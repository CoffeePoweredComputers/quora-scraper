            "answer_text": "How you write a hero should depends on what you believe defines an individual. ( a larger philosophical issue) Other answers have already mentioned about giving your characters flaws and not making them 100% perfect. I wholeheartedly agree with this advice and it\u2019s probably the most important thing to keep in mind. So what do I want to add? I personally find that the best stories are the ones that draw strong parallels between their heroes and villains. The idea is that a hero is someone of moral character that their external circumstances have not broken them. My favourite fictional dynamic is that of Batman/Joker. Both of them had a bad day. One choose to give up on sanity, the other chose to channel his feelings into a crusade. Both are broken men. One hides behind a mask, one behind a smile. And the joker\u2019s primary goal? To break Batman and prove to the world that Batman is no different/just as crazy as he is. The only real difference between these two characters is how they dealt with tragedy. We can\u2019t control our circumstances. Not completely. But we can control our attitudes. For me personally, people are defined by their choices. Not necessarily the consequences of these choices but rather how the choices reflect on them in a moment. The only difference between a hero and a villain can be the choice they make in response to a situation as mentioned in the example above. In my own working series, I want to separate the hero and villain simply by their responses to loss. The idea of fighting either for or against a world that continues to screw them over. I truly think that this is what separates a hero from a regular three dimensional characters. The hero is the character making sacrifices and tough choices. They are the ones clinging to hope despite the world collapsing around them. A hero is just someone who refuses to be broken by a cruel reality. That\u2019s what I believe. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it is not an easy question. It highly depends on the type of story you write and the kind of author you are. Here, I will speak from personal experience and in a more general tone, so everything I say needs to be taken with caution, I\u2019m do not speak the absolute truth. Being a French writer, I speak and write an analytic language. That means the longer and more full the sentence, the better. Opposed to English where short sentences are the best (I don\u2019t know for literature though). Therefore, I often do long, descriptive sentences about my character\u2019s feelings or thoughts. Also, I\u2019m an author who strives for realism. I\u2019d say there are three main component to make a good character (not only a good hero) I\u2019ll put examples of those points at the end : Avoid perfection (or utter evil).Who wants to see a perfect hero or a vilain whose only characteristic is it\u2019s evilness ? Your characters need as many flaws as qualities. Your heroine is beautiful ? Make her imbued with herself to compensate.Your villain is a sadistic corporation director ? Show his other, more natural face, in a scene with his family.The point here is to make you reader sympathize with you hero, and make your villain credible. None of us know someone perfect nor do we know someone entirely evil, even a certain dictator of Germany during WWII was a vegan (or so I heard). You best hero will be the more flawed one, and you best villain will be the one with more nuance. We call them characters, not flatacters. Give them imperfections, give them greatness, give them ugliness, give them motives, give them fears.Which brings us to our next point : Justify every last behavior a principal character exhibitsYour villain wants to exterminate an entire race or clan in your fantasy novel? Let\u2019s call him Anakin and have one of his loved one slaughtered by that race/clan. Clich\u00e9, but if you arrange it correctly, it works. Your hero wants to become a free man in a society encouraging the usage of slaves, well, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, but show where he finds his determination, show his moments of doubt and when he is about to break. Make your reader root for him. Make your reader want to step in, shake your hero by the shoulders, and yell at him \u201cCome on ! You can\u2019t give up like that ! You have to fight\u201d And then show the slow and painful return of hope and strength.Even with a simple sentence, or a short paragraph for not so important choices, but never have your hero/villain do something out of thin air, without real motive. Because nobody does things just \u201cbecause\u201d. People often don\u2019t assume their reasons, but they do have reasons.In short, develop the psychology of your character, show the thought process, show how the gears turns in their heads. Do not be able to summarize your character, his quest and his motives in a single sentence without leaving a good chunk of info out\u201cHe is the chosen one, and the prophecy says he shall banish evil out of the lands.\u201d\u201cShe is the despicable queen of a crumbling kingdom, because her greed lead her there and now she pressure her subjects just to get more possessions.\u201dWhile it might be useful to have an few words expression referring to your character to avoid repetition, if you succeed to summarize your hero/villain this way, I have the displeasure to inform you that he\u2019s too simple, too flat.You wouldn\u2019t say that \u201cHarry Potter is a sorcerer who fights against the forces of evil because it\u2019s master killed his parents and he is kind of the chosen one.\u201d While it is surely accurate, you have to know the books to get it, it\u2019s too summarized, too many infos are left out to explain correctly who Harry Potter is. So, in conclusion, I\u2019d say the common point there is realism. Describe your hero like you would describe your best friend or your worst enemy, or even yourself (without falling into the self-insert/mary sue thing I beg you). Why should we like him/her and sympathize ? On the contrary, why should we despise them, why are they an horrible person ? But don\u2019t just stay in surface. Dig, dig, dig deeper and deeper, the more important the character, the deeper you need to go. Examples:Here are extracts of my character sheets : Fidget - Disillusioned, cynical, mistrustful, pessimistic, loyal, braveThis character lost his parents while fleeing to not be turned into a slave, and lived a life of beggar always on guard to not be caught. Therefore, his trust in the world and people is totally broken, but as hard as it is to get, once you get it, he\u2019ll be the most loyal person you can find, and will do anything for you. Oscar - Proud, stingy, materialist, cold, striving to better humanity, devote his life to that cause.That character is the CEO of one of the biggest and more powerful company in the wold, making money by selling a product used by everyone, but based on a new technology discovered very recently. While his first goal was to make money, he is also convinced that his work helped humanity raise to unprecedented standards. I bet you can\u2019t distinguish only based on the adjectives which is the good and which is the bad guy. The twist here is that the product Oscar created is a collar having only one goal : enslave and totally control the members of Fidget\u2019s race in such way that the collar controls their bodies, bypassing their will (fantasy world, so Oscar is a human and Fidget a creature). Both have qualities, both have flaws, both have backstory, both have reasons for being who they are. Even if those aren\u2019t very good reasons (can we really say that enslaving a specie is \u201chelping humanity raise to unprecedented standards\u201d ?), they are reasons nonetheless. Because in real life, people don\u2019t always have a good or moral reason. Here is an extract of my most recent chapter : \u201c[\u2026] Car elle \u00e9tait la capitaine de la garde royale. Elle avait failli sa mission une fois, et aujourd\u2019hui, elle prenait leur revanche.\u201d\u201c[\u2026] Because she was the head of the royal guard. She failed her people once, but today she would take their revenge.\u201d Here we are in the thoughts of one of those creatures who is about to kill thousands of humans to exert revenge. It\u2019s two simple sentences, one explaining her past, the other explaining what happened that changed her and pushed her to do what she\u2019s going to do (of course it is more detailed previously, but here we remind the more important to the reader). It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated, but it is like salt in cooking, you just can\u2019t do something tasteful without it.And by the way, is she a villain or a hero ? Is killing for some moral cause something moral ? Those questions bring another thing I should have add, but it\u2019s a more general advise, make your reader question him/herself and his/her beliefs and moral grounds. Crush their mind, force them to think, because nothing can make you think like well written characters and stories. Those three characters cannot simply be summarized in one sentence, maybe in this Quora answer they could be, because I didn\u2019t go into much details, but believe my word, they just aren\u2019t. So that\u2019s it, congratulation if you got there because that was a very very long answer. But I think it was really important to expand there. A last advice if I may, find characters you liked or found realists in other books or fictions, and try to analyse why they are this way, what make them \u201cproperly written\u201d, then try to mimic and appropriate the lessons you learned. Of course, those are general rules, and you need to know how to break them to achieve true genius. Like my philosophy teacher said recently : \u201cMasters apply the rules with absolute perfection, while geniuses break those rules and create new ones the future masters will use.\u201d ",
