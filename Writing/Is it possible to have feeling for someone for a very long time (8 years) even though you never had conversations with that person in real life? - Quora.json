            "answer_text": "Definitely possible. I had many crushes in my teenage years, some of them were completely fantasy crushes, in the sense that they didn't even exist- damn Legolas!- this is embarrassing. I've had my share of fictional crushes, celebrity crushes (still do!) and crushes that develop as a result of eye contact without ever culminating in the exchange of a few words. To highlight my point, I remember myself being completely head over heels in love with a boy that was one year older than me, when I was 12 because I just saw him hanging around my neighborhood and he just happened to look at me once and smile. It lasted more than a year. He was really handsome actually. I thought about him a lot and, and for a 12 year old girl that means A LOT. He eventually went to Germany with his family and I never saw him again. So, I know what it means to have feelings for a long time for someone you haven't even had a real conversation with. It's normal, as long as it doesn't affect you in your life of course. As long as it doesn't mess with your mental health and your social life feel free to gush over any fantastic crush. But please, keep in mind that life is so much more interesting, beautiful and surprising when we take matters into our own hands and are brave enough to go talk to that hot guy that happens to be our neighbor, classmate, friend etc. Keep it real!

(Okay, maybe only a ghost of those feelings) but I don't have any personal interaction with the talented, lovely kind, Susan Dey\u2026so I don't know\u2026she could be a horrible hateful person for all I know.
