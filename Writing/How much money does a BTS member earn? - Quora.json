            "answer_text": "As it goes, each individual member of a K-Pop group can make more or less money than the other members. Overall, BTS grosses about $35-40 million all together. It\u2019s hard to find their individual salaries when they all have projects of their own they are all doing and most K-Pop music industry companies like to keep their idols\u2019 salaries under wraps. It\u2019s estimated that they each make about $3.8 million, but with \u2018RM\u2019, \u2018AgustD\u2019, and \u2018Hope World\u2019, it\u2019s safe to say the rap line makes more than that. Not to mention, Taehyung probably gets outside money from his time on Hwarang. Finding out their exact salaries without them telling us outright would be pretty difficult, so it\u2019s up to us to guesstimate. Jin, Jungkook, and Jimin make around $3.8 million, with Hobi just ahead of them. V makes a significant amount more due to his acting career and popularity. And the highest paid members are, hands down, Yoongi and Namjoon. I would go ahead and say Namjoon is the wealthiest out of all them, making around $4.5\u20134.7 million, solely because he has more individual projects with other artists and has written quite a few songs for other artists. EDIT: As of March 5, 2018, J-Hope entered the Billboard 200 at number 63, now officially moving up significantly in the income rankings of BTS and becoming the highest charting Solo K-Pop act. (So that one cuck in the comments can leave me alone because Yes! J-Hope makes more money than Taehyung now!) ",

            "answer_text": "They individually all have different networths because they all have other projects outside of BTS that they earn money from aswell (Tae\u2019s acting career, Suga\u2019s producing etc.) Also nobody truly knows their networth besides them so all the numbers listed below are just projected and approximate. Let\u2019s begin Seokjin is obviously the wealthiest out if BTS because his father is a very famous and wealthy CEO, but that aside, these numbers only account for what they\u2019ve made as musicians. Yoongi: 9 million Namjoon: 8.3 million Seokjin: 8.3 million Hoseok: 8.3 million Jimin: 8.3 million Taehyung: 8.3 million Jungkook: 8.3 million Yoongi\u2019s wealthy most likely comes in from his success with his mixtape \u2018Agust D\u2019 but Hoseok\u2019s mixtape \u2018HopeWorld\u2019 was also widely accepted and successful and these numbers don\u2019t reflect the added income from that or for Namjoon\u2019s mixtape either. Hope I could help, Ciao. ",
