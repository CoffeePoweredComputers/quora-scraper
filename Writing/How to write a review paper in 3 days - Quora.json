Capture the main ideas, often found in the introduction or abstract, and citations. Those authors may start as the variables to compare and find relationships between and then they get grouped under concepts or themes. Look through their bibliographies. Eventually highlight the issues, questions, or problems. Show what is absent, but important for further study, and if no reports can be found, research. Treat it like an ongoing essay draft, the updated hook and thesis at the top for why it is relevant to the writer and vice-versa, the body of examples and references in the middle, and the conclusion or aftereffect at the end. Links could be in footnotes or endnotes. Spend some time each day editing for cohesion and coherence. That prototypes an ongoing feed for additional survey as the pertinent search keywords expand.
