            "answer_text": "Is there any good way to write a novel with multiple first-person narrators that allows for switching between narrators mid-chapter? I tried that style once because I needed to present the thoughts and actions of a character hundreds of miles away (in the story), or maybe even just down the block, but in all to capture his point of view that would be at some level opposed to what the main protagonist was feeling. I guess all I can say is that I got tired of working with that format, for that particular book, deciding that any POV should come from the main character\u2019s mouth and any contradicting action would present itself, so to speak, \u201cright in front of her.\u201d But when I struggled with the multi-POV style, I had tried separating chapters by editing the chapter headings, such as \u201cLenny: A big disappointment.\u201d Then back to the main protagonist, \u201cSheila: Steals away for a bad girl rendezvous.\u201d That worked fairly well but was a huge weight on my head, and I felt the story would fall with more peaceful acceptance if I kept it more simple as far as POV and beefed up the emotional elements in the story, scene by scene, concentrating on making that better and more entertaining. Simplicity for more depth, you might say. As far as mid-chapter changes, it has to be the creator in you who can manage that irregularity and be praised for your originality. You\u2019re talking about, I assume, changing perspectives mid-chapter as opposed to chapter-by-chapter. I can see that. There should be some physical guide to separate the two, and you should consider other creative ways to dramatically separate the two speakers. You\u2019re dealing with creativity, no more or less than painting, sculpting, designing a house. It\u2019s your baby. The big problem you\u2019ll probably endure is the reader\u2019s acceptance, and the main way around such a thing is to convince them that you have a method to your madness, a reasonable route through the story that they\u2019ll love. Catch their attention, make them wonder what the heck just happened when your second narrator stepped in, prevent them from putting the book aside because they\u2019re okay waiting to find out what your character is up to, what s/he has discovered, is about to take action on, or some uncharacteristic behavior that has their eyes bugged in a \u201cwhat the hell\u201d manner, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to sleep now. Much good fortune with your writing, and be safe. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There\u2019s no good way. But if you are an absolute master at handling POV, preferably via psychic distance and free indirect style, then you can probably find a way to make it work, although it will seem mannered (and possibly pretentious, to start with), and will still probably tire the reader and spend their good will rather quickly. If you are a master, however, you probably can do it. Here\u2019s the thing. If you are a master, you will know this already. So if you have to ask, it means you still have a lot of learning to do. But I\u2019m not telling you not to try! Absolutely do try. Every experiment you make in narrative technique will teach you valuable lessons, and make you a better writer, in the most effective way possible, because you will be tailoring the lessons perfectly for the student.

            "answer_text": "Not really, because you have to make absolutely sure your readers follow the switch. I\u2019ve seen this done very effectively in romance novels (which often switches POV from one character to the other) by use of physical transference \u2026 maybe a character pours a glass of wine, makes eye contact, and hands it to the other character. There\u2019s a scene break, and then we\u2019re in the POV of the character who\u2019s taking the wine glass. But the key is, you have to make it absolutely clear where and who we are or it doesn\u2019t work. ",
