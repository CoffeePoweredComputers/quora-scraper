            "answer_text": "If you want to get a handle on renewable energy then it is vital that you first fully understand the thermodynamic laws. Otherwise you can soon wind up many a garden path. Unfortunately many would find this topic a bit boring. The renewable debate is riddled with thermodynamic nonsense and absurd cost calculations. This usually due to a subconscious belief that renewables are somehow free; when in fact the harvesting thereof can be very expensive and energy intensive. One of the main problems here which needs to be addressed being government manipulation of the market with preferential legislation and complex subsidy contracts which enable some to cream off profits at the expense of others. A case of politics overriding the the basic science. Perhaps another topic to be considered.? ",

            "answer_text": "A simple question: How can utility-scale Renewable Wind and Solar-PV Energy be converted into Carbon-free & Sustainable energy? Background: Wind and solar-PV require require complementary power generation plants that can vary their output to match the inherent variability in wind and solar-PV generation. These variations result from the inherent fluctuations in the environmental conditions that provide the energy wind and solar-PV facilities convert to electricity. Currently natural gas plants make up the majority of these flexible operating plants, but they produce carbon. Accordingly, because they are necessary for wind & solar PV to be added to the grid, wind and solar cannot holistically be considered carbon-free. ",
