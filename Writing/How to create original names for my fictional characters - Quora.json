            "answer_text": "Is your fiction in the contemporary world? Then use a good baby name website to find out the most popular names. Be sure the name is in use in the place where the story is set\u2014some very common American names are rare in the UK, and vice-versa. Avoid \u201cweird\u201d names like Dweezil or Sunflower\u2014unless the parents were hippies, and the name is part of the backstory. Historical novels should make use of the popular names of the era in which your story takes place. You can check out various genealogy sites for the time period. You can\u2019t go wrong with timeless names like Mary, John, Susan, Thomas or other classic names that have been around for centuries. In High Fantasy, you have to be very careful to set up naming conventions for your various character groupings. For a good idea of this, check out various naming sites for Tolkien\u2019s races. Don\u2019t copy his names, but take note of how they are constructed and see that some groups have similar elements in their names, (for example, most hobbit females had flower or jewel names, there are no middle names, male names often, but not always, ended in \u201co\u201d or reflected nature, and certain surnames have common elements). For heaven\u2019s sake, please don\u2019t name a character something like Krystal Syndi Raven Silverhand. She will at once be labeled a \u201cMary Sue\u201d. Don\u2019t just grab a random name that you think sounds \u201ccool\u201d; make sure that a \u201ccool\u201d name fits the world it is set in. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly whenever I write a book or fictional story I start on a paper and brainstorm the story plot. I for example want my main character to be quirky and confident, I write a description about the person traits and personality , then I look at every letter in the alphabet and pick which one suites her, I think the letter \u2019N\u2019 matches her best. Now, its up to your brain to think of different names. I made my characters name \u2018Nin\u2019 because I like the vibe y\u2019know? Its hard to explain \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd1e I also wanted to write about another character that was nice at first then appeared to be the villian. I thought that the name Dina would suite her too! It really comes to how much research you put into the name. I just usually go onto baby names too thats easier! TL;DR Brainstorm ideas for your character personality then match them to a letter that suites them best! Get some research about that one letter and pick and narrow down the names you like until you get one that your happy with! -Lena\ud83d\udda4 ",
