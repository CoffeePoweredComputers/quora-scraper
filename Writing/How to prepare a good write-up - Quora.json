            "answer_text": "Internships are key to building experience as a student. Many a times more priority is given to the students who have done some past internships than others. Moreover it is very important for students to gain knowledge, explore new things and find their own potential. Write up plays a vital role to land you an internship, so it's quite important to invest a good amount of time and energy while writing your write up. I have seen many people with extremely good marks but poor write up missing an internship opportunity whereas people with low marks but strong write ups getting the internship. So let me give you a rough idea about what you should write in your write up! (For Academic/Research Internships) So first thing first! 1. Mention your interest to pursue a career in research. Tell them that you want to and you will pursue a career in research field.Why are you interested to pursue a career in research field.From when did you have this aim?2. The Topic First, ask yourself in which topic you really are interested.Then, write that you are interested in so and so topic and you want to work on this topic.3. Use of knowledge Whatever experience and knowledge that you will gain, how will you apply that in \"our\" life.Example: If you say that you are interested in polymer chemistry, then mention that with knowledge of producing different kinds of polymer I will try to produce \"biodegradable\" polymers which will reduce the pollution.*Most of the students don't mention that how they are going to use this knowledge and those who mention this are always ahead in the league* 4. Why you want to join that Institution in particular? Here you have to brag about that Institution that there you will get to work in sophisticated laboratory and will be able to work under highly experienced proffesors moreover interaction with other research scholars there, will help you in long run.5. Why should they give you this opportunity? Here you have to brag about yourself. Don't feel shy. Don't be moderate. Tell them that you can be a wonderful asset for their Institution. You will give your 100% in the work and you are definitely worthy for this opportunity.Well, this is how you should write an write up. I'm may not be perfectly perfect, sometimes its your selection of topic that can get you an internship and sometimes the passion. So be hopeful and even if you don't get an internship does not mean that it is the end of your world, use your summer/winter to gain some other knowledge. Just don't waste time. That's it. Pro Tip: Always apply in many institutions, not just in one or two, because you just never know what's gonna happen. *The more you apply, the more will be the probability of your selection* (Saying from my personal experience). *Apply for online internships too*. Be happy! :D All the best! :) ",

That will be quite moderate to pass a spell of time.\u201c1st impression is the last impression.\u201d So you have to acquire that impression firstly. That will keep your viewers stick to your write up.Think something unique. You have your own brain. So you are yourself unique and your ideas should not match with others. That again attracts readers.Try to use vocabs quite accessible by society. Usage of bombastic words will not prove you intellect rather your proportion of dislike will increase. Your idea should be meaningfull and just. Otherwise that will not be charmful.Last of all ,surname should have a compact irony. Try to give surname at the end of your writing because you will have time to think . This will attract people more.",
