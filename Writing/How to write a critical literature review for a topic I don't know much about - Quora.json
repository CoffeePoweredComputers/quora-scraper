            "answer_text": "Well, there is a solution you can accept in this case - ask professionals to help you. If this review is very important for your education process, better to follow my advice. I also once had the same problem and should run for help from https://123writings.com/homework-help/finance. It was a very professional help and after this I started to be really interested in what I study (at least because I read what they wrote for me). Otherwise, read a title of a topic, find someone who also wrote about this, read it, and create an opinion about this topic in your head. And then - keep writing whatever comes on your mind. But first option is definitely better. Good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "A theater critic is allowed to praise a production. To criticize in this sense does not mean \u201cfind bad things to say\u201d. A summary of literature is not the same as a literature review. It is where you start to make your review. You should point out particularly helpful and/or relevant material, and compare different work. Examples: \u201cPublications on this topic up to 2009 are given in an extensive review by Author1.\u201d \u201cAuthor2 reported that Mg was critical in the mechanism, while Author3 found it was Ca. Author4 concluded that it was the interaction between Mg and Ca which provided the controlling method.\u201d \u201cAuthor5\u2019s model has been extensively used. Variations have been proposed by Author6 and Author7. However, Author8 pointed out that it is strictly only true where the Reynolds Number is low and thus inertia can be neglected.\u201d \u201cThe majority of publications reflect US practice. A somewhat different view is given by Author9, who has studied the systems in the UK and France.\u201d ",
