            "answer_text": "Hello Andreas. White tattooing ink doesn\u2019t last to long and fades away over time. I have one tattoo of a \u201c\u201dPink Panther \u201c sitting in a champagne glass. The white has been re-colored twice. Lasting about 5 years. However, it depends on how your skin takes the ink, sun exposure and personal skin care. I live here in sunny California and do a lot of boating and camping often with the shirt off. I hope this helps? ",

            "answer_text": "For my skin, and where I live my white ink has lasted 10 years on my oldest tattoo and I still have white after years and months after my other tattoos. I am usually covered and not in the sun a whole lot(Washington State doesn't get a lot of sun anyways) and I'm always using sunscreen since I'm fair skinned. It all depends on how well you take care of the tattoo and your skin. There are also times where white pigment will discolor and either yellow or gray out. ",
