For instance, the problem may lie in the fear of failure, lack of sleep, lack of proper nutrition, inability to find that \"golden\" seat which would just inspire you to get to work. I am just going to throw some ideas in there and hope you find them helpful. Why are you writing a dissertation? What are your main motivators? Are you excited about doing the research? If not, what could be changed in order to make this inspired work, not a chore.Once you know your answers to #1, what will happen if you don't get it done? Are there any consequences you will have to face? Is there a deadline?Do you have a \"sweet\" writing spot or a \"golden\" seat, which kicks your brain into the right gear once you take it? If not, train yourself to work in this one location that you like. Being consistent will teach you to get straight to work once you are there.Make sure you consume the food that gives you mental energy, not sluggishness. Get enough sleep. Unplug daily at least for one hour. Get time outside. Read books related and not related to your subject.Have fun!",
