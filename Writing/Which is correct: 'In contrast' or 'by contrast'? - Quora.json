            "answer_text": "In your example, \"by contrast\" is correct. But \"in contrast\" would have been correct in this sentence: His relationship with his father is poor in contrast to his relationship with his mother, which is great. Both have the same meaning, but \"in contrast\" usually requires \"to\" or \"with\" and is followed by a noun, while \"by contrast\" is usually followed or preceded by the subject of the sentence. ",
