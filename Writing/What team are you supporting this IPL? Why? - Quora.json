            "answer_text": "This team that has been the powerhouse of batting, has had brilliant players in its ranks right from the beginning, that has always surprised its supporters and is lead by probably the one of the best batsman around. This team has never lifted the coveted trophy of the IPL in any of its seasons. It has the record of the highest as well as the lowest totals in IPL; but has the most unconventional results in its matches. Though I do not live in Bengaluru; I have never found the reason why I came to love this team right from the time when I started watching IPL. Yes, I support Royal Challengers Bangalore(RCB). One of the reasons may be because two of the cricketers whom I admire the most play in this team (You can easily guess them\u2026) Every season, I watch IPL for the sole reason of watching this team go into the finals and lift the trophy. Though it may seem funny, but I cried a lot when the team lost to SRH in the finals of 2016. Even if this team has never won the title despite being led by Run Machine Kohli-the HEART of RCB and MR. 360- the team\u2019s SOUL; yet it seems to have one of the most committed fan base in the IPL and the fact that it has the 4th largest fan-following among all teams without winning a single trophy proves it. https://www.kreedon.com/the-most-popular-ipl-teams-in-social-media-with-the-highest-fan-following/ Despite being criticised a lot by my friends for supporting RCB, I never feel any shame in doing so. In the end, I don't know what will happen this season, but I hope that they play well.  However, there's no doubt about this: I will always keep supporting RCB!!! Thank you!!!

            "answer_text": "Well well, First of all every team is unique and best in itself. So, can't compare a team with another and say that this team is the best. So, remember every fan has its own favourite team and the team is best for him/her. But as you have already awaken the IPL FAN inside me than I should surely share it with you. And remember the thing I Will be telling about my team is only my opinion and precisely the the opinion of FAN inside me. But in reality I consider every team to be equal and deserving. MY favourite team is the \u201c WHISTLE PODU ARMY\u201d i. e. Ceeeee Sssssss Kkkkkkk. So, here is why I like CSK. 10 reasons why I like the Chennai Super Kings There is a lot of bullshitting about the Chennai Super Kings over how they make it to the playoffs every season. N Srinivasan scripts all of CSK\u2019s wins from his bathroom, politics, blah blah blah. While there is no denying that the IPL is full of controversy, why is that CSK always paraded as the team to hate just because they are so good? Now, I am from the same state but that\u2019s not the reason why I like the CSK. So for all those who hate CSK, read this if you have any idea how a premier league has to be played. For those who love CSK, here are tem seasons to know why.  CSK: Giants of the IPL  1. CSK is the only team to embrace the concept of a domestic league in the right way. There is a very CHENNAI flavor in every aspect of CSK. The \u2018Whistle Podu\u2019 theme belongs to Chennai. Isn\u2019t there one flavor that you can connect to a Mumbai or a Kolkatta or a Jaipur? Do Punjabis really need Priety Zinta to dance for them..?  2. CSK is the only team to have embraced the concept of a club properly. Faf Du Plessis was an unknown when CSK signed him 2 years ago. Now he\u2019s our leading scorer. That\u2019s what successful EPL teams to. That\u2019s what we do.  3. The dressing room of CSK is widely known as the happiest of all if IPL teams. The pranks, the way newcomers are made comfortable is a mark of great teams.  4. When CSK plays and a batsman hits a four, they don\u2019t have to show Shah Rukh Khan clapping, when a six is hit, they don\u2019t have to show the Shetty sisters hugging or when a batsman gets out they don\u2019t have to show Priety Zinta cussing and discussing strategy with the coach. It\u2019s strictly the players and the fans and that\u2019s how it should be. The lesser the distractions, the better the team.  5. After the recent incident involving Shah Rukh Khan at the Wankhede Stadium, Juhi Chawla was quoted as saying \u201cIf today Shah Rukh Khan were to get upset and quit the IPL I wonder if there\u2019d be any people watching the matches\u2026 in Wankhede or any stadium.\u201d Seriously, if Wankhede comes to watch Shah Rukh Khan rather than Sachin\u2019s batting, then God save cricket.  6. Despite the dash of IPL, Chennai still and will remain the most knowledgeable of all crowds in India. That\u2019s a mark of fans who will remain loyal to CSK all life. If you think about it you will understand what I am saying. Remember, Sachin was booed once in Mumbai. That will never happen to any cricketer in Chennai (Except Virat Kohli when he plays for RCB)  7. As a team, CSK is not dependent on one player like how RCB had in Gayle and Kolkatta in Gambir. Every time we find some player finishing it in tight situations. Morkel, Bravo, Dhoni, it\u2019s a finishing line up to dream.  8. One of the most important factors is how well the local lads and generally the Indian players have played for us. Vijay, Badri, Anirudha, Ashwin and Balaji have all won games for us. Name one team that has so many local lads in their team and doing well. Add to that Raina and Dhoni. So the over dependence on overseas players is negated in CSK. 9. Harsha Bhogle tweeted this after the last season win he said \u201cEventually the best team, the best organized, the best selected and the best led won the IPL and that is how it should be\u201d. Need anything more to say. You know which team I am taking as I have described much about these things.  10. The truth is CSK, even for IPL\u2019s short history has to go through these phases like how great teams go through. Barcelona is constantly accused of diving despite the beautiful football they play. The Australian Cricket Team was accused of too much sledging when they dominated world cricket. But didn\u2019t they change the way cricket was played? Like those great teams, we will endure and play the way like only we can and whistle the way like only we can. Go CSK Go..! ",
