            "answer_text": " Be grateful that you can even think about making work \"fun.\" We are so blessed that we live in a time and world where there is even a possibility of finding fun in the work that we do. Previous generations used work merely as a means of sustaining themselves and only a handful could focus on their self-actualization or making their work \"fun.\" Don't just go to work to make a paycheck. That is probably one of the most damning things someone can do to their happiness. Most people spend a majority of the hours in their week working, so put yourself in a position to enjoy those hours, Find a way to align your work and your efforts with what brings you most joy and fulfillment. The fact that we can now pick up our smartphones and take a picture or record a video and turn it into a business is incredible. The \"fun\" jobs are not just reserved for celebrities and the elitely talented. But the increase in opportunities changes the way we have to make decisions about our work. So here's what I would do... Figure Out Why You're Working- That may seem like a simple question, but it's important to determine and be aware of our true purpose. Most of the previous generation simply worked for money, but a lot of young people are taking freedom, impact, and self-actualization over simply a large paycheck. Are you working to better yourself or provide for your family? Maybe you're working hard to make your parents proud. Find ways to remind yourself of that treason and purpose as much as possible. Write it down often or post it somewhere you'll see it regularly. Often times we lose connection with our purpose for working and it makes work much more mundane.Start Doing More Of What You Like- We are all born with unique talents and strengths that we can contribute to our teams or companies. Often work becomes unbearable when we are not utilizing our best strengths. So identify what those are and ask to start doing tasks like those. If you work for someone else, ask to do some extra work that involves your strengths. Add value in those areas so not only build your skills but to help them recognize your abilities. If you work for yourself, start putting yourself in a position to thrive by doing more activities that include your strengths. If you're not working, start doing the things that are fun and start creating content. There are infinite ways in which we can add value. The most important thing to make it fun is to figure out what you enjoy doing.Appreciate the Fun Times- The reality is that not all work is going to be fun and some fun involves work. But often times we are caught in our own emotional bullsh** that we miss out on the fun that we could have by just being open to the experience. Often times there are great (and fun) moments that go missed simply because we weren't paying attention. So try and find fun and gratitude in the smallest things. It's like when you get a new car, you start to notice it all over the place.Let me offer one more piece of advice... You asked about making work fun, but I'm not sure that \"fun\" is what you're actually looking for. Theme parks are fun, but I can only spend a day there. You might be looking for something fulfilling. Those things I could do forever...

            "answer_text": "I work as a cook\u2019s assistant in my college\u2019s cafeteria. My bosses & managers have their on/off days that are hard to predict while 90% of my co-workers do their work begrudgingly like they\u2019ve given up on finding anything better in life. Plus there\u2019s always a high chance of injury (3 severe burns and a slit finger in 2.5 years working there). However, I also believe that a job can be worth your time if you find something fun about it and/or you can create that fun. At work, I like to be creative with the food. Since customers watch us make it, I love to do be artsy with the the creations. Like using sauce to make silly faces, arranging their fruits/veggies into rainbows, coming up with puns according to ingredient used, etc.I\u2019ll strike up conversation with customers who aren\u2019t occupied with cell phones/other people. During \u201csample preparation\u201d, I experiment with different variations of the recipe and try to see what the customers reactions are (I created a lot of business this way)Even if I\u2019m dishwashing, I\u2019ll dance along to the radio and try to time myself; how many dishes can I do in one hour, will it be more or less than last week? Point is, I look for opportunities to make things interesting. Create little games to help do your work, talk to more people, find ways to improve what you do for better business, etc! ",
