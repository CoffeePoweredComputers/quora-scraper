            "answer_text": "A powerful way to get real leadership experience is to join a volunteer organization part time and get involved. The power of a volunteer position is that you have no authority over people, and they will only follow someone who has built trust with them. Think of it as a leadership boot camp. It will be challenging but if you can build influence with people who don't have to follow you for a paycheck , then you can lead anywhere.   Additionally, leadership is defined as influence ( the building of relationships where people are willing to  trust you) Be intentional in the relationships you build daily, as this too will strengthen your leadership muscles.

            "answer_text": "If there are no obvious ways to get involved in college life, meaning that there are no clubs or student body (highly unlikely if you're in US), then your only other option is to be a leader and create opportunities. If you are set on remaining in college for the duration of your leadership skill acquisition, you can form those clubs and organizations, and chair them (or co-chair) and get a taste of what event planning and budgeting and resource allocation is all about. If you are open to life outside college, another Quoran has already suggested volunteering - where you start out under he direction of another person, and they you can progress within the hierarchy depending on how well you present yourself as a leader.
