            "answer_text": "Any blog is only as profitable if you can get your readers to stick to your blog and come back again and again. It\u2019s one thing having a few articles show up in a Google search, it\u2019s another to have a community of people that love hanging out on your blog and going through your content. So to answer you question, a parenting blog, like any blog can be successful and profitable. You\u2019ve just got to give your readers workable content, entertain them, or prove that you\u2019ve got their best interests at heart. Do that, and you\u2019ll have a profitable blog. ",

            "answer_text": "Parenting blogs can be particularly profitable, since many parents take to the internet to solve parenting challenges. That part is tricky though, since, in order to create a profitable blog, you would have to use your expertise to tap into the challenges they are facing and then offer a product or service to provide a solution. Think printables, courses or even affiliate products (such as Amazon) that can make parenting life easier. Of course, you do have to gain traffic and a following before seeing a profit, but I think the potential is there - especially in the parenting niche. :) ",
