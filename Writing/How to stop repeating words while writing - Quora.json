            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t worry about it in the first draft. We all do it. In addition to being an author, I\u2019m a freelance editor for other people\u2019s manuscripts and I see this issue all the time. What\u2019s interesting to me is that each writer I meet has one or more different and specific words they repeat. In any case, the first draft is meant to \u201cget it all on the page\u201d so you don\u2019t need to concern yourself with repetition too much at this stage. With the second (or third or fourth) draft, here are some tips: Discover what words you repeat. Use Command-F, or whatever search shortcut you use, and type it in. It will be disheartening to see that you repeat a word 82 times, but don\u2019t let that get in the way of the haircut that needs to be done. Next, go through each one and decide if it\u2019s the best choice for that sentence. Some should stay and others can be changed.For example, in this paragraph alone, I repeated a variation of \u201cword\u201d many times. I went through and changed \u201ctype the word in\u201d to \u201ctype it in\u201d and \u201cgo through each word\u201d to \u201cgo through each one\u201d and \u201csome words should stay\u201d to \u201csome should stay.\u201d This left only two. Both are necessary, in my opinion, so I left them in. Go to Thesaurus.com - The world's favorite online thesaurus! and type in your word. You will see alternative options.Read aloud. Yes, some authors do this for their entire manuscript. Voicing a scene will quickly reveal what words are being overused.Pay close attention to word repetition within the same paragraph and chapter. Those need to be weeded out as they are most obvious to the reader.Ask a critique partner. They know all your flaws, trust me.One final comment: Don\u2019t stop at words. Scenes are often repetitive. The way to find those is to ask yourself, how does this move my story forward? If it serves the same purpose as another scene, then you have some trimming to do. Best of luck to you with your story.

            "answer_text": "It depends on which words you\u2019re repeating. \u201cHe said\u201d or \u201cshe said\u201d in particular is a phrase that actually is all right to repeat, because most readers, when reading dialogue, really don\u2019t _read_ those words. They\u2019re just understood as dialogue attributions. When you start substituting \u201cshe shouted\u201d and \u201che whispered\u201d you start calling the reader\u2019s attention to the dialogue tags and when the emphasis isn\u2019t actually necessary, it\u2019s more disruptive to the narrative than if you\u2019d left it alone. Other words, though, can be expanded upon. Suppose you keep referring to someone\u2019s hair as \u201cblonde\u201d. \u201cBlonde\u201d is fine as a general adjective but you could definitely make it more interesting and descriptive. There are blogs and synonym-finders all over the web that can help you expand your vocabulary. I like to use Thesaurus.com - The world's favorite online thesaurus! since its lists are generally pretty good, and it lets me link out to other words if the first one didn\u2019t get me quite what I was looking for. Be careful, though, that when you use a suggested synonym, you actually know the definition! \u201cCell\u201d and \u201cboudoir\u201d (to pick a relatively obvious example) might both show up as synonyms for \u201croom\u201d but there are some differences in the details of what they really mean. :-) Reading aloud will help you to spot repetition of phrases, such as starting each sentence in a paragraph with the character. \u201cI walked into the kitchen to check the temperature of the milk. I poured the milk into the cup. I walked the cup over to Dan. I thought that Dan looked pale.\u201d Nothing technically wrong with any of those sentences individually, but they\u2019ll certainly strike your ear as choppy and repetitive out loud. A lot of this is better to worry about correcting during re-reading/editing. It\u2019s really hard to spot if you\u2019re overusing something while you\u2019re in the process of getting it down for the first time - you don\u2019t know the first time you use a word how much you\u2019ll use it going forward, and worrying about it too much can disrupt the thought flows.
