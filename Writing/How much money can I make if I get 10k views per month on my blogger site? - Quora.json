            "answer_text": "If you monetize your blogger site with Adsense ads and are getting 10K views per month, depending on your niche you can earn anywhere between $0.20 to $7 CPM (per thousand impressions). Some niche like food, photography, art, education, entertainment get low CPC/CPM ads. While health and fitness, technology, smarthphone, AI, law, etc. get high CPC / CPM ads. The rate of CPC / CPM also depends on your visitor\u2019s country. A blogger site which gets 10K views per month and has 90% traffic from U.S. will get high CPC / CPM rate like $6 CPM. Whereas, same blogger site getting 10K views per month and has 90% Asia traffic (China, Pakistan, India, Nepal) will earn $1 CPM or lower - This is because of few advertisers competing for the ad position in that region and therefore the ad-rates are low. So decide the target-audience of your blog, and earn accordingly. Hint: On one of my technology site which gets $7 CPM rates because its solely U.S. based site and I\u2019ve blocked traffic from all other countries except North America, so the average CPM rates are kept ALWAYS higher!

            "answer_text": "It depends on your monetization method and how well you convert your blog traffic into customers. Blog traffic in itself isn\u2019t worth money, but if you offer something to your readers then it can be worth quite a lot. For example, you can promote affiliate products in your blog posts which will pay you a commission if someone clicked on your unique affiliate link and ended up buying the product. You can learn more about affiliate marketing from this video:  Another way to monetize your blog is by connecting your blog to Google AdSense which will display ads on your website and blog. Each time a reader clicks on an ad you\u2019ll get paid. A third way can be promoting your own products or services within your blog posts. A fourth way is to sell your website to someone who is interested in a website with a good amount of traffic. And there are probably more ways that don\u2019t come to my mind right now, but the point is, if you monetize your blog correctly then there is no limit to the amount of money you can make. It comes down to what you sell and how well you sell it. I hope this helps answer your question. Cheers Juan ",
