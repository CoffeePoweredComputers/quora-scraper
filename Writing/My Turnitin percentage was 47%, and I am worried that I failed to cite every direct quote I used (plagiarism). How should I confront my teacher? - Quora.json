            "answer_text": "You should review the Turnitin report to see what it flagged as plagiarism. When you see those indications, you should follow them up. If you haven\u2019t submitted the paper yet, you can work to correct them. Also, note that the settings may affect your percentage. For example, if the teacher did not set it up to exclude quotes and bibliography, this could explain a high percentage, although if your paper is nearly 50% quoted, that may be a problem. You can change these filter settings to see what affect they have. The results would be a point of discussion. If you have submitted the paper, you should talk with (not confront - why would you want to confront) your teacher. If you have an explanation, you could go over it and ask for the ability to correct it. If you plagiarized inadvertently or even on purpose, you can say you learned your lesson, etc. This only works once, though, so be more careful next time. Ask your teacher to allow you to turn in a draft to check. This is helpful to avoid making inadvertent mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "Go and talk to your teacher. Do not confront. Be completely honest. 47% is a very high number, and I\u2019d want to know what\u2019s going on (and Turnitin does a pretty good job of telling me), but the number doesn\u2019t tell me if you\u2019re plagiarising or legitimately quoting, so I\u2019d look. What you need to do is to give credit for all ideas, information and words that aren\u2019t yours, honestly, clearly and accurately. If you\u2019re quoting too much and thinking not enough, you\u2019ll get a fair mark for what you\u2019ve done. Summarising and combining is good - it\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. Do NOT paraphrase paragraphs to make them \u201cyours\u201d or to reduce your Turnitin scores - we HATE this. ",

            "answer_text": "One way that it can show up like that is if you left a space between the quotation marks and the words. \u201cLittle Women\u201d will not be counted but \u201c Little Women \u201c or \u201cLittle Women or \u2018Little Women\u2019 will all show up as plagiarized, potentially. If you used proper lead-ins and parenthetic reference, but merely forgot to use quotation marks correctly, most teachers will not consider that to be deliberate plagiarism. On the other hand, if nearly half your paper is unacknowledged quotes, I think you are in a bit of trouble, even if you did write it as if you were paraphrasing. But \u201cconfront\u201d is not what you want to do to your teacher! The teacher may \u201cconfront\u201d you! I think you should go to your instructor and say, \u201cCan we talk about my paper? I didn\u2019t intend to plagiarize, but I think I may have made some errors in my citations and use of quotation marks.\u201d And hope for the best! ",

            "answer_text": "One possible reason for the higher similarity percentage is not necessarily that you plagiarized, but rather, did not write in your own \u201cvoice\u201d by paraphrasing. Turnitin allows professors and students to determine whether plagiarism occurred, but does not actually catch plagiarism - only similarity. If using quotes, that raised the similarity (reduces originality). Recommend not using quotes, but to continue citing all sources, where used in the paper. In this instance, it does not appear that the teacher should be confronted, but rather, to learn from the report and revise the writing style to improve originality. ",
