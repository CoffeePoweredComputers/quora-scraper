            "answer_text": "This sentence is kind of a \u2018run - on\u2019 sentence (meaning you should break it into two or more shorter sentences because it is too long), but if you wanted to keep the sentence in this form there is only one grammatical error that I found. \u2018The thought of being in a constant learning situation and being in a university environment where I have access to unlimited learning opportunities\u2019 is the full subject here. This sentence takes third person singular \u2018it.\u2019 You must conjugate the verb \u2018to convince\u2019 with third person singular in simple present, which is \u2018convinces.\u2019 Another option, which was shown in a previous answer by Joseph, is to put the verb \u2018to convince\u2019 into the simple past as \u2018convinced.\u2019 You could even play with the tense and make it a continuous statement like \u2018is convincing me to continue my education further.\u2019 To add, you could use present perfect as well, \u2018has convinced me to continue my education further.\u2019 Any of these tenses could work in this sentence; just remember to conjugate the verb in third person singular! I hope that helps. ",

Therefore, I would further my education because ___________________________. Otherwise. The sentence has no special message other than stating that access to a university stimulates education. THE READER needs to know why the university is such a fantastic environment for your learning potential. (Talk about your interests in the frame of what you\u2019ve already said.) Give the idea purpose if you\u2019re going to use it. ",
