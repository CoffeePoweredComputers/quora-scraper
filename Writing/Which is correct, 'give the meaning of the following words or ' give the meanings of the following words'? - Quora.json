            "answer_text": "If you were to ask \u201cgive the meaning of the following words\u201d then you\u2019d be asking for what the meaning of the entirety of the words are. For an example, if you asked it after someone said \u201cShe isn\u2019t up to the standards we require of an actress.\u201d, then you\u2019d be asking what that meant, what specifically they meant by her not being up to the standards; Is she too unskilled, not attractive enough? If you were to ask \u201cgive the meanings of the following words\u201d then you\u2019d be asking for the definitions. For an example, if someone were to say \u201cCease opination on antecedent topics\u201d, then you\u2019d be asking the definition for the words \u2018opination\u2019, \u2018antecedent\u2019, \u2018cease\u2019, \u2018topics\u2019, and \u2018on\u2019. Does this help? Do you need further clarification? ",

I realize this is dangerous advice to give, but when in doubt, go with what sounds right. ",
