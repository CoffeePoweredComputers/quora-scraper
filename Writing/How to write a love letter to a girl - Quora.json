            "answer_text": "Before You Write As a girl here's an advice. Don't write her a love letter if you are a stranger. You don't necessarily need to be her friend or anything. But it will be helpful if she knows who you are/has seen you around a few times. I think a love letter would be effective if she's in your school/college/office/neighborhood. If you're a complete stranger then please don't attempt this before you have actually introduced yourself to her in real life. Girls either a) Get creeped out by random love letters from strangers or b) Don't take the love letter seriously and ignore it if the love letter is from someone they have never seen/heard of. For Writing Use cute stationary to write her a love letter. Try to get one of those scented papers used for writing letters, or at the most, paper that is slightly thick and colorful (use her favorite color or baby pink color is also nice) Stick a flower on the corner using tape. It doesn't have to look very clean and professional. On the contrary, it should appear that you did everything on your own. Buy a nice marker/pen to write in. A good handwriting is preferable. Put ample of space between your words and make it understandable. How much should you write? It shouldn't be very short. The girl will think you weren't that serious and didn't dedicate enough time. It shouldn't be very long either. The girl shouldn't think you are hopelessly in love with her. Take things slowly. About 250-500 words are more than enough. What you should and shouldn't write: Start slowly, don't sound creepy. Mention how you know her/came across her. Tell her about yourselfDon't jump to saying you love her. Love is a big deal. You need to confess things like that face to face. Tell her you have feelings for her instead.Explain why you like her. Now you can surely compliment her smiles and her eyes. But don't start with that. If you personally know her, then explain what you like about her personality. However, if you have never talked to her and her appearance is all you can describe, don't compliment her in a straightforward fashion.Tell her you want to get to know her better/wish she was a part of your life/want to meet her or something. Leave contact details like your phone number or email. Or if she knows you, your name. This is important. If you don't do this, you won't appear serious.You could put up a nice poem or quote, or mention a song or well, anything that reminds you of her. REMEMBER: Don't use those silly quotes/songs/poems you find easily and everywhere on the internet. For poetry, try something by a classic poet. Same goes for songs or quotes. Don't use mainstream stuff.All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Get to know about her from different sources first. Ask people about her. What was her past experiences with love letters or boys. Is she interested ? Single ? What's your image in her mind? Understand the consequences. Before hurrying into it. If you are sure about it then go forward. Write what you feel will make her happy with a good image of yours.  Length of love letter should not be short. At least fill a A4 size paper. Start with how you are. Good interesting things about yourself.  Think about the small things you like in her. And find the words for her to describe them. Finally how much you care for her. And would respect her decision with a proposal.  P.S. Research well before giving love letter to that girl. She might have brother or boyfriend. :D  Edit: After writing the letter read it 10 times. Ask people close to you to have a look and suggestions. Don't make grammatical or spelling mistakes as i might have made in this answer :p  ",
