            "answer_text": "If the subject of the bio is still alive, move heaven and earth to meet them and get their cooperation. If they are not, do the research. This takes time. While you are gathering material, ideas start to come to you and you begin to get a feeling for the way you might write the bio, the thread that might run through it. Many biographers work a different way, with everything planned out in advance, but from the way you talk I think you belong in the organic sub-section of writers, who must wait for the bio to unfold organically as they're working on the material, rather like the way we must wait for a flower to open in its own time. With this type of writing, you won't know what is relevant and what is not until you've collected quite a body of material. So this way of working always takes longer, but for an organic writer, this can't be helped.  Good luck, Dani ",
