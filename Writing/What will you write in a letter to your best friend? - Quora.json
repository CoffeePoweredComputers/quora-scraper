            "answer_text": "Dear Best Friend, The likelihood of you seeing this is somewhere from medium to high. Therefore, it\u2019s a stupid idea. But I\u2019m doing it anyway. Best friend, There\u2019s been nothing like knowing you. I\u2019ve never had such flavorful days, from beach trips to shopping cart hauls to fast food runs. I\u2019ve never woken up in the morning with excitement that threatened to burst my skin at the seams. At the same time, I\u2019ve never gone to sleep wishing that tomorrow would be different. Actually, that\u2019s not true. Best friend, There are many things I love and hate about you. Your dynamism never fails to amaze. Like a firework, your moments are brilliant and everlasting in the mind\u2019s eye. But, like a firework, your image fades from the mind as your greatness peters to dust. Your energy exhausts me. I am not responsible for your rage, nor resentment, not any of the problems you face other than the ones that have to do with me. I cannot teach you to have a voice against others, nor can I force you to release the anger that hurts and heeds you. Lots of my issues to do with you are issues that have to do with me. Funny how our ego always reverts the focus to the mainframe, no? I loved you when you were awesome and I love you when you\u2019re awful. It\u2019s fresh in my mind and our friendship was filled with light. I remember those days, and they\u2019re not far off, but I need my space like dead bodies need graves. Awful analogy, but I\u2019ll rot from within and stink up the whole house if I do not get my room. Best friend, I love you. It is why I decline your calls. It is why I ignore your texts and go quiet when you assume it is ok to walk over me. Talk over me. I restrain myself, so you can live a little brighter. Breathe a little easier. I know how violent things are in your head. I don\u2019t want to be another bullet point, another arduous task to tackle in your mind. I hate you. It is why I spit venom at you. It is why I ruminate over our fights, how I could have spoken too soon, and too little, and not enough and this is why I am feeling so ugh and I want it to be over already. Best friend, I hope we stay friends to the very end. And if not, Then at least treat me like you would an old friend. ",
