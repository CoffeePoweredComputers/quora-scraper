            "answer_text": "Most companies, large ones anyway, have a progressive discipline policy. This generally begins with a sit-down with the employee to find out what it going on. This conversation should not be accusatory in nature, but one that seeks to get to the bottom of what is going on. Is there something going on in the employee's life that is causing them to be habitually late? If so, the employer should first try to work with the employee to see if that problem can be solved. Can the employee's schedule be adjusted? Does the employee have problems at home or at work with another employee? Sometimes, tardiness has nothing to do with work and everything to do with an employee's personal life. Working with the employee to solve these issues will bear better long-term fruit than immediately jumping to discipline. At the same time as you have this discussion with the employee, you need to explain why their tardiness is an issue. It affects morale, causes lost work, etc. Help them to understand why it is an issue. Let them know it cannot continue and give them an opportunity to correct the behavior. At the same time, if you have other employees doing the same thing, you need to be prepared to address those issues with those other employees. Employees sniff out inequity like drug dogs. You cannot single out one employee for tardiness if you excuse it in others. However, after you have worked with the employee all you can, and the problem continues, you may have no choice but to move through the progressive discipline procedures to a write up and eventually termination, if the behavior does not stop. This may seem harsh, but if you fail to follow company policy, then soon other policies will cease to be followed and it will become difficult for you manage your employees effectively. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly you should ensure that your company procedures make it clear that all employees are expected to be on time and what the disciplinary process is for those who don't adhere to this without having good reason and make sure that they are clear on these points by issuing each employee with a copy and having them sign to confirm that they understand the procedures. You will need to keep records of the days and times when they were late and if they are consistently doing this without any good reason for why which you can only ascertain by asking them why they are consistently late before you decide to discipline them as they could have legitimate reasons for it which you could try and resolve by other means such as changing their hours or getting them to make up the time. However if there is no tangible reason then you should firstly give them a verbal warning and outline what the consequences will be if they continue to be late without good reason and set out a timeframe of a week to a month to give them the opportunity to improve their time keeping. Should they continue to flout the company policy within the time period then you have to follow the companys documented disciplinary process which typically is a verbal warning where they are given a period of time to make amends followed by a written warning that sets out that should they fail to deliver and if they still don't adhere within a given timeframe then they will be dismissed. You have to ensure that you have adequate records of their repeated lateness and that you have followed the correct procedures for disciplinary action as well as ensure that you have an independent third party present in the disciplinary meetings and that the employee is able to have another person of their choice present in the meetings too. Without a proper written disciplinary procedure in place in the company that your employees are aware of then you will have difficulty in disciplining your employees for being late or for any other undesirable conduct and the law will be on their side ",
