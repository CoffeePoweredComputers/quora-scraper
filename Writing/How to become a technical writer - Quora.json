            "answer_text": "Defining the technical writer Wikipedia describes a technical writer as \u201ca professional writer who produces technical documentation that helps people understand and use a product or service.\u201d So in theory if you\u2019re good at explaining things by writing about them, and can get paid for doing so you\u2019re a technical writer.  [Note that the US Bureau of Labor statistics has a more detailed explanation.] Finding work as a technical writer Now if you want to do this fulltime you\u2019ll need a job in technical writing or perhaps freelance in it. There are plenty of great guides on how to land a job, so I won\u2019t get into that here. It basically boils down to applying to job openings, making connections, etc. - the same as any other jobs. I would like to add to Paul Pehrson\u2019s answer about working on open source projects. It is a good idea, and adding items to your portfolio certainly help when applying to jobs. Be warned though, that it\u2019s hard work, and if you didn\u2019t pick the right project to work on you\u2019d have spent a lot of your time on a piece that no one is interested in. I\u2019m all for gaining experience, every bit helps, but your time is limited, and you\u2019ll want to put as much of it as possible towards gaining experience that will help. A portfolio is immensely helpful when starting out because it\u2019s very likely you\u2019d be the only one with one. 50 candidates straight out of school and you\u2019re the only one who can actually prove he knows what he\u2019s doing? That\u2019s a win. How do you demonstrate a portfolio? Redditor Nobic points out that: Your Technical Writing portfolio might include PDFs of previous work you have done, and links to any online profiles, such as your wikipedia profile. Your wikipedia will have a list of changes you have made to different articles. The same could be said about other profiles. If you frequent and contribute to any Knowledge databases (like the mozilla knowledge database) or help forums (such as the DD-WRT forums, or whatever), you can choose to include those in your portfolio. It is up to your discretion whether you include them in your resume, but if you do include them in your portfolio (and your portfolio will come up during an interview), you will have a chance to discuss it with the employer. A good example of this is Tim Murphy who wrote a guide on how to use Mint.com, and has gone on to have a very successful career since then. The manual currently retails for around $30. The Mint: Money, Bill Pay, Credit Score & Investing software is still free. That should tell you plenty about what\u2019s possible. Joel Henry Hinrichs\u2019s answer - it\u2019s who you know is also true. The majority of technical writing jobs today are in the software fields, with the second most common being from high tech hardware. You\u2019ll get hired when you can demonstrate expertise/competence, but you can\u2019t get people to give you due consideration unless you\u2019ve got the right references. Becoming a great technical writer Now let\u2019s talk about leveling up your technical writing skills. Ultimately what you worked on and who you know will only open doors, they won\u2019t actually propel you to greatness until you get real good at technical writing. Here are some pointers to get started: Get comfortable with specialized technical writing software. You can use MS word or Apple pages to publish help manuals but a dedicated software makes it easier. I recommend HelpNDoc because it\u2019s free and powerful.Get comfortable with basic image editing. To explain how to use a product you\u2019re going to need photos, diagrams and screenshots.Always take the time to familiarize yourself with the product you\u2019re writing about first. You need to understand it as well as the original creators. In fact, spend time with the creators while you\u2019re at it. The fastest way to understand a product is to help out during usability testing.In line with the previous, take time to understand who will be using the product as well. You need to write in the tone and language that your audience is most comfortable with. When in doubt err on the side of caution, as developers almost always overestimate the abilities of their audience.Equally important, learn to work well with a team of people who know more about everything (related to the product) than you do. The idea that a single person working from a single point of view can create documentation that applies to everyone in every situation is ludicrous. You might start out alone, but eventually you\u2019ll want to work with other subject matter experts, and they\u2019ll almost always know more about the product than you do. This is a good thing. However they might not be as good at writing as you are, so the final responsibility to communicate with the users still comes down on you.Never start without an outline and use case study. The documentation should always be arranged logically, from the user\u2019s perspective, so take the time to lay out each topic first. Again, a good writing software is a godsend for this.Edit and proofread over and over again. Work towards (1) making everything easier to understand (2) reducing the time needed to understand something fully (i.e. minimization).Understand the basics of good design. You\u2019re a writer, not a designer, but your job is to help people understand, and that\u2019s just not possible if your design is making things more difficult. You don\u2019t need to take design classes or anything (doesn\u2019t hurt though) but you do need to understand the principles of good design, so you\u2019re arranging your documentation in a way that makes it easy to understand.And finally, learn to get user feedback. Until you\u2019ve heard from actual users that the user manual is good, you\u2019ll need to assume it\u2019s not and can use more improvement. The users may not have time, or want to talk to you, so it\u2019s up to you to ask the right questions and get the necessary feedback from them as quickly as you can.So TL;DR To become a technical writer you need to start getting paid for explaining things to people by writing about themTo get paid for this you need to find work in this fieldTo find work in this field you need to know the right people and demonstrate the right capabilitiesTo be able to get ahead in this line of work, and see serious money coming in, you need to get good at technical writing, and you can can start with the 9 points listed above.Good luck ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, The job of a tech writer is to present complex information related to a product in clear and crisp language so that even a layman can understand more about the product clearly. To become a good technical writer you must have the following skill sets: Common sense - Believe me, this is very important for a technical writer. As you have to juggle between multiple projects, keeping track of all projects, prioritizing, understanding the work and so on will become a herculean task if you don\u2019t have this quality. I have seen people getting fired even though they had sound technical skills needed for a technical writer. This happened just because they were not having common sense and better judgement according to varying project scenario.English - Even though it may seem very obvious, English reading and writing (grammar, punctuation) skills are very much important here. But in practical, a tech writer has to use basic English as he/she has to cater to global audience. In some of the countries, audience won\u2019t be well versed in English. Hence, it is very important that the document must be user friendly and easy to understand.Good reader - There is a saying \u201cGood things in, good things out\u201d. A good technical writer must always read all types of books (fiction/non-fiction) to cultivate the good things which he/she reads.Interviewing skills - Since a tech writer has to create content from scratch, he/she has to attend back-to-back meetings, interact with the Subject Matter Experts (SME) like designer, developer, QA, business analyst etc. The writer has to grasp all these vast info pouring in. Also, he/she has to ask right questions at the right time. Hence, the writer must have excellent grasping and interviewing skills.Technical Publication Standards - There are some international standards related to technical publication. To name a few - Microsoft Styleguide for Technical Publication (MSTP), Simplified Technical English (STE), Document Development Life Cycle (DDLC) and so on. It is good to have an idea on all these.Tool knowledge: At last, but not the least, there are some tools specific to writing/illustration. My personal opinion is that, tool knowledge is not that important, as even a newcomer can learn these tools over a period of time. Nevertheless, the writer must have the tool knowledge to complete his task.Hope this answer helps. ",
