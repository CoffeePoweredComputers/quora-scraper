            "answer_text": "There's so many ways to connect with people these days. Options are everywhere. Think of the six degrees Kevin Bacon approach. Cross utilize your networks. Source the contact you need to reach on LinkedIn - but you can't contact them directly unless you are a premium member\u2026 not a big deal, because you\u2019re better off anyway if you have someone that knows this contact make the introduction prior to reaching out. So find a mutual contact on Facebook. If you want to solicite a business that clearly states \u201cno solicitation\u201d then you clearly feel strongly that you have something of value to present to them. Explain this to your mutual contact so they understand the value or mutual benefit. They're not going to connect you and the business if they don't think you have value to offer because it's going to potentially close the door to the relationship they've developed with that person or business. And if you really do have value, the business moves forward with whatever it is that you're offering, you as well provide benefit to your mutual contact. If you want it bad enough, you should be able to find a way to connect with anyone. But it's a grind. Networking is not a process that delivers instant gratification typically. You have to be in for the long haul and see it through. It pays off and adds to your personal value immensely if you do the same for others when they come to you. At that point, you are a networker.

No Soliciting means No Soliciting. You want people to feel it\u2019s their idea to come to you. Give them a good reason to. I\u2019d go with the courier package that specifically speaks to their needs and aims for the callback. Don\u2019t expect a 1:1 mailing to callback ratio, though. ",
