            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. You have  to have a good idea of who your characters are before you write them.  Who they are, how they were raised or how broken they are will determine how they react to situations.  If you have flat characters with no personalities, no life problems, they will not make for very interesting reading.  I often talk about compelling characters and this is exactly what I mean.  A very sweet woman. a young new bride, who was daddy's little girl, sheltered for most of her life, is not going to have the same verbal or physical reaction to bad news or bad luck as a hardened hooker.  You have to know what you're dealing with in order to write realistic dialogue and reactions.   So let's say you're writing a bank robbery scene.  The two women above are taken hostage.   Right from the get-go you need to know who your characters are so you can have them react in a way that doesn't leave the reader scratching his/her head.  Their personalities will determine how they will behave with regard to the situation they find themselves in, to the robbers themselves, and to each other.  Each will have their own style of speaking, body language, and attitude.   I do a rough list of my characters that I can refer to.  The 'why' of how someone reacts has to be believable.  Daddy's girl will probably sit in the corner of the van and shiver and cry.  It would be out of character for her to boldly try to seduce one of the robbers into letting her go.  But the hooker would do that.  The lists that you see people use are a bit long for me.  I don't really think what my character's favorite movie is is going to matter for my bank robber.  Unless he is trying to emulate his favorite movie character himself.  Their favorite holidays, colors,   favorite teacher?  Their favorite flower?  I can see where someone who likes to fill all that out would really understand their character, but it's too petty for me.  I stick with the following list.  Fill it out and you know pretty much what you have to work with for a character and why they do the things they do, which is the most important aspect of doing this bit of pre-writing work.  \u00b7  Name, sex, age.  (Davin, male, 32) \u00b7  Physical description (Short, thin, bad complexion, one weak leg that drags sometimes.) \u00b7  Educational background: field of work (Dropped out of school in 9th grade, works as laborer on construction sites.) \u00b7  Family issues/ friends  (Never knew his father, mother was a drunk.  His few friends  are mostly in prison now. Never had a girlfriend for any length of time. Is a bit intimidated by women.) \u00b7  Flaws/strengths  (Stubborn, opinionated.   Is very mechanical, can fix things.) \u00b7  Dreams/ aspirations (dreams of opening his own repair shop) .  Fears  (That he'll never amount to anything, and will live alone in a dirty trailer until the day he dies.) Now, when Davin goes in to rob the bank, the reader knows why, they know how he's going to react to the two vastly different women hostages -- and you can write realistic scenes. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a massive and completely false dualism circulating about character creation, which is something along the lines of:   Either you prepare them in great detail before you begin writing, orYou discover them as you writeNot only is neither of these really either helpful or possible, but no author really does either one or the other. If you have a good story, it's the story that calls forth the characters; you create the characters that you have to have in order to tell the stories that you want to tell.  What varies is how conscious authors are of their own creative process - of both the discovery of characters, and the extent to which the nature of the characters is meaningful or even discoverable outside of the context of the story. One of the most common dilemmas that authors come to me with is when they need a character to do some arbitrary thing to make the plot work, but can't find a convincing reason why they character would do it. I find these issues reveal the nature of the creative process when it comes to character. Because in the best books, with the best characters, part of the drafting and redrafting process is a kind of narrowing down, an increase of resolution, a penning-in of characters, on the basis of what the character must be in order for the story to work. So we ask ourselves all sorts of questions about the circumstances and the history, that might lead to characters taking certain decisions. As long as the character still has a choice, we know the problem hasn't been solved. What your characters do has to be inevitable. Everything that has come before is leading up to what they do, the things they say, the decisions they take, such that there is no longer any possibility that they could do anything else. The only way you can get there is iteratively. To start with, you have an idea of the story and it's characters (neither can exist without the other). And then you begin your process of refining both, together. Even the writers who spend hours building complex and detailed backstories are actually taking decisions about what can happen in the story, they are narrowing the possible paths that the story can take, by adding more details about the characters. And once they begin a first draft, many of those details will change. In essence, what I'm saying is that you can't create characters first, and then write a story about them, any more than you can create a story and then decide what the characters are like. Writing a story is a process of steady refinement. Each draft is like a layer of paint on an oil painting. No visual artist expects to get the picture just right with the first application of paint.   If, however, I had one don't about characters, it's this:  Don't define their physical appearance.This causes more problems for the reader than writers ever imagine, and I've written very extensively on this in other places.
