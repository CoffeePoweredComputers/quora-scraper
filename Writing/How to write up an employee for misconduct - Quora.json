            "answer_text": "Before you write them up, make sure you have the done the pre-work so the write up will stick. What do I mean by pre-work? If the first time the conduct has occurred and it is not egregious, sit the employee down and explain why the behavior is unacceptable. Immediately after the conversation, send the employee an email confirming that you had the conversation. It\u2019s not important if they read it or not - this is your documentation that the conversation occurred. If the behavior is repeated, you now have proof that the employee should have known better and s/he will find it difficult to contest the write-up. The conversation is the first step in progressive discipline. We always want to give the employee a chance to correct behavior but without documentation we can\u2019t prove that they ever knew it was wrong. But what if the conduct is egregious. No problem - don\u2019t bother writing them up. Fire them. If there is ever a doubt about which road to take, talk to your HR manager. They know the company and its policies and can best advise you. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "By following company policy and procedure on the matter. Document the entire situation by writing a formal report, including the names of everyone present as witnesses and what happened, any attempts of your own to correct the issue prior to having to elevate it to a written complaint (if any), and filing the paperwork your company issues for such issues (there may be no papers at all, it could all be electronically filed as is done more and more in this day and age). When in doubt, ask your boss, whether it\u2019s a supervisor, the general manager, corporate HQ, or the owner. ",
