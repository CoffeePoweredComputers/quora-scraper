            "answer_text": "Making your content reachable to everyone is possible through SEO. With the right keywords, headlines, and topics, you can surely secure a sweet spot on Google searches. However, those are not enough on their own. Your content's quality has a lot to do with making it more reachable to everyone. That means you also have to recognize your audience, identify your niche, and determine your networks. It's not enough to have a little idea of who will be reading your content. You have to really know who you're speaking to through your articles. You must be able to know what they are interested in, what they feel about certain issues, and which groups they belong in. Basically, you must have a reader's profile. That way, you'll know how to compose your blogs. You'll have a better sense of setting the tone for them and bonding with the readers. It's also important to have a clear sense of your niche. Many content writers identify with too broad niches that make their articles unnoticed. You have to find a specific one, a community. That way, you can adjust your content according to how that area discusses matters, what they talk about, and what their principles are. Your content must belong to a certain category, in short. Your blog must be seen as a reputable source for something specific. And lastly, you have to determine your platforms or the channels on which you'll promote your content. There are a bunch of sites or networks out there for all sorts of fields. Find the ones where people would engage with your content. That way, you might even establish relations with websites who can backlink your website to one of their pages. That will surely increase your visibility. ",
