I am little unaware if there\u2019s something like this sort of scheme running but I think it would be better to first pitch your \u201crequest-email\u201d and if they get agree then they will arrange you dashborad and everything for writing. I don\u2019t think that if you write a complete post and email them and they will inch down every line of your guest post, this might not be an easy probability but if you do wanna check there\u2019s only one-way: wrap your whole content and email them from the contact form in their blog. {Warning: Some bloggers are very arrogant and they might heat up! and you would end up losing a precious chance} I might think that there could be one more way to write on your blog and on anything (I might not know) and send them the link (of your writing) on their social media and make a request. (Edit: If you don\u2019t find anything to write upon and to send them the link, then only use your blog.) ",
