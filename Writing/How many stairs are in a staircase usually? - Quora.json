            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as a \u2018standard\u2019 staircase. As others have pointed out, there is generally a formula to determine the rise (height) and going (length) of each tread based on the floor to floor height. This determines the number of steps. Regulations for stairs are different for different types of building. Public buildings must have shallower stairs with more landings. It is however possible to consider the minimum effective stair in a residential building. In most parts of the world, the typical minimum floor to ceiling height for new dwellings is generally around 2.4m. Depending on how big your rooms are, and the spans of the joists, you will typically have a floor construction of 200\u2013250mm depth. This generally works out at a minimum of 13 risers. However, if the dwelling is large, the ceiling is likely to be higher and the floor construction could be deeper so you could end up with between 14\u201316 risers. In some jurisdictions, once any flight of stairs is over a certain height, you need a landing in the middle. Generally the rule works that for every n. height you need a landing, so you could have more than one. ",

            "answer_text": "The number of stairs is determined by the floor to floor height you have. On a domestic staircase the risers should have an height of 190 or 200 mm, so if you have for example a floor to floor height of 2900 mm the number of risers will be 15. (2900 : 190 = 15) The top step is usually one riser below the floor level, so you will have 14 stairs. If you want the top step flat with the floor you have 15 stairs. This to give you a very general explanation. Each staircase is however designed according to the space available in the house or commercial space (not only to the floor to floor height , but also to the ceiling opening width, to walls positions etc.) . Each staircase is unique and number of stairs is always different. ",
