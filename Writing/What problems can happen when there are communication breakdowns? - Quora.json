            "answer_text": "In any relationship, be it personal or business related, communication is key. Period. That said, when it comes to a breakdown in communication, it could signal the ending of a relationship. Problems that arise from a communication breakdown are a strong sense of confusion for whomever is on the receiving end of faltering communication, a feeling of drop in self-respect or self-worth and finding yourself in a state of loneliness. All three of these examples come from a communication breakdown in regards to a personal relationship. To be more concise, think of the feelings experienced after a breakup. As Led Zeppelin mentions in their 1969 track, \u201cCommunication Breakdown\u201d, it causes a \u201cnervous breakdown\u201d, which is true. The feeling of left alone without response can drive anyone insane, as lead vocalist Robert Plant goes on to say. ",
