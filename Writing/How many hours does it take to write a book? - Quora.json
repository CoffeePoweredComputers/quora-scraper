            "answer_text": "My first novel, No Third Choice, began according to a story I had in mind. I got about five pages in and hit a brick wall. Several days later, over coffee, my partner (bless her heart!) suggested that instead of taking the story in this direction, I should take it in that direction, and the first draft was finished in four weeks.  That was the easy part. I then edited, rewrote, re-edited, solicited comments from friends (most of whom have not read my subsequent novels, which may tell you something about the state it was in then), re-rewrote, re-re-edited, tweaked and generally modified it for about three years until it was picked up by a publisher. The later novels didn't take as long to rewrite; they took longer to get the first draft down. It was a lot better, by comparison.  The real answer, I suppose, is not unlike 'how long is a novel?' It is as long as it needs to be and it takes as long to write as it needs to. Some novels, of course, are a lot longer than they need to be. It takes a good author to pull that off without making it boring. ",

            "answer_text": "Read this write up on a website by Alexis Grant Over lunch recently with a pair of travelers who are considering writing a book, one asked me how long it took me to write mine. \u201cMore than a year,\u201d I told him. \u201cI worked on it full time for a year, then revised while getting my social-media business up and running.\u201d \u201cA year?!\u201d he said, practically gaping. \u201cThat\u2019s a long time.\u201d It is a long time. Writing a book is no small project, of course, but sometimes I wonder what took me so long to write \u2014 and revise and revise and revise and revise and revise \u2014 85,000 words. Of course, it\u2019s not the writing that takes a long while; after writing on deadline for a newspaper, I know how to crank out paragraphs. It\u2019s the telling of the story that takes time, discovering not what to write buthow to write it. Yet when I mentioned this to an author during my second writer\u2019s residency at The Hambidge Center, she had the opposite reaction. \u201cTwo years for a revised version of your book? That\u2019s nothing.\u201d Plenty of authors take years to write a book, she said, and a year and a half or two years is a totally reasonable goal. Of course, it depends on the type of book you\u2019re writing, the length, your experience, whether it requires research and more. We often hear about how popular novelists pump out a book or more each year, while I read somewhere that it took Rebecca Skloot a decade to complete her fabulous The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. So I think the only answer to this question is that it takes as long as it takes. Likely longer than you expect. No matter how many months or years you plan to spend writing, a book is the kind of project you don\u2019t want to take on unless you\u2019re dedicated to spending a whole lot of quality time with it.
