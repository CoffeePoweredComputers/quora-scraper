            "answer_text": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Baz Luhrmann's work sharply divides critics. I think it's telling that, as I write this, Rotten Tomatoes has the Tomatometer at dead on 50% because BL's work has always sharply divided critics.  It's getting to be a cliche when speaking of Baz, but it's true - you either love him or you hate him. If you didn't like Moulin Rouge and don't appreciate his style, you won't like The Great Gatsby. Me? I love his style. Love it. I was disappointed in Australia - but Gatsby is a return to his Moulin Rouge form. The guy is a bold genius, an iconoclast who doesn't give a toss what more timid souls say about him. No-one will ever look at a Baz Luhrmann film and wonder who made it.  Leonardo DiCaprio's Gatsby is so beautiful, so intensely, twistedly, passionate, that he makes me want to cry just to look at him.  It's a magnificent film. And now, someone is going to say, Oh, but it's flawed!  And I will reply, Well, duh!  What a redundant statement. Of course it is. What film isn't? What anything isn't? It doesn't look dreadful. It looks beautiful and different from anything you will ever see again. Here are a couple of rave reviews to counter-balance the terrible ones that receive the most publicity: The Great Gatsby: 4.5 stars \u2018The Great Gatsby,\u2019 Interpreted by Baz Luhrmann Page on Darcymoore Judging Luhrmann\u2019s Gatsby: Five English Scholars Weigh In I particularly like the last page in which some clever journalist has gathered 5 English Lit professors to debunk, with their reviews, the preposterous idea that the film strays too far from the source material (as if that even matters). And just one more for your amusement.  James Franco reviews James Franco's review of 'The Great Gatsby' If there were anything I wish he would do in hindsight, it's to name the film just plain 'Gatsby' to head off all those The Not So Great Gatsby jokes which folks seem to think are clever.

For example, in the book, it is only the first party that is experienced with a sense of wonder and awe, with subsequent gatherings generating a queasy distaste in Nick. It\u2019s part of the commentary on decadence and corruption running throughout the book. Yet in the film, everything is glitz and glamour, and the themes get pushed into the background in pursuit of that Baz Luhrmann spectacle. TGG is not without its pleasures (the modern songs done in a big band style are pretty great) but it has to go down as a hollow adaption of a literary classic. ",
