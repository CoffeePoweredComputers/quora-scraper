            "answer_text": "Well, that depends on what you mean by tablet. In your question, you cite both tablet PCs and tablets. Both are tablets, but both are not PCs, which sounds like a logic puzzle. Generally, a tablet (sans PC) is a device that has a touchscreen for interaction, no keyboard, and runs a mobile OS like iOS or Android. There have been a smattering of Linux-based tablets, and Microsoft floated the miserable Windows RT for a bit, but that\u2019s pretty much it. A tablet PC, on the other hand, is a tablet that runs a non-mobile OS, like Windows. There have been precious few Mac OS tablets, and they were very costly converted MacBooks, so those don\u2019t really count, which leaves just Windows. While a tablet PC lacks a keyboard, it\u2019s quite rare that they don\u2019t have a keyboard as an option or a bundled component. So, yes. There IS a difference, though that line is starting to blur. Mobile OS apps are maturing, online services have become far more prevalent, and Microsoft has been hammering away at stuff for a while now, like the Surface Pro and Surface Book. Tablets are also taking a dive in the market, as more and more people use their phones instead. And, of course, Microsoft has recently highlighted PC makers who have started announcing Windows devices that run Windows 10 on ARM processors, which is a strong him that MS will be rejoining the mobile market with a device that can not only work as a phone, but as a real PC. Times sure as hell are interesting. ",

In such a scenario there is no clear line that separates one gadget from another in terms of what it can be categorised as. A tablet could be something that has a touch screen as its primary input and has a large screen just for that. Add a keyboard and a mouse to that and it becomes a table PC since keyboard and mouse are often associated with PCs. ",
