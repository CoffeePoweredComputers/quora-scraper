            "answer_text": "Adding illustrations constitute a major change in your book. You will have to get a new ISBN and copyright registration for an illustrated version of the book which is considered a \u201cderivative work\u201d. However, people do cheat. If you don\u2019t make a very big deal out of adding illustrations to a newer layout, no one is probably going to notice. Though, you can\u2019t then go adding this new information about illustrations to the previous copyright. So it will not come up in your current ISBN or Library of Congress listing that it is an illustrated book. You will also have to make sure to indicate a separate copyright for the illustrations in the new layout otherwise they can be copied. The original copyright will not cover illustrations not indicated by the copyright registration since they don\u2019t appear in the manuscript you submitted. ",
