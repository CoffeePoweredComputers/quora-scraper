            "answer_text": "The expression of an equilibrium constant depends on the stoichiometry of the reactants and products. Consider some balanced equation [math]aA+bB\\longrightarrow cC+dD[/math] First, the concentration of each product is raised to its coefficient and multiplied together (concentrations are expressed in square brackets [ ] ): [math][A]^{a}[B]^{b}[/math] Then, multiply the concentrations of the reactants, after raising them to their coefficients: [math][C]^{c}[D]^{d}[/math] Lastly, divide the value for the products by the value for the reactants: [math]\\dfrac{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}[/math] Therefore, the equilibrium constant is expressed as [math]\\dfrac{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}}{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}[/math], given a balanced chemical equation [math]aA+bB\\longrightarrow cC+dD[/math].
