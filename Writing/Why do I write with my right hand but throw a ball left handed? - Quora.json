And don't forget that some teachers, especially in parochial schools, used to force kids to write with their right hand. I also cut with scissors with my right. And shoot a gun. And do archery right-handed. But eating, throwing, drinking, boxing, all sports, using tools, etc\u2026all leftie. Go figure. ",
