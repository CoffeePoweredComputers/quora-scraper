            "answer_text": "Hi there, for this answer, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re referring to language private tutors, but most of the points apply to any type of private tutor. I would say private tutors have different rates based on what country you live in (and the minimum wage), the language itself (whether it is in high demand- more expensive; or in lower demand- which would be cheaper), and the number of private tutors available on that platform (so if there\u2019s only one or two teachers teaching it, as opposed to 15 or 20, then they would be more expensive, because there would be higher demand) However, here are some other things to keep in mind: Most tutors work with an hourly rateIf you\u2019re looking to discuss a paper, assignment or prepare for a one-time event, like an interview for e.g.- this could be beneficial. BUT- if you want to learn something consistently, this really matters. If a tutor is charging $16/hour, this would really add up the more you use the lessons.You would want to try out different teachers before you stick to oneIt may be that some tutors have a cheaper rate, and some more expensive. Sometimes, I see this distinction because of their academic achievements (one has a Phd, the other has only a masters, etc.) however the more expensive one doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the better tutor. Test out your teachers before you pick one to continue with.Availability of the tutor is really important What is the point of finding an amazing tutor, but having no availabilities with them? More importantly, if the only time you\u2019re available is at 2:30PM or 10PM, you want to make sure the tutor is available then too.If you are looking for language tutors, you can always check out Rype.

            "answer_text": "Here is an analysis to help you understand how much online private tutors cost, why the prices vary so much and hopefully help you make a better decision: (1) The first thing to ask is why are you looking for an Online tutor and not an In-person tutor? Online tutors are great for: Learning languages - You might not live close to someone who can tutor a foreign languageLast-minute/On-demand/Late at night - Perfect to answer a quick question for tomorrows examConvenience - No need to travel, save time, safe.In-person tutoring can often be more effective for drawing-intensive subjects like Mathematics or Science. (2) Next you need to decide what you want to get out of the tutoring? Exams/Tests - Do you want to pass a important exam or test, you might only want tutoring adhocly, and if the exam is very important you might be willing to spend more.On-going, remedial - Do you want someone who can help you with your English for 3 years? You might then want to find a more affordable option.Content/No-content - Do you require the tutoring company to supply you with content? If so it might be more expensive. Or do you have your own content, or will the tutor know how to help you.Here\u2019s the breakdown: Chegg, $30/hrStrengths: On-demand, content, QnA\u2019sWeaknesses: Languages, long-term/on-going relationships.Noteworthy: Subscription model.Varsity Tutors, $50 - $80/hrStrengths: On-demand, hands-on, long-term relationships.Weaknesses: Expensive, large once-off purchases, Languages.Noteworthy: Largely app based.MyTutor, $20\u201340/hrStrengths: Affordable, long-term/on-going relationships.Weaknesses: Non-professional tutors.Noteworthy: Largely UK based.Verbling, $15\u201350/hrStrengths: Language, long-term/on-going relationships.Weaknesses: Non-language, curriculum.Noteworthy: Free trail.iTalki, $15\u201350/hrStrengths: Language, long-term/on-going relationships.Weaknesses: Non-language, curriculum.Noteworthy: Strong community.There are hundreds more of these companies, and a price that will be perfect for you depending on your needs, I will update the list with any recommendations.
