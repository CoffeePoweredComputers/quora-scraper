            "answer_text": "I agree, it has taken longer since Sept 2019. We are experiencing an odd case right now. Our Pomodoro Focus Timer DayNinja - Focus Timer+ - Apps on Google Play only appears when this url is used. If anyone types into google play \"DayNinja\" it does not appear and there are no other matches. The app was \u201cpublished\u201d 4 days ago and still has not appeared. Google Play Developer Chat support says we must wait 7 days before they can investigate. We publish a lot of apps and never have experienced this delay. Typically when \u201cpublished\u201d the app appears within 4hrs, 24hrs at most. To reach \u201cpublished\u201d status the longest we have experienced with Google Play is 7 days. The odd thing here is that it is \u2018published\u2019, I\u2019ll add to this answer when we get a solution so it helps others who experience the same frustration. ",
