            "answer_text": "A new team member does not, rather should not introduce himself/herself to the existing client with an ongoing project, in which project he is joining as a new resource. It is the responsibility of the project manager to introduce a new entrant resource to the existing client. Having said that, the new resource does not write to the client asking for the project\u2019s requirements. You can find it in the project scope document being maintained by the project manager and it is available to all the resources, be it old or the new. Also, whenever there is a change in scope/requirements, this document is getting updated by the BA or the project manager himself, and you cannot approach the client every time for this. Hope this answers your query. All the best. ",
