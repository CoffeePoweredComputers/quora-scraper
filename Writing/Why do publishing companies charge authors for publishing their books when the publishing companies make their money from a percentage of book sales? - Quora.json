            "answer_text": "Publishing companies, legitimate houses, do not charge authors. They pay authors. Look, it works like this. Assuming that your work has been submitted to a legitimate publishing house, and they agree to publish it, you receive money, called an advance, which is literally and advance against future earnings. Generally, it\u2019s paid in three separate parts: on acceptance, during the process, and on publication. If your book makes more money than the advance that was paid, you get another check, called a royalty. This is a percent of the total sales of your book. Now, all of that is a simplification of the process, but here\u2019s what\u2019s important. The (legitimate) publishing house does in fact keep a portion of your profits. Why? Because from the moment you submit that manuscript to the moment it hits bookstores and online site, many eyes and minds have worked on your book. Editorial, copy, marketing, rights, art, and sales departments have all worked to figure out how to work with you to make your book better, to figure out who might want to read your book, and to get it into the hands of readers who are the target audience. All of those people need to get paid, and the lights have to stay on in the office. The publishing company has not asked you for a dime. They have split any profits with you; if your book doesn\u2019t earn out, the publisher is in the red. If a publishing company asks for money, they are not legitimate. They are a vanity press. A vanity press will take your manuscript and agree to turn it into a book for a set amount of money. They make take an editorial pass at it, which means that they may have someone who reads it to make sure that there are no glaring errors. They may have someone who designs a cover. You pay them to turn your manuscript into a book. Another model is self-publishing. You, the writer, take your manuscript, and hire an editorial service to edit it. You hire a designer to make it look like a book. You hire someone to write cover copy, and someone to figure out how to market it and do publicity. You\u2019ve paid a chunk of change, but you have total control, and anything the book makes is yours. Of course, you can do all of those things yourself and save money, but each and every component of the process requires a specific skill, and it\u2019s a good deal of time consuming work, which will eat into your day job, family, or the next book you\u2019re trying to write. And it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to get a self-published book into stores and picked up by mass market accounts, the places like CostCo and Target and airport stores, that can move large numbers of books. It\u2019s also beyond doubtful that a vanity press book will wind up on the shelves at Barnes and Noble. The short version of this is that if a publishing company asks you for money, they are a vanity press, not a legitimate house. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Mainstream traditional publishers do not charge authors for anything (other than excessive changes made after the book has been laid out for the printer, because changes then are EXPENSIVE). Those operations that do not choose books based upon their commercial potential or literary merit DO charge, because they know that the books they publish have little or no chance to garner substantial sales. Some of these operations pretend that your manuscript was chosen by their editors. But if they\u2019re requiring that you buy X number of copies, or pay $Y toward the cost of the publishing, then they\u2019re not expecting to make their money from sales. And that tells you something. There are also a few hybrid publishers, who are usually very small houses that have very small amounts of working capital. They may ask that that authors who have a manuscript they really like, but cannot afford to add to this year\u2019s list, pay a portion of the costs of production, and get a higher royalty rate as a result. There are very, very few of them, and you\u2019re unlikely to have found one. ",
