            "answer_text": "Cuneiform was developed by the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia c. 3500-3000 BC. The cuneiform script was developed from primitive writing in the late 4th millennium BC. Mesopotamia's \"Primitive literacy\" period spans roughly the 35th to 32nd centuries. The first documents unequivocally written in Sumerian date to the 31st century at Jemdet Nasr. That is, as far as I know, the oldest mentioned date of the appearance of Cuneiform. Hieroglyphs emerged from the preliterate artistic traditions of Egypt. For example, symbols on pottery from c. 4000 BC have been argued to resemble hieroglyphic writing. Primitive hieroglyphic symbol systems develop in the second half of the 4th millennium BC, such as the clay labels of a Predynastic ruler called \"Scorpion I\" ( Naqada IIIA period, c. 33rd century BC). The first full sentence written in hieroglyphs so far discovered dates from the Second Dynasty (28th or 27th century BC). So all in all, I\u2019d say hieroglyphs were older, as primitive writing had appeared before Cuneiform. But maybe Cuneiform developed faster. ",
