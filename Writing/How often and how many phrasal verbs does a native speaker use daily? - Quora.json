            "answer_text": "I am going to give you a glib answer first: all that they need. The reality is that the categorization of phrasal and non-phrasal verbs is something that happens in grammar books but - here is the important part - not in a native speaker\u2019s head. What happens in that head is this (much faster than this explanation takes to read): what thought am I trying to express, and what verb and other parts of speech do I need to make a sentence that expresses that thought as closely as possible to my intent? Whether a verb is phrasal or not does not matter in that process. I just know which verb works best in that context and then I wrap the words around it, one of which may be the preposition that categorizes it as a phrasal verb in your textbook. So the straight answer is: I have absolutely no idea how many phrasal verbs I use, since there is no separate container in my brain to which I can attach a usage counter. I realize this is not helpful. I encourage you to approach expanding your use of English this way: discover through reading, listening and conversation which verbs are used to express which meanings, then look up what the sentence formation rules are for them (phrasal/non-phrasal, regular/irregular and so on) and practice them in your writing, speaking and conversation.
