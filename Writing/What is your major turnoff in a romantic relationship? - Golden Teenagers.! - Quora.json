After that she starts telling me I need to be religious, I need to come home from work early (which I did not control), and finally she told that she wanted to move to a larger city almost 1000 km away. With her there was no negotiation! She was beautiful, intelligent, but mean as a snake! If she would have asked maybe I would have. Since constantly she told me what she thought I needed to do without consulting me, it was time for a change. I don\u2019t drink or smoke, but I do say a few too many bad words. I told her that I like who I am and I am a good person. I asked if she could stop constantly nagging me. She said \u201cNO\u201d and I said \u201cSeeya and moved out.\u201d I have no regrets. ",
