            "answer_text": "This is a great question. It\u2019s a little bit of a strange process because writing for a documentary is necessarily done in phases. The writing process will also differ somewhat depending on the subject of the film and how much you can expect to know in advance. You\u2019ll need to start with research on the subject. A lot of research. If a documentary has already been done on this subject, what are you revealing in yours that hasn\u2019t been showcased before? Who are the characters in this story? What\u2019s the question you want this documentary to answer? You want to be very clear with yourself about the story you want to tell (although the truth is, when everything is filmed, you may find there\u2019s a better story there). Documentary film is a changing genre. There are a lot of options for how to tell your story. Watch a lot of documentary films and see what you like and don\u2019t like. Once you know what story you\u2019re trying to tell and how you\u2019re trying to tell it, my suggestion would be to outline the film much like you would any other. What are the beginning, middle, and end? What are your hoped-for turning points and surprises? What\u2019s the climax? How detailed you go with this is going to depend on the topic and the way it\u2019s necessarily being filmed. You might go ahead and write using the split script format at this point in the process. You\u2019ll likely only write a final script after the footage has been shot. It too will look different from your standard narrative script. At this point, it might be called a \u201cpaper edit.\u201d The link below has some great visuals for the different types of documents that you might use in the process of writing a documentary script.

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t write a script as the first step. I would write out topics I want to cover and brainstorm how I could capture those topics in filming events and interviews. I would then plan out those shoots, including people I have to talk to at events and interview questions for the interviews. And then, with all of that footage, I would THEN go about writing a voice over script in conjunction with the editing process. And have that voice-over recorded by a professional as part of the final audio design of the film. Or, you know, not use voice-over at all. Just let the events and the words of the subjects themselves narrate the story of the documentary. Why do you think you need a script at all? ",
