            "answer_text": "The words 6:30 is usually associated with the time of the day. If one wants to say the time is 6:30, one could use the numbers 6 and 30 to say so. It is also possible to say: it is half past six. In Sanskrit, the latter method is used. So 6:30 as a fact of the time of the day would be: \u0938 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927 \u0937\u0921 \u0935\u093e\u0926\u0928\u0947. Because of rules of Sandhi in Sanskrit - well defined rules which govern how to join two adjoining alphabets to facilitate better pronunciation (actually articulation) 6:30 in Sanskrit would be written as \u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0927 \u0937\u0921 \u0935\u093e\u0926\u0928\u0947 meaning half after six. The two words \u0938 \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0927 are articulated as if they are one word by Sandhi rules to be written and articulated as \u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0927 \u0935\u093e\u0926\u0928\u0947. I hope this helps. ",
