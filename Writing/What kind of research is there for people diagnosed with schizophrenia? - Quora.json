With June estimates at 7000+ authors, 69 other Hackernoon contributors might also be a victim of schizophrenia, along with me. This article serves to demonstrate why these people are facing tougher-than-average odds to live to a ripe old age, and how society isn\u2019t doing them justice in helping or finding a permanent solution. Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is the psychotic disorder that\u2019s defined by losing control over your reality. If you start to slip into beliefs or experiences \u2013 auditory, visual \u2013 that others don\u2019t perceive, you\u2019re schizophrenic! There\u2019s other qualifiers to the disorder, like having a certain frequency and total number occurrences of these thoughts \u2013 as well as a lack of other conditions which may otherwise explain these often terrifying and traumatizing thoughts. What counts as an hallucination or delusion? A hallucination is an effect on your senses that others can\u2019t perceive. You might see something that isn\u2019t there, hear something in the distance that only you can hear \u2013 you might even perceive other people perceiving your hallucinations, which is a trap on it\u2019s own because now your hallucinations are covering your other hallucinations. You can see how easy it would be to lose touch with reality when your own human mind makes up its mind to revolt! A delusion is a belief in something, some thought or idea or pattern that nobody else can perceive. You might think the media is talking to you, telling you to do things in secret code. You might think that you are somehow special, be it superpowers or the fact that you\u2019re President \u2013 these delusions can vary in strength and severity, and may even go unnoticed in some for years and years before causing any issues. There are negative symptoms of schizophrenia, too \u2013 where the positive symptoms are qualities you\u2019ve gained or acquired from the illness, like hallucinations or delusions \u2013 the negative symptoms are things that you\u2019ve lost with the new mental state. These could be habits or behaviours like caring about one\u2019s well-being (cooking, cleaning, self-care) or curtailing one\u2019s hobbies due to lack of interest. Prevalence Schizophrenia affects 1% of the population, 1.5% of Americans and 1.5 million people were diagnosed with it this year. This translates to 300 000 Canadians, nearly 5 million Americans \u2013 verily, 105 million people around the world. Indeed, someone you know \u2013 more than one person you know \u2013 could very well be suffering. Concurrent Disorders & Overdoses Nearly half of people suffering from schizophrenia abuse drugs and alcohol. We call this a \u2018concurrent disorder\u2019 \u2013 meaning that drugs and alcohol abuse are occurring at the same time as the psychological symptoms that lead a professional to diagnose schizophrenia. I bid you welcome to the first reason schizophrenia is a death sentence: 0.216% of the American population died from overdoses from 1999-2017 (with a noticeable trend upwards in deaths/year). Given that 9.4% of the population reported using illicit drugs in the last month: Americans: 300 000 000 Drug abusers: 28 200 000 (9.4%) Deaths / 18 years: 648 000 (0.216%) Deaths / abusers: 2.3% Abusers / schizophrenics: 50% Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%) Abusers that are schizophrenics: 2 500 000 (0.75%) Deaths / abusers that are schizophrenics: 57 500 (1.15% of # schizophrenic) Deaths schizophrenics / deaths abusers: 8.88% 8.88/2.3: you are 3.86 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average drug abuser if you\u2019re schizophrenic. 1.15/0.216: you are 5.32 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average person if you\u2019re schizophrenic. Suicides The suicide rate for Americans is 0.014% when \u2018adjusted.\u2019 The \u2018lifetime risk of suicide\u2019 for people with schizophrenia is 4.9%. Americans: 300 000 000 Suicides: 4 200 000 (0.014%) Suicides / schizophrenics: 4.9% Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%) Suicides that are schizophrenics: 245 000 (0.08%) 4.9/0.014: you are 350 times as likely to die from suicide than the average person if you\u2019re schizophrenic. I\u2019ll let the numbers speak for themselves in this section. Smoking Cigarettes According to the CDC, 34 000 000 Americans smoke. 90% of schizophrenics smoke. 67% of smokers die from smoking, 474500 a year. Excuse the changing numbers here, in the previous calculation the 1.5% of schizophrenics was from the stat \u2013 and in this second calculation it\u2019s divided into my guesstimation of total Americans, so 1.666%. Americans: 300 000 000 Smokers: 34 000 000 (11.33%) Smokers that die from smoking: 387600 (0.1292%) Deaths / smokers: 1.14% Deaths / population: 2 193 000 (0.731%) Dead smokers / deaths: 17.67% Smokers / schizophrenics: 90% Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.666%) Smokers that are schizophrenics: 4 500 000 (1.5%) Smokers that are schizophrenics that die: 63 000 Deaths schizophrenic smokers: 1.26% You are 11% more likely to die if you smoke while schizophrenic than the average smoker. You are 1.72x as likely to die in a given year if you smoke while schizophrenic than the average population. Research 0.856 billion is spent on HIV/AIDS efforts a year, affecting 1.1 million Americans and 26 000 Americans die from HIV/AIDS each year. $147 000 000 000 is spent on cancer research a year and 609 000 Americans will die from cancer every year \u2013 38.4% of people will or have had or do have cancer. $74.65 is spent on research per person diagnosed with schizophrenia, $788.70 for HIV/AIDS per person and $1276.04 for cancer per person. Seems a bit strange, no? ",
