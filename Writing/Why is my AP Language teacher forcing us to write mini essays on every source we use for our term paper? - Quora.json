            "answer_text": "Hi, Sagan. I\u2019m flattered by your question. Before we get to your question: looking at your little photo: is that a selfie or what? Just kidding. Okay, your question. I am at a bit of a disadvantage. I tried to read your AP Language teacher\u2019s mind, but she /he did not come through clearly. So, I\u2019m afraid, between the two of us we shall have to figure it out for ourselves. I don\u2019t really know where to begin, but in this modern day and age I\u2019ve heard it said that that is no excuse. So, we\u2019re left to ourselves. First of all, I must confess, I don\u2019t really know what an AP Language class is. (I presume it is a class, because your teacher has the authority to make you do something you don\u2019t understand and further, I presume again, you don\u2019t like, because why else would you ask this question. Only jailers and teachers possess those kind of authority.) Okay, we now know it is a class. I\u2019m not necessary as dumb as the \u2018Dumb Blond\u2019 for not knowing, but I am from South Africa and we do not have AP Languages out here. So, we\u2019ve overcome that obstacle to reason this out. Right? Next. Let\u2019s find the next clue. Your teacher makes you write mini essays. Another new one. I\u2019ve never heard of mini essays. I one hundred percent know what an essay is. I can give you a lecture on that, you know. I\u2019m really good at it, me being a writer of sorts. A mini essay sounds like a little essay, but I\u2019ve never heard of that, as well. So, let\u2019s try a synonym. You know what as synonym is, don\u2019t you? I can\u2019t see you, so I assume again that you are not a hundred per cent sure. A synonym is a different word with more or less the same meaning. This is where a synonym comes in handy. One that comes to mind is your \u2018mini\u2019. So, I would say \u2018little\u2019 says it is a \u2018mini\u2019 essay. After all that grammar, all you need to know is that no matter whether an essay is a \u2018mini\u2019 or a long essay. It is still an essay. Essay is an essay and that you know well. Seeing that this teacher makes you write essays all the time. Why? Because, seeing that AP refers to a language it seems to me that it is an essay in a language. So, now, I am not a genius so I looked up what this AP Language is. I found that it is an AP English Language and Composition course. I also read that \u2018The AP English Language and Composition course is designed to help you become a skilled reader of a variety of texts as well as becoming a skilled writer. ... Using research materials and synthesizing information from various sources are integral parts of the AP English Language and Composition course.\u2019 That, my friend speaks for itself. It is part of educating yourself. (See between the lines why) I\u2019m sure there are a few other courses that you easily hate as much as, well, maybe not as much, as writing mini essays. Still, you have to do them for some or other reason you will not know unless your teacher tells you what the reason is. My heart goes out to you. I once were where you are now in your life. You know what? I survived. Who knows possibly you can get hooked on writing. Give it a go. I did. Go well, my friend. Don\u2019t give up you wouldn\u2019t like to be a loser. Write those darn essays. I\u2019d love to take a photo of you when you win some prize for writing something. Bye for now. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t want to second-guess your AP teacher but I can think of a couple of possibilities. One is to give you more practice at writing. And the second is more important. In today\u2019s world a lot of people don\u2019t take in information critically. In other words, they trust that everything they read or hear is accurate. By asking you to write a mini-essay on your sources, I would imagine your teacher is trying to assess both your research skills (are you using primary sources that are reliable?) and your ability to synthesize information correctly. As an example, years ago in a history class I read a text on witchcraft. The author was a historian who wrote for the popular market. I read the bibliography and checked one of the source books she\u2019d used. She had pulled some information from the primary source out of context and it changed the meaning. That was the last book I ever read from that author. And after having spent more than 20 years in mainstream print media, I hammered into my reporters to check their sources. We could only run facts and information that was a matter of public record, but could ask some witnesses what they saw or heard, first hand. Always check sources on things you read or hear. ",
