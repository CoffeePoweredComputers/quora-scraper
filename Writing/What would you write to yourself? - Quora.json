            "answer_text": "Dear Little Perry, By the time you get this letter you\u2019ll either be in your suicidal phase, or your depression phase. But I just want you to know something. Even though your struggling, and everything sucks, and you get bullied think positively. As mom would say: \u201cThere just jealous of you\u201d so calm your ass down and don\u2019t do it. Now you're probably thinking \u201cThey won\u2019t know, only one person knows\u201d well that one person will eventually call the cops to your house. Then you\u2019ll go to a mental hospital, where their going to ask you all sorts of questions, and then make you leave. And even if you did do it, do you think of what you\u2019d do to Melanie? She\u2019s depressed too, but you killing yourself might just end her life as well. She\u2019s your only best friends, your her only boy best friend who\u2019s actually there for her. So you ending your life is a big no-no, and plus next year you\u2019ll be considered a bit cooler than now. And sure you\u2019ll probably not believe that but believe it, because I currently am loving my life and don\u2019t want to disappear because you killed me. Or is it because I killed me? Either way don\u2019t do it. Anyways I think this letter is pretty long, don\u2019t you? My fingers are getting tired and I have to finish my homework for online classes. It feels good to know that you\u2019ll get this letter and you\u2019ll stop all this suicidal non-sense. Your Greatest Friend, Yourself ",
