            "answer_text": "I earn around 800 USD a month writing 2\u20133 chapters a day on that platform. (2\u20133 chapters is barely 2 hours work a day) You can make nice bucks if you know how the website works. But you will have to hand over your copyright, so yeah. So unless if you believe that you are one of a few authors whose novels would be adapted into movies, anime, or whatever (Mind you, they are only a few and a fair number of authors are under the assumption that their work is a masterpiece and people are empty-headed to prefer \u2018crap\u2019 over their novels) I will advise you not to sign. (Cause you know, if someone decides to adapt your novel, you won\u2019t have a say as the company owns the copyright.) Otherwise, if you want to earn money from your hobby, you are great to go. You can also self-publish on amazon and keep the copyright but that will require a lot of effort (Editors, covers, and marketing. - You will have to study all and it's really a pain. Webnovel platform gets you the readers and there is no high demand for grammar so yeah) In the end, the choice is yours. As of rest, the site is legit, held by Tencent (You can find them on Wikipedia) They will give you what the contract states. Ready carefully and sign only if you are certain of what you are getting into. I don\u2019t like people screaming they are a scam. They are not. The contract states you will hand over the copyright. It\u2019s your choice, take or leave. No one is forcing it down your throat. ",

            "answer_text": "i got this message just today on wattpad. i'm not doing it. first, i saw that the word 'offer' had been glitched out, which not only can change the meaning of the contract, it can also be used as a valid defense on their case if you decided to bring them to court on the fact that what they did went against the contract you signed. furthermore, the site holds a series of translated stories rather than original writings, and upon more research on the site, i've seen a series of stolen and plagiarized content from other fanfiction websites, primarily wattpad, ao3, and tumblr. i decided to contact a different wattpad author and ask if they had received a message similar to this, and when they confirmed it, i compared the messages and they were exactly the same, besides for the insert of our usernames. this shows that the website, or this 'author liaison representative' did not, in fact, read my story or their story, which proves that they have no interest in the story itself, rather they have interest in getting more content on their website, and taking content from wattpad and other big fanfiction networks. i'd advise you not to sign this contract, as you'll probably come to regret it.
