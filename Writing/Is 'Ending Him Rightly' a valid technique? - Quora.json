            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at the context first and foremost. Judicial duelling with a preset of rules. As it seems closed helmets were a must. Now with closed helms you don\u2019t really see small movements that your opponent is doing. And throwing the pommel aka End him rightly (which is actually quickly in the original text) suddenly becomes a valid technique IF your sword is constructed in such a way that the pommel is removable by screwing it off (which is very rare) It won\u2019t kill, it won\u2019t maim, but it will disorient your opponent for that 1-2 tempo worth of time to rush him down and murder the hell out of him with the weapons you have at hand.  \u201cNote the twelfth play. If you want to end him quickly, hold your spear and sword together on your arm, unscrew the pommel of your sword and throw it at him vigorously. Close in with the throw and use your sword or spear, whatever suits you best. When he throws his pommel at you, keep your buckler close to you and watch out for the throw. Hold your spear in your right hand and prepare to thrust, to stop him from closing in if it is his intention.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Of course not. Imagine this :You\u2019re in the middle of a fight and suddenly your opponent completely drops his guard and starts unscrewing the pommel of his sword for several seconds! By the time he\u2019s done unscrewing it you should have stabbed a good dozen times and if you didn\u2019t\u2026 wtf were you doing? Taking a 5 minute nap? Now pretend the guy has managed to unscrew his pommel and throws it at you do you Crawl in a ball and let him hit you as many times as he wants?Use your basic training to not flinch at a small iron ball being thrown in your direction.Supposing you can\u2019t avoid flinching, retreat and keep the distance.Now the guy has a sword with a loose grip which just puts him at a disadvantage. Of course that\u2019s if the guy is unarmoured. And to add a layer to the whole nonsense the illustration represents them both armoured meaning the guy at which the pommel is thrown has not the slightest reason to flinch. ",
