            "answer_text": "Nobody has \u201can opinion\u201d about the Oxford comma. You use it (or omit it) depending on the policy of the company you\u2019re writing for. If you\u2019re writing on your own, it\u2019s your choice. My husband has been writing for a newspaper for the past 22 years. I type all his columns. I omit the Oxford comma because newspapers don\u2019t use it. On the other hand, I write books - and most publishers want the Oxford comma. I use it when I type my own manuscripts. That\u2019s what professional writers do. They adjust their practices according to the situation. They don\u2019t have a \u201cposition\u201d about it that they feel obliged to \u201cdefend.\u201d ",
