The problem with quota is that it's built like a social media site, in the sense that you speak how you talk, not how you write. Despite what many teachers tell you, these two should not be the same thing. How you speak is one form of writing, as how you write is another, no one speaks in the way Hemingway wrote, nor Fitzgerald, it's an artform within itself ",
