            "answer_text": "This, my friend, is classic writer's block. Everyone who writes goes through this, so you're not alone.  First of all, understand that \"writer\" is not an identity, it's a role. A human being is a writer only while performing the act of writing.  So write. It doesn't matter if what you write is genius or literary or whether publishers or agents will like it, and it especially doesn't matter whether it's good. Just sit down in front of a blank page or screen and start writing. If you can't think of anything, write, \"I can't think of anything.\" Narrate your thoughts, describe your breakfast, transcribe the ingredients on your shampoo bottle, whatever. Write. Don't expect anything of yourself other than that you will put black ink on a white page. Do that for one minute today, two tomorrow, and so on, building up your stamina until you have a regular, daily practice.  Commit, and be patient. You'll probably never have an \"a-ha!\" moment when you finally feel like a writer, you can be sure you've \"arrived\" and are certain you have finally overcome your writer's block once and for all. The sky will not open and the Muse will not descend holding a shimmering cup in each of her thirteen bejeweled arms, all of them runnething over with Genius Original Ideas.  This is what will happen: A month or six or twelve from today, you'll sit down in front of your typewriter/notebook/computer and realize that you are the same person you always have been, but now, your day just doesn't seem right anymore unless you get a few hundred words out. This will feel kind of neat. Then you'll forget about it, because there's a blank page in front of you, and then you'll write something, because that's what you do. ",
