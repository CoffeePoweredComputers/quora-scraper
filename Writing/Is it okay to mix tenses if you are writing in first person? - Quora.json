            "answer_text": "No. But sometimes. But mostly no. The other answer is correct. People think in present tense, so you can always put thoughts is present tense, like so: I'm gonna die, Joe thought. Goddammit, I'm gonna die! \u2018I'm\u2019 is present tense. \u2018Thought\u2019 is past. But in your mind, you hardly say I was going to die. Thats just not what people do. But. But, for the love of god, do not mix narration tenses. They are looking at their actions either from the future or from the present, not both. They are Katniss, narrating the Hunger Games as they happen, or they are Kvothe, looking at events from long ago. If you want two distinct time periods, then you can switch it up, but only within the limits of those times. For example. Now I am here. But it was a long road, a rough road. Let me tell you about my birth. No. Too long ago. Let me tell you about my childhood. I was a poor kid from a poor home . . . Two times. Now and the past. Everything you experience now is current, present, happening. Use \u2018I am.\u2019 In the past, it already happened. Use \u2018I was.\u2019 If you're asking this question, stick with one tense. I assume you don't know when your character is speaking from, so don't make it too elaborate in the first draft. One tense and one tense only. You can add others later. There is nothing that annoys me more than a tense that changes while I read. Except perhaps comma splices. Just don't do it. Please. Thank you. ",

All of the actions are written in past tense and all of his thoughts are written in present tense. Here is an excerpt from chapter 6 Empty Inside to show you how I combine the two tenses.  I put some warm water on my face and ran the blade across my face. It took awhile but all the facial hair was gone. I took the comb and tried to decide what to do with my hair. I ran the comb through my hair and styled it back, and felt something familiar tugging at my mind. Maybe now that I had cleaned up\u2026 maybe I could remember who I was. I looked into the mirror and stared at the reflection \u201cMy name is\u2026okay let\u2019s try this again my name\u201d I curled my fists. \u201cMy name is! Dammit come on\u2026\u201d I gritted my teeth \u201cMy name is\u201d I felt tears well up and I hit the wall \u201cCome on Dammit! My name is\u2026\u201d I stared back at my reflection and I couldn\u2019t take it \u201cMy name is\u2026 My name is\u2026\u201d My throat got drier and the tears ran down my face, \u201cMy name\u2026\u201d I sighed \u201cMy\u2026 my\u2026I\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Why can\u2019t I know? Please, someone help me. I feel so alone, this is worse than everything that\u2019s happened so far, I thought a shave would help me remember. When I first cried it was because I was angry that I didn\u2019t know who I was, then I cried because I was afraid of what I might be, but this...I\u2019m broken. This pain is so much worse, it\u2019s not like any of the wounds before, I\u2019m a shell. I\u2019m nothing. I walked to the bed and fell down on it, I couldn\u2019t handle this; this is hell. Hell isn\u2019t physical pain, it\u2019s an emptiness inside that starts to consume you. God, could someone please tell me who I am. ",
