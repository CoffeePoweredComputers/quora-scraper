            "answer_text": "The answer depends greatly on what is meant by \"a new language\". For most languages of the world, we do not know their history. For those we know, and this includes the largest languages in the world today, most are only a few centuries old. The English of the Middle Ages, for instance, would not be immediately understandable to a modern English-speaker, but we still refer to it as English. The languages of Scandinavia have a common ancestor in old Norse; here we use a different word because the borders of the nations were rather fluid at the time, but strictly speaking there were two main branches of Norse, one eastern and one western. It is a bit of an accident that western Norse is not called Old Norwegian in the same way as with English; so you may say that whether a language is \"new\" often depends on the person who writes the history of the language. But there are times when a population abandons the language of their ancestors and starts speaking a different language that is not descended from the old language of the population. Perhaps this is what is meant by \"a new language\"? This happens with alarming regularity today and results from mass media of the nation state. In the lifetime of those born today, hundreds if not thousands of the world's languages will die out, unless some enormous force is set in movement to preserve them. This fate has already befallen hundreds of other languages, albeit fairly recently. In the past, a similar thing happened when a \"civilized\" nation or empire spread across \"tribal\" areas. The language of the ruling people gradually replaced that of the smaller and less organized groups they conquered. This was particularly true when there was a difference in the level of technology and sophistication, where the conquering people was considered civilized and the conquered people were seen as barbarians. In the opposite case, where the barbarians invaded a civilization, it was usually the invaders that gave up their language. This happened to the Germanic invaders of the Roman empire, and the Mongol invasion in China did not replace the Chinese language either (although this is a bit of a different case as the Chinese language is more of a written convention than a spoken one.) If by \"new language\" we mean one that has never existed before, this happens when two languages of roughly equal standing meet and a trade language (pidgin) or mixed language (creol language) is created. Historically however it is not very common that the new language replaces any of the existing ones. Creolization may have played a role in forming the Romance languages, the European languages descended from Latin. But for the most part the splitting of Latin into modern Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, French and so on is probably analogous to that of Scandinavia, as the formation of nation-states have consolidated language within each nation at the cost of common understanding between nations.

            "answer_text": "in the vast majoritty of  cases, it hasn't worked that way. it's not that a new language is created and then people start using it, it's that two groups speaking the same root language get geographically or culturally separated and their language evolves in different directions until they are distinct.  The exceptions would be invented languages like Esperanto or Klingon. The latter has grown as a language because people thinkit's cool ",
