            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming that you are an instructor. I was; mine have done well on their semester projects because of the way I handle them. Does the research project count at least 25% of the term grade? Then get the students started early in the semester, no later than the third or fourth week of a fifteen-to sixteen-week term, even sooner if the term is shorter. It\u2019s difficult for even experienced researchers to find and use good, scholarly resources if the project is a two-week discrete unit. Give some freedom about the topic; I would have mine select a problem that\u2019s important to them, perhaps something in their major (concentration). Have them write a proposal early on that you need to approve. I\u2019ll volley suggestions to particular students, but it\u2019s their choice. A topic that\u2019s important to the student keeps interest. Next, about two weeks later during a regular length term, is a working bibliography. This is a list of possible resources that the student believes might be good leads about the chosen topic. Check that these are good, scholarly resources, and go on. Then, about two weeks after that, I require an outline. How does the student plan to organize his/her paper, and how will he/she do this? Next, in about another two weeks, is a good draft, nearly to final copy stage with all citations done according to the required style manual. At the end of the term, the students present their projects orally to the class and hand in the final copy of their papers. Handling the project in this manner has resulted in good projects and little to no plagiarism. ",
