            "answer_text": "Not by Republican standards. Nearly all his work experience has been in government, which is worthless according to them. He has no business experience, which is how to run a government\u2014just like a business, for personal profit, like the Republicans\u2019 choice does. Sanders has no experience conning people out of their money\u2014bankers, investors, employees, suppliers, contractors, and customers, unlike the Republicans\u2019 Man of the Hour. He isn\u2019t a real man, because he doesn\u2019t have over sixty women accusing him of sexually assaulting and/or harassing them (and then bragging about it), unlike the Republicans\u2019 choice. He doesn\u2019t realize that people are only poor because they\u2019re lazy; that Mexicans are rapists; that you should never rent an apartment to a black family; that chain immigration is evil and close to treason (unless it\u2019s your latest wife\u2019s family of course); that the press (other than Fox \u201cNews\u201d, Breitbart and such) is evil and unamerican and lies all the time\u2014as proven by their claiming that Trump lies all the time, and then showing communist things like \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cvideos\u201d of what he said to prove it). He\u2019s never been repeatedly bailed out by his dad because his business ventures have a habit of going bankrupt, and then being bailed out by the Russian mob\u2014so he also doesn\u2019t understand the Art of the Deal (i.e. have a rich dad and crooked business associates who need a money launderer who asks no inconvenient questions). So by Republican standards, Sanders doesn\u2019t have what they\u2019re looking for. But fear not. He isn\u2019t going to be the Democratic nominee anyway, so his qualifications-or lack of them\u2014are irrelevant. And the guy who will be the Democratic nominee is infinitely more qualified than the other party\u2019s candidate, by experience, by temperament, and by sheer human decency.  ",

            "answer_text": "See, here\u2019s one of the things about America, in its politics, qualifications don\u2019t matter. As long as you fulfill the minuscule constitutional requirement to be President, if you can get elected, you are qualified according to the system. Note that the other answerer\u2019s statements about him being a socialist is not an answer about his qualifications, merely their opinions of his opinions. Do not be duped into conflating the two. Ah but I get what you\u2019re asking, has Sanders got the base of knowledge that might enable him to be successful in office? Well lets see, he\u2019s been in Congress for decades, in politics for longer, was a marcher for Civil Rights and against the imperialist butchering of Vietnam in the 60s and 70s, has a decades long reputation for integrity in Vermont and one of the highest name recognitions of any serving politician nationally. He\u2019s also pretty much single-handedly shifted the window of acceptable political discussion in the US further to the left, enabling open discussion of some things that would be almost unthinkable before. He probably forgets more about how Congress and law-making work then most people will ever learn. I\u2019d wager he\u2019s more qualified then most members of the current establishment, including the current President. That won\u2019t stop the smear campaign which answers questions like this with irrelevant attacks on his character like some other answers on this side, but that was going to happen anyway. ",
