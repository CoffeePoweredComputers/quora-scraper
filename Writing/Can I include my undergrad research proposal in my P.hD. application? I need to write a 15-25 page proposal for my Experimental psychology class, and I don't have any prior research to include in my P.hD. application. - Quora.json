            "answer_text": "This is a question with many inherent flaws. If you are really applying for a Ph.D. program, you need a research proposal worthy of, and appropriate for, that level of research. It should be uniquely considered and written with that in mind, and, as such, I sincerely doubt that an undergraduate research proposal would suffice. I am not certain why you are even talking about using a proposal that you might be required to write for an undergraduate experimental psychology class. That\u2019s one psychology class out of many required for an undergraduate psychology degree. You\u2019ve got a long way to go and a lot to learn before you are ready for graduate level work. You are talking about writing a Ph.D. research proposal and that, in and of itself, does not need to include or reference any prior research that you might have done. It is literally what you are proposing to research in a Ph.D. program, not a summary or description of what you have already done. In addition, if you want to be taken seriously when you use the abbreviation Ph.D., you need to know where the periods go. It is not ever written P.hD., it is written either Ph.D. or PhD. The Ph part is short for Philosophy and the D part is short for Doctor. It is Doctor of Philosophy, from the Latin, philosophiae doctor or doctor philosophiae. ",
