            "answer_text": "Grandfather , a person who would always see you as his own child because he would always want to raise you as he raised his own son, probably make up for all the mischievous things my father did so that I as his grandson won't fall into those . My grandfather, Sh. Som Nath Gupta is a very known and reputed person among the community and relatives as he was a business tycoon and would help every one and other that would cross in his life. He married early and had 5 kids , the eldest one being my father makes me the eldest in my generation in my family too. So as a first of my generation everyone in the joint family would treat me as their own and as their prince who would take the throne :p My father on the other hand was very bossy in his teenage and ruled among his siblings, almost parented them. He was a bit of a brat and as a 70\u2019s kid would go , he loved literature and all the glam things , even had a offer of marriage from a pen friend he made in England in his adult life. Declined because she wanted him to leave his family and come off to England. ( Imagine my birth taken away by a British woman ) . As my family tells me I was very pampered by my grandfather , he would always want to spend time with me even if I was the one who would piss in his clothes whenever I wished ( as a kid , comon) . I could sense that growing up but he went to US around the time I was 6 or 7 and got citizenship there and spent most of the time in USA. Whenever he used to come , he would bring me sacks full of toys and American chocolates and chips ( probably why my cheeks are half a kg each ) and I would be a jolly good fellow for months. As I started off my schooling , he would get up early morning to wake my mom up and then me to get ready for the morning drill. He would bathe me , would help me dress up and would bless me for a good day. It's amazing how a person devotes his life to raise another life as good as it can be. I always looked up to him more than my own father ,not that I wasn't fond of my own father but something about my grandfather would give me Inspiration to do everything. I flunked badly in my entrance examination for engineering and I remember he was very upset while my father was very angry. He came up to me and said \u201cI know this is not the end but I want you to know that it is this point from where you become a real man, how you take your own failures ! \u201d. It got me pretty hard and I went into a college and got a job at Infosys and did pretty well for myself and he would ask me everytime that how am I earning or did I get a promotion. Always thinking and worried about me even when he got his own medical problems. I felt so comfortable and humbled by him that I had my first drink with him in his room and he cheered me with his scotch and said that \u201cIt's you that I am hoping will keep my name alive\u201d and it resonates in my mind all the time. That's me and him , me owning his hug .  18th June , 2020 just two days after his 84th birthday , he left this world after fighting cancer for a year and I just felt that warmth of his hug gone that was always somehow holding me tight. I couldn't watch him fighting for every breath in his last hours on video call as he was in US and I just couldn't go to him because of the ban on international flights by government due to covid-19 crisis. He was a man of a great rapport, great will power and a flawless heart that I am going to miss for rest of my life. I just promised to myself that very second that I would make his name proud, his family proud and never let his name down. I know I didn't justify much to the particular question but I hope I did ignite some love and some thoughts in you for your grandparents . Just sit by them , talk to them , trust me , that's all they want. Thank you for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "Raj found an old box while cleaning his home. He opened thar box and found a toy. It was his childhood's favorite toy which he got from his dad even though his mother wasn't in favor as the toy was costly. Raj cleaned that toy and travelled through his childhood without any ticket. Many memories got refreshed. A smile appeared on his face. Just that time, his one year old son hit him with baby walker. Raj gave his favorite toy to his new favorite toy. Raj's son Meeraj smiled when he received the toy. He started playing with it. When Raj's wife Meera noticed that toy in Meeraj's hand, she asked, \"Raj, when did you bring this toy for Meeraj?\" Raj looked at his late father's photograph smilingly and answered, \"I didn't , Meeraj's grandfather did.\" Parents left us on their time, but not their blessings & memories.
