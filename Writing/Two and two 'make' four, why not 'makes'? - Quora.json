            "answer_text": "It can be either make or makes, and depends entirely on usage in a specific dialect/location. It would be unusual to hear either in British English, where you would more usually hear Two and two is four. The reason for the singular usage is generally that the phrase is a contraction of a longer phrase: (The sum of) two and two is four. Sum is singular, so the singular was retained when the phrase was truncated. ",
