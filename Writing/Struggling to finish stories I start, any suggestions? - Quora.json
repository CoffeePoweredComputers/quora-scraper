            "answer_text": "First, understand that getting through the middle of the story is hard. Then, get comfortable with the idea of writing the boring stuff in order to get to the good stuff. Get comfortable with writing badly and fixing it in revisions. Stories don\u2019t \u2018read\u2019 like well-written stories while you\u2019re writing them. If you just want to read good stories, read the ones someone else has sweated over and reworked :) Next, think about why you\u2019re becoming bored. Do you know your characters? Are they interesting to you? If not, do some deep-diving character analysis. We\u2019re only going to care that they take that risk, if we know WHY it\u2019s a risk to them, specifically. We need to know why it matters to them. Or perhaps you\u2019re bored because you\u2019re using storylines you\u2019ve heard a million times before. Think about taking a trope (like, the bad guy killed the hero\u2019s father) and turning it only its head (like, nope the bad guy IS the hero\u2019s father). That can make for a much more psychologically complex and interesting story. Think about what annoys you in other people\u2019s sci-fi and high fantasy stories. Why does no one ever use the bathroom? Why do wounds never become infected? Whatever it is, if it annoys you, write a scene where that happens. Another thing to consider is that you might be trying to write novels but calling them short stories. Short stories revolve around one incident, one moment, one big badaboom. You can\u2019t have a lot of characters. You can\u2019t tell a lot of backstory. You have to weave hints of the life-outside-this-incident into the story, but you can\u2019t go off on a tangent, explaining the history of Hyr-Arund\u2019l and its ten kingdoms\u2026Choose your cultural references carefully and write the story of the people in the moment your story takes place. And always, always be thinking about conflict. This goes back to the \u2018know your characters\u2019 part. Conflict isn\u2019t a big battle scene. Conflict is battling someone you love, or for something you care about in a very personal way. Keep writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing is hard work. I\u2019m a published poet and write marketing materials for a living, but also struggle with keeping my novels going. A couple of thoughts. If you are stopped at a point in your story or novel because of boredom, perhaps your reader would also be bored. Objectively look at the plot and see how you might change it to add more action, more conflict, more surprises. Something has to happen. It is the main character\u2019s challenges that make the story interesting. These obstacles to the protagonist\u2019s goal(s) can be from the lead character himself/herself, (think Catcher in the Rye where Holden\u2019s mourning over his brother\u2019s death is preventing him from being successful at college); from life throwing crap at the character (think The Odyssey where Odysseus battles Posieden and mystical creatures in his 10-year journey to return to his wife Penelope); or from the antagonist\u2014the person or people actively opposing the main character\u2014(think Harry Potter and all those who tried to foil him: Lord Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, Gellert Grindelwald, etc.) And ultimately, you have to stick with it\u2014keep working, keep writing, keep reading, keep learning about the craft. In a great TedTalks, Julian Griedmann says to velcro your butt in your chair and have your character take the \u201cpath of most residence.\u201d Watch his talk called \u201cThe Mystery of Storytelling\u201d and view other TedTalks on writing and creativity. Read books in your genre and take apart why they work or don\u2019t work. Go to writer\u2019s conferences. Read writer\u2019s magazines and blogs. Continually learn about the art of writing There\u2019s no magic formula. Hey, if I had all the answers I\u2019d be a NY times best selling author! All I can tell you is that it takes tremendous dedication and effort to write a book. Writing my first historical novel took me years and was the hardest single project I\u2019ve ever done. But I learned a lot and there\u2019s a sense of satisfaction in actually completing a novel. (Even if I haven\u2019t sold it yet.) So take a seat, take a fresh look at your story and imagine what could happen next. ",
