            "answer_text": "The pre Columbian Maya had a logographic writing system so sophisticated that scribes at each city state could record names, the birth and deaths of important people, marriages, wars, battles won, prisoners taken, prisoners sacrificed, changes in dynasties, visits of rulers of one city to another, words for animals, detailed stories about the creation of their world and the role of gods. Also dates, down things like \u201c5 days later it happened\u201d.. And religious blood letting ceremon\u00edes by a ruler or his wife. One of which was piercing by a ruler of his own tongue . Self piercing of other even more sensitive parts of the body in blood letting ceremon\u00edes is also recorded , but let\u2019s skip those details here. Most preserved Mayan writing is carved in stone. Some is painted on walls or sides of caves that were sealed in such a way that the writing was protected from damage by humidity for over a 1000 years. A few books of Mayan writing were preserved\u2026 Something of interest which just occurred to me, is that there no hint of accounting records, things like tax records, inventor\u00edes, etc. Now that mundane stuff isn't going on a ruler\u2019s moments, but \u2026 Maybe in the thouands of bark paper books that were left to rot after the Classical Mayan city state system was replaced by smaller, illiterate states? Maybe they used a completely different recording system for accounting? Miztec and Zapotec peoples in what is now Oaxaca Mexico also had writing, some of which has been preserved, but I know little, er read \u201cnothing\u201d, about current understanding of those writing sytems.

            "answer_text": "Some people who were living in the Americas had writing systems. Most did not. There writing systems were associated with dominant imperial sort of cultures. The smaller cultures near them often did not have them. As to \u201cwhy?\u201d the answer is that writing systems are rare in human existence, even today. In the Americans the center for written language was in Mesoamerica. They had bigger cultures there a little later and thus writing came about 650 BC. It did not have time to spread to the rest of the Americas. This is not so different from the fact that Finnish did not have a writing system until 1548. Estonian came from that and was even later. For most of human existence people have not had writing or scripts. Literacy is a new phenomena relative to the 200,000 to 300,000 years anatomically modern humans have been around. All humans have language. Not all humans have writing. Most do not. Only about 2% of human existence has had any writing. It is not \u201cnatural\u201d to humanity. For all the history of humans, most people in most times did not read or write. Most languages have never had a writing system. Even in Europe, for example, writings in Estonian did not became significant until the 19th century. There are about 7,000 living languages today. About 3,982 have a developed writing system. The rest have none. But most of those are in theory only. The scripts for about half of those were developed by anthropologists or missionaries or others in the 150 years and are not taught in schools. The vast majority of writing systems are descended from 4 systems. Those are Egyptian, Sumerian, Chinese, and Mesoamerican. All modern systems are descended from the first three. The first of those writing system was 5000 years ago. They only really got going around 3000 years ago. It was only used by scribes. It was only used by a very small culture relative to the whole world. Humans have been around for at least 200,000 years. It seems that the idea of writing is very hard. Given the example of the idea of writing some places have made their own without using another system. There were several writing systems in North America (Mexico is part of North America). The most sophisticated ones were also all descended from one source just like all the ones in Europe are from one source. It was more difficult for ideas to travel from Mesoamerica to North or South America because of the way the geography and ecosystems work. Still even from the first writing systems in Sumer, it took until the second century, which was 3100 years later, for a orthography to be developed in Northern Europe. That is only about 4000 miles over land. In 1500 at first contact with America, very few people in Europe could write or read. The numbers of literate was about 5% . In the rest of Europe there were similar numbers, ranging from 1% in Sweden to a high of 17% in Netherlands. Our World In Data  Reading and writing are artifacts of large city states or empires and mostly industrial societies. In places where these existed in North America they had writing. Even in the early 1800 most people in England could not read or write and were not creating written records. It was only people who ran the large Empire who could read. In 1800 40% of people could not even sign their own marriage documents. So, my point is that the reason there was no writing in most of the Americas, is that it is historically rare, there were not enough large societies who needed it and it takes time to spread and there was not enough time.

The Cherokee founded a news paper, the Cherokee Phoenix in Georgia, they printed in English and Cherokee side by side. I found an archive of it and was surprised at how well written it was. Mayans had a complex written language but the catholic priests destroyed most all except for a few manuscripts found hidden in a church. Their pyramids are full of glyphs which were finallly deciphered by a teenage boy. Their creation story and some of their beliefs are all that is left of their writings. Before Columbus North America had great cities all along the rivers known only as mound builders. It is a mystery who they were since they disappeared after first contact, Hernando de Soto and his army marched up Florida into Georgia in 1540 looking for gold and land. Some of the only written history about the people living here in North America before Columbus are from his troups and a french man named Jacques la Moynes. Untold numbers of people vanished between then and 150 years (approximately) later when settlers arrived. It is believed that diseases spread out and killed up to 90% of the pupulation. No written records but there were scams and lies about the empty mounds. I wish an effort to find the truth about mound builders would be funded by our Gov\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "In many so-called 'indigenous' cultures, preservation and handing on of knowledge was a critical function entrusted to those who had a shamanic or priestly role. There were also 'levels' of knowledge which separated 'functional' aspects such as hunting, fishing, food cultivation and gathering, phases of the moon and seasons etc. and higher level, esoteric knowledge such as genealogy and history, priestly arts, divination, astronomy etc. Also, there was great emphasis on committing all to memory accurately and so, other than mnemonic aids, there was no need for it to be recorded in written form. While where it did not exist, writing might well have developed eventually as part of cultural 'progress' and needs, we need to think about these different motivations. There is also the aspect that where something is written down, it becomes accessible to all without any constraints which might have applied previously. Another aspect of these levels of knowledge also is the specialised differentiation between roles: warriors; builders; canoe makers; weapons makers etc. In M\u0101ori priestly learning, for example, even following the development of an alphabet for writing M\u0101ori, these things in many instances have never been written down.

            "answer_text": "Depends on how you mean \"written\" and what Native group at what point in time you're thinking of. Inscription technologies are vast and variable. As some have already mentioned, technologies such as wampum or quipu can be considered writing, just not the kind developed by European and Asian groups. Pictographs and ledger drawings could also be considered writing in a sense and ledger drawings are records of specific events. Many purely indigenous American writing systems, of course, don't work with the same articulation as alphabets or syllabaries, two kinds of systems that appear to have been imported. Mayan and Incan writing works by logography, similar to hieroglyphics, though Guaman Poma wrote a codex in 1615 that mixed several types of inscriptive systems. So, a lot depends on how closely you think writing matches the Euro-Asian technologies of ink on parchment or paper and at what point in time you're examining indigenous people of the Americas. There are certainly material records that people kept and shared to maintain social cohesion and control, they just don't always look like what is considered typical writing. ",

And yes, several did have excellent and profuse written records. However, much of this was destroyed by Spanish missionaries out of prejudice and ignorance.  However, if you only consider \"Native Americans to be those living in the United States, the Iroquois had a form of writing symbols used on what they called a wampum belt. And Sequoyia created an original written alphabet for the Ani Yun Wiya (Cherokee). One could easily consider the many forms of petroglyphs and even images painted on leather by many Native Americans as a form of written record as well. ",

Among some of the northern plains tribes, the winter of 1804-5 was known as \"the year the black man froze his private parts,\" referring to the slave York getting frostbite on his penis that winter. These tales were told orally, with the pictographs on the hide serving as mnemonic devices. So I have to equivocate on the answer. Most records were kept by sedentary cultures. Most North American natives didn't live in sedentary cultures, and writing as such never developed. So I'd have to say that they didn't develop writing and so didn't keep records, largely because they were generally mobile and dependant on animal and human power to carry things. ",
