            "answer_text": "Most audiobooks are narrated by just one person, and depending on the style of narration, one person may be all you need. That said, narrators need to be able to read in different voices depending on the kind of narration they are performing. Being able to differentiate one\u2019s voice and separate characters in an audiobook recording session is a real skill. Within solo narration, there are several different ways that a narrator can give voice to an audiobook, being: Fully Voiced Reading (narrator\u2019s voice as well as distinct character voices for all characters in the book - think Jim Dale narrating the Harry Potter series)Partially Voiced Reading (narrator\u2019s voice and select, distinct character voices - more along the lines of Stephen Fry narrating Harry Potter)Unvoiced Reading (narrator comes across more naturally, no characterization involved - your favorite business book, perhaps)Some books are narrated by multiple readers. This is true in full cast productions as well as multi-voiced productions. When you listen to a great narrator reading a fully voiced production, it can sound like there is more than one voice artist involved. Cost and logistics may be factors for why some books are narrated solo, however, stylistic considerations are more likely to determine why an audiobook is narrated, for the most part, by one voice artist or narrator.

            "answer_text": "The other answers have already given valid reasons as to why audiobooks are predominantly narrated by a single narrator, like money, time and the logistics of the project involved. However, in case you are not aware, there is a company that produces audiobook adaptations with full casts that is called Graphic Audio. Their productions are phenomenal and let me tell you, their slogan is \u201cA movie in your mind\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what you get. Your imagination truly runs wild with their voice acting, original soundtrack , sound effects and more. And moreover, they don\u2019t just adapt novels but comics as well. Here are some samples/trailers to check it out:    Please note, there are not that many full trailers in their youtube channel but there are samples for every adaptation in their website. Among those that lack trailers, my personal favorite adaptations are for the Elantris, Warbreaker and Mistborn series. A joy to listen to every step of the way. Hope this helps! ",
