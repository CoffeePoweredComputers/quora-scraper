            "answer_text": "I have been writing in Google Docs for years and never encountered a problem. Since I write on a laptop in the morning, and my desktop later in the day, I found Google Docs to be a far safer approach than trying to sync copy between two computers after my laptop battery went wonky, and reset itself to a past date, causing my syncing software to replace my new copy with old copy. As someone else mentioned, as long as your password is strong, you should be okay. ",

            "answer_text": "It's as safe as your password is complex\u2026. Docs are encrypted at rest and you can restrict access via sharing settings which is great\u2026 but \u2026. if you have a weak password, no 2-factor authentication and have not setup your account identity verification steps to ensure your account is not accessible from other countries/browsers/computers without extra validation from you using devices you own (think SMS to your phone\u2026) Then\u2026 It's as secure as \u201cmonkey123\u2033 is a good password to use\u2026.. not very (sorry monkeys) So if (like anything online) you need to consider the security of your data then don't give bad hackers an easy way in, follow these steps and like me you will continue using Google products for 10+ years with no fear: Setup a strong password -> Set password strength and allow non-admin password reset (or use a password manager -> LastPass )Set up 2-factor authentication -> Add 2-Step VerificationSet up account validation-> Verify a user\u2019s identity with a Login ChallengeSetup an external backup solution -> CloudAllyHope this helps anyone\u2026. or everyone. ;) ",
