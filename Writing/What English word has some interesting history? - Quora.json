            "answer_text": "I want to introduce you to Lord Sandwich (1718\u20131792) , first lord of admiralty and a wild gambler :  The modern sandwich is named after Lord Sandwich, but the exact circumstances of its invention and original use are still the subject of debate. According to Pierre-Jean Grosley ,the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the gambling table. But Sandwich was into many bad habits, including the Hellfire club, and any story may be a creation after the fact. Lord Sandwich was a very conversant gambler, the story goes, and he did not take the time to have a meal during his long hours playing at the card table. Consequently, he would ask his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread, a habit well known among his gambling friends. Other people, according to this account, began to order \"the same as Sandwich!\", and thus the \"sandwich\" was born , and is one of the most popular Food of our times .

            "answer_text": "The English word \u201cfair\u201d has interesting history. The word \u201cfair\u201d and the notion \u201cfairness\u201d are distinctly Anglo with British cultural underpinnings and arose in the late 18th century in the British Empire as a result of the rise of capitalism in the industrial revoluton. They are not exactly translatable into any other language. The emergence of the concepts of \"fairness\" and \u201cfair play\u201d in market based economy reflects a shift away from absolute morality to \"procedural (and contractual) morality,\" and the gradual shift from \"just\" to \"fair\" can be seen as parallel to the shifts from good to right and also from wise (and also true) to reasonable: in all cases, there is a shift from an absolute substantive approach to a procedural one. Etymologically they are originally of Anglo-Saxon origin and can be traced back to the old English f\u00e6ger \u2018pleasing, attractive\u2019, of Germanic origin; related to Old High German fagar .
