            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a few different ways to do this, but I know it\u2019s always helpful to have an exact strategy you can follow\u2026 So here\u2019s exactly how I did it. Step #1 - Find a specialized part of writing you want to start with One of the biggest problems I see with most freelance writers is that they\u2019re simply too vague. In other words, instead of picking a specialization and standing out that way - they decide to become a generalist\u2026 And even though I totally understand the logic, trust me - it actually makes your life harder\u2026 As it just gives you more competition (because everybody else is a generalist), so niching down is actually the easiest way to stand out. You could do this in a few different ways\u2026 But to give you a few examples, you could: Become a content marketer for certain industries, like:Content marketer for tax firmsContent marketer for health and fitnessContent marketer for dog training companiesEtc, etc, etcFacebook Ads copywriterEmail funnel copywriterSales page copywriterEbook writerCover letter writerAnd on and on and on. The important part is really just picking a specialization, as that\u2019s what will help you stand out (and quickly learn your skill)... Then you can always grow after that. Step #2 - Create a portfolio The next thing you need to do after this, is create a portfolio you can use. This is extremely important as it seems to be the one thing clients want to see, so just create a few items you can share\u2026 And the only thing I wanted to mention with this, was just making sure that you create \u201cresults\u201d if you\u2019re in a results-based field. In other words, if you start with something that can be measured - like: Facebook AdsLanding pageEmail funnelEtc\u2026Then you\u2019ll want to make sure you do a test run with a personal project of yours, as clients will want to see this. On the other hand, if you do something \u201ccosmetic\u201d - like: Content marketerEbook writerCover letterEtc\u2026Then you can get away with just create an example and sharing it that way (as they\u2019ll just want to see your work). After that, we\u2019ll move onto: Step #3 - Getting clients So there\u2019s a lot of different ways you can get clients anymore, but for me personally\u2026 I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of Upwork, the world's largest online workplace, especially to start\u2026 And if you wanted to try this method, here\u2019s the 3 main guidelines you\u2019ll want to remember: When writing your cover letter, always start by acknowledging you read their job posting. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything fancy either, just a simple acknowledgement will go along wayAfter that, always make sure you include 1 -2 portfolio items (via link)And lastly, make sure you end with a question\u2026Which brings me to the last thing I should probably mention, and that\u2019s the mindset of a cover letter. The biggest problem I see with most freelancers, is how they think they need to go for the sale right away\u2026 When that\u2019s honestly the worst thing you can do. The reason for this is because NOBODY buys from strangers, so when you go for the sale right away - you\u2019re just scaring clients away\u2026 And on top of this, when you get them to respond (with a question at the end)... That alone will help you stand out from the crowd and win jobs right away. To give you an example of a cover letter that won me $2K, here you go:  Long story short\u2026 Freelance writing really doesn\u2019t have to be that hard. If you simply: Find a nicheCreate a portfolio for that nicheThen follow a proven strategy after that\u2026I guarantee you\u2019ll be able to start making money from freelance writing a lot sooner than you\u2019d think\u2026 And trust me when I say that, because I honestly had zero experience (or writing education) when I first started\u2026 So I\u2019m pretty sure you can succeed in this as well. P.S. Also, if you\u2019re interested - here\u2019s how I get clients now ",
