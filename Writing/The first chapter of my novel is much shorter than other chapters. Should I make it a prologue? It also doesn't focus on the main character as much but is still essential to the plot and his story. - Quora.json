            "answer_text": "Sure. Just make certain the prologue stuff is interesting and grabs the reader. It\u2019s misleading to promise the reader one story but start off with an aside. Remember the movie \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d. It doesn\u2019t open in Fairy Tale Land, it opens with a kid playing a video game and his grandfather walks in. That was supposed to establish the narrative. Instead it had the audience buzzing, \u201cHey, what? Did I walk into the wrong theater? Oh, crap\u2026\u201d And they couldn\u2019t enjoy the sequence. You might consider putting the \u201cprologue\u201d after the first chapter as an \u201cinterlude\u201d. That way you introduce your main character, get the reader hooked with their challenge, then stop for a moment and go, \u201cOK, you need to know this stuff before reading further\u2026\u201d Or toss it entirely and work it in later. Hemingway said, \u201cWhen writing a short story, throw away the first page. When writing a book, throw away the first chapter.\u201d Sounds like what you might have here. ",

            "answer_text": "My gut reaction is: \u201cNo. No prologues!\u201d Few authors do them well. But maybe you\u2019re the exception. I\u2019d recommend leaving out the short chapter entirely. Don\u2019t delete, just set it aside. Then let your editor and beta readers have the rest of the ms. Don\u2019t mention the missing chapter. If the feedback makes it clear that the missing information is actually essential, then discuss the missing chapter with your editor. It may be it\u2019s perfect prologue material, but more likely that essential info can be cannibalized into other parts of the narrative where it will do its work most effectively. ",
