            "answer_text": "Just start. Get a pen and some stationery - or even use lined notebook paper - it doesn\u2019t matter. Begin with the friend\u2019s name and then simply say what you need to say. A word of caution - if this letter will carry some unwelcome news, do NOT mail it immediately. Set it aside for a day or two. Then re-read your letter. Do you still feel the same way? Would you like to change your wording to soften your tone or to better explain your feelings? The written word is a wonderful thing. I know I am thrilled to get a real hand written note thru snail mail these days. It says that I mean something to the person that wrote it. However, written words are powerful and cannot be taken away so easily. Being able to read and re-read hurtful words could permanently damage your relationship with that person and others who are related in some way to the circumstance or to the two of you. On the other hand - if what you want to say is something deep and wonderful in your heart, then write joyfully. But - I still encourage you to set it aside for a day or two and re-read it to be sure the words as they are assembled are easily understood. ",

There are formal ways to do this, but of course, it is your friend. They will be glad to receive a letter from you. The usual form of a letter has your information in the upper right hand corner of the page: <your name> <your address> <your phone number? email? maybe.> <todays date> Next, on the left hand side, you put the name and address of the person you are writing to. Then, write the salutation: \u201cDear <name of the addressee>, <Body of the letter with what you want to say. You could even draw pictures.> The closing:Something like \u201cBest regards, or \u201cYour friend\u201d or Sincerely, or \u201cYour most humble and obedient servant\u201d Maybe that last one is a little old fashioned. Then sign the letter. Put the letter in an envelope, properly addressed, with your return address, and with the proper postage. Put the letter in a post box, or take it to the post office. ",
