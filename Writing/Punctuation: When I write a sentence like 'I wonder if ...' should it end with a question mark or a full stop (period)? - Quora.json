            "answer_text": "In all of your sentences, the words that follow are all indirect quotations, so they end in a period, not a question mark.  This is true whether the complementizer that introduces the subordinate clause is whether or if.  Some people believe thatwhether is more appropriate than if, but that is a stylistic objection, not a linguistic objection.  The same guidance applies if the complementizer is that: I wonder that it never occurred to him to just stop talking. There are sentences, introduced with wonder, that include direct quotations, for example: I wonder, will Mary come today? Note that with direct quotations there is no complementizer (whether, if, or that) and the auxiliary verb is the first word in the embedded clause.  An auxiliary verb is a modal verb (would,can, etc.) or an inflection of do, be, or have.  In direct questions, the auxiliary always precedes the subject.  However, the direct question is not a quoted sentence, so no quotation marks are used.  But since it is a direct question, it is preceded by a comma, and it is terminated with a question mark. ",

            "answer_text": "tl;dr - you almost certainly finish with a full stop / period Firstly, if shouldn't be   I wonder if Mary will visit today.  It should actually be   I wonder whether Mary will visit today.  Saying \"I wonder if....\" is colloquial, but ambiguous - does it mean that you will only start wondering if the thing happens? Compare for example:  I'm going shopping if Mary turns up.  However, to the point [1] -  If it's a subordinate clause, then it does not finish with a question mark, but with a full stop / period / point [2].  John wondered whether Mary would be visiting.  There are two circumstances in which you need a question mark: Firstly, if you are going to turn it into direct speech:  John asked \"Is Mary visiting?\" Secondly, if the overall thing is a question:  Are you wondering whether Mary is visiting?   [1] Did you see what I did there?[2] Now you do :-) ",
