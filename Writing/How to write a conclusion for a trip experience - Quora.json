            "answer_text": "Most conventional advice about how to write conclusions (\u201ctell \u2019em what you told \u2019em,\u201d or restate your main argument \u201cin conclusion,\u201d etc.) is terrible. No one ever wrote a memorable or resonant conclusion by writing \u201cin conclusion, here\u2019s another way of saying what I\u2019ve already said four times.\u201d Instead, situate your argument in a broader context. Think about how your argument applies to your reader, to their community, to their country, to their life on earth as a human being. Why should they care? What\u2019s in it for them, to listen to what you\u2019ve been saying and take it to heart? Why does it really matter? More here: How to Write Conclusions That Don\u2019t Suck ",

            "answer_text": "You didn't say what you are writing; if you are writing a novel, the third and final act is about 25% of your story and should be devoted to closing your story. By the end of the third act you should have accounted for all your main characters, what happened to them, and how the protagonist won over the antagonist and the conflicts. You need to 'tie up' all the story's conflicts and loose ends. K.M. Weiland's writing guide, 'Structuring Your Novel', and others, will show you what you need to do. It's not possible to get sufficient help here without being intimately involved in your story. You wrote it and only you can close it out. Some authors write the last sentence first. I knew how my story would start and end before I started writing. What I wasn't sure about was who or what the antagonist was. But it all worked out. ",
