            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends on what sort of knowledge. Knowledge of an 'intellectual' sort, like knowledge of the speed of light or knowledge of the chemical composition of water, for example, seem only to improve the quality of life in an indirect, instrumental way - perhaps this knowledge will lead to inventions which save labour, improve our health, or allow us to travel faster and with more ease. But such knowledge doesn't improve the life of the individual who possesses it. The joy of knowing and discovering such facts about the natural world might give meaning to someone's life, but in this case their is nothing special about knowledge improving my life, it just happens to be the object of my desires. Similarly, discovering, learning and performing new card tricks might be what gives me pleasure - it seems that knowledge of this sort has no special status in terms of improving my life which I might not gain from other pleasurable activities. On the other hand, there is knowledge of life in a more practical sense - what we might call 'wisdom'. I might, for example, 'know' that simply pursuing my desires in a selfish fashion will not bring me happiness - such knowledge surely improves the life of one who has realised it. But it is knowledge of a quite different sort to the first kind. In the first case, if I know the speed of light, I can simply inform anyone else of the fact - and then they know it, too. If I inform someone of my conclusion that the selfish life does not lead to happiness, they might accept what I say and themselves take it up as a belief which they hold, something they claim to know - but they will, in all likelihood, continue to live and act as before. There seems to be something about practical 'wisdom' of this sort which we have to 'know' or experience in a more immediate, personal sense. Such knowledge strikes with the force of a revelation, not at all like the noting of a pertinent fact. So, essentially, I think the answer is 'yes' - but there are interesting questions to be asked about the types and status of knowledge, and how such knowledge can be transmitted and realised. ",

            "answer_text": "1  'Quality of life'--we all seem to know what the phrase means, but what if such knowledge actually disqualified life?  Then it seems knowledge would also disprove the quality of life? 2  On the upside, however, if improvement is and always has to be felt, then the question becomes \"Does knowledge make life taste better?\" But notice how for that to be answered, life must be able to be touched, sensed, objectified, and if it isn't already so, then it has to in a way be thrown outside of yourself and made into an objective thing that you can then also taste.--But how is this ever to be done? And what object could ever possibly represent life  or be made equal to it?  3  Since what is being desired here is clearly impossible, a restriction or a qualification is placed on the answer: namely, why turn your life into something it can never be like in the first place, unless perhaps doing such a thing will invariably improve its quality and make it taste good? Or at least leave it as it is, but in any case no negative effects or turns for the worse are allowed, because what sense would there ever be in doing that?   4  Therefore, knowledge --of such things as life as such, as what could be more general than that-- had better to improve the quality of life, because if it don't we can then just auto-disqualify it.

            "answer_text": "I would rephrase this, with your permission, are there any people who's lives are ever improved by knowing something.  If you accept this rephrasing you will I think accept that there are many such cases.  For example if you are walking across the street and there is a bus about to hit you, your life will be improved if you know that, because you can get out of the way.  If you are laboring as an office temp but you would be a great opera singer, your life would be improved by knowing that fact, because you could take steps to achieve that more satisfying career. There may will be cases in which someone's life is made worse by knowledge.  So for example if the office temp above will never be able to become an opera singer he might become unhappy by knowing that he would have made a great one. Some have argued (e.g. J.S. Mill, Aristotle)  then it is inherently noble to want to know what's going on, even if it leads to dissatisfaction, that it is slavish or inhuman to want to be ignorant.  If they are correct then knowledge could improve the quality of human life even if it leads to unhappiness.  They don't want to leave in a fool's paradise, even if it is paradise!  I'll leave it to you to decide if you agree with them -- it is really each person's individual decision and (in my view) no other person can tell you what's right on this score. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The more knowledge we accumulate the more it places us in good steed to make better/more informed decisions about our own lives (although this isn't a rule), thus adding to the likelihood of being able to live a 'good' life, with a high standard of living and the ability to maintain that standard of living. On the down side, knowledge can also drive you nuts, because you can see more clearly than most others what is happening in the world and how those problems can be solved, yet there is much ignorance (often willful), in the world that continues to hold humanity back and even contributes to our own destruction; and this can have negative impacts on both your physical and mental health. The good news is that people with knowledge usually have enough insight to find ways to deal with their anxieties and fears and can often achieve a level of harmony with their environment to allows them to focus on the positives in this world rather than the negatives; and as having knowledge increases the likelihood of you having more leisure time, or personal time than those less knowledgeable people (once again not a rule but a strong possibility), you will have more time to devote to the things you love in life rather than your obligations. With the addition of a higher level of disposable income one can construct their own environment around themselves and their families to achieve a level of inner piece, which is the key to living a 'good' life.

            "answer_text": "Understanding is superior to knowledge, in my view. Experience doesn't always result in understanding, but it helps.  For me, understanding is the mature form of knowledge, and in this form, all dualities are transcended and included.  The quality of life is eased GREATLY by knowing how to resolve dualities, in all aspects of life.  Yoga is the fundamental process by which one can understand the nature of ourselves, so that we can behave appropriately and set our attitudes (bhava)  in such a way as to respond appropriately to the forces of karma. Understanding reveals the connecting thread between apparently separate bundles of knowledge, which can easily (given too much left brain) turn into an endless recursive list of facts and assumed objectivity, which is a big mistake. Knowledge, in it's more mature form is nicely said to be: SatChitAnanda.  To break this down, 'sat' is: that which does not change in the three periods of time, past, present and future. It speaks to a quality of the Self. Chit means knowledge, but also means consciousness. In my mind, this knowledge is related to consciousness itself, and by subtly aligning one's life with the REAL nature of yourself (the Self), knowledge comes in for free, as does understanding, it's larger and more flexible form.  You become more permeable TO knowledge by knowing yourself. This makes sense because you ARE the thing you would know. Knowing yourself is a process of combining the knower/knowledge/known separations into a united understanding. It is for this reason that I recommend knowing yourself, constantly and consistently on Quora. There is no area of life in which a deep and profound knowledge of yourself will not improve your quality of life. So much so that at this point I have transcended the fear of death itself. Why concern myself with that? I will be reborn again, and hopefully I will have learned something, and inevitably, I will no longer need to be born to fix the problems I am no longer aware from previous births.  Ananda is Bliss Absolute. It is the emotional component to one's life experience that comes from the unifying consciousness of the Self. This bliss (and love) is a reaction to one's Infinite, unbound, transcendent nature.  ",

            "answer_text": "Once more, thanks for a thought provoking A2A, Miquon. Knowledge is certainly a prerequisite to a decent quality of life. However, in my view, is only one facet with regards to improving one's quality of life. In fact, knowledge can be rendered utterly useless if not coupled with the right virtues which would allow for the effective application in relevant situations where one's quality of life is at stake. For example, it is almost \"common knowledge\" that adhering to a consistent exercise routine can yield substantial health benefits, thus ameliorating one's quality of life. However, the discipline (a virtue) required to stick to a consistent routine is usually what is in short supply, not the knowledge. Yes, the more you know about your how your body works, injury prevention, etc., the better off you will be. But it is only one part of the equation. The question of virtues is one that I've given much thought as I've embarked upon the maturation process over the commencement of my adulthood years, and, at this moment in time, I've come to the conclusion that it's better to focus on developing the correct virtues as opposed to the acquisition of knowledge. Of course, that's not to suggest that acquiring knowledge about a particular subject matter with respect to one's quality of life has been rendered unimportant and trivial. It is essential, but, in my mind, not the most challenging part of improving one's prospects of living a happy life. It's identifying and strengthening the virtues required to apply such knowledge to one's circumstances that is well and truly the defining factor in this regard. Hope that helps a bit, and thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no.  Socrates (a philosopher) claimed that life without philosophy wouldn't be worth living (he actually is supposed to have said, \"the unexamined life isn't worth living\"). So a life worth living will require at least some knowledge, and in fact, if you live to an age of adulthood, you will have acquired not only knowledge, but an actual philosophy of life, whether you know it or not.  So in one sense, being and staying alive improve through knowledge.  On the other hand, both a little knowledge and a lot of knowledge can be a dangerous thing.  Ignorance may be bliss but it sets you up as a target and victim placed squarely in the crosshairs of anyone not so ignorant who lacks the moral empathy or social sympathy to leave you alone in your blissful state and not take advantage of your ignorance.  At the same time, elite powers and unruly mobs tend to distrust and eliminate those who are more intelligent, knowledgeable, and wise. History is littered with the dead bodies of philosophers, prophets, and preachers who knew too much - including old Socrates himself. And one doesn't have to be a philosopher, prophet, or preacher to die of too much knowledge - Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby may be examples of exactly that fate.  Life is necessarily and inevitably risky, and things like security, safety, quality, and luxury, etc., are fleeting and tenuous at best. Knowledge equips you to deal with that fact of life, but it also reveals to you - and exposes you to - more of the risk at the same time.   ",

They perceive enough to fit into their fundamental needs and they conduct their subsequent behaviors accordingly. It they cannot do this they cannot survive. This is the most fundamental form of improvement that knowledge can bestow. At this primitive point, quality of life is simple. Humans can abstract their perceptions with the use of symbols and gigantic neural networks. One can extrapolate the benefits from structuring perceptions this way to include many new and complex paybacks. Yes, not only does knowledge improve the quality of life, it is life\u2019s primary support. The exception would be having knowledge of something that can be detrimental to know.  For instance, having the unnecessary knowledge of something that is painful can have an adverse impact on performance. ",

But the more knowledge you have about the world, in any way, shape, or form, the more likely you are to live a better life! There is a definite Correlation there. Although, I do have to mention that the people living the best lives usually do not focus on their knowledge, they focus on their feelings. That being said though, knowledge is definitely an amazing starting point and can help improve your quality of life IF YOU USE IT RIGHT! Knowledge alone does not do anything. You have to take a corresponding Action with the knowledge you acquired. Just knowing what to do is easy. But actually doing it is another step entirely.  ",

            "answer_text": "If we start by defining \"the quality of life\", then we can get an answer that will make sense in a specific way. \"Quality\" should refer to how well the characteristics of something match with one or more of the following:  Requirements such as benefits, and benefits such as reliability, usefulness, and appeal. Correctness such as for purpose, and purpose such as goals, relevance, and rules. Improvement will mean providing, increasing or actually aligning the presence of characteristics that benefits and purpose call for. Knowledge certainly helps to discover and recognize those characteristics; to inform or instruct how they can be produced and included; and to explain how they help and how much they can help. Additionally, knowledge helps to recognize the current state of things versus any other desired or undesired state, triggering decisions about whether to take action or not. So, the answer is, yes, knowledge is a tool that is helpful for bringing about improvement in the quality of life. However, every tool is subject as well to dis-use, mis-use, and ab-use.  ",

The Adam and Eve story highlighted this very question. God placed the tree of  knowledge in the center of the garden and instructed them to not eat from it. Of course they did and the result was they could no longer be ignorant to the knowledge of good and evil. They could no longer be without responsibility for having that knowledge and every choice they made needed to be in context of their knowledge.  We can see a constant push and pull of sayings such as 'knowledge is the key' to 'ignorance is bliss' and the reason for this contradiction is that knowledge is both a curse and a blessing. Can knowledge improve the quality of life? Absolutely! Can knowledge also make life more difficult? Absolutely, because with knowledge comes responsibility. With knowledge you can know longer ignore what it is you know or turn a blind eye because knowledge is also tied to our own morality. When we know better we are expected to do better. When we know more, we are expected to achieve more. When we become more knowledgeable we know we must act on that knowledge because to we also know that a brain is a terrible thing to waste. ",

People put a great deal of emphasis and value on knowledge but in my experience particularly as a Life Coach, knowledge yields little fruit.  It is applied knowledge or wisdom that improves one's quality of life.  I can know a lot of things but can I create value for myself and others - that seems to make all the difference, it's more like knowledge with an infusion of heart (courage) that makes an impact.  I hope I have been of service.  Best wishes. www.howtowoohoo.net ",

I have found certain small, seemingly commonplace bits of knowledge to be of infinitely more value than other grand understandings. These gems benefit me greatly, but to others their effect may not be as intense, because they are not faced with the same needs, or degree of those needs, as myself. First, we must learn what to do and how; then we must learn to take action. So much of the knowledge that is useful in this life comes down to an attitude--a state of being--that we cling to with the ferocity of a shipwrecked sailor hugging a tree in a typhoon. It's all that keeps us from being swept away into chaos and calamity. ",
