            "answer_text": "The answer begs the question, \u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d If you are talking about the usual order in which tenses and aspects are taught and presented in English language class books, then you would find something like this:  This order is not only illogical in terms of usefulness, but it also has absolutely no bearing on what is easiest or most frequent. This order has been used historically to teach languages. It is a construct created by early philologists who believed that \u2018simple\u2019 was simple, (which it isn\u2019t), and decided to teach it first. If you are asking because you want to teach English, I suggest that you throw this in the trash and listen to and read authentic English. Make your own chart based on the frequency of the tenses and aspects you hear being used by real people. Think about the function as well as the tense-aspect. For example, consider the present continuous as it is presented in most class books. You have a page filled with images of people doing various activities. The activity is that the students take turns asking, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d while the other answers, \u201cShe is reading.\u201d or \u201cThey are listening to music.\u201d Now, how often do real people talk about right now? If you asked me, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d, as my husband often does when I have a vacuum in my hand, I would reply, quite sarcastically and not very happily, \u201cWhat the f^&%k does it look like I\u2019m doing?\u201d So, asking annoying questions isn\u2019t really something I want to teach my students. Do we use the present continuous? Yes, but far more frequently for other functions than \u2018right now\u2019. Think carefully about the language you are teaching and be very wary of traditional charts. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not realy clear what you\u2019re asking about with this question. Obviously, the commenter so far have different interpretations. Is the the sequence in which tenses are learned or taught? Is it the sequence of time, like past, present, future? Or, are you asking about how tenses are used to establish a sequence of actions in complex sentences? The answer to any of these questions is pretty complex. If you leave a comment that clarifies what your asking, I would be happy to give you an answer. ",
