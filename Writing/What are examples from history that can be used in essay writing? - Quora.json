            "answer_text": "Use of examples in your essay writing is an excellent way to explain your point. These are also used to support a statement. History is full of both good and bad examples. The application of right example at the right time brings a logical flow in your writing with a sense of strong persuasion and ability to engage user's interest in your writing. Every example won\u2019t fit every situation since each situation differs from others. You won\u2019t probably use religious examples to prove your mathematical or scientific data and vice versa. As far as you are using right examples, you can use any historical example in your essay writing such as: Facts of World War I and II to explain the devastating consequences of greed for powerLife of Buddha to advocate the power of simplicity, love, and compassionDetermination of Mahatma Gandhi to bring peace in society through non-violent approachThe examples of many famous personalities with their incredible contributions who were physically disabled such as Stephen Hawking, Helen Keller, and John NashThe examples of self-made billionaires withMost important historical events such as The American Revolution, The Reformation, and Berlin Wall",

            "answer_text": "What kind of essay are you writing? Anyways,  today I've read an interesting fact about Leonardo da Vinci. When he  was working on \"The Last Supper,\" he needed two men who would pose for  him as Christ and Judas. Once he went to a church, and saw a young men  singing in the choir. \"That's the guy who will pose for me as Christ,\"  Leonardo thought, and offered this man to work as his model. However, da  Vinci did not manage to find a model for Judas. Three  years later, when \"The Last Supper\" was almost finished, Leonardo saw a  homeless drunk men lying in a ditch; the man's face seemed to be marked  with every known vice. Leonardo immediately figured out that this was a  perfect candidate for Judas; he took the homeless man to his workshop,  and finally the painting was finished. The homeless man saw the painting  and said, \"You know, I've seen this painting three years ago.\" \"You  did?\" Leonardo asked. The man said, \"Yeah. Three years ago, before my  life rolled to heck, I used to sing in a church choir. Back then, some  guy - and an artist like you - had asked me to pose for him as Christ.\" ",
