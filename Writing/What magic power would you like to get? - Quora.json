So instead, I'd give myself the ability to negotiate flawlessly (a sort of mind control, if you will). Why? I could always get what I want from anyone. Gotta have some selfish reason, right? I could encourage people to do things they normally wouldn't do, like studying or stop procrastinating. I could convince people to improve on our community and daily lives. This power would allow me to perform a multitude of tasks, from a small thing such as making that thief give back what he stole to something grand, like pushing the world to reform. Of course, I'd have to gain the popularity first, but hey, I've got mind control. I can force people to increase my popularity. Let us decrease militarization! Let us research more science and technology! Let us start that Energy Revoluion to get out of fossil fuels! Let us clean the world! Let us spend some more time educating the unfortunate! Let us have an era of world peace and prosperity! Let us make steps to colonize other worlds! Let us join as one to conquer our problems together. Let us improve humanity. And that's why I believe that superb negation/mind control is the best. My magical power can unite everyone for one cause. If one person can't do it, I'm sure seven billion people can. We are stronger together than apart. ",

I still believe it. My old bedroom window looked like this:  (Sorry about the quality, closest I could find) except slightly wider and longer. I would climb up onto the top third of my window and push it open and dangle off, half of my body inside, the other half swinging over the street below. I was so certain I could fly, I tried to jump so many times (thank god the next door neighbour was good friends with my mum and so they would often smoke on the doorstep and she\u2019d see me and scream at me to get back inside before I broke my skull). I used to have dreams of leaping off rooftops and falling a little before I\u2019d shoot up into the sky, I still dream of flying now, just less frequently. I remember being captivated by Peter Pan and I absolutely adored the flying scenes where they\u2019d leap and swim out of their windows and drift over the clouds and around buildings, I have a slight feeling that\u2019s where my obsession came from. But in short, flying. I\u2019d love to be able to just step into the air and fly away. ",

            "answer_text": "I am sorry, but I am totally unskilled and untrained in the stagecraft known as magic. I don\u2019t think entertaining folks by pulling rabbits out of hats and \u2018cutting\u2019 pretty ladies in half is something which I could ever see myself as doing! If however, in case you are alluding to the Witchcraft art of \u2018magick\u2019, then I can and will address your question from that perspective: note: Please understand that, as you may well know, since the 6th Century BCE, the good Hebrew, Christian and Muslim folk have been killing Witches (aka: Sorceresses and Sorcerers) in accordance with an explicit direction in the Book of Exodus to \u2018Suffer Not A \u2018Witch\u2019 to Live!\u2019 So, my discussion may seem vague\u2026) The power of the Witch to perform acts of magick is granted to us by our deities and is an art we are taught and receive much training for! Although it should be pointed out that there are many hereditary or natural Witches, with natural or innate abilities within the art of magick which tend to assist them in the magick workings. So once the Witch is properly trained and their natural abilities are identified and strengthened, a Circle of Peace, Power and Potential is cast and the Elemental Sprits of the Four Directions are invoked to bring their wisdoms and energies and to provide a security function. Then, our Goddess and God are invoked to provide Wisdom, Guidance Blessings and Energies for our magickal workings. Next, the Witch will add, to the energies already gathered, the energies of a Natural Source such as the Sun, Moon, Aurora, Wind, Wave, Storm, Fire or Earth (gravity, magnetism, Fire, etc..) These combined energies are then focused by the Witch upon a target, via technique and intent, to cause physical change in the world in which we live, or, to create a change in the life of an individual such as with a curse, blessing or binding. So, in the simplest of terms, my magickal \u2018power\u2019 is: the Blessings of my Deities and the energies given to me by them, plus the energies provided by The Elementals and the energies of Nature, all combined and controlled by me and my intent to create change!

Not having a personal dynamic in a situation, but being part of what is going on by just being able to observe surreptitiously, would be an amazing adventure.   Think of the things you could do and see and experience without anyone even knowing (or stopping you).  I could sit in the President\u2019s office and hear exactly what is going on. I could visit famous people and see how they really live and what they really talk about.  The doors would be open (and free) to almost any place you could think of!  Although I suppose occasionally there would be a little matter of sneaking through security that would need to be thought through.   I could visit amazing places in the middle of a dark night and not worry about being a victim of crime.  If no one can see you, why not stow away on a cruise ship and take a trip around the world.  One problem that I see with this is that I would still have mass, so I could be sleeping on the deck of the ship when some unwitting sailor trips over me.  Although, since this is \u2018magical\u2019, maybe the mass problem can be imagined away.  The other problem is someone with no integrity having the same powers, might not have the same desire to just quietly \u2018observe\u2019 the world. ",

I will survive through barely passing my exam by cramming up a syllabus which has no relation whatsoever to my future life or career. I will survive through giving an exam with FULL 90 MINUTES OF SLEEP because didn't I mention that this is my superpower. I may not have cool elemental powers or kickass tech. I may not be battling aliens or monsters with a wicked sword straight out from a greek myth but I am a teenager in highschool and that is just about the same thing.

Most superpowers involve super enhancement of an already human ability, i.e. super strength, super speed, etc. Other powers allow one to perform impossible feats such as controling certain elements. But the power to CONTROL TIME allows for many things: Firstly, you could stop the aging process for yourself and be immortal, until such time as you decide that you should die (so you\u2019re not stuck living forever no matter what). Secondly, it is essentially the same as teleportation, as you can stop time, and move from one place to another, then when time starts again you appear to have teleported from the perspective of someone else. Third, you can increase/decrease the flow of time, meaning if you wanted to travel to the future you could do so. There is something you can\u2019t do with this power, though. There are many theories as to what would happen if one were to go back in time, but a lot of them are unsavory (e.g. the Butterfly Effect). But imagine\u2026 at that point there are not many superheroes who can hold a candle to you. ",

Starting from sunrise, his power begins to increase and he begins to grow larger and his personality changes from his submissive night-self to his prideful daytime-self, with the process reversing with the setting of the sun. In the daytime, his physical strength increases dramatically and he is able to radiate intense waves of light and heat easily capable of melting metal and vaporizing stone. Merlin hearkens his power to that of the actual Sun, the source of all life. Escanor is able to imbue Rhitta with his magic power, which causes the slashes from his axe to also burn his foes. In his fight against Galand, Escanor's power level was shown rising by 5 points every second. During noon Escanor's size grows considerably, becoming many times his own size. His magic power also vastly increases. When utilizing it he can create a miniature sun of pure magic power, whose heat is such that it can melt the armor of a Holy Knight several meters away just by being in its vicinity. It can also be controlled and directed for attacks, causing immense damage. When his power peaks at noon, the size of the ball increases accordingly, as does his strength. At high noon, Escanor reaches the absolute peak of his power and he becomes The One, \"the invincible incarnation of power\", according to Merlin. This form only lasts for one minute. While in this form, Escanor's strength increases to the point where with a single strike of his hand, he could knock off Meliodas in his Assault Mode. His durability also grew to the point where he could easily shrug off Meliodas' Kami Chigiri without sustaining any damage. He was also able to eventually overcome Zeldris' Ominous Nebula attraction force, whereas previously he himself and Ludociel were powerless to resist it, his magic power leaving Chandler and Cusack shocked and Zeldris referring to Escanor as a monster for easily overcoming his magic power, [1] and proceeded to break through the Demon Prince's magical ability with his Divine Sword Escanor before heavily wounding Zeldris with a simple finger jab. However, as Sunshine is a power made for a Goddess Clan's member, Escanor cannot resist the effects of using that power on his human body ",
