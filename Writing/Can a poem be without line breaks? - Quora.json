            "answer_text": "Yes, it can. Poems written that way are called prose poems. A number of poets have tried their hand at these things, but the example that pops into my mind on the spur of the moment is Rimbaud\u2019s Illuminations, a whole collection. They\u2019re short, heavy with evocative imagery and feeling created by a lyrical but non-metrical flow of language, and the plot is rudimentary or non-existent. Instead, there are intuitive leaps from one idea to the next. The overall sense is impressionistic or surreal. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting. There has been poems without line breaks, but usually they're made like that because of special reasons. For example, you want to form a visual object with the words. But I guess that's one of the points that separate poem and prose. Even though both contain poetic elements, poems are composed (generally) into lines and stanzas, while proses are into sentences that are combined into paragraph. I once heard someone say that in creating poems, there are no rules. You know a poem to be a poem because you can feel it. Not because of sets of rules it obeys. So, you can try to make a poem without line breaks to prove this point. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, although it is relatively uncommon, I could easily imagine, in concrete poetry a poem about Spaghetti being presented as a single line of text that bends haphazardly around the sheet having no line breaks\u2026. for example. Some poetry forms rely on line breaks, and whitespace is generally important in a poem, but there are times where line breaks are not required. However it should be noted that this alone is not what makes the words poetic or non-poetic. Prose may not require line breaks also\u2026 I hope this helps some and wish you good luck in the future\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Sure but think of a book written of one long sentence. The breaks help set the meter and rhythm of how a poem is read. Almost all limericks are read with the same rhythm (There once was a man from Nantucket) try reading that limerick without any breaks and much of it\u2019s lewdness is lost. I guess my question to you is why would you write a poem without line breaks? ",
