            "answer_text": "While speaking and listening are certainly important, learning writing is a great way to appreciate Chinese culture and communication through pictograms. Usually, learners begin with learning pinyin, then move to reading and recognizing Chinese characters, but often skip over learning to write in Chinese. I think that this is a mistake for intermediate and advanced learners. First, there are many benefits to learn to write Chinese characters: \u2022\tWriting can strengthen your memorization of characters \u2022\tCommunicating with Chinese friends \u2022\tStudying in China, or doing business in China may require Chinese character writing \u2022\tExercise your brain to visually recognize form and function in Chinese characters instead of an alphabet \u2022\tBetter understanding of Chinese culture   Many learners may think that if they know pinyin, they can type the characters they need into a computer keyboard. However, even learners who know pinyin may frequently input incorrect sentences into the computer and may express the wrong meaning. Others may not understand what they want to express. The reason is, in Chinese, one pinyin input may match multiple Chinese characters (homonyms). Readers cannot understand what you wish to express if you choose the irrelevant characters. Here are two steps that you can take to begin learning to write Chinese characters: Step 1: Know how to start Just like building a house, we have to build in order as we put the characters together. Characters are written by combining different \u201cstrokes\u201d. So, you need to start from learning the various strokes. Learn the stroke order and know the rules to construct the character properly (and beautifully!).  You also need to learn Chinese character components and structure. Chinese characters have different types: single-component characters (\u4eba) and multi-component characters (\u5988). Complicated types contain more strokes and components, such as \u201c\u68ee\u201d, which consists of three \u201c\u6728\u201d. The basic structure of Chinese characters : You also need to learn Chinese character components and structure. Chinese characters have different types: single-component characters (\u4eba) and multi-component characters (\u5988). Complicated types contain more strokes and components, such as \u201c\u68ee\u201d, which consists of three \u201c\u6728\u201d. The basic structure of Chinese characters: \u2022\tThe left-(middle-) right structure: \u5973 + \u672a = \u59b9; \u7c73 + \u53e4 + \u6708= \u7cca\u2022\tThe top-(middle-) bottom structure: \u516b+ \u5200 = \u5206; \u7acb + \u65e5 + \u5fc3 = \u610f\u2022\tThe enclosure structure: \u53e3 + \u53e3 = \u56de; \u7389 + \u53e3 = \u56fd Step 2: Make an effective and reasonable plan Set specific goals. Don\u2019t say to yourself: \u201cI want to learn writing effectively or better than I now know\u201d. Don\u2019t be vague about how much you will learn and in which method. Your goal should be laid out in such a way 1.Time: goals for every month, every week, and even every day; know how many hours you will spend writing characters. 2. Method: how many characters you will need to practice, how to practice, test, evaluate and revise, etc. 3. Tools: choose the proper tools: flashcards, Twiddla, Skritter, or written on paper. 4. People: find a qualified tutor who can check, test and inspect your progress, find a partner that also makes your study more interesting. 5. Rewards: once you reach your goals, reward yourself and celebrate your achievements! I hope this information can help inspire and motivate you to learn to improve your writing of Chinese characters. The process of learning and training your mind and hand to form these beautiful and mysterious pictograms is valuable to not only your Chinese learning, but your overall understanding of communication and art!

            "answer_text": "Here are some tips for practicing your act of writing Chinese characters. Usually, learners begin with learning pinyin, then move to reading and recognizing Chinese characters, but often skip over learning to write in Chinese. This is unappropriate way for intermediate and advanced learners. Step 1: Familiarize Yourself With Chinese Characters. Learn to read and type in Pinyin. Pinyin can help reinforce your memory on the pronunciation of certain phrases. It will also go a long way in helping you type out Chinese words and look up phrases you don\u2019t know. Step 2: Make an effective and reasonable plan for your characters writing. Set specific goals. Don\u2019t say to yourself: \u201cI want to learn writing effectively or better than I now know\u201d. Don\u2019t be vague about how much you will learn and in which method. Your goal should be laid out in such a way: 1.

People: find a qualified tutor who can check, test and inspect your progress, find a partner that also makes your study more interesting. 5. Rewards: once you reach your goals, reward yourself and celebrate your achievements! Step 3: Improve your basic Chinese writing skills When you arrive at a more advanced level, you can begin to start forming sentences in writing. Whenever you have an Inspiration, pen it down in Chinese. Try writing a short journal entry daily about your day, new words you learned, or make up a short story. Of course, trying to fit in all of these daily activities along with formal language study may be challenging. However, setting some time each day for the casual activities will definitely strengthen your language ability. Young children can choose this way to practice their Chinese. When children do not recognize a word, they can describe it with other words they already know. Once you get to that point, a set of doors will be opened to your language learning and significant advancements will be brought into your Chinese learning. Step 4: Focused reading to improve your Chinese writing 1. Select an area of focus; 2. Start recording good examples from the materials you read; 3. Sort and organize the examples you record; 4. Keep your record handy next time you write and use the new words or phrases. I hope this information can help inspire and improve your Chinese writing. The process of learning and training your mind are valuable to not only your Chinese learning, but your overall understanding of communication and art! Know more: Chinesewriting ",
