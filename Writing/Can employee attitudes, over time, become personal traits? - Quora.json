            "answer_text": "Employee attitudes that are displayed over and over at work often become labeled as personal traits. Likewise, there are typically personality components that are apparent with positive and negative employee attitudes. For example, someone that regularly complains at work might be labeled a \u201cnegative Nancy\u201d. The personality is such that tasks need to be well organized with adequate resources. There is little to no flexibility for a shortage of materials, too few employees or a lack of other resources. On the other hand, an employee with a positive attitude would be much more likely to view inadequate materials or too few employees for a job as less than ideal, but be capable of proceeding to do his or her best work under the circumstances. Employee attitudes or personal traits are difficult for an employer to alter. Discussions seeking employee opinions about what they are bothered by, genuinely seeking and listening to employee suggestions for how the employer can make changes, managers offering objective pointers for how employees can improve their attitudes, mentoring from other model employees and training can be conducted on expected attitudes in the workplace. Sometimes re-matching an employee to another manager or position by acknowledging how an attitude or trait can be accommodated can improve a particular attitude or trait. Motivation for employees to change can be offered as well. Managers can develop rewards for employees\u2019 behaving in an optimistic manner or for making fewer negative comments. People can change their behavior. But underlying attitudes tend to more entrenched and difficult to change. They are based on such factors as family upbringing, religion, customs, culture, age and socio-economic status. The point for employers is to know what attitudes and traits are necessary for excellent job performance and customer service. ",

            "answer_text": "Any behavior you repeat so often that it becomes habitual starts to become part of your \u2018personality.\u2019 So displaying an attitude (which is done through one sort of behavior or another) can certainly fit into this. Personality, in my view, is an accumulation of habits, some of which you could change, but some you either don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t realize you could. They are therefore limitations. ",
