            "answer_text": "Pen pal and online are kind of an oxymoron when places together. :) Writing to other people via electronic mail perhaps no longer qualifies as having 'pen' pals. However, you may use the yahoo chat room if you are looking for something purely platonic, and privately exchange emails so that you communicate electronically on issues that are of personal interest (I am guessing you don't JUST want to chat?)...another good idea is to develop a friendship on a social networking site like Facebook and thence, transfer it to the mail medium and continue your conversations there.
