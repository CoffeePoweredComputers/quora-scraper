Short marketing emails don\u2019t need graphic design. In fact, just plain text emails can work really well. However, longer copy \u2014 such as landing pages and direct mail pieces \u2014 NEED a graphic designer to work their magic. Without design, you would end up with a block of text that\u2019s hard to read. And, if people won\u2019t read your copy, you won\u2019t get any sales. Besides, adding pictures and graphs that support the copy can increase response. ",
