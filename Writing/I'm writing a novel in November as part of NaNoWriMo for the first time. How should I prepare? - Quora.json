There is a lot of preparation work you can do prior to starting the actual writing in November.  How much is good for you depends on your writing style.  Are you a \"planner\" or a \"pantser\"?   Some folks (pantsers) start out with only the most basic ideas and let the novel take them where it will, and that's hard to prepare for, other than just doing as much writing as you can between now and November 1.  I'd also say read as much as you can, too - you'll get those ideas swimming in  your head! Others, like me, are planners.  We like to know our characters, and have at least a pretty good idea where the story is going before we start.  That can take the form of a few vague notes jotted here or there, or a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline, character sheets, pacing planning, etc.   All of that can be done before November!  The NaNoWriMo rules say that all the words that appear in the book have to be written during the 30 days, but any outside material - outlines, character sheets, timelines, maps, etc. are encouraged beforehand. I try to pace my planning so I'm peaking my excitement about the story right at November 1.  Ideally, I can hardly wait to start writing.  If you do too much planning early, it may feel flat by the time you start, or you may have changed your mind about a lot of things in the ensuing time.  If you start too late, you're doing all that planning when you really should be writing.  That can take some practice, but it will really help you get a productive start come November. Hope that helps - good luck in November!   Have you looked at Script Frenzy, by the way?  That's in April, producing a 100 page script or screenplay during those 30 days.  Lots of fun, and run by the Office of Letters and Light, the same great folks that bring you NaNoWriMo. ",

            "answer_text": "30-Day writing challenges like the NaNoWriMo Challenge are crash courses in helping writers understand the amount of discipline required for productivity and getting a novel completed. This article is a great resource for preparing for it, but in summary, here\u2019s what you should do: Be organized As with any task, the better organized you are, the more likely you'll be to be successful and achieve your goal. So, on the front end, you'll need to set a daily word count goal, just like bestselling authors do. Don't edit, just write Writers create, using the right side of the brain, while editors analyze, using the left side of the brain. It's two different processes and needs to occur at two different phases of development in your creative endeavors. Since the NaNoWriMo challenge only requires 50,000 words to be written within a month, there is no need to edit yourself. The focus should be placed entirely on the creative process of writing. Do the prep work now If you plan to write a fantasy manuscript, the amount of work that goes into worldbuilding on the front-end is daunting, to say the least. This video can get you started on some of the core aspects of worldbuilding. Regardless of genre, if you're not quite sure how to build your main character, this article is a good starting point for learning about the Hero's Journey and the steps that are traditionally included in it. Since all great stories follow a similar heroic arc, it's a good idea to know this arc before creating your own hero. Additionally, a lot of writers have seen a lot of success with using The Snowflake Method. If you don't have a ton of experience in story drafting or plotting, the Snowflake Method is an easy way to get your story on the page. This article is a basic tutorial on how to approach the Snowflake Method to get your story outlined before the NaNoWriMo challenge gets started, and is good information to know on the front-end of any attempt at writing a story. Consider creating a scene list While a scene list is not required for writing a novel, some writers, like author J.K. Rowling, swear by them. If you want to create a scene list before your 30-day writing challenge, this article is a great resource for learning what a scene list is and how to make one. Let your friends and family know what you're doing Being able to balance one's work and family life as a writer is an obstacle many writers admit to facing, so to prepare yourself for any 30-day writing challenge, you'll need to understand this simple truth on the front-end. Especially if you have a full-time job outside of your writing endeavors, you should have the conversation with your significant other and family members so they understand the amount of privacy you'll need to get 50,000 words on the page within 30 days.
