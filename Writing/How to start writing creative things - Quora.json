            "answer_text": "I think the harder question is why rather than how. How: you sit down and write. If you don\u2019t have any ideas, brainstorm, or look at some of the techniques suggested all over Quora. How do I come up with ideas to write about? I am sitting here, staring at the wall. No ideas are coming. Don\u2019t forget to look at the suggested questions related to the above question. They\u2019re on the right side of your screen. There are loads of them that will help you. If you have trouble finding your \u2018voice\u2019 or you\u2019re not sure how to turn an idea into a story, there are loads of books about this. One that I like to suggest is: Amazon.com: Plot Versus Character: A Balanced Approach to Writing Great Fiction (0035313650352): Jeff Gerke: Books There\u2019s also: Amazon.com: Story: Style, Structure, Substance, and the Principles of Screenwriting eBook: Robert McKee: Kindle Store But some people find that one too complicated. I think a beginner can do fine with it if they\u2019re a careful reader and don\u2019t insist on \u2018getting\u2019 all the information into their heads the first time they read it. It\u2019s best to read some, write some, read some more \u2026 it\u2019s a great book to reread because you\u2019ll get something new out of it each time you make progress with your writing craft. But maybe you need this Quora thread for the how: I want to write a novel, but don't have an appealing story idea, skill as a writer, free time, tenacity, imagination, or observational skill needed to write a good novel. What should I do? None of this advice will make a bit of difference, though, unless you figure out why you want to write. Is it for fun? Do you want to develop a side income stream? Do you have things you want to say to the world? Are you a masochist? (The last comment is meant to be funny. I feel like a masochist sometimes because of my compulsion to write.) Until you have a purpose, whether it\u2019s self-entertainment, therapy, you want to work toward becoming a professionally published author, or some other reason, it\u2019s going to be hard to direct your efforts. It\u2019s also going to be hard to give you specific advice that will be useful for you. I hope this helps! ",

You could have asked it in dozens of different ways, or not ask it at all, but you created it. Some people think that fiction is synonymous with \u201ccreative,\u201d but they\u2019re only looking at the writer\u2019s skill with words. Yes, flowery, evocative words can make some fine writing, but that\u2019s not all there is to creativity in writing. Any time you write something that\u2019s never been written before, you\u2019re creating. In fact, the only writing I can think of that\u2019s not \u201ccreative\u201d is plagiarism. In fiction, for example, you are being creative when you choose which scenes to write and which to omit. But you do the same thing in writing non-fiction. If you\u2019re writing, say, about World War II, which battles do you choose to write about? What non-battle events do you describe? And how many details of each do you write, and which do you omit. Those are all \u201ccreative things.\u201d No two accounts of World War II will be the same. Each will be a \u201ccreative thing.\u201d Then, too, it\u2019s creative to decide on the order of things in you writing. Where does the story of a romance begin? Where does the story of World War II begin? Do you choose chronological order in your writing, or do you go back and forth in time? If two events take place concurrently, which do you place first in your writing? Or perhaps you switch back and forth with a little of one alternating with a bit of the other? In other words, any time you write anything that\u2019s not merely copying someone else\u2019s words, you writing a \u201ccreative thing.\u201d So, just stop worrying about creativity and start writing.

            "answer_text": "You ask three questions, how do I start to write? This is easy, start with a prompt. Write one sentence with your character entering a place. Write one sentence where the character confronts a villian. Write dialogue between them. Write one sentence after the protagonist or villian leaves, explaining what has changed. Keep going, write as much as you can. You ask a second question, how do I write? This should be without lifting your fingers from the keypad or paper or using delete. The edit, edit, edit. You ask a third question, how do I write creatively? This can be with imagination or by creating something new. Newness can only be evaluated by knowing what is old and looking for gaps. Newness can be from a different perspective or using a different style or technique. Newness can invent style, knowledge, news, science, techology, insight, argumentation, process, place or character. Newness can be a combination of things. Writing with imagination may be that you start with a set of facts, then immerse yourself in the dream of what you create. This is usually associated with fiction or poetry or creative nonfiction, allowing a reader to walk with you through a time, place, emotionally imbued experience. The more a reader experiences the more creatively you have written. So notice sensory experiences and include them. Also notice your emotions, and how emotion is seen in others. ",

My go-to is ten minutes. Write something creative for ten minutes a day, every single day. Get a calendar and give yourself a big X or a star sticker for every day that you meet your goal. A visual reminder of your chain of writing days will give you a boost to keep going. If you\u2019re not sure what you want to write, here are some ideas. Pick up a book and write the first paragraph of it, just to get your fingers moving, then keep going in your own words.Search through Google Images until you find a picture that sparks a story idea.Write fan fiction.Make a list of characters you want to write about.Make a list of situations your characters might get themselves into.Pick one thing from each list, a character and a situation, and then write that story.Get a book of writing prompts and just make your way through it.Give yourself absolute permission to write total crap.

As long as you have the inspiration. you can write a creative sentence or paragraph relatively easily. There are many ways to find inspiration. One example is to just write even though you have no idea what to write. Another way is to Google it. There are many great tutorials on how to write inspiration. This next suggestion may sound crazy, but it can work. If you\u2019re like me and you sometimes get very creative ideas at the most random moments, either talk to whoever brings these ideas like this: \u201cLook, can you please bring me these ideas when I\u2019m actually writing or am in the correct location and condition to write?\u201d Another way, my preferred way, is to simply keep thinking of the idea and don\u2019t stop until you can write it down.

Or have you ever liked a series and you\u2019d love to see an episode with certain challenges and elements in it? That can get you into fanfiction which is a great way for some to start because you can work on story, using established characters, in an established \u2018reality\u2019 and you can run right into it. You can take a \u2018what if?\u2019 and immediately get into writing about it if you use established characters. Later, you can learn to build up the world, build up your own characters and have tremendous fun creating everything and sharing more of your imagination, but from what I understand about fan fiction, it\u2019s a great head start on the important aspect of story telling.

You just need to have an idea about any particular thing and there has to be a mixture of anything you like. First, Decide what your writing is about, is it love, comedy, seriousness etc etc, then work accordingly Regards, Ali, http://www.available.pk/ ",

            "answer_text": "A good process regarding writing creatively is to brainstorm to first come up with an idea, a theme or a story. You can also just start to write and not stop for 3 minute stretches and then put your fragments/cut ups up on a wall and look for a theme emerging. Some say that you should just write and avoid the urge to stop and edit as you go along. This is a kind of automatic writing. Another technique is to sign post with section/chapter headings before you start writing which gives you a map for your story. Train your brain to come up with ideas. Visualise what you think into pictures or short film clips in your brain and then write them down. Hope this helps. Just start writing and do so everyday. ",
