            "answer_text": "Why is the Victorian age known as the age of prose? While there are others with a more qualified background who could answer this, it\u2019s just interesting enough and partially up my alley that I felt I could respond in layman\u2019s terms. Basically the answer comes down to a couple of factors: FunctionalityThe nature of ProseTemperamentIn terms of functionality, Victorian age roughly corresponds with the development and evolution of the printing press. The printing press had been around for hundreds of years prior to the Victorian age, but it wasn\u2019t till around 1850 that steam power and the other advancements of the industrial revolution were able to scale up printing capabilities to beyond human limitations. Massive works of literature had been published prior to the Victorian age, but they were typically works given religious or historical value. Massive works of literature had been published prior to the Victorian age, but they were typically works given religious, cultural, or historical value. With the advent of steam powered rotary presses, ANY written word could be printed so easily that it\u2019s religious, cultural, or historical significance wasn\u2019t necessary to offset the effort. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that by the time this printing behemoth finally burst onto the world\u2019s stage, a great deal of Europe\u2019s common classes population had learned to read as you can see here:  Literacy rate Now let\u2019s talk about the nature of Prose. Pros by nature is lengthy and typically hadn\u2019t been considered a value prior to this point. It also lacked the beauty and artistic sentiment that had been attached to poetry and classical works. Even classical works we would today consider simply prose-like stories had been written in poetic forms\u2014assonant, rhythmic, alliterative and others\u2014both for artistries sake as well as for sake of memory (as many of our earliest classics were originally oral in nature.) What classical and historical and cultural works of prose that were published prior to the Victorian age were one of a few things: Older prosaic works translated from other languagesTales for children and womenAvant guard (for their time) works attempting to push the boundaries of literature.The nature of prose combined with the advent of the steam powered rotary printing press, making it an ideal new evolution of literature. None of this development of prose would be possible during the Victorian era itself, however, without social and cultural temperaments. The Victorian era coincided with the end of romanticism. Romanticism, focused on emotion and sentimentality and great classic cultural works of history, focused heavily on those older and more poetic forms of literature. At first, this movement contributed to the vast wealth of printed material during pre-Victorian years. But after France\u2019s revolution of 1848, when commoners ousted royalty trough violence, more realistic, conservative, and populist attitudes settled in. Poetry no longer embodied the soul of the era\u2014not with the dethroning of nobility and war looming on the horizon. Prose was a natural reaction, especially since it\u2019s seeds had already been sown by a few of the romantics: the Shelley\u2019s and Jane Austin, among others. They\u2019d sown the seeds of prose through more romantic works of prose that hinted at the realism that was settling into the public consciousness. Thus, with technical advancement and a reactionary environment, the nature of prose became a perfect fit that flourished during the Victorian era. Again, I welcome additions and corrections by those who know more than myself! ",
