            "answer_text": "Writing a business plan is supposed to cost time and effort, not money. Time is just a few hours for the first plan, then just an hour or two a month to keep it up. Effort is knowing and deciding, then reviewing and revising. If you know your business well you have less effort planning. If you don't know the business, then you need to research, which does involve more effort. The idea of paying somebody to write a business plan is misguided. A business plan is not a one-time task to be done and then forgotten. Real business plans are obsolete in a few weeks, so the economics of having one done by an outsider for a fee are fake. Whether they are for business owners to manage better, or startups to figure out what steps to take, they are supposed to be done by and used by the people executing the plan. Paying somebody to write a business plan is like paying somebody to do your exercise. However, people do contract outsiders to do their business plans. I spent years doing that as part of my consulting business. The most I ever billed for a business plan was $60,000 (for one of the international divisions of Apple Computer). I billed no less than $5,000 for a plan. My favorite was the one I did for equity in a company that later went public, so no fees, but a percentage of ownership and a seat on the board. There are people who still write business plans as consultants. Some will do that for a few hundred dollars. Most charge a few thousand. If you're looking for that, think of it as coaching, somebody helping you with your plan by offering tips, suggestions, reviews, and so on. Don't ever let it be somebody else's business plan if you are the business owner or startup founder. It has to be your plan. You need to know every word in it. Every number. Every comma. Or else it's useless. ",

            "answer_text": "I write a lot of plans. I can\u2019t say that my approach always works, but here is my experience. Most people want a fixed price. They don\u2019t want a cost per hour. But all you have to sell is A) your knowledge and skill and B) your time. You need to understand your client\u2019s ability to clearly tell you what you need to know to write a plan. Idiots cost you time and money. People who can\u2019t communicate cost you time and money. People who don\u2019t know what they want and claim they\u2019ll know it when they see it, cost you time and money. NEVER OFFER THESE PEOPLE A FIXED PRICE. They will waste your time and frustrate you. Charge them by the hour. I have run into these people, but thankfully, they are rare. To tell if someone fits the above category, you need to talk to them. You need to spend time on the phone or in person interviewing them. Then I follow up the interview with a list of questions. Now it\u2019s time for them to tell you what they know about their business and what they really want or need to see in your plan. You should now have enough information to understand what the finished product will look like. You should have enough understanding of the business, its challenges, opportunities, marketing plan, supply chain, etc. to write that plan, at least in your head. When you have done this a few hundred times, it become second nature. Now that you know what you need to do, you need to calculate how long it will take to do it, add in some contingency time, multiply by your hourly rate, and send it in a proposal to the client. Be sure to lay out what you will do and what you won\u2019t do. I had a client who expected me to write his pitch deck and some other docs as part of the business plan. Told him absolutely not, but I learned my lesson. Put it on paper. Make it perfectly clear that you can do more, but the client will pay more. I have written roughly 285 plans by rough count. I have had problems with maybe 6 clients. Since I established a routine, I have had maybe 1 problem client and I resolved that to my satisfaction (but not his.) I recognize that as a consultant, I am in business that requires some give and take. But there has to be limits. After 6 rounds of edits, including some so trivial as to change the caption on a picture, the client came back and told me he wanted to scrap the marketing plan and start over. I told him no problem, pay me for this plan and then we can work on another. He thought I was going to toss 30 hours of work and start again. That didn\u2019t happen. You need to draw the line, and most people understand. But every once and a while, you find one that doesn\u2019t. ",
