            "answer_text": "When you use the -tari endings on verbs, you're adding the nuance \"do stuff like \u2026ing (and \u2026ing, etc.)\". Technically, you're supposed to finish off your list with suru in the proper tense and politeness. Y\u014dchien de e wo kaitairi ehon wo yondari suru desh\u014d. In kindergarten you'll (do stuff like) draw pictures and read picture books. Nakama no ie de, terebi g\u0113mu wo shitari terebi wo mitari shite ita. We played video games and watched TV at my buddy's house(, that sort of stuff). See how useful this is for making a list of things you did/will do? Finishing it all up with shimasu or shimashita just makes it all polite or formal. (Usually the word \"stuff\" is an informal word. Notice I was talking about nuance above.) The -masu endings are just the non-past polite endings for verbs. Miru and mimasu both mean \"look, watch,\" but the ending -masu just adds politeness or formality. For the past tense, change -masu to -mashita. ",

            "answer_text": "Verbs that end in -Tari express representative actions, such as responding to a question asking what you normally do on your days off. so if you want to say you do things such as eating and sleeping on your days off, you\u2019d use the -tari ending. -masu endings express verbs done in the present, so tabemasu (\u98df\u3079\u307e\u3059) expresses that one is eating currently.
