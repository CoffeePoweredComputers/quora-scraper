            "answer_text": "Buy shopping it to producers or agents. But that generally doesn\u2019t work, because producers generally are already inundated, and if you don\u2019t have an agent, it may take some time to generate interest, which WILL take more than one screenplay. The film industry is generally very vetted in processes, and a lot about who you know. You\u2019ll want to first worry about getting an agent, which will take a lot of very solid writing samples and the ability to pitch your ideas. ",
