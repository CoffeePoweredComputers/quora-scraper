            "answer_text": "While there\u2019s no infallible blueprint per se to a 9, there are conventions that can ensure a high band performance: Here I enlist eight vital ingredients that make for a creditable task one casual/informal letter. Ensure that the letter is addressed Dear + first name [ Dear Susan ]the letter begins with a a friendly opening phrase [How are you? I was chuffed to hear from you.]you make use of contractions [ I\u2019ve / he\u2019s / she\u2019s / it\u2019d / they\u2019d / could\u2019ve/ can\u2019t, etc.]phrasal verbs are used to invoke and accentuate the casual register (tone) [ Examples: catch up, check out, get together, put up, drop by, etc.] Native users of the language tend to use these (far) more than non-native users.there is use of idiomatic language and idioms [examples: on the ball, in the same boat, a lot on one\u2019s plate, learn the ropes, etc.]the exclamation mark (!) is used (helps express excitement, which is a quintessentially causal emotion) [Can\u2019t wait for our road trip!]the letter ends with a friendly closing phrase [Have a great trip! Hope to catch up with you soon!]ends with a casual sign-off that features the first name of the writer [Lots of love , (name <in the next line>)]there is the use of more casual, easygoing vocabulary and colloquial, everyday expressions in place of heavy, academic/bookish terms.So there you have it! The idea is to maintain a highly conversational tone since you are writing to someone who is very close to you, and you share a warm and cordial relationship with them. The key here is to maintain an informal register (tone) throughout, ensuring that you do not make lapses into formal tones as you write. Being tone-appropriate is what distinguishes a good writer from a not-so-good one. Now how about if we see all these principles above in execution? Observe through the following model answer that I have authored to illustrate good practices for an informal/causal letter:  Dear Carrie, Hope you\u2019re doing splendidly! I suppose you are, too, what with the camping holiday you\u2019re mulling over for the summer. Oh, going through your mail, I was positively chuffed to learn about that particular bit! You couldn\u2019t have thought of a better way to ginger up the summer! You\u2019re going to love it, getting the city out of your lungs, taking inthe pristine mountain air, getting out the camping grill, cooking out in the open, treating your taste buds as your eyes feast upon the raw beauty that surrounds\u2026it\u2019s the best! So as I understand, you\u2019re headed to the Himalayan lake of Chandratal. Capital choice! I guess my rant about the place\u2019s magical vibe finally got to you! Having been there, I thought I\u2019d clue you in about some things you may want to look out for. The road up there is treacherous, and things tend to get a bit dicey. You want to make sure you\u2019ve got a good pair of hands commanding the wheel. Speaking of which, you might want to consider being on board an SUV to stay on top of things, quite literally too! Also, things tend to get rather chilly post sundown; you may want to pack thick sleeping bags that keep you toasty. Finally, you\u2019d asked if I\u2019d like to come along. Well, you know, it\u2019s hard to pass up on paradise, especially when a friend is headed up there! I\u2019d love to! Let me see if I can get out of work around the time you plan to hit the road. It would be stellar to finally get to do this together! You\u2019ll be hearing from me real soon! Thanks a ton for the invite; hoping to do this together!

            "answer_text": "This is a good question, and it\u2019s actually quite easy to get a high band in Task 1 General Training. The most important thing is to show that you have understood that the scenario calls for a friendly letter. This should be reflected in the choices you make with respect to vocabulary and sentence structure. Avoid overly formal expressions and write in a way that would make sense in the context of communication between friends. For example: \u201cI am writing to inform you of my scheduled visit to your town\u201d is completely inappropriate. Instead, write: \u201cI\u2019m writing to let you know I\u2019ll be in your town next week\u201d. Also, if you have an opportunity to show that you have developed rapport with this person, take it: \u201cI know you like Chinese food, so I thought we could go to that restaurant by the promenade\u201d. Perhaps most importantly, don\u2019t overdo it. A lot of the advice on social media and the blogosphere is dangerously wrong about this. If you attempt to pepper your response with as many idioms and expressions as you can, your writing will come across as extremely artificial and even memorised. Keep it natural, simple, and to the point. Remember, IELTS is a test of your ability to communicate, not your ability to memorise idioms. If you\u2019re a competent writer, idiomatic language will emerge naturally. ",
