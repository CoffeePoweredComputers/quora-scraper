            "answer_text": "I am in favor of ____________ (proposal) because of Y1 _______________ and Y2 ____________ The proposal must be precise, and it should be an idea that hasn\u2019t been discussed to death. The Ys are your arguments. The \u201cI\u201d is yourself but it also stands for the issue. After you write the thesis, then you discuss the issue, but DO NOT ARGUE \u2014 yet. Then tell why you are a good candidate to be discussing the subject. That\u2019s known as ethos or, in modern terms, establishing your credibility. However, it\u2019s sort of optional. Then discuss your proposal. DON\u2019T ARGUE \u2014 yet. Just be precise. Think it through. Pretend you are presenting the proposal before some kind of governing board. Hypothetically, you need to answer all the questions they make-believe people will ask you. THEN discuss your arguments. 2\u20134 arguments is usually best. You need lots of facts. Just because you say something is true doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. PROVE IT. Then wrap it up. I have taught writing to 20K to 30K students, btw. ",
