            "answer_text": "Real estate, when speaking of the ownership of land, refers to the land - not the improvements (house or structures on the land) and usually the land extends to the center of the earth and into space.  Real estate is unique as no two pieces of land can be identical, therefore value is determined by the desirability of the land and the location (often based on proximity to a desirable geographical feature such as a City or body of water). The improvements are what most people think of when they are thinking of buying or selling real estate, when in fact most of the value is actually in the land.  The cost of the improvement can vary based on obsolescence, condition and wear/tear.   This is why in some parts of the world, people will pay huge amounts of money for land and then tear down the improvement that exists there.  The cost to tear down a structure isn't that high, and surprisingly the cost to build a new house on a piece of real estate is much more reasonable than many would expect. I like the WikiPedia Definition, but again, in my real estate texts from salesperson pre-licensing, as well as the texts from my brokers pre-licensing course,  the definition of real estate doesn't include the improvements because the pure value of the land and location, the unique factors and geographical features, are what most people seek before the improvements: Real estate is \"property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as crops, minerals, or water; immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this (also) an item of real property; (more generally) buildings or housing in general. Also: the business of real estate; the profession of buying, selling, or renting land, buildings or housing.\"From:  Real estate ",
