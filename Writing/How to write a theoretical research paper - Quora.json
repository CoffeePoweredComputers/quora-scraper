            "answer_text": "Original article written by me here at Linkedin: How to write a theoretical research paper? Often, it is difficult to produce experimentation of certain phenomena to be stuidied -either those experiments are completely non-feasible (such as in Quantum physics letters) or there may be resource limitations (expensive experiments, prolonged time for experimentations, data collection is labour intensive). In such cases ,the researcher opts for writing a theoretical research paper by relying the proof of his hypothesis on simulation o survey rather than experiment. Often, theoretical papers are not given sufficient weightage in engineering journals where the validation is feasible by experiments. But theretical papers are valuable in basic sciences such as physics where theoretical frameworks are valid if experiments are not feasible. A scientific theoretical paper background goes like this - 1.Introduction - This section discusses what others have reported in their research that is relevant to the research topic proposed by the author. The author also identifies the lacunae or the grey areas that have not been investigated and thus he is proposing this research. In the second part of the introduction, the author proposes how he is going to test his hypothesis which is basically the research methodolog. 2.Developing a Mathematical Model - A mathematical model is the theoretical model of the real system. It is obviously an approximate representation of the real world. A theoretical model is usually an under represented model of the real system with assumptions. Simple mathematical models (linear) are more approximate(or less accurate) and hence have large deviations from the real world problems compared to the complex models (non-linear). However, complex models make the simulations heavy with lot of processing time and memory and hence a middle approach (neither too simple not too complex) model is suugested. 3.Theoretical simulation 1 and 2 - the mathematical model is then simulated for a series of iterations using two types of numerical solution methods so that they are comparable against each other. An example would be to solve a differrential equation using MATLAB and then cross validating with a FEA results from a FEA package such as ANSYS. 4.Results and Discussion - Under results and disccusion , the author writes about the results of both the simulations, compare te results and lists the observations. He also highlights what went wrong with the assumptions, what were the errors and the indentified causes of those errors. 5.Conclusions -This is the last section of the paper. This is usually a smal paragraph where you will highlight what was intended before the theoretical simulation and what were the results. You will also discuss briefly what can b improved. You could discuss the applications of yur results.You can briefly discuss the future prospects for this work. 6.Abstract - This is the summary of your paper and 1st section of the paper. This is reserved to be done in the end of the paper. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean by a 'Theroretical Research Paper\" But if its something like a thesis here's what I use. But before you start please take the effort of framing your research topic well .It is extremely important and I cannot stress this enough. For any respected guide/expert a badly framed title is red flag. There are 5 parts to it. 1: Introduction 2: Review of Literature 3: Research Methodology 4: Analysis 5: Conclusion  1. Introduction: Here is where you write about why the study is relevant. Give a little bit of context as to what the study is about . The main objective of this chapter is to declare the primary and secondary objectives. Ideally your primary objective is your research title and the secondary objective/s are subjects that aid in providing perspective/addln info to your primary objective.  2. Review of Literature: This is considered important by many and helps you understand the topic better. Review of literature details all the reference sources that you have read to gain information/context for your research. This chapter also aids you to identify similar research carried out by others. This enables you to stress how your research is different from others.  3. Research Methodology: This chapter lists out your data collection tools and methods. This is where you mention stuff like Quantitative/Qualitative Analysis. You mention the merits and demerits of each method and how each method will help with the primary or secondary objective/s.  4.Data Analysis : This would perhaps be the most extensive chapter. Here you are grouping and analysing your data. Till this step you have a chunk of data that you gathered using various data collection tools at your disposal. Now you analyse all of those data. Here you include, graphs, pie charts and other tools to represent the data.  5. Conclusion: This is where you interpret the data. You have a graph which shows an increasing consumption of X with time?, tell why and why you think so.  Make sure that your conclusion is an answer to the research topic. \" A study on  feasibility......\" Ans: \"This study found it to be feasible (reasons).....\". I hope you get the idea. ",
