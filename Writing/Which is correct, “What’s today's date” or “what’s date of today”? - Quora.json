In order for the second one to work, I believe you would have to say \u201cWhat\u2019s THE date of today\u201d, not entirely sure, because this is never said in everyday parlance; you could alternatively say \u201cWhat\u2019s the date today\u201d, without the \u201cof\u201d, or simply, \u201cWhat\u2019s the date?\u201d ",

Technically the first one is grammatically incorrect because the second sentence is missing a word. You need to insert a \u201cthe\u201d between what\u2019s and date in the second sentence. The phrase I use is \u201cWhat\u2019s the date today?\u201d but that\u2019s just personal preference. ",
