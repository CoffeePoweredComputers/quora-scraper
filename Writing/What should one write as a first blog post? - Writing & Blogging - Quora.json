            "answer_text": "I usually write an introduction as my first post on a new blog. What I want out of this introductory post is for the reader to: get to know the postExpectations when they read the blog in future postsGet to know me and my writing stylewho I am affiliated to (if any)?I want my blogs to have the reader feel like they have been a part of the blogging process and they are the only ones having a conversation with me. You do not have to give every little detail. Hopefully, you will own your blog for a long time, and so the first year is spent finding your audience and allowing them to feel at home. By year two, you should have a good idea of what the average reader is about, and what they like and do not like about your blog. If you do not know by that time, you need to start finding out. This is another conversation for another day. First things first, and that is writing your first blog post, and concern yourself about the rest later. ",
