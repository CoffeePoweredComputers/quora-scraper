            "answer_text": "There is no easy way to answer this. In my time, I have seen, been part of and witnessed the sales of about 60 different screenplays and in each case the sale came to be for very different reasons. So each scenario is different. But let me just run through a couple of the most common ways that screenplays are bought and sold: AGENTS: Most if not all established writers that I have worked with sell their screenplays through their agents. As a professional, this is by far the best way because a good agent is in constant contact with the industry (the buyers) and knows what they want and what they are looking for. However, getting an agent is no easy task. Agents makes their living from the percentage they get off each successful sale. Serious, professional Agents, only represent a limited number of writers at any time. For that reason they have to make sure that the writers that they represent, are able to sell their screenplay . If they can\u00b4t sell the writer\u00b4s work, they don\u00b4t get any commission. In short; Agents are extremely picky about who they want to represent and tend to go with established writers who\u2019ve already sold a bunch of screenplays, already.- It\u00b4s indeed a catch 22. PRODUCTION COMPANIES: There are basically two kinds of production companies (when talking about theatrical features and not Television); The established Hollywood companies and the independent companies. Both groups are the actual buyers of screenplays but they go about acquiring them in somewhat different ways: The Established Hollywood Companies- This is pretty much a \u201cInvite Only Party\u201d. The industry is in severe crisis at the moment and I currently know of no production companies that accept un-solicited material or spec scripts. All the movies you currently see in the theaters are produced through a \u201ctop-down Model\u201d The ideas all come from producers who then shortlist and hire the screenwriters that they want to work with. At the moment, big budget movies have to be produced this way because the producers are the only ones who are in touch with the investing financiers and therefore knows what can and cannot be financed. However, with all this in mind, there are still the Pitch festivals: PITCH FESTIVAL If you live anywhere near L.A and have about 500 -1000$ to spare, you might consider enrolling in a pitch festival. At the Annual Pitch festival, you get a chance to pitch your screenplay to a select group of Hollywood executives. Be sure to prepare your perfect presentation as you will have no more than 10 minutes (approximately) to pitch your screenplay. However there is also the Independent market, to consider: INDY PRODUCERS and how to find them. Some but not all Indy companies still accept unsolicited material. In practical terms this means that they will on occasion accept to read screenplays from un-established writers. If you are such a person, this is one of your best bets. I suggest that you spend some time doing research in order to find those companies. A good way to start is through the \u201cIndependent film and television alliance\u201d check out their website for a list of independent production companies. Then go to each of those companies website and find out whether they accept unsolicited material or not. However, be are of the fact that this is an international organization so a lot of the companies listed, might be located abroad. If you are in doubt whether they accept unsolicited materials or not, do yourself a favor and inquire about this, through mail, before you submit anything. Another way is to go to ISA (international Screenwriting Association) They occasionally feature lists with producers who are looking for scripts. Their page also lists writing gigs. Yet another way to get in touch with Indy producer is through Podcasts. Many sites, such as ScreenwritingU, and Stage32, now offer podcasts with professional producers: signing up for a class with a professional producer might get you inside, down the line. COMPETITIONS: Screenplay competition\u00b4s is a somewhat new way to sell your screenplay. Some but definitely not all competitions invite professional producing judges to evaluate the competitors. In some cases, a first prize might yield an option with a company. When looking for a competition, make sure they offer \" Producer Reads\" - I say this with bated breath, because there are so many competitions out there that make a living from young hopeful writers but fail to have neither industry connections nor any interest in or ability to help you get sold. So, for your own sake, before you waste any money in submitting to a competition, please research it carefully. SCRIPT DOCTORS Some but definitely not all script doctors either have industry connection or better still, work for the professional industry. If you are lucky enough to find one of those, request their services and follow the suggestions for script changes they make. If they truly represent the industry and they like your script, this might yield an option on your screenplay. ",

            "answer_text": "[This advice is all based on the question asking about how to SELL your  script. That's different from developing it yourself or trying other  avenues outside of the studios, of course.] The \"answers\" are relatively easy to state, but very hard to achieve. Here are my ten bits of advice, then...  Your script is done? Good. Rewrite it. And rewrite it again. And again. Successful writing tends to involve more time rewriting than was spent on the previous stages of writing. Make it as good as you possibly can. Never say, \"oh it's good enough to show,\" because when you just get tired of rewriting and too anxious to wait and just start showing something too soon, you're being impatient and it probably means the script has problems you don't want to address (or perhaps aren't sure how to address). So rewrite.Write something else. Yes, this is relevant to selling the other screenplay you have -- because part of selling the screenplay is going to inevitably involve the question of whether you have any other imagination and ideas besides the one screenplay currently in your hand. So be sure to always have something new in the works. Sometimes people are more hesitant to buy something from a writer with only one project.Get feedback. Send the screenplay to everyone who is willing to read it, and then ask for feedback. The best feedback will be about what they liked, what they didn't like, and why. Sounds simple, but very often feedback can get into nuances and the reader's own ideas etc, so listen and pay attention to all of that, but the crucial feedback is always what they liked, what they didn't like, and why. This is to support the fact that you're going to REWRITE. Take the feedback, figure out how to enhance what they liked and how to fix what they didn't like, and then do it.Move to L.A.  It's true that lots of writers live somewhere besides Los Angeles and can effectively work as screenwriters. And it's true that modern technology makes it even easier to do that every year that passes. That's all very true, and it doesn't matter -- move to L.A. Proximity matters, being in the place where the movies get made matters, being able to attend events and go to the Writers Guild and make connections and show up for a meeting all depend on where you are. So be where you need to be. If you want to live somewhere else, you can move there after you establish yourself as a working screenwriter (but be willing to fly out to L.A. or to Canada to be on set or attend meetings whenever needed).Send query letters and then forget about it. Yes, you'll want to take some time sending some letters and making calls to agents. Just make sure first that they are an agency that accepts such inquiries, because most of the bigger companies that represent film talent will only consider people who are FIRST referred by someone the agency already represents. Meaning you have to know somebody they know, and then they'll call you. If you call them first instead, they'll just politely tell you that's not how the system works and that you need to be referred to them. Instead, look up directories of agents and agencies, and find the ones who are open to writer inquiries, and then look for an agent who either reps people writing screenplays similar to what you write, or look for an agent who has few clients and is younger and hungrier to make a name for themselves (and thus, for you). Make the calls, send the letters. But after you do, don't worry about it -- because although you'll definitely need an agent when the time comes to sign a contract selling your work or taking on a writing assignment, you'll still do most of the work of finding jobs yourself, so get used to it and spend your time writing and pitching your work, not hunting for an agent. This is especially true if you only have one screenplay -- remember the second point above? Go write something else!Send query letters and DON'T forget about it. Those letters and calls to agents aren't as important, since they'll find you or take your call when you have real need for them, but what are important are the letters and calls you should be sending/making to producers. Get a directory and look for production companies that accept unsolicited screenplays, and contact them. Also look to see who produced some films similar to the things you write, and see if they accept screenplays from writers, so you can send them your script as well. If you're going to spend time calling and writing people whom you want to help you sell your screenplay, you'll be much better off spending that time contacting people who make movies than people who rep writers, I promise.Learn how to pitch, and then do it.  Pitching isn't easy, but it's mandatory. Even if your agent sets up everything for you and gets you a buyer for your script or a writing assignment, you have to be the one to go in and meet and make the pitch for your screenplay and for yourself. You are pitching BOTH, so don't miss that point. You better be enthusiastic, better know your project inside-out, better be able to talk and able to listen, and you better know how to say, \"Yes I can do that,\" to every suggestion they make (and they'll make a lot). I really think writers should not just focus on the creative end of the situation, but also spend time reading and studying the marketplace and box office trends related to their genre as well as in a broad sense. Being able to pitch your project requires getting the producers/studio as excited about it as you are, which will inevitably involve helping them say \"yes\" to you because they believe your project will be successful, so learn the art of salesmanship and do it the way the best salesmen do -- by really knowing what your customer wants and helping them get it.Respect the people to whom you're trying to sell your script. I know a lot of writers think studio execs and producers don't know anything and don't care about creativity, and who think notes and suggestions and requests about changing and rewriting screenplays are just worthless, but you better accept that first of all (a) it doesn't matter because you're going to have to deal with execs and producers anyway and take all of those notes and requests and do all of those rewrites regardless of whether you like it or not, and (b) you're asking someone to give you a lot of money for your writing, and to risk a large investment bringing your artistic dream to life, so they not only have some interest and right to want to give input into this thing they're investing in, but they also might actually have some good ideas that make it more likely your script will transfer better to the film market and be a success. If you can't listen to them and tell them that you can make the script into what they want and need it to be, then they won't buy it, it's that simple. So recognize that your interests are served by investing in caring about their interests.Don't stop. It takes a long time to sell a screenplay, usually years before you'll get your first sale, if you EVER get it. So keep rewriting, keep working on new material, keep contacting producers and attending events and trying to get feedback and advice. Every day, all day, commit to it and accept that it might take a very long time.Be nice. Yeah, I said it, haha! While you move through L.A. and make contacts and friends, don't go around with the attitude that this is all about advancing yourself. Favors are the coin of the realm in Hollywood, and too many people are only interested in people who do them favors and trying to get favors from everybody. Don't be like that. Instead, be nice and do favors for other people if you can, when you can (be reasonable, of course, because the fact is that even as a new writer you'll slowly get more and more requests for favors and won't realistically be able to do most of them, but if you can then do). Everybody you meet who isn't already at the top (or moving quickly on their way up) is likely someone who WANTS to be, just like you, so remember that and remember that you wish people would be helpful and friendly and not just trying to use you for their own advantage, right? So don't just use other people, either, and instead do favors assuming they'll never be repaid, and if they are then take that as a great surprise. The point is this -- you aren't making friends and doing favors to try and self-promote, you do it because it will make you happier and help contribute to an atmosphere of encouraging that kind of attitude. That's important, it will benefit everybody the more that becomes true, and as a new person in a new town it's good to have friends who trust you and whom you know you can trust, too, regardless of whether any of you are famous or successful or not. Everybody's trying hard to make it, so help make the experience better for everyone if you can, and always tell yourself \"we're all in this together.\" It makes disappointments easier to take, it makes it easier to keep walking into meetings, it makes it easier to cold-call and do impromptu pitches, and since it will take you years to have a chance to sell a screenplay, this attitude will make those years a lot more fun. And if you're the kind of person who has trouble being nice and not trying to use folk to your own advantage, just remember something -- those people answering the phones and working in the mail room who you might be tempted to ignore and be rude to because you think they can't help your career? They'll be executives and running the place some day. Yep.",
