            "answer_text": "A complaint letter to the principal of a school may be sent by a student, parent of a student or a teacher employed in the school. Most states encourage the student, parent or teacher to first explain their problem to their principal in person before sending a formal complaint letter. \u200bIf this doesn\u2019t have the required effect, they should send a letter formally expressing their complaint, with details, and giving a recommendation for a satisfactory resolution. The principal may attend to complaints, but cannot legally tell others about the steps they have taken. It may be enough for the complainant to know that the issue is being attended to, but if things don\u2019t get better, they may want to consider sending a complaint letter to the superintendent of the school district or the school board. Before taking further steps, the parent or student should call the principal about a week after they have received the letter to learn if any measures are being taken. Sample Letter to a Principal Dear Principal, My daughter, Cal, who is in 8th grade mentioned to me that the dance tomorrow night has an Hawaiian Luau theme and that there is a reduced entry fee incentive to wear a costume. Without knowing more than that, I feel compelled to write to find out more and with some concerns that this raises for me. I believe that, as a nation, we do a rather inadequate job learning about indigenous/native cultures, so when the exposure to one of those cultures is less an opportunity for learning and more about adapting it for our entertainment, I believe as educators we send a wrong message. The harm of one small dance organized by students who may mean no harm on its own arguably is negligible -- but when it is part of a pattern of a society's cumulative disregard for inclusion, I find it more problematic, and therein lie my concerns. Since [school name] has diversity as one of its guiding principles (indeed one of the reasons we chose to have our daughter attend,) I hope that you will share my concerns. I am hoping that if the dance does indeed have the theme, that it might be followed with a school-wide initiative to know more about native Hawaiian cultures that involves a more comprehensive look. I am happy to help in that endeavor and offer these thoughts with a generous spirit. Sincerely, Cal\u2019s Mom(home 222-222-2222) ",
