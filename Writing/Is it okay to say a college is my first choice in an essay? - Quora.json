            "answer_text": "It\u2019s fine to say a college is your first choice in an essay. But the best way to \u201csay\u201d this is with an early decision application. That action is more convincing than words. Have you checked the school\u2019s aid policy? I realize that some families make more than the floor for receiving aid (i.e. let\u2019s say you\u2019re from NYC and your parents collectively make $135K \u2014 that may be top 15% in the country, but lower middle class by Manhattan standards, and not enough to pay for $50K/year at Stanford when they\u2019re renting a Manhattan apartment and paying for your two older siblings to go to college), but at some schools the financial aid team will look at each case individually. If you can explain your financial situation, the school may be willing to work with you. And if you have to say \u201cno thanks,\u201d because you can\u2019t afford it\u2014 that should not burn every bridge for all the other schools you\u2019re applying to. You can also reach out the financial aid office at the school before you apply and ask them if they make exceptions in terms of aid given parental income, ask them what would qualify you for aid, etc. You get to determine what \u201caffordable\u201d means, and you can turn down an offer if you find the aid package isn\u2019t affordable. At the same time if you\u2019d rather not have the pressure of making an instant decision on affordability after admission (if you\u2019re going to turn down an early decision offer, you have to do so quickly), and want to weigh both the size of the aid package from the college you speak of and other aid packages you get from regular decision schools, waiting may be the better option. You may want to ask yourself: How good are my chances of getting in to this school? Is it absolutely really where I want to go? Even if \u201cI\u201d want to go there, am I actually going to be making this decision in tandem with my parents and their financial ability to contribute? If you get in, will your parents be willing to contribute even though it will cost more than other options? Or will they be of the opinion that you should attend a state school or school that offers more aid? If the latter, that may influence your decision. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily get into the specifics of \u201cwhy this is my first choice but I didn\u2019t apply early\u201d \u2014 there are plenty of kids who just don\u2019t get around to early decision. If you want to say it\u2019s your dream school, that\u2019s fine. ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at my blogs, you'll notice that there's one called Your Academic Evidence. You're on trial and your application is your evidence. Now supposing you say that the school is your first choice. What evidence do you have to back that up? A statement made without corroborating evidence is called \"hearsay,\" and is inadmissible. So what are you going to back it up with? They don't want to hear about rank; they don't want to hear how you want to make all your friends jealous; they don't want to hear how cool this will make it to the people you might want to date. If you can't name three programs, professors, or organizations unique to that school, with actual details of why they make you want to go there, then you don't want to go there. For instance, when I chose to apply to Temple Law school, I was able to say that I wanted to study trial advocacy, and the man I'd seen interviewed on 60 Minutes was teaching at Temple. I was able to say that someone I knew from outside the law school on a personal basis was one of the trial advocacy instructors. And I was able to say I owned a house in Philadelphia and could bicycle to school and back. If you don\u2019t have this kind of evidence to back it up, your statements aren\u2019t credible. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re lies; it just means there is no particular reason to believe them. ",
