            "answer_text": "Off the top of my head I can think of 3 Beatles songs that were recorded by other artists which became No.1 hits in the UK in the 1960s. They are:- Michelle by The Overlanders in 1966 Ob La Di Ob La Da by The Marmalade in 1967 With a Little Help from my Friends by Joe Cocker in 1968 (probably most well known cover of a Beatles song) The Beatles obviously recorded all these songs themselves so I don't think it could be said that they were written \u201cfor\" other artists. Perhaps it was just the case of the record companies of these artists seeking permission for them to record their songs and have them released as singles. ",
