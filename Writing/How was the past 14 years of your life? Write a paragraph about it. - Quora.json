            "answer_text": "I\u2019m 18 and all the interesting stuff started happening when I was 4. I was a skinny child because I was a very picky eater. If I didn\u2019t like something, I just wouldn\u2019t eat it and my parents were fine with that. When I was almost 5 (or maybe I was 5, can\u2019t remember) I had an operation on one of my eyes. I had to wear an eye patch for almost a year. People still walk up to me and say that they remember me because I was the kid with the eye patch. I would have no idea who these people were so I guess when your eye has a giant bandage over it, you tend to stick out. Starting in fourth grade, I was taken to a studio once a week. The program was called Kids-4. It\u2019s a TV/Radio station almost completely run by kids. I didn\u2019t age out of the program until eighth grade. By that time I\u2019ve been on live tv, I\u2019ve been on the radio, and I\u2019ve done some acting in front of a green screen. I conducted interviews, I edited clips and audio. I found out that I really hate being put in front of a camera, but I loved doing things behind the scenes. I loved operation the special effects from the control room, operating the cameras, and editing the projects. In fifth grade, I was put in this reading program because my reading level was that of a third grader. My elementary school teachers kept telling my parents to get me tested because it was pretty obvious there was something wrong with me mentally (well not wrong exactly, more like different. I was wired differently than the other students). I didn\u2019t understand it, all I knew was that I was more emotional than my friends and the conversations I held were all over the place it was hard for other people to keep up. I\u2019d start talking about my favorite food before somehow ending the short one sided conversation talking about how brown is such an ugly color. My parents got me tested in seventh grade. I just had ADD so it wasn\u2019t anything too major. I got meds that the doctors kept upping the dosage on. Fast forward to high school. I turned 16, I\u2019ve been in the orchestra for a number of years, and I\u2019ve already had 3 internships based on videography. My dad got arrested for a crime he didn\u2019t commit, a few weeks later my mom got diagnosed with cancer. My little sister and I spent a lot of time home alone that year. Mom was in the hospital, dad was released on bond and he spent most of his time with my mom. He wasn\u2019t allowed on school property anymore. So he couldn\u2019t come to any of my concerts and mom was too sick to go. I wasn\u2019t driving yet so my mom\u2019s friend would drop me off before leaving. Then the pandemic interrupted my senior year of high school. Our graduation ceremony, prom, senior trip, and final concert got canceled. I just got my learner\u2019s permit today after passing the written test and in the fall I\u2019m going to college to study Visual Communications. It hasn\u2019t been the best 14 years but I\u2019m proud of where I ended up and I\u2019m looking forward to living the rest of my life. My sister is going to be 16 in the fall and it seems like just yesterday she was 4 ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently 13 years old. Close enough. I was born in 2007 on January 29th. My mom loved me but right from the beginning, my dad didn't want anything to do with me. As I look through my old baby pictures, I can see how bored and uninterested my dad looked with me. He lived with my mom and I for only a few months after I was born. Then she kicked him out because he wasn't doing anything to help her. I didn't see my dad often. Maybe once every 3 years. That changed once he decided to be a prick. My mom loved me very much but she did have a hard time keeping the house we lived in clean. My mom paid all the costs involving me and she had had enough with him so she put him on child support. It made my dad angry so he called child protective services on my mom. The house was a little messy so they took me away from my mom and I had to go live with my dad. I was7 or 8 at the time. My dad got me taken away from my mom because he didn't want to pay child support. He gave me my own princess room and I loved it! I didn't realize at the time what a piece of crap my dad was. He would always play with me and he had a girlfriend who would make paper doll clothing with me. I lived with him for a few months and went back with my mom who had fixed up the house. After that, I never really saw him. I've seen him like 5 times in 5 years. I used to blame my mom for not letting me see him but I finally realized that my dad just didn't care enough to see me. The only family I have is my mom and my brother. My aunt and clusins all some pot and do drugs. My oldest cousin even has over 20 felonies and has tried to choke his girlfriend. She was also a druggie. My girl cousin is dating a drug dealer and my third cousin is currently awaiting trial for punching a nurse. My grandma used to be kind but our relationship has turned very toxic within the last 6 months. I hate her now. My dad leaving me has caused me to be very insecure about myself. I find it hard to stand up to people who make fun of me and it has made dealind with my acne very difficult. I don't think I'm pretty and I don't think I'm smart. My mom tells me I'm beautiful every day but it's not enough to convince me. I'm going into 8th grade this year and I'm going to be facing all my old bullies. I'm hopeful but nervous. This time I'm going to try to have the courage to think better of myself and to try my best to stand tall. Hope everyone stays safe from COVID!! ",
