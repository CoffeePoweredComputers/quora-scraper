            "answer_text": "Articles are craftsmanship of a writer where his written piece of work serves to a particular topic and from then postered to the public through several means for them to read. If you are looking for publishing articles online there are a lot of blogging sites for free as well as paid (they give you a domain name and a website) to publish your articles online. I'd suggest you start up with a free blogging site and then after you gather a proper audience get the paid version of the blog or get a website and use Google AdSense or any other third party advertising agent to get your work monetized. If you are looking for publishing your articles on Newspapers or Magazines, get in touch with the editor or the Hard team of the News paper or Magazine and mail them or converse with them the gist of your article. Make sure your content does not have any material that was sourced from a copyrighted/patented content (if it does make sure you give the credits to the rightful owner - Applies for both blog as well as print) Get the deal done and your work will be rewarded. For a freelancer in News paper and Magazine your pay will range from Rs. 2 to Rs. 15 per word depending on the content. Settle for a base price initially, make continuous contacts with the editor and grow up with time for constant flow. Also, if you feel your work has some deep content set a prize for it and try to negotiate with the Editor. If you work well on the article and if you keep working for a particular Newspaper/Magazine they'll ask you to work on articles when they are not able to do one. Travel, food, politics, science and education, conflicts, and controversies are some topics that attract a lot of audience. ",
