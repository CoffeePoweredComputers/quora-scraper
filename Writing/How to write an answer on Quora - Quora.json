            "answer_text": " Before I begin writing an answer I go through a whole process to decide if I have something unique to say on the subject. If I\u2019m going to just repeat what everyone else is saying then I\u2019ll upvote the answers I enjoy and go on to another question. I go through that process here: Dirk Hooper's answer to What is your process of selecting good questions to answer? If I feel like there\u2019s something I can add, then I literally just start writing. This is a new thing and it\u2019s come after several years of being here on Quora. How often have you heard that writing becomes easier the more you do it? Guess what? It does. I\u2019m not new to writing. I\u2019ve been seriously interested in writing since I was very young and I took creative writing courses when I was around 13 years old. I took film and video studies in college, which is just basically learning how to write about film. And I\u2019ve been published as a comic writer, a poet, and in numerous articles. But writing didn\u2019t really become easy for me until I started writing for Quora. I have some foundational training in composition and I use those skills when I write. If you read my answers, most of them follow basic structure for a composition. Sticking to that makes my answers easy to read and it makes it easier to write. Basic Composition I will often frame the question in my own way, so if the question disappears or changes, my piece will still make sense. It also makes the piece better for publication elsewhere, if I get lucky enough to get recognized for a good answer. Then I do my best to set the plate and offer any background that\u2019s needed to understand what\u2019s led to my answer. I follow that up with a few points, or the meat of the answer. Finally, I wrap up the whole answer by summarizing what I\u2019ve written and try to give a broader thought on the issue. Research While I\u2019m writing an answer I\u2019ll try to recall anything I\u2019ve read that might back up what I\u2019m saying. If I can\u2019t come up with anything I might do a Google search to find some supporting material. In some cases, a solid quote from an authority on the subject can be a gift from glob, and bring authority to my own answer. I do my best to add links to sources as I go, it makes it much easier to add them while I write rather than go back and add them later. Editing Once I\u2019m through with the answer I read it out loud. What I\u2019ve discovered is that you\u2019ll find a ton of mistakes that way. Since I don\u2019t have a staff of editors who are looking out for what I\u2019m writing, a brief look at my writing and syntax is the least I can do to try to not look like an idiot. (I removed several words from that last sentence when I read it back\u2026 it works.) I often remove something at the beginning or end that just goes on too much. What Quora Has Done for Me All of this is the same way that I\u2019ve written since I was young. What\u2019s different now is my experience in writing on Quora. What I used to do was create an outline, then do some brainstorming on the subject, do my research, get a lot of information in front of me, and then write the piece. After writing for several years on Quora all of this comes naturally. The hardest part of writing, for me, and maybe for you, is just getting started. I used to talk myself out of an article before I ever began. That doesn\u2019t happen any more. I\u2019m confident now that whatever I set out to write will come out fine. In fact, it\u2019s probably confidence that Quora has given me the most. Writing regularly, seeing what others write, learning from them, and getting the feedback through upvotes and comments has forged my writing in fire. So Now? Now I simply start the answer and trust myself to get to the end. It\u2019s made me far more productive. I\u2019m still sticking to what I\u2019ve learned about basic composition to get me through the process, and I edit it to make sure it\u2019s easy to read, but it\u2019s the power and confidence that I\u2019ve gained by writing more often that has really set me free.
