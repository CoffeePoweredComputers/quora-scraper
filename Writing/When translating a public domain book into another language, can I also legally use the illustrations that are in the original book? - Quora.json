            "answer_text": "What an interesting question! The answer depends on why the book entered the public domain. (I\u2019m answering about US copyright, here. I\u2019m not a lawyer, and I\u2019m not qualified to speak about non-US IP rights.) If it was originally published in 1923 or earlier, then everything in the volume has passed into the public domain. If the book passed into the public domain because the author died more than seventy years ago, then you have to consider the artist\u2019s copyright separately. Can you find a date of death pre 1950 (at this moment? If not, it\u2019s probably still under copyright protection. If the book passed into the public domain because the author released it into the public domain\u2026 you might want to reach out to the artist or their estate. If they didn\u2019t fight the author\u2019s waiving copyright, then you might have an argument that the art too is in the public domain. \u2014 but wouldn\u2019t you want someone to check with you about your work before makng it their own?

            "answer_text": "If the book is in the public domain because copyright has expired, then yes, you can use the original illustrations along with a translation. If the book is more recent, an author could put the text in the public domain but the illustrator might not do so with the pictures, so in that case, you would not be able to use them. A similar case could occur if someone illustrated an old, out of copyright book with new illustrations. In that case, the illustrations would still be under copyright but the text would not be. ",
