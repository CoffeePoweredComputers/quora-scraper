But it's possible to draft a \" formal \" document on a piece of scrap paper, if it is witnessed and given credence by such a witness. Hoe does it/ they differ?  The more complicated, the better. The more anchored in expectation and labyrinthine wording, the better.  But in the end... It's about how serious the intent is.  A document, a letter, a note... They become  'formal' when witnessed and thus acknowledged. ",
