            "answer_text": "If you want a letter to sound as if several people wrote it, each person having a distinct personality, then you should create several characters. Use the same method that an author uses to create a character for a story - build the character\u2019s voice by jotting down ideas about their background in life; which town do they come from, what\u2019s their job? Give one of them a very shy personality, and another an arrogant character, then you use these two to create a line of thought that creates a moving scale of characteristics. Miss Modesty in the middle and Mr Agreeable to her right. You could have a narcissist just off of the arrogant one to create some pretty loud friction in your letter. ",
