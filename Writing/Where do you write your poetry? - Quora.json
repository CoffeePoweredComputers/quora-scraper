Since I write a lot about people and their behaviour it can be in cafes, airports, pubs, anywhere where people populate. Here\u2019s one I wrote whilst walking in the woods with my dogs - The Smuggies Written after an encounter in Hirst Woods on 08.06.2020. * Behold The Smuggies, see their ostentation, Gestures designed to invoke admiration, Strutting through the woods with feigned elation, Thinking they\u2019re entitled to adulation. * See how they occupy the footpath without caring That this is a footway we should all be sharing, Straddling the entire space, they\u2019re not for moving. If we don\u2019t move their faces are disapproving. * Safe spacing it seems is not their responsibility. When we hold our ground we suffer their hostility. We lesser mortals are supposed to give them passage. \u201cWe\u2019re superior\u201d clearly is their message. * Heaven forfend if we impede their jogs To exercise ourselves and our dogs. How dare we occupy their running tracks And our dogs cause histrionic panic attacks? * Off they go, the sniffy, sneery Smuggies Disdainful expressions on their snooty muggies, Offended that we peasants had the temerity To hinder their showy-offy run for charity. * Lynne Joyce 19.06.2020 ",

            "answer_text": "I write my poetry in a variety of places. For the place of the actual words of the writing, I often write in a spiral or composition notebook, when I don\u2019t have access to the internet, and later transcribe it neatly into a google doc. Sometimes, I write it straight into the google doc. Other times, I write a poem on a piece of scrap paper, and save it in my pocket until I can get it down on something more permanent.I publish my writing on Wattpad, in two different books made for that purpose.As to where I am when I am writing, there are three main places- school, at home either in my room or the living room, or on the go, in my pocket notebook or a scrap of paper.
