            "answer_text": "Writing is your mirror. You write on paper what pops up in your mind. Read it. It makes no sense to you. It does. But the first thought is not in measure with the last one, nor the rest of the thoughts, with each other. Whereas if you want to write an essay or an article about anything, you will write in an articulated form. You think first. You try to make sense with your thoughts. You concentrate on 'one' thing. You will put into words what you want to believe or say. It's no more nonsense. It's your mind now. It's an articulated form of thoughts and ideas, given life. That is what writing does. It changes the aimless shoot out of your million thoughts inside your brain, into something that tells a story. It changes 'mere' chain of nonsensical thoughts into a systemised argument of your belief. Your belief regarding whatever it is that you're writing. So write. And write just to look at how your own thoughts appear in the form of words. Because writing is a mirror, it reflects the 'image' of your mind, which is imageless. So try writing. ",

            "answer_text": "HEY THERE! I personally feel that it's very important sometimes to write down what you feel. Because there are times when we are so confused, we don't understand what we feel and don't. There are times when we have mixed feelings, when we feel something else and end up speaking something else. When we write down what we feel, when we write our heart out, the heart feels lighter. If you don't agree to this, try it out yourself. Take a piece of paper and write down whatever is troubling you, whatever is hurting you, whatever is making you cry, whatever is making you happy, whatever you want to do, what you don't want to do, what your brain is thinking and what your heart is feeling. Once you write it, read it twice and understand what are the real feelings and what are the temporary ones. Once you do that, it becomes easier to know yourself and even if you don't come to a conclusion, ki farak penda hai? If nothing went right, nothing even went wrong. So, try it for yourself and for the constant dilemma between your heart and mind. ",
