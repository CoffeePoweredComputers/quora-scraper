            "answer_text": "For the most part, green is just considered an acceptable alternative to red. Students and businesspeople use black or blue for permanence and legibility, while red is used for corrections by teachers and editors as an easily noticeable contrast to black and blue. Green is also a good contrasting color and is easier on the eyes for long grading/correcting sessions, and a decade or so ago they were also popularized on the idea that a bad grade in green isn't as harsh or upsetting to a student's delicate sensibilities as red is.

            "answer_text": "Like Michelle said, it's much easier on the eyes than red is when annotating or editing text or some other work. Red has become associated with error and failure, as when you receive a \u201cbleeding red\u201d exam. I do find it odd that you seem to have difficulty getting green ballpoints. It's still a common color for a ballpoint, unlike say, purple. ",
