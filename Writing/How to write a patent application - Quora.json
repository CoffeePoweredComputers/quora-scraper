            "answer_text": "I'd recommend looking at prior patents in the same technology area.  But keep in mind, title, drawings, abstract, etc. are all secondarily.  The claims are the most important part of the patent since defines the patent right.   So start by drafting a set of solid patent claims and build from there. Here are some other tips. MeetingWave Blog: Have a great idea? What about a Patent?   http://shar.es/38fyk The point of the blog article is simply to save money and possibly generate a stronger patent application. I still recommend having an attorney or agent review before filing. However, if looking to save money, I don't recommend calling an attorney, explaining the invention over the phone and have him/her generate the application from scratch. That\u2019s a massive waste of money. I recommend preparing the first draft yourself and than have the patent lawyer review and provide comments. The blog talks about during a thorough search of patents and published applications to determine if patentable and than using the closest found as templates to generate a draft. The primary purpose of filing any application (provisional or nonprovisional) is to secure a filing date for the subject matter disclosed in the application.  I recommend filing a provisional application since cheaper to file and can be updated cheaply throughout the following year SO LONG as it\u2019s as complete as possible so that it can ultimately support any patent claims issuing based on that filing. That is, draft and file the application with details, claims, drawings, etc (i.e., don't skimp) as if a regular application, but file provisionally. Then, during the year, if you come up with any improvements as your product is developed, you can update what you first filed and file a second time and get a second date that can be relied upon for the additional innovations.  At the end of the year, you should file the fully updated application as your nonprovisional and any foreign filing.  The provisional application should be complete as possible. Doesn't have to include claims, but drafting claims will provide the structure you need and also a good way to start thinking about different aspects/embodiments or your invention. I usually draft a mega set of claims first and once nearly settled on language/terms, use that to draft the specification. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re planning on doing everything yourself, the first thing you need to do is block off many weeks/months to learn how to do it properly; it\u2019s a major commitment once you decide to apply for a patent on your own. After all, patent law is one of the most complex areas of law that exist. Now, I\u2019m assuming you are doing it yourself to save money? Well if you end up doing it yourself and mess up, good chance you\u2019ll end up spending at least 2x more than you would have if you hired an attorney in the first place. Even if your application is initially approved, damage from doing it yourself can appear many years later when other companies\u2019 attorneys notice the loops in your inherently weak application. If you feel that you cannot afford an attorney, you can minimize high-rate billable hours by doing as much research as possible on your own to verify the eligibility of your patent, and assembling all relevant documentation and material to reduce a lawyer\u2019s billable hours down the road. Anyways, here are some tips on writing your own patent application: It is imperative for you to conduct a thorough search of \u201cprior art\u201d before going through the burden of beginning the application. (side note - patent attorneys on LawTrades offers free preliminary patent searches)Make sure you are clear and complete in your writing. Don\u2019t give the good (but likely unhappy) people at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) a reason to deny you for lack of clarity. To achieve this, use objective observations rather than using subjective puffery.When writing the description, you are expected to include the following: title, technical field, background information and prior art, description of how your invention addresses a technical problem, list of figures, a, detailed description of your invention, and an example of intended use.It\u2019s helpful (and sometimes overwhelming) to take a look at patents that have already been issued. Head to the USPTO website and search for patents issued that are similar to your invention.I invite you to check out LawTrades to receive a fixed upfront price quote for your various patent needs.
