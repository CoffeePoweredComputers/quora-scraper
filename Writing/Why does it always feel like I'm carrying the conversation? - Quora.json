I am going to assume you are a talkative person if you feel you are carrying the conservation. But trust me social skills are not so bad, just remember who you are talking to and whether or not the person wants to actually socialize with you. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you uncomfortable with silence. Sometimes I stop talking to see if they pick up, but only do this if i get the feeling you have. I think if I'm always the one to start conversation, it's probably not because I'm like a ninja and they never see me walk in the room. I don't really care to force a relationship with anyone, even if I like the other person. ",
