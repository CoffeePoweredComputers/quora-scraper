            "answer_text": "The basic reason for this tilt is aerodynamics.You can observe, the car where speed is essence you will find the tilt is on the higher side like lamborginis and ferraris. Whereas some cars like people carriers (vans) or adventurous vehicle like jeeps, you will find the windscreen is very slightly tilted.The higher tilt in the windscreen allows the air to flow smoothly over the car and thus reduces the drag. This results in better acceleration of the car and also achieve higher speeds in lesser amount of fuel. Note: This is my 1st answer. Kindly ignore any grammatical or spelling mistakes. ",

            "answer_text": "Car windshields are tilted mainly to decrease the likelihood a rock picked up by a nearby car's tires will cause a crack if it flies toward and impacts the windshield.  By tilting the windshield the rock has a better chance of glancing off surface rather than being a stopping surface. ****Edit:  They are also tilted and curved for better aerodynamics.  It gives the car less wind resistance. ",
