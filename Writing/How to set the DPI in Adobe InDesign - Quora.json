            "answer_text": "The dpi of any document created in indesign can only be specified when exporting to an appropriate file format (PDF, JPG etc). There is no default setting.  This allows greater flexibility to specify a range of export qualities to enable smaller file sizes for proofing and larger, quality outputs when creating documents for print etc. It's worth noting that lower quality linked images within an indesign document won't improve with higher export settings, so always use the best quality imagery appropriate to your desired output. For example: ~300dpi CMYK imagery for print. ",

With \u201cAll\u201d option DPI was greatly improved. ",
