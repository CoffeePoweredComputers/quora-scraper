            "answer_text": "They are both present tense, but the one with being has progressive aspect. This locates the focus of the action internal to the time-period the verb refers to: \u201dThey are being taken care of\u201d - the process is ongoing at the time of utterance, \u201cat present\u201d. \u201cThey are taken care of\u201d - the present tense in its own, in a main clause, usually refers to a generic activity that applies at all times, e.g. \u201cKangaroos are taken care of by their mothers until they are able to forage for themselves\u201d. The present also often refers to future time: \u201cThere\u2019s no point building facilities for them - from next July they are taken care of by the State.\u201d Basically there are strong constraints against the use of the present tense on its own to refer to present time (its better name is the non-past tense). If you want to refer to what is happening now, at least in a main clause, you normally need progressive aspect. ",
