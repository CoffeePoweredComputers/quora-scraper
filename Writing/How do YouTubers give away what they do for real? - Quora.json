            "answer_text": "Organizing Give aways is really not an easy task the key reason behind it is SEO and get better rank in YouTube algorithm. Most of YouTuber who already have a dedicated user base generally partners up with some brand in order to boost their product will give away such products. The generally eligibility criteria is to Comment in their video , Like , Subscribe and follow them on their social media. Think of it this way if that YouTuber really has a intent to give a certain product for free what are the chances that you will get that probably 1 in 100000. You may think lets try our luck or you find that YouTuber to have a really good heart and so did the rest of the other 100000 who commented. Even though he/she gives free stuffs ( brand partnership ) all it really does is boost their content. I mean think about it they get good user response YouTube favours that and his/her brand partnership has also got their limelight. So it is a win win scenario for the YouTuber. If my answer helps an upvote will be really appreciated. Thanks ",
