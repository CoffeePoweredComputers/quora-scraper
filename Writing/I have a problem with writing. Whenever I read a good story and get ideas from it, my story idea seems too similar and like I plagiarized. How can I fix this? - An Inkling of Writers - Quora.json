            "answer_text": "It is far from unusual to borrow from the authors we love. Many of the greatest authors have done this. Shakespeare, for instance, picked up a great deal older material, rewrote it in his own voice, and now we borrow from him left and right. I think that a degree of self-awareness, and observation, is what prevents a person from plagiarizing a story that inspires him or her. When a character in your story is saying such-and-such, is that it really character from the book you\u2019ve read speaking? That\u2019s just ripping off. Or when a character from your book, who happens to be inspired from a book you\u2019ve read, is saying such-and-such, is that character saying something a friend of yours would say? Or, better yet, is that character saying something you would say? If so, you\u2019re starting to find your own voice, and you can tell old stories in a refreshing voice. The self-awareness necessary to tell a good story can take time, and a lot of reflection, to gain. It can be unpleasant because it means finding one\u2019s own faults, that the antagonist of your story would be understandable, that the protagonist would have his or her (perhaps fatalistic) shortcomings You like a story in a spaceship and want to tell a story with a similar premise? Fine. But what would YOU honestly say if you were in that situation your characters are in? What would make YOU snap as the villain does? Personally, religion has helped me understand myself better. Getting older, and hopefully wiser, naturally helps. And there are plenty of great books by very self-aware authors, I find Shakespeare and Dostoevsy (who never use straw men as central characters) to be two of the most glaring examples, which can help. Even characters as despicable as Iago and Rastalnikov are very understandable, and relatable. With just a little commitment and patience, anyone can make great strides. And when a person knows him or herself better, worries about plagiarism should cease. \u201cKnow thy self.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Keep writing. Good storytelling makes itself different enough. The best stories are the way they are because the pieces fit. Characters do what they absolutely would do in that situation \u2014 and you learn to see them so clearly, you know how the smallest distinctions mean your story has to go somewhere different. In fact, don\u2019t try to make your story more different from others. That usually leads to forcing it, and making characters and events ignore what should happen just to make yourself more different. Instead, focus on how you\u2019ve already planned part of your story\u2019s essentials to be a combination nobody else has tried \u2014 some part of it has to be a bit different. Trust in that part, and do it justice. If you write the best story you can, and it comes out clearly unlike anything else, you\u2019ve made yourself original. Or if your best work is still a bit like other stories\u2026 then it\u2019s easier to sell. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with being inspired by the work of others. The true test of creativity is jumping off from an idea and adding your own twists to it. Shakespeare, for example, borrowed all his plots from earlier, popular works or from history. In effect, all his plays were reboots. What makes him great is the way he transformed the material he borrowed: he added and removed characters, gave those characters more depth, compressed events, and engaged his audience. You can change an idea for the sake of change, but you probably haven\u2019t made your story any better than the original. When you do borrow, you need a clear understanding of exactly what you borrowed and why, you need to transform it in a way that avoids any accusation of plagiarism, and you need to give it a compelling function in your own work. If you can\u2019t do all those things, you\u2019re better off depending on your own inspiration. Over time you\u2019ll develop a feel for which ideas to develop and which to let ferment for a while longer. ",
