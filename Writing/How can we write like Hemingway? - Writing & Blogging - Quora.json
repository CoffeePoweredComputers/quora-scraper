            "answer_text": "Wow \u2014 I\u2019m curious \u2014 why would you want to write like Hemingway? I mean, Ernest Hemingway was a great writer and all, but he is Ernest Hemingway. He wrote like Ernest Hemingway because he was Earnest Hemingway. James Joyce wrote like James Joyce because he was James Joyce. E.M. Forster wrote like E.M. Forster because he was E.M. Forster. I am not Ernest Hemingway so I cannot write like Ernest Hemingway. Writing as self-expression I guess what I am trying to say is, we all write as an expression of our selves, who we are. What we write on the page is a distillation of all our past experiences and all our hopes and dreams. Everything that we are leaks and seeps into every page we write. Every word we choose marks or reflects our \u201cidiolect\u201d and our \u201cvoice\u201d as authors. Writing within a temporality If we believe narrative theory, we can only write from who we are. We cannot write \u201clike\u201d somebody else. We can imitate other writers, I suppose, as an exercise. We can look to other writers\u2019 writing style to learn from but other writers\u2019 writing should be more of a springboard for our own writing. Ernest Hemingway wrote from another historic epoch \u2014 his writing is a distillation of that historic epoch. We are present in this here and now. We can write with sensibilities from the here and now. Writing as a \u201cre-writing\u201d of universal themes Aiming to \u201cwrite like\u201d another writer would be a betrayal of who we are as a writer, as in individual. They say that there are only limited plots and conflicts in the universe. Since human beings have begun leaving written records of their lives and activities for millennia, we have exhausted all the possible plots and conflicts there are or there will ever be. Every story we can ever tell has already been written about by somebody else in the past. But it is also a truth that every writer in every age \u201cre-writes\u201d what has been written before his or her time. Every writer now will echo other writers in the past. Every writer from the past that a writer in the present has read will help shape who that writer will become in the future. As writers, we read other authors because we may find inspiration from what they have written about or the manner by which they had written. Writing stories only I can write It is for this reason that beginning writers are always advised to write the story only they can write. So, Ernest Hemingway is a White man. If I am not a White man (I am a brown middle-aged woman), I cannot pull it off writing like the White man Ernest Hemingway was. I have to write as a brown middle-age woman would. The topics I choose to write about, the characters I create, the settings I put my characters in \u2014 they are all a product of my being a brown middle-aged woman. Ernest Hemingway wrote dialogue the way he did because of his discipline as a journalist. Since I am not a journalist, I may not craft my sentences the way he did. To force myself to \u201cwrite like\u201d Ernest Hemingway will probably bend my writing. Writing to find my own voice Writing like some other author will show in the final output. Unfortunately, when we write \u201clike\u201d some other author, our characters and the \u201cvoice\u201d in our writing becomes inauthentic. I will be writing a story but there will be the ghost of Ernest Hemingway hovering in every sentence, every paragraph and scene. Writing our own truth While there are commonalities that bind us all as human beings, we as individuals have our own personal truths. There are experiences we have had that speak to the truth of our own experiences. It is from these personal truths that we write. And we cannot write our own personal truth using the voice of some other writer who may have his or her own personal truth. Your voice is as good as anybody else\u2019s So, there really is no incentive for any writer to \u201cwrite like\u201d some other writer. I guess every writer has to find his or her own \u201cvoice\u201d and write with that voice. Your voice and my voice \u2014 they are as good as anybody else\u2019s voice and this is why we should all write like ourselves, not like some other author we admire. I am sorry if this answer does not give you the answer you were hoping for. ",
