            "answer_text": "I was born in Colombia, I lived there for 18 years. Throughout all those years I felt somewhat out of place when it came to socializing and relating to other guys my age because every single guy I met was a soccer fanatic, which I wasn't. Then, I came to the U.S. and I felt even more out of place as I couldn't relate to football! I tried to get into it and although I learned to like it, I have no passion for it either. Then, I started to party and that was fun for some time but then again, I found no passion for it so I stopped. Then I tried basketball, then camping, then indoor rock climbing and although I liked it, I had no passion for any of those.  Then, one of my friends took me to a lake where there was a pulley system that pulled people while they rode a board at 20 mph.   \u200b\u200b(not me) Woah!!!! My mind was instantly blown away and I knew I had to do it, it's called wakeboarding. I started going by myself all the time investing more time and money on it and I DEVELOPED a passion for it. People looked up to me for doing it, people praised the passion I spoke of it with, when I told them about it. Then, about 2 years later, I stopped for financial reasons. However, through that process I learned that I love water and watersports so I started researching water activities where I don't spend as much money. That's how I came across paddleboarding and snorkeling. That's what I do now and I absolutely love it, I am starting to DEVELOP a passion for it.   \u200b\u200b  \u200b\u200b(Me) So why am I telling you this? Because many of us have to search and search for what it is that makes us vibe and lose our minds and lose sleep over. I was never passionate about anything before, but after daring sample different things, I know that when someone says watersports, lake or anything beach related, I am the first one to sign up for the plan. In fact, people look for me so I can take them with me and I can show them how to have fun in the water! If you are not passionate about something, it means that you haven't looked hard enough! Have you tried watersports? Martial arts? Skating? Singing? Making music? Writing? Selling things? Traveling on your own? Joining a group? You should keep an open mind and be creative, step out of your comfort zone and present yourself with NEW things, break your daily routine. Go out there and look for it because it is not going to come looking for you. Soon enough, you'll find out that there's something that will hijack your attention and you'll want to do it more and more. ",

            "answer_text": "Try rephrasing the question for yourself, what things do I do that I have no interest in, what things do I do that frustrate me, what things do I do that scare me... wait you are not doing anything that scares you yet... bingo if it scares you a little it might be something you really want to do but you fear failure because it stretches your mind a bit more than you want, you have surely heard you need to get out of your comfort zone this is exactly what is meant, doing something that scares you a little. I am not talking about going out and robbing a bank, hitting a politician or stealing a car, not something stupid, but something that you have to ask yourself and you think what if I could really do that, and your mind tells you uh no, don't even think about it you will fail, your friends and family tells you no, you need to do something that is more reasonable or even realistic, exactly here is where I would start looking. If it challenges you and makes you wonder what if I could do it keep in mind fear and fascination are very close to each other within your mind, this is why we tend to learn new things easier, because we fear them and are fascinated by them at the same time.  So be aware that you can find 100 excuses not to do something and surly they would all be good ones to not to do something that challenges you, so I ask you instead to  think of the one reason why you should do it and then imagine how you would feel if and when you succeed and by the way you will succeed because when you take this route you wont give up and thus you cannot fail, failure is when you give up. Also keep in mind you determine your choices no one else can do so for you, and you surly have something you can be passionate about if it is just eating ice cream or pizza You see passion is not a predetermined thing within your life, it is a feeling that makes you feel good, that makes you want to do it more often then not, this is why so many people have problems finding passion they are looking for something solid that you can grasp onto a skill or a career choice, or some other item, but passion is a feeling that burns hot and cold at the same time, it can warm you up and cool you off within a split second. You know that feeling you get when you drink something really really cold and it hits you between the eyes that is not passion that is just freak-in cold so that is not the type feeling either, or that feeling you get when you see your dream partner, that jittery feeling between your legs and the pounding of your heart that is close but that is not it either, that's called lust. Just rest assured when you find it you know it, of that that you can be sure. ",
