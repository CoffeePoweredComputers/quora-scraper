            "answer_text": "Write your first letter when you are angry and hurting and put down every time you felt wronged or offended by anything at the job. Print it and set it aside. Sleep on it and wake up with fresh eyes to read your letter and pencil whip it. Ask a wise and trusted friend to read it and pencil whip it. Next day, read it and pencil whip it again. In cooler light, with a cooler head and a calmer heart, you are sure to find you have revisions yet to make. Make them and mail it. It\u2019s the third day after you wrote the first draft. You are not likely to have regrets about what you said or didn\u2019t say in the letter, and you may get the results for which you hope. Keep the first and subsequent drafts so you can see how your thinking changed as you calmed down a bit. Take them out and read them now and then. The time will come you\u2019ll laugh at yourself. Stay safe! ",

            "answer_text": "Get help. Once you are fired, you are gone. It is harder to come back. The boss is going to lose face if you come back without good reason. In order to come back you are going to need to use: local employment law (and this varies depending upon where you are, the USA has different laws from the UK for example).the contractcircumstances around your termination. (e.g. more evidence).Secondly, terminations are emotional. You are not thinking straight. This is a time for objective advice. A long 5 page letter full of fluff because you are hurting is not going to work. You need advice which tells you what to write, and keep to the point - the boss is a busy person you need to make clear why he was wrong. And each case is different. You need to get help. ",
