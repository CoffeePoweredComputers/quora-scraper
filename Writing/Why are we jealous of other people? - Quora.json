            "answer_text": "Often jealousy is based on insecurity (sometimes then mixed with fear and rejection, or a fear of not being able to be what another person is, and may present as feeling envious of their jobs or achievements.) Sometimes they feel that since they always seem to have unfairly less (disadvantaged through no fault of their own ) they want what the other person has, sometimes not even really wanting that, but just want it purely because the other person has it, whilst they don't, and then this kind of jealousy that is based in covetousness (simply put, lust or greed) may lead to demand by entitlement, but based on quite ridiculous excuses for its existence. (by example , you may get a member of one ethnic group who perceives that it seems to be only people of the other group that drives smart cars, and lives in big houses,, then assuming that it's those \u201cthings\u201d and that race or ethnicity that has unfair advantage purely for that reason, (nothing else than an \u201caccident of birth\u201d.) . But still perceives the obvious success of those people as what HE should aspire to.. But can't get there. (thinking then it's the TRAPPINGS that will justify himself to others.. But this is not so. Most others would TELL him so, and even if he sees it, he SO desires the mouth-watering success that he feels that status brings that he will virtually sell his soul to get the status brought by the \u201cthings\u201d so that he too can gain acceptance to that high status group. Thus to him it becomes perfectly valid to be covetous or greedy, and he may well stop at nothing. I have friends who have so many homes that they cant even use each one each year for more than three days at a time every second year, and gave a yacht on the Ned and own a, few racehorse, whilst I also know others who live in a tin house and wake with their feet in a pool of water in the Winter and have to cut the firewood at 4 in the morning in order to boil the water to have a hot wash before work. The level of jealousy in one is painful but easy to undsrstand, whilst the others simply don't see the seeming injustice that the others feel, since they see their forefathers hard-won prosperity almost as a birthright. Of course we all know that jealousy is just wrong, but until we have experienced the sourness of having to be made to take pleasure in \u201cbeing granted a privilege of walking through the \u201csteam\u201dof the rich man's shower\u201d, then we can't really begin to identify with it. It takes a colossal amount of maturity to be so assured and confident as to watch another man prosper when all you ever meet are closed doors. I've been through times when I've struggled with not having much money, and so did my mother who was once a Pauper\u2019s child, and it hugely influenced the way my mother handled her life. Fortunately she had the character herself, (as well as a very proactive and ambitious husband and she didn't become an \u201cI demanad\u201c) .. but almost over compensated by acquiring all the trappings that she perceived to represent success. (she BUILT a kingdom around herself) and modelled herself on the Queen Mother. It's ridiculous, but if you didnt understand the shame my mother experienced you wouldn't have known why she seemed to always be chasing an image. She too wanted to be welcome in upper society! Thus she spent her whole life laying a secure foundation for me and my brother so that neither of us would EVER need to have her experience. They say it goes like this\u2026 Jealousy, bitterness, anger and then to its fullest, murder (murder the reputation, the person or deprive them of their posessions and image by acts of vengeance based on jealousy and envy. Thus if these groups perceive its the Constitution of a country that is biased against them, specifically depriving THEM , they will.. change the Constitution\u2026so that it DOES \u2026. give \u2026. them the fruits of the land\u2026based on entitlement, justified or not.

            "answer_text": "Because we all want more than we have, some of us are confident, secure and have faith they can achieve their goals on their own, others will find those to assist them. Those who do not have this confidence or are insecure have goal, wants and desires as well, but they do not have the faith in themselves the will achieve it. They see what they want or desire, they know what they want, but they do not have it for sure. When they see others who have these, or have access, they envy and become jealous because they have what is not in their grasp yet. Some have things or feel as so, that they deserve them, own them or have rights to them and if this ownership or or acquisition is threatened by anyone, they feel jealous and angry that they may loose what they feel is rightfully theirs, even if it is not, they may feel so. These people out of lust, love, envy or because of the possibility of loss of something or someone they feel is rightfully theirs feel an extreme emotional loss and anger at anyone or thing that may have help or caused this loss. These people are insecure and lack confidence, they have little control of their emotions and can commit unbelievable acts to protect their interests, stop any threat to their interests or punish anyone causing this threat or even assisting in it. They ignore common sense, logic and ration because this emotion is so strong. Some of us want little, some of us want a lot and some of us do not have what it takes to achieve it, these are insecure and will be jealous of those who can achieve it. If you have no doubt you can achieve anything you choose as long as you devote the effort necessary to achieve it and do not quit, there is no reason to be jealous, you may want or envy, but jealousy is for those who can not achieve it.
