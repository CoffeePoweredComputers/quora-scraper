            "answer_text": "Dos 1 . Do find out what are your most common mistakes. Checking your work at the end is really important, but many students complain that they don\u2019t have time. You can make this process more efficient by checking your work when you practice and writing down your four or five common mistakes. After a while, you will get to know your more common mistakes and fix them quickly.You could also use grammar checking software like Grammarly to help you spot mistakes.2 . Do read the instructions carefully. Seems like a very obvious one, but it is one of the most common mistakes students make in IELTS writing task 1.Take one minute to read the question a few times and really understand what it is asking you to do. Practice will also help you familiarise yourself with the different types of task 1 question and save you time in the exam.3 . Do paraphrase the question. You will lose marks for copying the words in the answer and the examiner is looking to see if you can paraphrase the question. To paraphrase, simply use synonyms to change keywords.Example:Question: The graph below gives information about cinema attendance in the UK between 1998 and the present, with projections to 2018.Paraphrased: The diagram shows data of movie-goers in the United Kingdom from 1998 until now, with forecasts up to 2018.As you can see, the meaning has not changed but the words have. This should be the first paragraph in your essay.4 . Do use signposting language. These are words and phrases that tell the examiner what you are writing about. They are sometimes also called \u2018discourse markers\u2019.Examples include \u2018The graph/table/chart shows\u2026\u2019, \u2018The most significant change is\u2026.\u2019, \u2018Another noticeable change/trend is\u2026.\u2019, \u2018Overall\u2026\u2019.Remember that these should only be used appropriately.5 . Do practice on IELTS answer sheets. Many students worry about not writing at least 150 words in IELTS writing part 1. A clever way to always know how many words you have is to practice on the official exam answer sheets and then you will be able to judge how much space you normally use for 150 words.A quick google search will help you find these.6 . Do know how to describe change. You will pick up easy marks if you know how to accurately describe change. From very small to very large, here are some examples:Minimal-slight-gradual-moderate-considerable-significant-substantial-enormous-dramatic.You will normally have to describe change in your task 1 essay and these more advanced words will help you gain some valuable marks for \u2018lexical resource\u2019.7 . Do spend time organising and planning your answer. This is one of the main differences between students who score well in IELTS writing and those who don\u2019t. It is never a waste of time to plan your answer as this will help you score well by giving a clear and coherent answer.Familiarise yourself with the different question types and then learn the different structures for each one. For example a bar chart should look like this:Paragraph 1- paraphrase question.Paragraph 2- overview.Paragraph 3- describe main feature in detail.Paragraph 4- describe another main feature in detail.When you have this structure in your head, you will be able to plan an effective answer quickly and easily.8 . Practice writing overviews. Your overview is probably the most important paragraph in the whole essay. Write a good one and you are well on your way to getting a good band score.An overview is a summary of the main features shown in the diagram.Part of this is identifying the main trends in the diagram. For bar and line charts ask yourself what is increasing, what is decreasing and what is fluctuating? For processes ask yourself how many main stages there are and what are the main changes and outcomes?Remember that your overview should not include any numbers because you are just describing the most significant aspects in general terms, the detail comes in the next paragraphs.9 . Do consider which tense you are going to use. Many IELTS candidates lose easy marks by only writing in the present tense. Ask yourself if any of the data is about the past or the future and change your tenses accordingly.10 . Support your descriptions with accurate data. As stated before, you won\u2019t use any numbers in the overview section but you will have to use data to describe the main features in subsequent paragraphs. Make sure you choose the correct data and that it is accurate.Don\u2019ts 1 . Don\u2019t use the same words for percentages and numbers. For percentages use words like large/small/higher/lower percentage of\u2026For numbers use words like many/more/most/few and fewer.2 . Don\u2019t give your opinion or speculate. IELTS task 1 is not a discursive essay; discursive essays are for task 2. Only write exactly what you see and don\u2019t try to give reasons for the data unless explicitly stated in the diagram. You will lose a lot of marks if you do this.You should also not add any new information or draw any conclusions from the data presented.For example, I had one person who was an engineer and was presented with a diagram of how a car engine works. He wrote a very detailed description of the process from his own knowledge. All of his information was correct but it was not shown in the diagram. He didn\u2019t achieve the score he should have because he made this error.Remember, give the IELTS examiners what they want and nothing else.3 . Don\u2019t use bullet points, notes or abbreviations. Again, this might be fine in university essays but not in IELTS essays.4 . Don\u2019t write every number or process you see. Many students do this and end up spending far too much time on task 1. Remember you will only be asked to write about the most significant features.For example, in a line graph or bar chart question you will only be expected to write about 2 or 3 things. Any more is a waste of time and you won\u2019t get any extra marks for writing about anything else.5 . Don\u2019t copy words from the question or information from the diagram. If you do this examiners will not mark these words and it is therefore like writing nothing at all.To overcome this, familiarize yourself with the common vocabulary used in IELTS writing part 1 and learn synonyms for this information. Also use synonyms when practicing writing.6 . Don\u2019t overuse linking words or signposting language. Above I advised you to use these words but one problem students have is learning lots of linking words and then overusing them to show the examiner how good they are. Unfortunately, for those students you lose marks for overusing them.If you use around 6 of these words and phrases you will do fine. More than 8 and it looks like you are trying to insert them in without thinking if you are using them appropriately or not.7 . Don\u2019t have messy handwriting. IELTS examiners will try their best to understand what you have written but sometimes the writing is so untidy that it is impossible to read. If your writing is like this the examiner will not be able to give you a mark for the words they can\u2019t read.Many of us rely on computers these days and some students don\u2019t realise how bad your handwriting is. Show some of your practice tests to a teacher or friend and ask their opinion. If they can\u2019t read it then an examiner won\u2019t be able to either.8 . Don\u2019t use informal language. Remember this is an academic essay and you are expected to write in that style. Avoid phrasal verbs, slang and colloquial language.9 . Don\u2019t just focus on line and bar graphs. These may have been popular in the past but it doesn\u2019t mean IELTS will continue to use them that often. We are seeing many more maps, pie charts and process diagrams these days.Many students overlook these kinds of questions and if you are well prepared for every type of question you will really stand out from the crowd.10 . Don\u2019t panic! Many students open up the exam paper, see something they know nothing about and then panic.",

            "answer_text": "Pencil is much better than pen - you can rub out unwanted words! (You are under time pressure.)Allow 3 minutes to get your head around what the task is (and probably write a plan which consists of a few words only), 12 minutes to write, and 4 minutes to error correct.You are not asked to interpret the information given, so you must not do so. You should just write about the facts given, which you must treat as facts, even if you think that they are wrong.A person reading your script should be able to re-create, to a greater or lesser extent, the original picture/diagram etc. Obviously this applies less if the candidate was originally presented with a numerical table - and in general you shouldn\u2019t try to describe every item of data.You should have an introduction (\u201ctopic overview\u201d) that explains the scope of what you are doing, or achieving, or trying to achieve in your writing task. This is typically the first paragraph of 3 or 4; the topic overview can be contain as many as 90 words, or one third of the whole writing task. Conclusions are sometimes unnecessary, and occasionally unhelpful, unlike in Task 2, although generally they are present in writing at Bands 8 and 9 levels - perhaps using language such as \u201cOverall then, the diagram\u2026.\u201d, \u201cTo conclude, the diagram\u2026.\u201d, \u201cIn conclusion, the diagram\u2026.\u201d, or \u201cTo summarise, the diagram\u2026.\u201d Often, you should conclude with a summary of overall trends (not with your personal opinion!)Good task 1 writing will naturally contain 3 or 4 paragraphs (rather than 2 or 6).In Task 1 you should use your own words, so you should try to use synonyms for most of the topic words used in the question.Each of your paragraphs contains a topic sentence. This is the sentence which shows what the paragraph is about. It\u2019s usually the 1st or 2nd sentence of its paragraph.Make sure you use the correct units - for example, the units on the graph may be in thousands of people, in which case \u201c2\u201d on the graph represents \u201c2000 people\u201d in your writing; also, don\u2019t copy sentences from the question!Here is a formula for the 1st sentence of Task 1 to get you going on auto-pilot: What\u2019s being measured? Type of picture given? Units? Categories? Years? Time Period? (Not all of these will always be appropriate.) An example of a 1st sentence is: \u201cWe have been given a bar chart showing the relative proportion of tourist numbers of 3 different nationalities visiting Italy over a period of 10 years showing 3 calendar years at 5-year intervals.\u201dYou should not use bullet points - you will get lower marks for \u201cCoherence and cohesion\u201d.For further information about IELTS, see my IELTS information page here on Quora.

(Picture) Just mention things as they are....do not write what you feel it is or what you feel it could do or be used for or anything....you are asked to mention the diagram as it is and your duty towards the task is to do just that ! No extras. I would suggest you work on your synonyms for big, small, rise, fall etc. As one needs to repeat as less words as possible for the writing tasks to show your ability to use English extensively. For example: The graph shows a steep rise in the population between 2001-2005, however, the proportion of growth in population seems to have decreased between 2005-2010.  Here instead of saying the proportion of rise in population I used growth and made small changes in the sentence. These matter ! Also look for these adjectives - steep, plummeting, burgeoning. Use terms like \"hit the peak\", peaked, etc. for maps and directions...you can use words like westward, eastward, northbound, southbound, etc. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there. In writing task 1, you will be asked to write a report about a line graph, a bar graph, a chart, a table, a map or a diagram, or a combination of two of the above mentioned types. I will share you the tips I got while I was also preparing for the IELTS test. First of all, be precise. State the facts the you see clearly. Write about what you can see in the data given, but no additional information. Remember, you are writing a REPORT, not an ESSAY. Secondly, you don't need to write every little detail. You just have to write the MAJOR FACTS, with some side details. Like: \"The number students who took the Science course reached a peak of 3000 in 1998.\" The major facts are the facts like the maximum and minimum points, increasing and decreasing greatly and such. The side details are the dates and the amounts. Thirdly, paragraphing. There are many ways you can compose a paragraph: you can put similar facts together; you can put opposing facts together; you can put the most prominent facts (like the maximum and minimum points) together. For task 1, you can divide your report into at least three paragraphs: introduction, body and conclusion. Finally, vocabulary. Do not just keep using the same words for increasing and decreasing repeatedly. Think of synonyms, or phrases with the same meaning. For example: \"rocketed\", \"dropped\", \"dipped\", \"rose\", and etc. I hope my answer helped you more or less. Good luck with your studies! :)  ",

For e.g. if an essay has a time allocation of 10 mins, you need to split your time as - 7mins for writing and 3 mins for spell and grammar check. Word count will always be on display. Always keep an introduction and conclusion in separate paragraphs. never exceed the word limit. ",
