            "answer_text": "If it's call of your intuition, definitely you should. One thing I want to tell you that NEET is a very \u201cambitious project\u201d and it takes a lot of dedication, perseverance and a bit of sacrifices, too. Being academically successful has never been easy, especially when there is so much competition. If you try hard and put your best, then definitely success will be your. Look at successful people and ask them about their struggles and failures. You have not mentioned here that what are you doing now. Pursuing any degree or just preparing for NEET. If you are pursuing any degree and doing great then don't drop. One thing you seem very concern about is your age and your fellow friends. I want to tell you here that when you will crack NEET then you will become an example for them and if you choose something common then you will merely get a chance to explore your potential. Let's talk practically. You are 21 now and if you take an another drop then you will get admission in a prestigious medical college in your 22. You will be around 27 when you will be a doctor. Practice for one year then get married in the age of 28 and it's perfect. Think about it. Everything is set, no any potential risk. And in college, no one even ask about anyone's age. So, don't think about it. ",

You can still do it. :) Believe in yourself.As the number of drop increases so does the pressure. ( Based on personal experience) . Don't waste time now, you might land up in a government college.

When she got the seat and came out of the counselling hall, her parents were crying in joy. That girl did not loose hope and was determined to get the seat and she did. And that look in her father's eyes was majestic. Three months are not less. If you decide to study rigorously from today onwards no one.... No one can stop you from getting a MBBS seat. What is the guarantee that the next year you will be fully prepared?? None... So please don't loose hope.. And be determined to achieve what you want. And you will do it. All the best. May the odds be in your favour. ",

Many a times people feel that they are born to be doctors & they must be. But it is not true! You must accept the bitter truth & think that you were never made for this field. Because if you were really interested, then you would have studied madly this year. Nevertheless, it is not too late still. Realise your dreams & fulfil them. Hope this helps you:) ",

            "answer_text": "I totally understand your problem. I'm going to give NEET 2017 too. As you are going to give NEET, i suppose you are aiming to become either a dentist or a doctor. If you are aiming to become a doctor, it would roughly take 8 years to complete total course. After that you would go for further specialization. And following that it would take approximately 1 to 2 years to get to equilibrium. As you are 21 right now, you'll end up becoming a doctor at approx 30. And above all. You can only give NEET 3 times and not more than that. And then there's an age limit. 25 for general and 30 for other castes. [1] If I were you, I would give it this year only. And talking about preparation, I'm also not much prepared. So we are sailing on the same boat ;) We have 3 months. I'm sure we will do good. :) P.S. I apologise if there are any mistakes in the assumptions above. Footnotes[1] NEET 2017: Application Form, Exam Dates, Exam Pattern, Syllabus",
