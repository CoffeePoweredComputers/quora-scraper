            "answer_text": "If you want to guarantee that everything\u2019s legally above board, you can\u2019t use any material copyrighted to somebody else without their explicit written permission. So the simplest answer to your question is \u201cnone\u201d. However, you might be able to claim \u201cfair use\u201d under certain very limited circumstances, but it\u2019s a term that\u2019s widely misused. Contrary to what many YouTube uploaders seem to think, \u201cfair use\u201d does not grant you the right to publish a complete work, and while it\u2019s rather charming seeing people who do this affirming that they don\u2019t own the copyright, that may well make things harder for them if they\u2019re sued because they\u2019ve conveniently affirmed upfront that they were aware that someone else owned the copyright! On the other hand, if you use a very short extract in a clearly educational/critical/parodic context, you might be able to claim \u201cfair use\u201d, but you must use no more footage than is necessary to make your immediate point and you must clearly have gone to the effort of adding such contextualisation (for instance, it\u2019s not good enough just to upload something and tag it \u201cfor educational use\u201d - you have to go to the effort of actually providing that education). You\u2019ll see from this that most YouTube videos tagged \u201cfair use\u201d are nothing of the kind, and it\u2019s important to realise that yours might not qualify either, even if you\u2019ve taken the necessary precautions - because \u201cfair use\u201d is very much a grey area, and a judge could easily go either way. There are also certain companies whose work you should never use under any circumstances because they\u2019re very litigious - Disney being a particularly notorious case in point. (Which doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s more acceptable to use the work of less litigious companies - just that you\u2019re much more likely to get sued if you breach Disney\u2019s copyright.) ",

            "answer_text": "Without other factors to consider, zero. Even a single screencap of a video is copyright infringement if you don't fit the other three rules of fair use. The \u201cminimal use\u201d rule doesn't set a specific duration, work count, percentage or other metrics. It just wants you to use a small part of the original content within new content of greater weight in the total value of the final creation. While also not replacing the need to watch the original and fitting one of the approved purposes for using someone's content. ",
