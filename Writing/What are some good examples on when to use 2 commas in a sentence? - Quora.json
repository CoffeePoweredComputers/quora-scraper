            "answer_text": "Commas create a \u201cmicro-pause\u201d that helps the reader take in the created meaning as clearly as language can allow. Often a pair of commas is needed to separate out a complete phrase or clause slightly, one that is \u201cembedded\u201d inside another clause and needs some pausing to be properly accounted for by the reader. These are called parenthetical commas because they act like brackets, to add in some subordinate information to a main clause or other superior grammatical unit. Here is an example: \u201cThe elephant, [which was] charging like crazy in all directions, needed careful handling.\u201d \u201cThe cars that were winning the race, albeit not a proper \u201crace\u201d as such, were not the electric models.\u201d ",
