            "answer_text": "Baichi is 100% insulting. Shamao is not that severe. Sometimes Chinese use shamao to refer to people who did silly but lovely things. I can give you one example. The boyfriend holds flowers outside even though it is snowing. The girl who received flowers would call him shamao. Because it is cold and snowing. But she is not refusing him, only to blame him for doing silly things. If she said baichi in the same occasion, definitely she turned him down and challenge if he is mentally healthy. ",

            "answer_text": "Sha-mao is perhaps only heard in (northern) Mandarin speaking areas, while Bai-chi is perhaps more widely used in non Mandarin speaking areas. Anyway, thanks to movies and TV dramas, I think many people understand these two words even though they might not use them in daily conversations. ",
