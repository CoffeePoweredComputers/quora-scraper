            "answer_text": "I never did any of those things. If anything I might have shook their hand and thanked them the day I started. My life has been blessed when it comes to getting jobs and more than my education and experience, I always attributed it to common sense. Yes, I said common sense. All things being equal, I believed they should thank me for joining them and that they were just as excited to get me on their team. i.e. I was the Manager of all Financial Systems and needed to hire an employee in my department. I went to HR to put in a job order, as it was SOP (Standard Operating Procedure). I described my requirements and was told they would start advertising for the position immediately. \u201cWait, I prefer to hire an insider and use this as a promotion for one of our employees.\u201d I was told this was not SOP. So I told HR, I would not even interview an outsider until and unless the position was posted internally for a minimum of two weeks. A promotion within would certainly increase company moral. I would get an employee who already knew company procedures. I could easily talk to other collogues to get honest information about my preferred candidate. I hired such a candidate. As I suspected, all this was true. Common sense. The day we finally parted, (this employee and I), he shook my hand and told me I was the best boss he ever had and it would be a hard act to follow. I approached every interview with the same common sense. I had an internal mantra which goes like this \u201cfind a better, faster, more efficient method to produce or increase the results.\u201d If someone asked me my strongest quality, that\u2019s what I would tell them. I worked smarter, not harder. Using this approach, I ended up with many bragging points. Start taking your own inventory and be prepared to talk about it in the interview. I keep saying you can\u2019t lose a job you don't have. Go for it. You\u2019ve got to believe it to see it. ",

            "answer_text": "Respectfully, Diane, did you not ask the same question already? Do not send cards or e-mails. Handwritten cards are hard to read. E-mails are bland and cold. They can be diverted to spam files, summarily deleted, blocked or bounced back. Never mind busy people at all levels must contend with legions of e-mails every day; your thank-you e-mail may not be read for days or may not be viewed altogether. Instead, work up, word process thank-you letters in proper business letter form and mail them. Along with expressing thanks for the interview, use your letter to reiterate and reinforce points you covered in your interview. Use your letter to raise and cover points you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to raise during the interview. Use your letter to express your excitement about the possibility of working for the employer and how you look forward to hearing from employer shortly. All of these things are impossible to cram onto a card. Besides, busy people are used to reading print instead of handwriting - you want your sentiments to be as legible as possible. Sending thank-yous in business letter form demonstrates understanding of business protocols. They provide another opportunity to sell communication abilities and provide a better opportunity to sell one\u2019s self than a card. ",
