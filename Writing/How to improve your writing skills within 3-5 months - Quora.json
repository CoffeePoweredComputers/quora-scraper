            "answer_text": "What do you want to write? If it\u2019s fiction, check out workshops in your area at public school and college adult ed programs, community centers and other places that offer courses on writing stories, novels, scripts and more. These programs often have good teachers\u2014professional writers who enjoy nurturing talent and can use the money. And look around your community for writers\u2019 groups. You\u2019ll have an audience that will react to your writing honestly, and all the benefits of a shared learning experience. If you want to improve your practical writing skills to become more successful in your career, a workshop or course is also a good idea. But another option is to use a book that guides you step by step through the process of improving your writing. This works for many people because writing for work purposes\u2014letters, email, presentations, blogs, proposals, social media, resumes\u2014is a learnable skill based on common sense and clear thinking. My own Business Writing for Dummies is not the only self-help book on writing but it\u2019s the one I know best, so I\u2019ll talk about that. It gives you a step by step framework for creating messages that achieve your goals. This starts with reasoning out what content will work for your specific purpose, and how to align the message with your readers\u2019 self-interest so they say \u2018yes\u2019 to what you want. To help with the technical side of writing the book provides a toolkit of down-to-earth ways to check your success and improve the language, tone and impact. By the way, many creative people take the trouble to improve their business writing because they too need emails, letters, resumes, proposals and more to be successful. Not much is more important to success today than communicating well with people. Put three to five months of energy into systematically improving you writing and you can make amazing progress\u2014and see the results. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have command of the language in which you would be writing? How is your understanding of grammar and spelling? Idioms? Can you read novels in that language and feel you understand the subtextual content of the writer? If you can\u2019t say yes, you would need to be working hard on the language. The first novel I read in French was Camus\u2019 The Stranger. I really struggled with the colloquial speech of the lead character as literal translations of idioms rarely works well. If you are secure in the language, your best bet for fast improvement is to do several things simultaneously: read at least two books on writing, or 4\u20135 on specific issues, such as character development, pacing, and so forth. Several other respondents to your question have covered this thoroughly. While you are doing that, keep a day journal and write at least two pages every day. Go to coffee shops, watch people, and pick two or three and write no more than four paragraphs on each, treating them as if you are preparing novel characters\u2019 biographies, Then write a two-page excerpt as if they are interacting with each other. While you are doing that, read at least four or five books in the genre you intend to use for your \u201cimproved\u201d writing. Be sure to read books by accomplished authors. Avoid drivel. Don\u2019t read it; it can be catching. Read quality literature. If you are going to write non-fiction, do the same thing with that as non-fiction requires significant differences in preparation and content. Once a week, read everything you have written since the last review. If you read this by someone else, what would you think of the writer? Can you see improvement? Don\u2019t worry much about editing in all this because if you aim for perfection immediately, you will be frustrated. Remember the goal is improvement, not accomplishment. You will improve, especially if your reading is done with a writer\u2019s eye. Are the characters real people? Is the narration coherent and does it progress logically? If you are creating a fantasy world, have you established the rules of that world and stayed within them? How do the authors whose works you enjoyed accomplish the techniques you read about in the books you started about writing? At the worst, you should be able to see real improvement by following this approach. But none of this will be of any use to you unless you recognize that this is work, just as much as digging a sewer line or any other labor. Writing well is work, burns huge amounts of energy, and is a craft as well as an art. Talent helps, but as in any craft, the core is a willingness to do the day-by-day work to learn how to use the tools at hand. Best of luck. Send a note to the people helping you in a few months and share what worked for you and the results. ",
