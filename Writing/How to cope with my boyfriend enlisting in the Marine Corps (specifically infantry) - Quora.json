            "answer_text": "Honestly. Wish him well and move on. The reality is he\u2019s gone for 3 months to boot camp where you\u2019ll at best get a few letters a week from him and realistically a lot less. Then he\u2019ll graduate boot camp and come home for about 10 days before going on to his MOS training for a few months. At which time he might then again come home for a week or two before reporting to his first military base which will probably be at 29 Palms in California or Camp Lejeune in North Carolina where if he\u2019s lucky he\u2019ll have been promoted to private first class and making the big bucks of $1,884.00 a month. You could get married and apply for military housing but honestly military life isn\u2019t very conducive to married life for either person even if he doesn\u2019t get deployed. The allowances you get aren\u2019t that great especially when trying to feed a family. The housing might be free, if you are lucky enough to get base housing, but you still have to deal with all the bills and the income of a non NCO is pretty pitiful. Do I know young NCO\u2019s that managed? Sure. But I also can point to a lot more who\u2019s families didn\u2019t last and if you are in 29 Palms married to your boyfriend and things go south the military isn\u2019t going to pay to have you move back home. Better that you both understand before he goes in that there isn\u2019t a commitment there than him getting a letter from you while in boot camp that you\u2019ve met someone else or a phone call when he\u2019s in infantry training. Same goes for you finding out he\u2019s seeing some girl in the little spare time he has. While he\u2019s willingly signing onto a life he probably doesn\u2019t completely understand you shouldn\u2019t be burdened with that also.

            "answer_text": "Becoming a Marine is a fine first step for a young man to do. I would be supportive of him and his choices, even if you don't understand or agree with them. While he's at Marine Corps boot camp, you might just calm down a bit and evaluate your relationship with this guy. Don't lead him on and dump him, especially while the guy is under great stress in the midst of his boot camp training, but allow yourself time to adjust to the new reality that your boyfriend is now going to be a Marine, providing he successfully completes his boot camp training. Wait until he finishes boot camp training and while he's home on leave, have a serious talk with your newly minted Marine boyfriend and see if you wish to keep things going with him. In the meantime, I wish your boyfriend the best of luck with his boot camp training. ",
