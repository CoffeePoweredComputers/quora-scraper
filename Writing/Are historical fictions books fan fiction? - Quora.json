Historical fiction writers may create a fictional character and guide them through through real historical events or they might follow the lives of real historical figures and fill in the blanks in what is known with their own invention. Sometimes the writer shows unmistakeable indications that they admire one of the real historical figures in the story.

People get paid for writing them, so they\u2019re not technically fan fiction, but the basic idea - of setting a story in a world which already exists and is known, with characters many of whom also already exist - is the same.
