            "answer_text": "Hi, Arthur. Thanks for your question. You know, when I am busy with a form I have no idea whether I am filling that form in or out. However, should I talk to myself when I am going to bedazzle that form with my \u2018beautiful\u2019 handwriting I think of it as \u2018I am going to fill that form in.\u2019 while I am filling that form in, it would make sense to me to say to me that I am filling the form out as it has that correct sound. Let\u2019s see what the clever guys have to say. Well, Arthur, whatever your little voice tells you have now arrived at the moment of truth. Are you ready for it? Well, ready or not; here it comes: Tadadada! \u201cThese expressions are very commonly confused by Malaysians. I\u2019ve even seen a sign in a bank with this mistake. I\u2019ll provide the definitions of each of these terms (from Wiktionary): Fill in \u2013 (transitive) to complete a form or questionnaire with requested information. Fill out \u2013 (transitive) to complete a form or questionnaire with requested information. Fill up\u2013 1. (chiefly of a fuel tank) to make full. 2. to become full So we see that \u201cfill in\u201d and \u201cfill out\u201d mean to complete a questionnaire, survey or form with the necessary information. \u201cFill up\u201d means to make something full, generally with a liquid. As mentioned by the dictionary, it is often used to refer to a car\u2019s fuel tank. For example \u201cI need to fill up my car\u201d. \u201cFill up\u201d CANNOT be used to mean \u201ccomplete a form\u201d. This is wrong. Can a form hold liquid? (Well, possibly if you rolled it into a cone it could, but then it would be ruined). Since it cannot hold liquid, it is not appropriate to use \u201cfill up\u201d. The appropriate expression to use with a form is \u201cfill in\u201d or \u201cfill out\u201d (even though \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d are opposites, \u201cfill in\u201d and \u201cfill out\u201d both have the same meaning). So please don\u2019t ask anyone to \u201cfill up a form\u201d because they will not be able to do it. Ask them to \u201cfill in\u201d a form or \u201cfill out\u201d a form.\u201d So, my man, what do you say? Am I not the cleverest? I was right on two occasions when I walked up to the form and while I filled in the form. Furthermore, I was not wrong to fill up the form. Give me a high five. You were in doubt so that does not count. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve also made a mistake once. I thought I was wrong, but then it turned out I was right all along. Kind regards, Bye. ",

            "answer_text": "In American English, they are used interchangeably, but in British English, generally \u2018fill in a form\u2019 is used, the verb \u2018fill out\u2019 meaning \u2018to expand\u2019, in the sense of putting on weight, but rarely in the sense of completing a form.  Fill out a form, fill out a form? You mean \u2018fill in a form\u2019? Has everyone turned American? The term \u2018fill out\u2019 is used in American English because of German influence, as in German, you would say ich f\u00fcllte das Formular aus or \u2018I filled the form out\u2019 which was translated directly by German speakers from their native language.  The Atlantic Reporter, Volumes 73-74, West Publishing Company, 1909, page 737 In German, the verb \u2018to fill in\u2019, ausf\u00fcllen, is a separable verb, hence aus or \u2018out\u2019 being used at the end of a sentence, but American English speakers may also talk about someone who \u2018filled out the form\u2019.  Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Journal, Volume 48, 1939, page 11 In British English, it is more common to say that someone \u2018filled in the form\u2019, rather than \u2018filled the form in\u2019, but in Dutch, the verb \u2018to fill in\u2019 is invullen, hence ik vulde het formulier in or \u2018I filled the form in\u2019.  Joint Volumes of Papers Presented to the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, Volume 2, New South Wales. Parliament, 1907, page 289 This German influence also applies to some American English expressions that British English speakers love to hate, like \u2018can I get\u2026?\u2019 which is similar to the German kann ich\u2026 bekommen? used instead of \u2018may I have?\u2019 ",
