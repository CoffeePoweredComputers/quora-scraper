Or would it be more of a romantic and very intimate letter, where you express your deepest feelings? You should also question the time period you been with him. It helps to establish the level of commitment towards writing these types of letters or poems. And do you know that he'll appreciate them? Is he into such thing's? You need to account for all these things because you just might be wasting your time. Maybe he appreciate a 6pack or something average that men or boy's like. ",

            "answer_text": "Look. Just write, and hold off on analyzing as you go. Depending on your experience in writing, you will write somewhere between 50%(if you are an experienced writer) and 90%(if you are an inexperience writer) utter crap. What you write won\u2019t be perfect, and don\u2019t let that stop you. Also, between writing and revising, give yourself some time to gain better perspective. Also, does your boyfriend LIKE poetry? And don\u2019t worry about where to begin. You can fix the order of stuff later. Just freaking write already. ",
