            "answer_text": "When I were a lad back in Blighty, a Billion were a lot. A million million, in fact. Then along came those Yanks and devalued it. A Billion became a mere thousand million. While a million million became a Trillion. (I suppose that makes a million million million a Gazillion?) Of course, this is grammatical nonsense. Bi means TWO, as in bicycle, bisexual, bipedal, etc. Thus, million million. And Tri means THREE, as in tricycle, tripod, trident, etc. Thus, million million million. Anyhoo, this reminds me of a story I once heard about a professor who studied primitive languages. He found himself chatting to a farmer in a poor, Third-World country. The man spoke English, so the linguist said to him, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that in your language, the numbers only go up to three. So what would you say if someone asked you how many cows you had \u2013 when you had four?\u201d The farmer mused for a moment, then replied, \u201cI would say I have MANY cows.\u201d This in turn reminds me of a REAL anomaly in my adopted country of Thailand. Here, TV programmes often have Thai subtitles on shows with Western dialogue. But whenever said dialogue includes the word \u201cfew\u201d, the subtitles say \u201c2-3\u201d.Likewise, \u201cseveral\u201d translates as \u201c5-6\u201d. It would seem that when dealing with numbers of anything \u2013 the Thais like to know EXACTLY where they stand! UPDATE! In fact, a thousand million is more properly called a MILLIARD. And a thousand billion is called a BILLIARD (no joke - nothing to do with the game). After which, scientists use POWERS (I.E. 54 x 10 to the power 18 is 54 with 18 zeros after it). And plebs like us use joke words like the afore-mentioned gazillion. But the real shame is the changing of billion from a million million to a THOUSAND million (the Americans are not the only offenders of grammer - the French did it too). These days, I AVOID the word altogether (AND billion) and just use thousand and million (the latter, as many times as is necessary). ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that a billion is a thousand million. But, it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. I was taught in school that a billion was a million million and that a trillion was a million billion. This is what is known as the \u201cLong Scale\u201d and was common usage in the UK until the mid 1970s ( see Long and short scales - Wikipedia) In 1974, Prime Minister Harold Wilson confirmed that the government would use the word billion only in its short scale meaning (one thousand million). In a written answer to Robin Maxwell-Hyslop MP, who asked whether official usage would conform to the traditional British meaning of a million million, Wilson stated: \"No. The word 'billion' is now used internationally to mean 1,000 million and it would be confusing if British Ministers were to use it in any other sense. From Billion - Wikipedia, see also 1,000,000,000 - Wikipedia So, that\u2019s it then, UK and US English now both agree that a Billion is a thousand million, question answered, end of the story. Again, it\u2019s not quite as simple as that. If we look at the following page Long and short scales - Current Usage - Wikipedia then we can see that, yes, the UK and US are now consistent in using the short scale shown in red on the map (lifted from the Wikipedia Current Usage link)  But, depending where you are in the world, a billion can refer to a million million or a thousand million or both or neither. There we go, question answered, everyone is somewhat more informed as well as more confused than they were when they started reading this. (I\u2019ve now been looking at the words million and billion so much that neither of them look to be spelled correctly or look like valid words at all) ",
