            "answer_text": "Good question- Twenty years ago newspapers hunted and searched for good stories and people. Today they charge to write even a paragraph on you unless you are a topic which can fetch attention of readers. You have not mentioned why you want to be subject of newspaper article. If you looking for fame, there are unliked things too which might creep in along with fame. But if you want to promote your business or product then here is my advice- I would suggest you to hire a PR who knows people in newspaper and get your story inserted in one of the pages. Get a professional writer to write about you and send it as a press release to newspapers on email or direct courier. Not every editor will take a note of your article. So don't get disheartened if rejected. ",
