            "answer_text": "Days after my husband and I learned that our son, our only child, has tuberous sclerosis, we were contacted by another mom who had a fourteen year old son with the same disease. She was nice and kind. She went on to tell me about her son. He had never spoken, and still hasn\u2019t to this day. He understood everything that was said to him, he just didn\u2019t have the ability to process it and get words formed and out of his mouth. I enjoyed talking to her, if anything, her attitude was contagious. I knew before the call that I would love my son no matter what he accomplished. After this phone call my mind started spinning. I had to have a plan. What is the next step for my son. We enrolled him into a early intervention program, even if it was for just a few months, before me relocated to another state. Once we moved and got settled, I moved to the next step of my plan. I enrolled in classes at the local community college. In those classes I learned sign language. I was dead set on giving my son the tools to communicate with us (his parents) at any cost. It was glorious watching him soak up this language. He began to tell us what he wanted, more, finished, drink, cookie\u2026etc. Nothing was sweeter to my ears\u2026I mean eyes! Suddenly, after his second birthday, he just started talking! It was as if he was waiting to be an expert before he started. I didn\u2019t really care, I was just thrilled he started talking. Now twenty-two years later, he hasn\u2019t shut up! That\u2019s ok, he is an amazing young man that is excelling at life at his own pace. I will forever be his biggest cheerleader and advocate! That is how my son and I roll! ",
