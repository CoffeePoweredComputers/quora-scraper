            "answer_text": " 10 Day Gratitude Challenge One of the coolest parts of gratitude is that it takes relatively little time to do it consistently. As a therapist, I often \u201cprescribe\u201d a gratitude journal where I ask my clients to write down 3 to 5 things they are grateful for every day. Most say they do this as they get ready for bed because it allows them to reflect on the day they\u2019ve just had. I like for people to think of 5 things if possible because it requires them to put a little mental muscle into it and think hard, reviewing the day through a positive filter. I also ask them to think of 3 to 5 unique things, not just repeating what they have already written in previous journal entries (I\u2019m grateful for my family. I\u2019m grateful for my friends. I\u2019m grateful for my dog. I\u2019m grateful I have a roof over my head\u2026). Ideally, they write about things that have occurred or have come to mind over the course of the day. I also like the practice of regular gratitude letters. As I mentioned earlier, the research studies often ask people to write the letters by hand, then give them to the recipient in person, asking them to read the letter out loud. People often balk at that, feeling like it is too awkward. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that the research found people tend to have an incorrect perception of this. In one study, even though participants reported a significant positive boost in their mood after writing a letter of gratitude, they underestimated how warm and positive the recipient of a gratitude letter of gratitude would feel. In fact, they greatly overestimated how awkward the receiver would feel. Sometimes it\u2019s not worries about how awkward it might be that is the barrier, but time or distance constraints. What if you really wanted to thank a teacher who lives three states away? I doubt you\u2019ll book a flight and hand-deliver the letter. The same goes for friends and family members who might live in far-flung areas or have travel schedules that make this nearly impossible. In those cases, it\u2019s perfectly fine to craft a text or email. You may even want to go old-school and write out a letter by hand, figure out where in the world you could possibly buy a stamp, then actually mail it. Crazy, I know! ",

            "answer_text": "I find that when I use a gratitude journal it\u2019s easier to express simple things I\u2019m grateful for. Randomly looking for something unique and genuine to appreciate about someone else is useful too. Especially when I\u2019m getting frustrated or upset with another person, looking for something to be grateful in them can change the tone of the conversation. Another way is to have an alert on your phone that goes off and when it does, you either think to yourself or share with the first person you see something you\u2019re grateful for about them. ",
