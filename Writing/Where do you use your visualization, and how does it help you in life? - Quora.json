            "answer_text": "I visualize everything. Every single thing that I want I visualize and I get it. I started practicing the laws of the universe and since then I have been happier and more content with my life. Visualizing your dreams lets the universe know that you want it. And the more you think about the more universe see\u2019s how bad you want it. That\u2019s just how the universe works and it\u2019s wonderful. Apart from this visualizing what I want and thinking about having it makes me feel so better. It lifts my mood. I feel peaceful and happy thinking that whatever I want is being prepared for me right now while I sit here and think about it. It helps me in life to not worry about my future and live in the moment. Cherish this days. Cause I don\u2019t have to worry about my future. Have a wonderful day. ",
