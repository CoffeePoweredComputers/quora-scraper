            "answer_text": "Basically, \u2018compare\u2019 assesses the similarities between two people or things. ex; \u2018That general has been compared to Napoleon\u2019, (or he is almost as good as Napoleon). Or, compare \u2018rum with gin\u2019, \u2018they compare in alcoholic content, or thereabout\u2019. Look out for specifics, in quality, value, or strength, etc. Contrast tends to distinguish, or emphasises differences by comparing/contrasting opposites people or things.: in quality or temperament for instance, by showing notable differences in appearance, usage or personality. I can\u2019t think of an example right now, but perhaps we could contrast rock music with classical music, or \u2018There is a marked contrast between these two men\u2019s accounts of this morning car accident\u2019. Well, something like that. I hope it helps to clarify the difference between those verbs. ",

            "answer_text": "There is very little difference:  Compare means to look for similarities and differences. Contrast means to look only for differences (though one could argue that you cannot look for differences without looking for similarities).The two words are often used as a set phrase in schools to mean to look for similarities and differences. Some teachers try to suggest that the \"compare\" part of the exercise is looking for similarities and the \"contrast\" part is looking for differences. I bet this is really just a rationalization that was made up by teachers trying to figure out the phrase after schools began using it. A \"contrastive essay\" or a \"comparison essay\" would not be any different than what we call a \"compare and contrast essay.\" It's just a phrase. In that usage, it doesn't make sense to break it down into its separate parts. ",
