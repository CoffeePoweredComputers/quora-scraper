            "answer_text": "I think the title of \u201ccreative writing\u201d would have likely come under the heading of philosophy, literature, Language Arts, and maybe theology back then. In the case of Nazi Germany, I think it may have found a use in the propaganda department, or one of its many subsections. Perhaps before the war, there might have been an opening found in burgeoning new world of advertising and marketing, or perhaps in the arts, especially the theater. There was, of course, academia for the chosen few. However, after the Nazis came to power, whatever you wrote was subject to the dictates of the State, and in particular, the Department of Enlightenment and Propaganda. Just like artists, writers had to be approved. In order to do so, they had to submit copies of their work and, if approved, obtain a special permit, otherwise they didn\u2019t work. Of course, they were free to \u201cvolunteer\u201d for military duty. Speaking of the movies and writing, you might enjoy an interesting book about about the Ufa, the chief movie production company during the Nazis years, and its actors. The book is entitled \u201cHitler and the Nazi Cult of Celebrity\u201d by Michael Mann. You might also enjoy \u201cNazi Women: The Attraction of Evil\u201d by Paul Roland, which covers Joseph Goebbels\u2019 relationship with many of the actors and actresses. Lastly, I would be amiss not to recommend \u201cLeni Riefenstahl: A Memoir\u201d by the lady herself. It details a lot about the artists and their relationship with the Nazis, and in particular, Joseph Goebbels. The other book is \u201cMarlene Dietrich: Life And Legend\u201d by Steven Bach. ",
