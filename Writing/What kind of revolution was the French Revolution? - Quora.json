            "answer_text": "Your question was, \u201cWhat kind of revolution was the French Revolution?\u201d  Technically (it could be argued that) the French Revolution wasn\u2019t a \u201crevolution\u201d at all. The word, \u201crevolution\u201d directly implies a return to what had been. But the French Revolution was hardly that. With at least equal, but in reality far more justification, it would be better called the \u201cFrench Breakthrough\u201d or the \u201cFrench Progression\u201d \u2014for there\u2019s your answer. But even that falls short, since the real accomplishment of the French Revolution was that it didn\u2019t just concern\u2014it didn\u2019t just advance\u2014the French. It advanced the whole of human society\u2014out of feudalism. ",

            "answer_text": "A disastrous one. The ancien regime was a mess that needed fixing/replacing. The Revolution though brought The Terror (look it up), and ended with EMPEROR Napoleon attempting to conquer the rest of Europe. The French Revolution was the template and inspiration for the Haitian Revolution. And the Russian Revolution, and by extension all the child revolutions of the Russian Revolution. The 18th century closed with two great revolutions. Most revolutionaries since then have taken their inspiration from one or the other. The French Revolution is so wonderfully romantic, flush with soaring ideals. Yet it and all of the revolutions it has inspired (directly or indirectly) have resulted in mass death. Choose wisely. ",
