And if personal bias is involved, then is it warranted in the said piece?Is the overall tone of commentary appealing to a larger audience? Does the author intentionally take digs at entities?IS IT EDITED AND PROOFREAD THOROUGHLY? (very important)Is the author's writing style simple enough to read?Is the author's writing too simple to read? Does it offer variation in sentences, introduces or adopts new literary styles without being overly flamboyant?Is the piece precise without the author beating around the bush?Is the piece well researched or administers one too many conjectures?Of course, you can't check ALL of these points for one article (that would be too ideal a situation), but if most of them are met, then it is a pretty brilliant piece. Please do share in comments, I'd be much interested in reading it :) ",
