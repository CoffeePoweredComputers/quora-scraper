            "answer_text": "Yes, you can take anything in life for granted as you have the ability to. The result of this is not known and will, most likely due to the unpredictable nature of life, have some detrimental effect on your life. Since you have the free will to do something though, doesn\u2019t mean that you should. It is in your interests and reason to willingly choose whether or not you wish to take anything for granted or not. Hope this helps. ",
