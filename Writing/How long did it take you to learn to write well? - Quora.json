            "answer_text": "Without the vocabulary skills, writing is a waste of time and as for poets, it is a waste of rhyme. The writing skills and techniques apply to many professional writers rather than the amateurs. For poetry, it is a common problem in the editing stages to have poems using it is and it's and its, yet not seeing the errors along the way. They are correct as separate words, yet not always in context and even the grammarly-dot-com service has to point out these variations to us as potential errors. We really need to focus, yet that proves increasingly difficult in this modern world of ours. Sometimes we just skim the emails and plough our way through our ideas and technical issues with computers and printers, scanners and credit cards and so on. To be in the Writing Zone is not the same as being in the Typing Zone. We may be on a roll one minute and up the creek the next. The more we write, the more we need to check... In recent months, I dedicated myself more to the editing stages than ever before. I began to recite the poetry more and more and to test how well each phrase could be spoken... and therefore how well or how badly it could be recited by others. I tried to get the poetry to be as user-friendly as possible. So a few compromises were made, some for the good, yet not always as neat and as tidy as I wanted at that time of writing.Deadlines do not help writers to write as well as they could, or as they should, but there are times when time is not on our side. It becomes a take it or leave it situation. We either write and share, or write and accept a measure of defeat. It just ain't good enough, pal... Don't bother. But that's the whole point, because we're supposed to bother! To write well is not a matter of time or the computer resources. There are techniques we can apply ourselves to. These don't arrive on the same day, just as we discover with HTML editing and various sequences that must be applied to make the web page function. So the writing techniques are meant to be followed up to a point. With characterisations we don't apply the rules because the character may speak that way instead of the absolutely correct way. With Sheldon Cooper of The Big Bang Theory TV show, we see a super genius who is usually a stickler for correct English, but not for every second of every single TV show. So it is with most of us. We switch from it is to it's every now and then. This happens in poems as well. There are benefits in checking the text for the way the abbreviations are used and when they can be edited to make things better. I regard myself as an amateur. I can write but not to the highest standards. I muddle through a lot of text, trying to see where the errors are. Over the years, I'm making more typos than word errors. It's why I upgraded to a larger PC screen. Now I can see the text better than I ever could. So I hope that shows in regard to my previous years. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience is in writing nonfiction, such as technical notes and documents, or Quora answers, or mail about family news. I had a good one semester course in writing in college. It was taught by a medical student. Sometimes he came late, because he had been helping to deliver a baby. I learned one very useful thing in his course. When you are writing something, first organize your thoughts and decide which main points you want to make, in which order. You can write a paragraph explaining each point. The result will be a coherent piece of writing. I also learned to use clear simple language. My goal is to explain so that everyone can understand, not to try to impress them with fancy words. The main thing is to put yourself into the mind of the reader. Explain anything which might be well known by you, but which may confuse your readers. To me, all these principles of writing are just common sense. So it shouldn't take a long time to learn to write nonfiction well. Of course, writing good fiction is a different kind of challenge. I have no experience at that, and I have respect for people who do it well. ",
