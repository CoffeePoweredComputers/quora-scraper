            "answer_text": "I would assume a lot of Small Businesses hire people to create their website with WordPress. Like Jeff Hawkins says, the smart ones do. A business succeeds when everyone involved in it does what they know how to do and delegates or hires out the things that they are not that familiar with. While being a DIY is an awesome thing. I\u2019m a DIYer, but when it comes to a business, it\u2019s about making money, time is money. So it wouldn\u2019t make financial sense to put aside your actual business duties to learn everything there is to know about WordPress. While WordPress might not be that hard, especially when you get some experience with it, there\u2019s a lot of value in Working with a WordPress Developer or Consultant to help you identify the best theme and plugins you should use on your website. There are tens of thousand of themes & plugins both free and premium. Choosing amongst them all is a tedious task for people new to the platform. That being said, if a business owner has experience with WordPress and a passion for working with websites, then they will often do it themselves and will do well with it.

            "answer_text": "All the smart ones!!! It\u2019s usually a good investment for a small business to hire talent they don't already have in house. That goes for any kind talent. Sales, legal, bookkeeping, store layout, most any talent the store personnel hasn't developed themselves already should be hired. WordPress is no exception. ",
