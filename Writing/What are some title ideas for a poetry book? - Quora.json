            "answer_text": "Good question. I got an idea from a poet who called my stuff, stacks of paragraphs. I\u2019ve written and put into book form (as yet unpublished) My Book of Stacks? Yes CJ, someday. That was a comment to my bestus poet friend. Here are the first two entries of my unpublished book. Apologize for the appearance. Copy and paste didn\u2019t work well. Stacks of Paragraphs A poet once called my stuff Stacks of Paragraphs. Maybe they didn\u2019t think it was poetry. Having given the Stack of Paragraphs reference further thought I took myself down that age old discussion of what is poetry. Paragraphs and line breaks a poem do not make. We are in that age of poetry without definition. It seems if one wishes, all things written are poetry. But that is no more true than a front and back cover making a book. Do rhyming lines make a poem? Paragraphs? Line breaks? Genius? Peter Roget nyms? Clich\u00e9d phrases? I honest to God don\u2019t know how far to stretch the definition of \u2018poem\u2019 and I\u2019m sure no two definitions are the same because the Pleasure Of Everyone\u2019s Mind is different. No matter, writers should write and let the reader sort it out. I like stacks of Shel, The Dr. and Bukowski. How about you? This is a book of my Stacks. Call it what you will. be-u-ti-ful dandys (for my little Mo) My stacks idled like bright yellow dandys among velvet bluegrass spoiling conformed scapes,  wilting under pesti-comments dedicated to purifying the field.  Then I remember the bonding walks with my granddaughter, her squeals of delight, picking those be-u-ti-ful yellow flowers, ignoring the green.  I wrote another just for her. ",
