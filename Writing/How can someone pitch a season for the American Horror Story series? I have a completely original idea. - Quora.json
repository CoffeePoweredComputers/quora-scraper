You need to be a member of the Writers Guild of America, and you need to have appropriate representation (agent, manager, lawyer), and you need to earn a spot on the show, which is a long and heartbreaking process. Read any TV writer\u2019s Twitter feed for proof. Maybe, maybe, maybe you could circumvent the first two steps by becoming a Writer\u2019s Assistant on the show, which is its own gauntlet to run. Otherwise you\u2019re out of luck\u2026 studios, networks, and production companies have very strict policies about receiving unsolicited ideas. You might think that\u2019s unfair, or foolhardy since they are missing out on your completely original idea, but establishing a proper professional status and relationship protects you and your idea, as well as AHS.

            "answer_text": "For me all the seasons of American Horror Story are a cliche. Because more or less they portray the same story / the content in every season so far. So if you have a new idea for the show please let the producers of the show know about it, at least we can see a different story next time around. ",
