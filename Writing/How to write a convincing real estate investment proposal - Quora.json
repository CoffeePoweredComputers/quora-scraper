            "answer_text": "How do I write a convincing real estate investment proposal? here are 5 particular guidelines on the way you should make that essential presentation. 1. all through your presentation, make it clear that you know which results the evaluation committee or the board members assume to gain if they support your idea.You have to spotlight your predicted financial and operational outcomes in phrases of the metrics that matter maximum to your target audience. for example, a enterprise angel may be interested by your start-up venture\u2019s anticipated valuation after 5 years while a corporate funding committee may emphasize whether or not your new assignment will exceed the corporate funding hurdle price (as an instance, greater than 15% annual return on capital hired.) 2. provide an explanation for how you plan to use the sources you\u2019re requesting.if you\u2019re soliciting for cash, provide a few details on how you may spend it on recruitment, marketing, operations, and so forth. in case you\u2019re asking for human resources (including engineers to paintings to your task) from a corporate funding committee, define the work agenda and perceive mission milestones in which you\u2019ll examine the effects. keep in mind that useful resource carriers are comparing your precise motion plan, now not a wellknown business concept. 3. think \u201clean\u201d and best ask for assets to cover the subsequent section of your movement plan, now not extra.It\u2019s tempting to tell buyers or board participants which you have a huge vision for the future, and that you will create a new multi-million greenback commercial enterprise. but, they'll no longer be eager on investment all your future resource necessities right after the primary presentation. You need to invite yourself \u201cwhat is the minimum quantity of assets that my project wishes at this moment if you want to reach the next level?\u201d This is a great instance of lean questioning, and it\u2019s turning into more and more popular when launching start-united states of americaand corporate ventures (see the lean Startup website and book for extra ideas). 4. quickly after your presentation, contact target audience members for my part, thank them for his or her time, and ask about areas for development.building a brand new business is not a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. you will need to provide your proposal commonly before you could acquire assist. in this long method, the pleasant sources of comments are contributors of your target market who can provide you with tips for destiny shows. method them with a nice mind-set that shows your willingness to accept complaint and take some of their pointers on board. besides discussing the contents of your presentation, ask about a way to increase your presentation fashion as properly. 5. Don\u2019t assume a quick \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201dAn investor may sound passionate about supporting your undertaking, but it will take a long time to attain an agreement in writing, such as a term sheet. that is due to the fact traders prefer to see how well you're selling your thoughts and merchandise to others earlier than they dedicate themselves to fund your assignment. prepare your self for a series of \u201cperhaps\u201d type responses from buyers or board contributors at the least for some months. in case you do now not surrender your thought by using then, they're possibly to form a tremendous affect approximately your endurance as an entrepreneur.

            "answer_text": "Great question! For perspective, when I got into real estate investing I had enough cash to where I didn\u2019t need a loan and an 850 credit score. Funny enough - I kept getting turned down! Now I\u2019m a banker and have remedied the situation :-) The biggest mistake people make is writing it for themselves and not there lender. Here is a great example: I\u2019m going to make $40K on this flip. Buy it for $40K and sell it for $80K. Why should I care? The bank only cares about getting there loan repaid. Here is how you should present it: Purchase Price: $30K Renovations: $10K After-repair value: $80K Loan amount: $30K LTV will be 60% Interest-only payments are $250 My W2 job wages can easily cover this without any cash-flow from this flip.
