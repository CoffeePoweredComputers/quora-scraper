            "answer_text": "Here are the fundamental steps: 1. Select a book - This may as of now be accomplished for you, in the event that you are right now enlisted in either an English or writing class. 2. Decide the objective for the length - Keep as a top priority that an exposition on a book would as of now have an inclined doled out number of words. We should set the word number (for outline) at 500 words. A 500-word article is entirely extensive and would permit you enough words to portray the plot of the story while having room schedule-wise to scatter what topics are available and what ethics are being passed on. 3. Settle on an organization and style - You will most likely be advised to utilize either MLA (Modern Language Association) or APA (Amercian Psychological Association) standard written work style. Along these lines, on the off chance that you were appointed a 500-word article, utilizing MLA design, then you would need to utilize a Times New Roman, 12-point text style, with a one-inch (all around) page edge and twofold space all through the paper. 4. Read the alloted book. Suppose (at the end of the day for representation) that you were doled out to peruse a book entitled \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" You would should be acquainted with the subjects that are inside the story behind \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" http://usawriters.org ",
