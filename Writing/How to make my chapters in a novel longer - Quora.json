            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A How can I make my chapters in a novel longer? First, let me ask you to consider this: Do you really need to? Many writers actually try very hard to condense their writing. Many consider stories to be much better if you remove all the unnecessary fluff. That said, I will assume you need to, so here are some things to consider: Do you need to re-think where you have your chapter breaks? Are you making new chapters where you should really be making scene breaks? Are you using scenes and sequels? Scene and sequel - Wikipedia Often writers forget all about sequels, and, often, those are the most important part of the story\u2014the part that shows a character\u2019s real\u2026 erm\u2026 character\u2026 (/lamely moves on to next bullet point) Are you using all five senses in your descriptions? Don\u2019t over do it, of course, but a little extra here and there can go a long ways. Have you given attention to your minor characters? Part of making them more \u201creal\u201d is giving them needs and desires. Some of those can become major subplots to your story. Have you given attention to your settings? There is a balance to be had between white room syndrome and naming the architect who designed every building. (White room syndrome is when you fail to describe settings and readers are forced to envision everything taking place in a \u201cwhite room\u201d with nebulous surroundings.) Have you given attention to your characters, or is there maybe some \u201ctalking head syndrome\u201d going on? Have you given your protagonist a \u201creal life\u201d? That was one of the things that made Spider-Man so popular when that character was created\u2014Peter Parker had to deal with \u201creal\u201d problems while dealing with the main one. In fact, sometimes Aunt May was the main problem and Doc Ock, or whomever, was the side plot. All of these things added up can greatly increase the length of a story. They can also seriously dilute your story if you are not careful, so I sincerely ask you to consider if you really need longer chapters. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks A2A, Not a universal tip but I am gonna share my personal experience and let's see if that helps. When I started writing (terrible \ud83d\ude37) the max each chapter would go would ve around 400 - 500 words. But now I can easily venture to 2k without struggling. In fact most of the time I have to control my inner god to stop or the chapter be freaking dino tail. But sometimes I couldn't even write a hundred words (that's a different story though\u2026) So, first of First. Read - I read more than I write. Each as much as possible and you'll naturally adapt to explain things better. Not read a fanfic too, go for Oz books as a beginner or Alice in the wonderland. Build your way to Frankestein and pride and prejudice.Content - Not telling you to watch youtube content but the content of your novel. How much are you serving as a whole like,The two lovers meet but a third person tries to destroy their relation. Very common. But easy. Decide how much to give each part, their meeting and intro to villain, pangs of separation and etc. Its important to follow this step with the step 1 or you'll just write small chapters with too much. 3. Edit - My first draft usually span between 800 - 1700 depending on the content of the chapter. I usually don't like making it larger than 800 words since when I'll edit, I would add a lot more clarity aka over 500 words that are necessary. These are the three tips I follow. Nothing much important or so. But trust me overtime by reading books and sketching the outline of your story and editing for the second or third time, you be begging to shorten the chapter. Also, if you really want to read long novels, try reading the ones of Webnovel app. Chapters to some goes over 1000 and wording is generally 1500 - 2000 words. And if you are looking for a masterpiece, read War and Peace. Anyway, hope you found it useful. You can request me for any writing query that you have ",
