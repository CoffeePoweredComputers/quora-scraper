            "answer_text": "I have been an MS student, a grad school application reviewer for 2 admission seasons, and am currently a PhD student. I\u2019m not an expert but I have learned a lot of things. I will explain the main components of the SOP and will accompany it by my own version of that component as if I were an applicant. *If you have an interesting backstory relevant to graduate school, consider writing a personal statement in addition to your statement of purpose. Grad school is about research. So keep the SOP strictly about that. Do not include any personal stuff in your SOP.* a.) Your first paragraph should open with your research interests: In one paragraph, describe your research thus far and how it relates to your interest for grad school. This is a skill I learned in my first few months as a PhD student. If you can succinctly describe your work to others in the first paragraph, folks will be happy. After all, the whole competition is about which candidate has more \u201cgrad-student-ness\u2019. For instance, my opening paragraph now would probably read as follows: I am interested in making autonomous driving (AD) work in Indian traffic, where there is no lane-driving, no rule-following, and where driving is more instinctual and behavior-driven than it is based on a set of rules. So far, success of AD has been limited to US roads which often have sparse, homogeneous traffic comprising mainly of personal automobiles; in addition, you almost never see any pedestrians on the road. My research thus far has addressed two issues - 1.) tracking pedestrians in dense (>4 per meter square) crowds and 2.) tracking heterogeneous traffic agents (cars, buses, people, animals, rickshaws etc) in dense traffic. These two issues are key aspects in addressing the problem of making AD work in Indian traffic. b.) Each research project that you did should be a separate set of paragraphs answering these questions: What is the problem? why should one care about it?What are the current solution addressing that problem? Why those aren\u2019t enough, or they have further complications?How does your research aims to tackle points raised above.Your methodology and findings.Compare your results efficiently and comprehensively with state-of-the-art.Finish it off with personal comments - what you learned, what you felt, what made you happy, what was difficult and why, did you resolve that? etc\u2026All of these should be one or two lines each. For example, this is what I would write: Effective tracking of traffic agents is essential for robotic applications such as autonomous driving. Previous work has so far only managed to perform this task on open highways where the vehicles are predominantly cars. In September 2018, I developed X, an algorithm to track different kinds of road agents in highly dense traffic. Different agents have different shapes, move at varying speeds, and their trajectories are governed by underlying dynamics constraints. The complexity increases as different types of traffic agents are in close proximity and interact with each other, including vehicle-vehicle, vehicle-pedestrian, vehicle-bicycle, pedestrian-pedestrian, etc. I use the tracking-by-detection paradigm where I combine deep learning-based object detection with a novel motion model called Y. This model predicts new positions and velocities of each agent by taking into account collision avoidance and inter-agent interactions. We evaluate X on the standard benchmark Z where we compare against N methods. We beat the state of the art on the following M metrics. We submitted this work to ABCD19 and are waiting for initial reviews. We wrote this paper in a week. Although we had the tracking infrastructure in place, I had to formulate a novel mathematical framework, run experiments to generate results on our novel dataset, and write up the paper in 7 days. Things were further complicated when I initially confused the motivation of the paper and had prepared a write-up that was completely different than what my professor wanted. This was a day before the deadline. Eventually, we ended up putting the last image in the paper 3 minutes before the deadline. We were 5 people, across 2 states, coordinating via phone and email, all holed up in our respective labs at 2:57 am and I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t shaking. This experience showed me that grad school is super exciting. See? succinct, interesting, and straight to the points. (This is just now, off the top of my head. I would of course polish the language and add more detail if required\u2026) Each such paragraph should talk about a particular project c.) Talk about some standalone projects: As an undergrad, all your research may not be unified under a theme because it is more typical for an undergrad to work on disparate projects either through their own interest, from a class they took, or by approaching some professor and helping a grad student on one of their projects. So keep in mind that while the main theme of your SOP needs to be consistent with the topic you\u2019re interested in grad school, you can always mention other topics where you academically made an impact. For example, this is what I would write: Phase Retrieval is an example of a non-convex quadratic program with quadratic constraints. In the real-valued case, it is a combinatorial problem which is known to be NP-hard. Despite this observation, recent years have seen the development of new algorithms that solve phase retrieval problems effectively. Unfortunately, because of the lack of publicly available real-world data, the lack of a common software interface for different algorithms, and a knowledge gap between practitioners and theoreticians, only little work has been devoted to compare and evaluate newer phase retrieval methods. So we created Y, comprehensive library that compiles all the algorithms within a uniform interface. I am first author on the paper for Y which has been submitted to ABCD. An important skill I learned was effectively leading a lab and collaborating with peers. My role in developing Y extended to overseeing a team of three undergraduate students and one high school student. I answered questions on theory which ranged from optimization to linear algebra to convexity, and troubleshooting problems that required domain knowledge of numerical analysis. This experience of answering non-textbook questions from students gave me confidence to not become completely dependent on my adviser and motivated me to guide the development of Y. For example, I observed how Professor X discussed ideas with more senior PhD students and I applied that with the undergraduate students. As a result, I learned how to tie up big picture ideas and delegate tasks to undergraduates. A nice after-effect of this mentoring experience is that I have now started answering questions on optimization on the question-answering website, Quora, where as of the time of writing this statement I am the top writer for this category. A link to my answers can be found on my homepage. d.) Conclude by mentioning which faculty you want to work with: This isn\u2019t to suck up to the department (When I was writing my SOP, it certainly felt like sucking up), but it is actually helpful in determining who to forward your application to. This is a double edged sword. It is good to mention the folks you\u2019re interested in. But if you don\u2019t understand their research, leave it at that !! Do not talk about their papers when you don\u2019t understand them. Faculty pick up on that and it sends a bad impression. If you read their papers and actually got some insights and you have some ideas on extending that work, then mentioning that is strong. In all other cases, simply mention the professor\u2019s name and what project you\u2019re interested to work with. This is how I would conclude: At UMD, I would like to work with X as he is also working in AD. I read his recent paper on classifying driver behavior from their driving patterns. This is exciting and has tremendous applications for AD. For example, in Indian traffic, driving behavior often influences driving patterns, so we could use driver behavior for trajectory prediction. Currently, X\u2019s work uses simple linear regression to derive a mapping for the prediction phase that require hand-crafted features. I was wondering if this task could be solved by deep learning; that is, given only video information of a driver, can we predict his behavior and subsequently predict trajectory? This is an interesting question that I\u2019d like to pursue in grad school with professor X.  So yes, it should be research-oriented, to the point, unique, no fluff, and most importantly, should contain as much grad-student-ness as possible. Please don\u2019t start with phrase or a quote. ",

            "answer_text": "To make your SoP stand up isn't a simple task, but still in case that you don't, your application will just essentially mix in with the majority of the others and you will have a small chance of being chosen. Writing one effectively, requires a ton of diligent work and a lot of thought. Many students compose something that is honestly exhausting or so generic that it could be about almost anybody. Your personal statement must be unmistakably and particularly about you while meeting expectations of the committee, that will survey your application.  Here are some areas that you have to consider while SoP writing: It should constantly open with a consideration snatching line that is going to make the reader want to read on to find out more about you.It should tell a story about you, it should not just be a rundown of skills and different facts as you would give inside a resume. Use an anecdote to provide a theme and a clear story line to keep their attention on your writing.Use dialect that all can get it. There is no certification that the reader will see all acronyms and specialized terms inside your picked territory so keep away from them and also slang. Compose using a formal but conversational tone.Write about you, this may sound obvious however many will fail to truly talk about their own experiences and ambitions and may even discuss others.Avoid any use of clich\u00e9s, if the reader see numerous announcements and clich\u00e9s it can emerge like a sore thumb in your writing and detract significantly from what you want to say.Get your work done so that you know precisely what the program is looking for. Ensure that you show that you meet all of their expectations within your writing.Be specific about what you have to say and if possible quantify your experiences and achievements so it is clear what you have done.Always proofread and edit what you have written. Submitting writing that is anything less than perfect is going to ensure that your writing is overlooked",
