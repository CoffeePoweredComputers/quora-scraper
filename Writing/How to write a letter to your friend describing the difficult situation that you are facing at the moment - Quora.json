            "answer_text": "My dearest friend Hira, My fondest wishes is that when you receive this short letter, you, your family and other love ones are doing well and find yourself in the best of health during these difficult times. As you may have heard through our other mutual friends, I was let go from my former employer since last April and my former employer is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy. It is a very terrible situation, not only for me, my co-workers, my former employer as well. Their business of 65 years, started by their parents and continued by them is about to fold, an extremely sad situation. For the last few months, I have been searching in vain for new employment to no avail and am beginning to feel the stress and the pain that many in my position now face. I want to remain hopeful and will always keep working at it but I am extremely low on resources and must bail out. At this moment, I am confronted with many difficult decisions and choices with very few options and solutions and have decided to leave NY temporariliy and return back to my parent\u2019s house, a decision I so much am regretting for the fear that I may become a burden or covid danger to them during this late stage of their life. You have been my closest true friend and I feel that I must confide in someone my deepest fears should you not hear from me during this difficult transition period of my life. Please keep me in your prayers as I will keep you in mind, Thank you friend, I will miss you dearly. Sincerely, Your most humble friend and servant, Nutty squared bud #2! Remember that last pre-covid border crossing ride into Canada where we got totally wasted on watered down beer and stale piss-tachio nuts!!! What on earth were we thinking? ",

            "answer_text": "How do you write a letter to your friend describing the difficult situation that you are facing at the moment? I think the threshold issue is why you want to write a letter that I presume would come out of the blue - a \u201ccold\u201d letter - a letter that comes out of the blue. People write cold letters to motivate action or a response from the recipient. Compare with cold sales letters or spam, such as Nigerian e-mails announcing you have just inherited megabucks but you have to do A, B and C, and provide proof of your identity, etc. to receive your \u201cinheritance.\u201d What kind of a response do you expect from your cold letter? Do you want your friend\u2019s help with your difficult situation? Do you want money? Do you want sympathy? Etc.? Depending on the length of time and closeness of your friendship, your letter may take the person aback and provoke a negative reaction. Your letter might arouse your friend\u2019s suspicions if you ask for money. In these scam times, any cold written request for money arouses suspicions. Your friend might think someone is pressuring you to ask for the money. Then, you need to consider especially in these covid times people have troubles of their own. The last thing they want to be bothered with is someone else\u2019s troubles. So you may want to think twice before writing a letter to your friend that describes a difficult situation you are facing at the moment. Ask yourself how you would feel if a friend sent you the letter. If you still decide to write the letter to your friend, I would suggest you be as brief as possible. Be dispassionate in tone and come to the point quickly. ",
