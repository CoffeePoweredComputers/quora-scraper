It carries the notion of forget or of neglect.    \u9057\u5fd8 yi2wang4, means to forget or forgotten without the idea of neglect.  \u5fd8\u4e86 wang4le5 or \u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86 wang4ji4le5 are both more common in daily speech for \"have forgotten\",  although both also can carry the notion of \"neglected\"  or \"overlooked\". Maybe one of the Chinese language instructors in Quora can improve this answer with some background on methods for expressing forgetting and forgetfulness? ",
