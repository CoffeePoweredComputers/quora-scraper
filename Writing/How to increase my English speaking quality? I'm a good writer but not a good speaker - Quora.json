            "answer_text": "First of all, I think we should all take pride in our mother tongue. But knowing a few different languages is also never problematic. So before beginning, I want you to please understand that learning and speaking a language is not difficult if you do away with the fear in your mind and put in your sincere efforts. Some points which might perhaps help you \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Know the Basics - To learn or improve upon any language one must be well acquainted with its basics. For this you can buy English Grammar Workbooks (which have all the grammar topics covered along with enough practice exercises) and solve them. This will help you get a good grasp of grammar.Listen - Its a famous saying that \u201cgood listeners are good speakers\u201d. So try watching English news, sitcoms or movies. For starting Indian English news channels will be good. Initially, you may not understand a lot of things but slowly and gradually you will. This is also good to improve your vocabulary and learning proper pronunciation of words.Read - Make a habit of reading any newspaper, magazine, novel (even your course textbooks would suffice) everyday. And make sure to READ LOUDLY. When you read loudly, it not only improves your pronunciation but also helps your brain to adapt so that you don\u2019t feel awkward later on when you suddenly start speaking in English is front a group. Even when you do the workbook part, read loudlyPractice - If possible try repeating the lines you read to yourself in front of the mirror. Try speaking the quotes of you favorite characters in the novel or movies. This really helps.Speak - No matter how much you read or listen, unless you don\u2019t start speaking you can\u2019t improve your spoken skills. So try conversing in English as much as possible - with your friends, colleagues, boss or other people. And speak with confidence.Most importantly be patient and keep trying. If your friends or colleagues laugh at you don\u2019t feel disheartened and lose hope. Just keep trying. Remember \u2018Rome was not built in day\u2019. Everything takes time but with your efforts and practice you can reach your goals. Hope you find the answer helpful. All the Best! ",

            "answer_text": "Be confident.Since you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019re shy while speaking, you\u2019ll have to improve on that. Just be confident, let go of your nervousness and don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes.Practice.Speak English as much as you can. Converse with your friends in English.Record yourself.This will help you improve your diction. It\u2019s a good method for self-analysis.Speak in front of a mirror.Stand in front of a mirror and just talk\u2026 non-stop, whatever you feel like. Just don\u2019t stop. It\u2019s a good way to boost your confidence.Think in English.If you think in your native language and then try to communicate the same in English, you\u2019ll have trouble. You\u2019d have to translate your ideas into English first. So make it a point to think in English. It\u2019ll improve your fluency.Focus more on fluency.While speaking, the main objective is to express your thoughts clearly to the other person. Minor grammatical errors can, hence, be ignored. So you should focus more on your fluency and less on using perfect grammar. (Don\u2019t ignore basic grammar though :p)Hope this helps. :) ",
