            "answer_text": "This is an excellent question. Generally, when you paraphrase something it\u2019s very informal and you get to choose what information from a given text you focus on as you paraphrase. It\u2019s similar to summarizing, but it\u2019s very loosely done. Summarizing, on the other hand, is something that people often do on tests. Therefore, it\u2019s a bit more formal. When summarizing, you need all the basic information from a text and you may not be able to use your own words as much as you would when paraphrasing. If you\u2019re focusing on writing key concepts, it would probably be more like a summary than a paraphrase. ",

            "answer_text": "When writing key concepts, what you do is paraphrasing the text. Although summarizing and paraphrasing are pretty similar, there\u2019s a difference you have to understand. All in all, paraphrasing is a purely subjective informal activity where you decide which chunks of information are relevant to your work and which are to be left behind. Paraphrasing is mostly done in your own words. That being said, summarizing is a more formal type of written assignment where you work with a text as a whole, using concepts and vocabulary of a respective author. Writing a summary is one of the task students receive in college, and paraphrase is something you do in your own time without any educational context. ",

            "answer_text": "You paraphrase. The difference is paraphrasing is a restatement of a text, passage, or work giving the meaning in another form. Summarizing involves the final part of an argument, reviewing points made and expressing conclusions. As you may have guessed, I did and do routinely consult my Webster\u2019s in order to give you the most precise answer available. I hope you have one and keep by your feet like I do. ",
