            "answer_text": "I think the key to this is sincerity. Choose a form of words that expresses what you feel and is appropriate to your relationship with the other person. And avoid colloquialisms unless you are sure of your ground. I receive a lot of emails with things like \u2018hope you are well\u2019, \u2018how are you today?\u2019, \u2018hope you are having a great day\u2019 and so on. These are pointless, vacuous and formulaic when they come from someone I\u2019ve never met and never had any dealings with (which is ninety-percent of the time). \u2018I trust\u2019 is more formal than \u2018I hope\u2019 but essentially expresses the same sentiment. It also sounds rather old fashioned these days - you would expect it in a letter from fusty old lawyers but not from a go-ahead young advertising executive. (It\u2019s more often used these days as a slightly tart reminder: \u2018I trust you won\u2019t forget to get Clarihew\u2019s report to him before the end of the day\u2019. I\u2019m not sure there is a useful substitute for hope, given what you want to express. Which means you have to stick with it or find a form of words which doesn\u2019t imply the expectation, speculation or query carried by \u2018hope\u2019. (This will be dependent on the context: wishing them a good weekend, saying you look forward to meeting or hearing from them, asking them to keep you informed etc. These things would generally come at the end of the letter - or email etc - often the expressions I mentioned above are the opening salvo.) BTW Do we normally say \u2018things are well\u2019? People are well, things may be \u2018going well\u2019\u2026 but then we do say \u2018Hope all\u2019s well with you\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "[Edit: original question details, referenced in my answer, were I find that I preface many emails by saying things like \"I hope your had a great weekend!\"; \"I hope the event went well.\"; \"I hope you had a happy holiday!\". What may be some good substitutes for \"hope\"? It's sounding trite and disingenuous at this point. ] You can say (this expresses a higher degree of confidence on your part and might be jarring if the occasion was actually a disaster) \"I trust you had a great weekend\" (or equivalents). To be honest, it IS a rather trite and disingenuous phrase because it's a professional email and you don't really want/expect to know about their weekend; it's just a form of words by which you establish that your relationship is a good-natured one. If you've got a greater degree of personal rapport built up and you do genuinely want to know, then phrase it as a direct question (\"How did the event go?\"). ",
