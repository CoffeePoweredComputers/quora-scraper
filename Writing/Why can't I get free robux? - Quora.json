            "answer_text": "(\u2014____\u2014) Did you really ask that? Fine, I\u2019ll answer\u2026 You can\u2019t get free robux because Roblox corporation needs money to support Roblox, the game. If everyone got free robux with no other kind of microtransactions, Roblox corporation will go bankrupt or worse\u2026 in debt (if they\u2019re not already)! You have to understand that the people in R.C. need your money so Roblox can be played for many years to come. I mean come on, most of the stuff you get are free anyway like: -T- shirts, shirts, pants, hats, etc. -Audio -Admin (in free admin games) -Games Honestly, you don\u2019t need more clothes or gamepasses to have a good time, cherish what you already have! Technically though, builder\u2019s club gives free robux, but you need to pay\u2026 so yeah. ",

            "answer_text": "You can. Some groups offer giveaways, I know some people who got Robux with that method. However, avoid online sites that offer free Robux, even free Robux apps if they ask for your password. The most safe and easy way in my opinion to get \u2018free Robux\u2019 is to join groups that offer giveaways but don\u2019t have too many members in them, which increases your chances of getting Robux.
