Or did he keep it just inside the front door as a deterrent to intruders? And Willie\u2019s \u201cShake\u2026\u201d derived from \u201cschakken\u201d, meaning to brandish. Surely, Douglas, the act of brandishing would normally involve some degree of shaking. Without any shaking, there would have to be some thrusting, otherwise one might just as well turn tail and scarper. Do forgive me. I haven\u2019t had so much fun since I arrived on Quora\u2019s doorstep. But I almost forgot to mention. Shake or hyphen, he did write such lovely plays! bm. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, IT IS. There is no other explanation for the hyphen. As soon as the epic poems Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece by WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE were published, Henry Willobie wrote: \u201cAnd Shake-speare paints poor Lucrece rape\u201d. Furthermore, the first time that the name appears on the front page of a Quarto, it was written with a hyphen. Pirate copies of Titus Andronicus, The Taming of a Shrew and 2+3 Henry VI were published in 1594 and 1595, without naming the author. In 1597 and 1598 two good Quartos of Richard the second and Richard the third was published, naming \u201cWilliam Shake-speare\u201d and \u201cW. Shake-speare\u201d as the author. Eleven years later, the sonnets were published under the title \u201cSHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS\u201d.  ",

He was a Renaissance man and a champion at jousting, and those jousting poles were very long. It would not surprise me if his friends called him shakes- Vere ( because his last name was Vere). He was the only Englishman to journey to Italy during the plague years which would be like going to Italy in 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic. And the plays of Shakespeare are filled with Italian words\u2014 in fact 13 of them take place in Italy. ",
