            "answer_text": "Start by taking yourself lightly. Be absurd, write something nonsensical, then dial it back. For instance, Harlan Ellison, in one of his collections, states sheerest fantasy in his bio, stating, in turn, that he flew \u2018over the hump\u2019 with Chennault\u2019s Flying Tigers, and his favorite foods are monkey brains scooped out of the freshly-trepanned skull, and french fries-very crisp. I doubt that he actually eats monkey brains (in as much as they\u2019re treyf) but I think you see the point. Of course, Ellison is much better known than either you or I. But come up with a funny one-liner you like, and give it a twist. For example, using me: \u201cThere is no truth to the rumor that Samuel John Klein is the spiritual leader of the world\u2019s longhair house cats, but it\u2019s never been disproven either.\u201d There is truth to the statement that I\u2019m a cat person, but no truth that the world\u2019s kitties look to be for spiritual guidance \u2026 well, as far as you know, anyway.
