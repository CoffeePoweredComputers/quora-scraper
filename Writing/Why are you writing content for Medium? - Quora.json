            "answer_text": "I began self-publishing on Medium because of 1) Ev Williams\u2019s reputation for success and 2) because of their promise to create a pay-wall system that would finally enable digital writers and self-publishers to monetize, at least, some of their work. Unfortunately, instead of being satisfied to #LETTHEAUDIENCEDECIDE, the editors of Medium clearly opted to shape what was exposed on the platform in their own image. Which meant if you didn\u2019t fit their post-Millennial profile \u2014 at least as far as your writing goes \u2014 you didn\u2019t get much promotion or exposure. Which, after all, is the name of the game, when you\u2019re not collecting a fee for writing. Then, Medium promised they could fix all that with their pay-wall system which would enable writers who built their own individual readerships to monetize their work \u2014 at least to some extent. But unfortunately, the Medium pay-wall system works only to benefit Medium, not the writers who joined it, many if not most of whom are complaining loudly these days. So, to answer your question, I\u2019m not writing for Medium anymore, at least, not much anymore. At the below listed link, you can read, if you care to, some of the best advice I\u2019ve ever given about writing. Cheers! About Writing About Writing ",

            "answer_text": "Mainly for the simplicity and partner program. Medium lets pretty much any writer sign up for an account and start writing. Anyone can also sign up for their partner program and start earning money for the posts they write. You don\u2019t to worry about writing advertiser-friendly content, or worry about keeping the site up to date and fast enough. There\u2019s also the fact that it\u2019s absolutely free, while having your own site requires you to pay for a domain and hosting at the very least. ",
