            "answer_text": "I assume you are talking mainly about entertainment personalities. The best way to send a letter would be to address it to them in care of their studio, record label, publisher, the last movie studio they did a movie for, television headquarters, etc. All those addresses can be found online. Write to their agent if you can find who it is. Neatly hand-write the letter and, honestly, don\u2019t expect a personal reply, but you never know. ",
