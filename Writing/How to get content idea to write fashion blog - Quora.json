            "answer_text": "When you\u2019re just starting out as a fashion blogger you probably have tons of ideas for posts. If you\u2019ve been at it for a while, however, coming up with a unique take on a trend or a fresh angle for an outfit post can be more challenging.  I feel your pain, I\u2019ve been there :) Luckily, inspiration is all around. Fashion is such a generous niche, offering plenty of opportunities for bloggers looking to stand out from the crowd. With a little imagination, you could write an entire essay about an accessory alone \u2013 how it helped you at one time in your life, how you came to have it, the outfit it best goes with, and so on. If you\u2019re having trouble building a post, use the 6-word formula - Who, What, When, Where, How, Why. As long as you have these basics covered, you can end up with a gorgeously-crafted post with minimum effort. Bookmark it for days when you\u2019re low on creativity.  Or, for extra help, rely on clich\u00e9s you can make your own.
