            "answer_text": "I think it generally means the \u2018mood\u2019 of a piece including the attitude of your characters towards their dilemmas. For example if you take the plot of Indiana Jones, the first two, anyway, there is all sorts of peril, but the mood is fun and you are never really concerned about the hero. A classic example is Franz Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis, which opens up with Gregor, a normal young man having turned into a giant insect (vermin, in German). Yet the \u2018tone\u2019 of the rest of the story is deliberately matter-of-fact, concerned about the practical implications of Gregor\u2019s new situation. Yet this casual \u2018tone\u2019 (and Kafka wrote in un unpretentious, almost blue-collar style in German) is what makes the story even more terrifying than a bunch of shrieking and gnashing of teeth would be. I think the main concern should be consistency in whatever you are writing, unless you have some specific end in mind in using contrast. I often think of the scene in American Psycho where the protagonist is screaming at the Chinese laundry people for not getting the blood stains out of his bed-sheets well enough. It is brilliant because it dances horror on the edge of a knife with humor. This is not easy to do. ",

            "answer_text": "Initially as a student of English literature I used to get confused about this critical analysis of poems. Most of the helping materials used to come up with various words like meter, rhyme, sounds, tone and many more and I always launched myself into a confused state unable to understand use of these in poems. But hold on, these words are same as their literal meaning the only thing is give several reading to the poem to unfold its theme, sounds, rhythm and all. Now coming to the tone, it is actually the mood of the poem, the type of emotion is judged through the tone in a way similar the tone of any tune denotes the emotion expressed. Thus it is an easy but an analytical feature of the poem. ",
