            "answer_text": "How much can you earn by freelancing in a given month? is what you asked and here is my honest response 1 - it all depends on your skill(s) and the amount of time you spend on finding leads, projects and ensuring clients are satisfied. 2 - When I started freelancing 17 years ago, I used to make around 4 to 5000 rs a month, but I never cared or felt low because I gave more importance to learning because the more you learn, the more you can earn then I started freelancing for IT projects around 3 years ago and focused only on specific skills which I was really confident on. Around a year and half ago, I started a Service Development Company and most of the work was coming from Freelancing Portals for quite some time. 3 - if you don\u2019t have any skills that are in demand, you must ask a question such as what skills can I develop to get into freelancing? 4 - do you have the zeal, the drive, the enthusiasm and most importantly self belief to fight it out? if yes, you can get in touch with me and I will give you access to life time membership and support which will be value driven and you will get exclusive access to my life lessons, my skills, my tools I use, my trade secrets on how I make money, ongoing tutorials, articles, ideas, case studies etc I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with nearly a dozen high-growth startups and world-class experts. What\u2019s more is that I\u2019ve never had to negotiate for the premium prices I charge for my content marketing services. Because I\u2019ve done such an effective job of defining my value propositions, branding myself as an expert within my field, and getting my content in front of new target audiences, I now have a 3\u20136 month waiting list for new freelance clients. However, that certainly didn\u2019t happen overnight. My rapid success in the world of freelancing is the result of a LOT of strategic positioning, hours of hard work, and good timing. If you\u2019re ready to get serious about freelancing and multiplying your self-employed income, here are my top twelve tips for earning more during your first year. To conclude, although I hate disclosing what I earn, to give you an idea, I am able to take care of my family, my own expenses, my investments and on top of that have some long term liquidity. you can feel free to contact IIMSKILLS by visiting their site and Learn Freelancing.
