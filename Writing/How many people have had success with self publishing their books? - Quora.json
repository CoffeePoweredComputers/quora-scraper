            "answer_text": "So\u2026 my big piece of advice is don\u2019t self-publish. Try and get in with a publishing house. A REPUTABLE publishing house - not a vanity press, not some rando you\u2019ve never seen in bookstores. If you self-publish, your book will likely never see the light of day beyond those family and friends who buy a copy out of a desire to help you out. You might \u201cget it into stores\u201d, but unless it sells steadily it will either come back to you after a couple years, get destroyed, or sit languishing on their \u201cconsignment\u201d shelf. There are VERY few Patrick Carmans in the world. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find stores that will take you seriously if you\u2019re self-published, both because of the low-quality of most self-publishing services and the tendency for self-published books to be\u2026 not good. I\u2019m not saying yours isn\u2019t good, but the VAST majority of self-published books are\u2026 not good. If you\u2019re having trouble getting published, find a good agent. They can help you refine your book and guide you on where to submit. It\u2019s a process, and you\u2019ll benefit from it. ",

People no longer have to rely on traditional publishing for success. \u201cAmanda Hocking\u2019s success story is also interesting and worth knowing: She wrote 17 novels while working at a full-time job. She self-published them all as ebooks selling more than a million copies.\u201d \u201cA writer of paranormal fiction who started her writing career as an unknown author and has become a bestseller when deciding on self-publishing on Amazon Kindle. But the road to success wasn\u2019t easy for her. She had a day job caring for disabled people to make ends meet and a night job when she was writing until dawn. By 2010 she had a total of 17 unpublished novels all of which have been rejected by book agents and publishers. At that time she was out of money and frustrated having spent years trying to interest traditional publishers in her work.\u201d \u201cA few days after publishing her vampire novel, My Blood Approves, on Amazon\u2019s website, she started selling nine copies a day. A few weeks later she published three further books to the series. Sales went up to more than $4,000 followed by $6,000 in pure profit, so she ended up quitting her job.\u201d \u201cAshwin Sanghi, the author of bestselling novels such as The Rozabal Line, has also turned to self-publishing after being rejected by dozens of publishers. Unwilling to give up on his dream, he decided to go to the self-publishing way, and the book is now a bestseller.\u201d \u201cRob Dirks self-published his first science fiction novel, Where the Hell is Tesla?, and it got sold 10,000 copies in the first twelve months after being rejected by publishers. He claims it wasn\u2019t luck.\u201d E.L. James \u201cArguably the most well-known self-publishing success story is E.L. James\u2019 50 Shades of Grey trilogy. She self-published the first book in 2011 as an ebook and print (on demand paperback) through an independent publisher. What began as Twilight fan-fiction, soon became a world-known bestseller. Despite the mixed critical responses, Fifty Shades of Grey alone has sold over 100 million copies worldwide, and the book holds the record for the fastest selling paperback which made her the richest of self-published authors.\u201d [1] Footnotes[1] Self-Publishing Success Stories You Need to Hear About",
