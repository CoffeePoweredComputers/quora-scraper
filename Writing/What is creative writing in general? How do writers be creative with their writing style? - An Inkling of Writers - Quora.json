            "answer_text": "Becoming a creative writer - that is, a writer who is creative - is actually pretty simple. But it\u2019s not easy. First, you have to read, and you have to read a lot. It also helps if you read a wide variety of books: find a genre or two (or three, or four) that you\u2019re interested in and go nuts. Find a couple favourite authors and dive into their bibliographies. This will help you get a good feel for what\u2019s been done before. Next, you have to write a lot, and you have to accept that, when you first start writing, you won\u2019t be very good. In fact, you\u2019ll be downright awful. But this is OK. No writer\u2019s first story has ever been a masterpiece. After that, you have to accept that you\u2019ll never become a \u201cgood\u201d writer. There will always be something you can improve; the trick is getting your writing to that sweet spot where it\u2019s polished enough that other people will want to read it. It takes experience to know where that sweet spot is, and even the most experienced writers often can\u2019t see it. You\u2019ll also need to develop a thick skin. Criticism is one of the best things that can happen to a writer (so long as it\u2019s sincere). It\u2019ll hurt your ego for a little while, but given time you\u2019ll grow from it. If you\u2019re serious about becoming a writer, your work is going to get rejected a lot: you\u2019ll soon discover that a rejection with criticisms is far, far better than silence (or, even worse, the dreaded form letter). And the last, and maybe most important thing is: don\u2019t worry about being creative. Just write what you want to write. It\u2019s not \u201ccreativity\u201d that makes a good writer; it\u2019s practice, practice, practice. Do this, and eventually you\u2019ll find yourself naturally developing your own style. But don\u2019t worry too much about being \u201ccreative\u201d: you can write nothing but Harry Potter fan fiction and still be \u201ccreative.\u201d Originality doesn\u2019t necessarily spawn creativity. Have fun! ",
