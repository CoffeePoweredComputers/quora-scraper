            "answer_text": "While most regular readers would agree that the content of Tamil newspapers and magazines has leaned more towards cinema and sensational stuff in recent years as cited in the question, I am afraid I do not agree with the contention that the quality of writers or writing itself has declined. In my opinion, some of the popular magazines still publish quality content though definitely less compared to what was the situation 5-10 years back. Coming to the question of web presence, I started reading Tamil articles online a couple of years back and personally for me, the experience has been very positive. Websites that publish Tamil articles have become really active portals of knowledge sharing and discussion on a variety of topics. I will share some sites that I have come across. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list. Also the content and themes of these sites may not suit everyone's tastes, but I am mentioning them here because these are some of the most popular sites today, and exploring the articles and discussions on these sites can actually lead you to some more sites that you might be interested in. Popular sites of individuals and sites for current affairs: 1. IdlyVadai - \u0b87\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0b9f\u0bc8 : Popular site for Politics and Current affairs with a touch of humour. 2. \u0b95\u0bb2\u0b95\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bb2\u0bcd 3. \u0baa\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bbf 4. \u0baf\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb7\u0bcd\u0ba3\u0bbe Popular web magazines: 1. \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bc7\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bcd : Web journal with articles on a almost every topic under the sun.
