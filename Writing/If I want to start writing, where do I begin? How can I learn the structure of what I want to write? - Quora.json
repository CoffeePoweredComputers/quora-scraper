            "answer_text": "Fortunately, brilliant minds have already dedicated lifetimes to studying how to structure great stories. Learn from them and you will shave many years off your learning curve. Let\u2019s start from the very beginning\u2014a very good place to start: Poetics by Aristotle.Aaron Sorkin, considered by many as one of the best screenwriters working today, claims that Poetics is essential reading for any writer. He\u2019s even so bold to claim that, if you go against the structure rules laid down by Aristotle, your story will flounder.The Writer\u2019s Journey by Christopher VoglerIn 1949, Joseph Campbell published The Hero with a Thousand Faces. It describes how to structure stories that revolve around a hero and his or her journey through life. It\u2019s a dense, tortuous book, yet it inspired George Lucas to write Star Wars and inspired many screenwriters and authors to create their best work. Christopher Vogler, who worked at Disney, thought that Campbell\u2019s ideas were so powerful that he wrote up a summary of The Hero with a Thousand Faces to help Disney improve its storytelling skills. That summary was eventually expanded into The Writer\u2019s Journey, a book that you should become intimately familiar with.Story by Robert McKeeMany writers hate this book and claim that it\u2019s about 95% fluff. Others swear by it. But no matter their feelings, most successful writers have read it, so you should as well.The Anatomy of Story by John TrubyThis is my favorite book about story structure and, when used alongside the books recommended above, it will give you the most advanced, flexible, and reliable method of structuring your writing.If you want to be a successful writer, you should read these books over and over again. I hope to read your stories someday. ",

            "answer_text": "This past year, my writing online racked up over 20M views (and if I\u2019m being honest, I think that\u2019s a low estimate). Do you want to know how I got started writing? Over ten years ago, every time I would feel sick, I would grab my dad\u2019s laptop and bring it into the bathroom with me\u2014I knew I was going to be there for a while. Up until the age 18, I didn\u2019t know that I was allergic to the most common food ingredient in the United States of America: wheat. My life was a never-ending stream of stomachaches with lots and lots of time to kill, sitting in the bathroom. While I would sit on the toilet, I\u2019d crack open my dad\u2019s laptop and start writing in a Word document. I would write about how I didn\u2019t understand why I had stomachaches all day. I would write about how I wished I was different, how I wished I was normal. I would write about some of the kids at my school, the ones that stood out to me, either because I was jealous of them or wanted them to like me or wished they would stop making fun of me. I would write about the fight I\u2019d gotten into with my mom in the kitchen, or my dad and his comments after my last hockey game, or my siblings and how my sister would practice the violin down in our music room and how I liked some of the songs but when she would practice her intervals for fifteen minutes straight it would drive me nuts. I would write about the way I saw the world, sitting there on the toilet, occasionally staring out the window on the other side of the bathroom. Through the glass, I could see a few trees, the winding street outside, sometimes our neighbor\u2019s car parked in their driveway, and I would wonder about myself in this world, and where I fit in. Thousands upon thousands of pages of this rambling were written by me in the bathroom. That\u2019s where I found my voice as a writer. If you want to start writing, if anyone asks where to start when it comes to writing, that\u2019s where I point. Not the bathroom. A journal. Your journal is where you discover your most honest voice. Your raw voice. Your unfiltered, genuine, sincere voice that sings with joy and sadness and wisdom and innocence all at the same time. You don\u2019t become a writer by trying to learn how to become a writer. You become a writer by writing what\u2019s in your heart, so much so that you forget you are even writing at all. When you write, it should feel like your chest is opening up and your entire being is being spilled onto the page in front of you. It\u2019s not so much writing that you\u2019re practicing, as vulnerability. And the best place to practice that is in your journal. ======================================================= Did you like this post?
