            "answer_text": "Rhetorical situations occur anytime there is an exigence (issue needing resolution and can be resolved), an audience which can be persuaded to take action, and there are constraints on what that action can be (time; location; history; institutions such as religion, government, education; etc.). For example, as an institution, Congress has specific expectations for how questions will be asked of witnesses during Congressional hearings and how witnesses will answer.  The rhetor must work within the constraints to persuade the audience of its need and ability to remedy the exigence. We're surrounded by rhetorical situations because  we are constantly having to talk to/with others.  Most obvious,  President Obama delivers a speech in Alaska on the need to act on global warming. The police chief  must address the anger and concerns of a community when a police officer shoots a civilian to persuade the community that the matter is not taken lightly or being covered up. Presidential debates are easily identifiable as rhetorical situations. Each candidate, working withing the constraints of the debate procedure, attempts to persuade the American audience that the other hopefuls are unqualified and they are the best choice. Prosecutors and defense lawyers try to persuade the jury that the defendant is or is not deserving of the death penalty.  Less obvious examples: You discover that several children in your child's school are being bullied but your school district has no anti-bullying program. You want speak at the next board meeting to persuade the the school board to develop and implement such a program.Your business is struggling to acquire new clients because of your company's sales approach and you (the rhetor) must persuade your employees to change.Your spouse wants to buy an SUV and you feel a hybrid is the better choice.The girl scout tries to persuade you that you absolutely should buy those cookies.",

            "answer_text": "I need to pee and I\u2019m in a room with people, so I want to say something to let them know why I am leaving the room. That\u2019s a rhetorical situation. I am fed up with the working conditions at my place of employment and want to make my voice heard, so I make myself a sign, staple it to a stick, and head out to picket. That is a rhetorical situation. I am MLK Jr. and I have a dream that I want to share with others, and I want to fight for equality for people of all races. I walk through the streets and stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to give a speech. That is a rhetorical situation. Don\u2019t let all the gobbledygook confuse you. A \u201crhetorical situation\u201d is any situation a person finds themselves in where they need to use language or convey an idea. While telling your colleagues at a business meeting, \u201cExcuse me, I need to use the restroom\u201d isn\u2019t nearly as lofty or as important as MLK\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, nonetheless, they are both rhetorical situations: a speaker who wants to convey an idea to an audience. TO ELABORATE: The \u201cneed to pee\u201d example usually clarifies things for my students. Imagine three scenarios: 1. I am a teacher and need to pee. I say \u201cExcuse me. Keep doing your worksheet. I\u2019ll be right back. I need to use the restroom.\u201d 2. I\u2019m with my grandchildren, ages 2 and 4, and need to pee. I say \u201cGrandma has to go potty. Just eat your dinner and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d 3. I\u2019m a college student at a bar with my friends and I need to pee. I say \u201cGotta break the seal ha ha! Be right back!\u201d Each of these scenarios is a rhetorical situation. We make decisions about how we want the others in the room to perceive us (ethos) and change our language choices and information (logos) based on the audience\u2019s needs and how we want them to react (pathos). Each of these rhetorical choices can be seen in the above rhetorical situations. So the fact is that we find ourselves in rhetorical situations constantly, every single day. We are experts at adjusting for rhetorical situations. It\u2019s only when the stakes are high, the discussion is more important than peeing, and the audience is much more nuanced than friends in a bar that understanding how to adjust for rhetorical situations becomes a real challenge.
