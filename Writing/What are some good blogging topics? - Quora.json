If you just want to talk about the same old things everyone else is talking about\u2026.ho\u2026hum\u2026. cobwebs. Try and use the questions from your Facebook page and make thorough blog post answers. Know that when one customer asks a question there are probably 10 other people too shy to ask the question and they are eager for your response. Are you using Google Alerts? This is a very easy method to find out what is happening in your industry. If you are in the florist business and you set up Google Alerts to send you an email whenever someone talks about \u201cfloral\u201d or \u201cflower business\u201d or even specifically \u201cmartha washington roses\u201d then you will have something new to discuss. I would take these great gems and sometimes just link to the articles on my business page. It makes people see your social media account as very forward thinking and ontop of the industry. In some cases these lovely gems being sent to my in-box give me the coolest ideas for blog posts. I take an idea and find other sources and then make a totally fresh approach to the topic. Be sure to write in a manner that is readable for the masses. If you cannot remember how to spell a word - use a different word. Add some fun with your titles. Talking about 2 different types of geraniums? Call your post \u201cA Tale of 2 Geraniums\u201d or \u201cDitto! I\u2019ll Take Two!\u201d Make your titles and subheading dynamic and always use headers and keywords to further get indexed by Mama Google. I can write on subjects that interest me - if you ask me to write about insurance my eyes roll back into their sockets (had to quit that gig). So choose topics that make sense to your clients, your business, your community - and all will be fine! Best of luck! ",
