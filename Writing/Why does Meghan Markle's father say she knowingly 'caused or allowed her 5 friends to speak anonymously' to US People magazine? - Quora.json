            "answer_text": "Perhaps she did know her friends would speak anonymously to People Magazine. It does not give him a pass to sell the letter she wrote him to the Daily Mail on Sunday. He whines and moans that \u201cthey made him look bad\u201d. Well, I\u2019d say that a father who goes against a child\u2019s wishes to not speak to the press not once but many times makes himself look bad. I know he was probably embarrassed by what was said in the interview-but you know what? He deserved it. And it\u2019s not just Meghan who he\u2019s let down in his family. He\u2019s never bothered to meet two of his daughter Samantha\u2019s children and the other three grandchildren said he never bothers with them. The poor homeless brother was not welcome in his father\u2019s house (even Samantha said no one is to blame for his problems except himself), and it\u2019s a safe bet Tom Markle didn\u2019t send a dime from any of his interviews at Meghan\u2019s expense to help his son Tom Junior get off the streets. He\u2019s a bitter old man who is jealous of his youngest child\u2019s success, instead of beaming with pride and celebrating her marriage. Instead, he\u2019s a big part of the reason that Harry and Meghan have had to make the wrenching decision to step away from their senior-royal roles. I saw a book title the other day that made me think of him; it was called, \u201cI Hate You, But Don\u2019t Leave Me.\u201d He wants the money that his association with Meghan brings him, but at the same time, perhaps he still genuinely wants a relationship with her. You can\u2019t have it both ways, sir. You have to pick one, and hope it\u2019s not too late to have the latter. ",
