            "answer_text": "Answer edit: I just found a book with the title: \u201cThe House That Cleans Itself\u201d I have to check it out. I don\u2019t like wasting time trying to find things, so I organize my small space in a logical way, and always put important things like keys, phone, and wallet in the same place. I don\u2019t throw clothes on the floor; the hamper is just as close. I also don\u2019t like looking at messiness. Even when I had small children, I had them clean up before they went on to play with something else. I also cleaned up their toys from the living room before their dad got home, so he would come home to a pleasant environment. I also worked outside the home, but got home by 3:30pm. When they got older, they were allowed to have messy rooms, but the common space had to be free of their stuff when they were done with it. When they lost things in their rooms, I\u2019d say \u201cI put it away the last time I used it\u201d. One of them (the Virgo) was always pretty neat, but the other one (the Sagittarius) was very messy, and still is at 53. The hardest thing for me is paperwork. I\u2019ve never been good at organizing that. I stayed in a friend\u2019s guest room while I looked for a room to rent. I hadn\u2019t been to her home before, and was surprised to see that her stove was covered with so much stuff, I was unable to use it. Her kitchen table only had space for one person, her son. She\u2019s a hoarder, and buys stuff constantly on HSN. Her laundry basket was overflowing, the cat box was full of poop, and her freezer was so stuffed, there was no room for any small item I might want to put in there. But there was one friend\u2019s house that topped that. She asked me to pick up her mail, and put it in her house. I was shocked when I could barely open the door to get in. Hoarding had taken over the entire house, and the appliances were unusable because of stuff piled on them. Even though she had a washer and dryer, she went to the laundromat. She\u2019s a yoga teacher, so don\u2019t let the occupation fool you. I\u2019d seen some places that were almost as bad, where there was only a path through the stuff piled up high. Like anything, there are levels of messiness, and reasons for it. As I get older, and have more physical pain, I don\u2019t maintain my space as I would like to. Fortunately, I\u2019m not a hoarder these days, and only have a tiny room that I rent. Right now my winter clothes are piled in a corner (in clear storage bags) until I move my summer clothes to make room for them. I have to wait until I have the energy for this, but it will get done, and my space will be fairly neat again. I do wonder if a neat house might actually bother some people. ",

            "answer_text": "There are plenty of great answers here already that say basically the same thing that initially occurred to me. To wit, people\u2019s houses get messy when they don\u2019t have the time, inclination, or skill to keep them clean. I was going to scroll on by, but when I started to do so, I realised: I know someone who purposefully keeps his house messy. The person in question is someone I used to live with. (I\u2019ll call him Bob for the sake of this story, though that\u2019s not his real name.) Bob\u2019s need to live in a messy house often drove me to the edge of sanity. As soon as I finished cleaning a room, he\u2019d insist on putting an empty food wrapper on his desk, or spreading dirty dishes across the bench, or pulling all the dining chairs out and leaving them scattered around the room. The edge of sanity, I tell you. Nonetheless, I always did my best to remain calm, and let it be. (Not saying I always succeeded, but I did my best.) See, there was a reason behind him wanting to live in a messy house.  Bob\u2019s parents divorced when he was a kid. Not a relaxed, happy, supportive divorce, but one of the more traditional kind of divorces with plenty of bad blood between his parents. Bob and his sister lived with their mother, who worked 2\u20133 minimum wage jobs and struggled to keep a roof over their head. Their house was always messy. Not by design, of course, but through the usual slide into entropy that happens when you\u2019re busy trying to afford food. That environment was Bob\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d; the place where he felt comfortable and at home. And then he\u2019d go stay with his dad for a while. His dad\u2019s place was fancy, and full of expensive furniture and no clutter. He had it professionally cleaned a few times a week. It was not permitted to leave dishes on the sink, or a book on the table, or a school bag near the door. Every item in the house had to be put away immediately or there would be consequences. The place was never messy. But he never truly felt like he was welcome there.  So when Bob walked into the kitchen and found that I\u2019d cleaned it top-to-bottom and everything was in its place, he felt the same feeling of anxiety and unwelcomeness that he\u2019d felt in his dad\u2019s place as a kid. So, to make himself feel at home, he\u2019d make a mess. In answer to your question: Sometimes people keep their house messy because it makes them feel more comfortable to do so. ",
