            "answer_text": "It is very tough to judge because we, as viewers will never get to know that what has happened behind the camera. But one thing is for sure that very big youtubers won't lie upfront because they have a lot on stake. And YouTubers with very few subscribers are honest too. I don't follow a lot of tech/product based youtubers but as per my observation , I would recommend you to checkout beerbiceps ,UIC, Techburner. Thanks ",
