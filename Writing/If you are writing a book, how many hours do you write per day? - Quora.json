            "answer_text": "This is a question that will depend on one's health as well as one's writing resources. Whatever writing skills we each have, we tend to press on like that film title, Carry On Regardless. We don't get all things right when we write. So let's accept that as a given and make advances as the years and the decades go by. I'm not exactly driven towards writing a book, but I can write poems throughout the year. Some writers just press on to write whole chapters and then edit like they don't want to stop editing. If they were to slow down, would they create less mistakes? God knows. So maybe that's the way forward for writers to get extra help from God. God knows our human limitations, when we can advance in a methodical way or in stops and starts. Some books take an incredibly long time to write. So that calls for patience. Consider whether a book takes a thousand hours to write yet only has a thousand readers when all is said and done. There are millions of books already yet there's still a market for millions more... that's how powerful the ministry of words has been and will remain. :We don't have to write till we fall asleep. That's a personal choice. Whatever works for you may be the only way that writing works for you. It could be a self-imposed deadline or somebody else's. It could be that you haven't got the best resources. Some use speech-to-text computer programs that actually do work well. Others don't trust these and simply type and type and type on typewriters or using QWERTY keyboards. So here's an extra point to consider, can you improve your typing speed? I don't type the majority of the text using both hands. I prefer the hand hand typing away and limiting the movement to the lower part of the keyboard and yet I find this speed matches the speed of the thoughts as I think these. Why type so fast if pausing to think what to write once the text has been typed? Why not match the speed of typing with the speed of thinking? Doesn't that seem more user-friendly and less stress upon the fingers?:I like saving the draft versions with different titles as I continue so as to keep the original ideas intact. I can return to these should I need to later on... By the way, there are certain types of overhead lighting that help writers. I use energy-saving daylight bulbs with about 23 watts as these are the full spectrum lighting rather than ordinary cream-coloured light bulbs using about 120 watts. I also upgraded from a 15\" PC monitor to a 19\" monitor and later I got a 27\" monitor. That's brilliant as it's easier to read the text. It was so impressive that I got another 27\" monitor for my second computer that's in another room.:It also helps to write, walk away, return, write, and repeat rather than just staying still and hurting the back, for example or constricting the back of the legs or having the shoulders hunched forward all tensed up. There are massagers that stretch across the sofa. I've got one of these to send vibrations along the back and the shoulders, thus relieving stress. So it isn't all about the writing hours but the ways we write, where we write and if we can see the text without straining our eyes.: ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A There is an allocation of time in my situation. I do so many things at different times of the day. Run a Business, teach, manage an office, plus travel around when required, do research, consultancies and spend time writing. I have a busy day of 16 hours. Within that time I squeeze my writing in. I have to confess Quora takes a lot of my time because the A2A\u2019s keep coming at me non-stop. It is a rewarding past-time but unproductive in financial terms. Where ego is concerned it tops the list. I am up at 4 am on a daily basis. My most productive times are between 4am-8 am and before which I need to cover the entire spectrum of work required to be done before I head off to a teaching assignment. At times, this can be overwhelming but somehow the spirit does not give up. Don't ask me why? Writing, for me, is just a hobby. Something to doodle on. Something to exercise my swollen ego and flabby muscles in the brain. How do I do it? With generous shots of single malt! Yes. I write for a good 4 hours/per day but its not the novels, poems, magazine articles etc. It is business correspondence, replies by email, travel documents, letters, blah blah. A whole range of writing work. Once I start writing a novel I switch off all those LED lights in my head and have just one light on. I tend to leave this busy, hurried world and retreat into a writing coma. This is usually in the evenings. Time to relax and write A delicious voice is often overhead from the kitchen: \u201c Put that glass aside and focus on your work\u201d \u201c Sure hon, it's a fuel stop!\u201d The voice goes quiet and my brain kick-starts again. When the battery drains out ( how does she ever know this?) a cup of tea magically appears on my desk and the glass evaporates into thin air. All is good in my small busy world. Thanks. ",
