            "answer_text": "No good reason except tradition, also I much prefer year, month, date, simply because you start with the most general and then you narrow it down from there rapid increasing accuracy. Then one can follow with hour minutes seconds etc, each step adding accuracy. Basically it is like comparing metric with imperial; or whatever it is called, guess what I am used to. I like nice clean ways of presenting and working with data. But maybe inches do look good. Also basically I had to learn to count in another another language because the 20 based counting we have applied wasn\u2019t making sense to me. After I just accept that the number are called what they are called, then it was easier. But eg I was running some code from a coworker and since the same version of our program had different region settings I got zero back, all because of date format issues. Really it should have failed, but that is another issue. The world is simply not logical and old lost history is the cause of much weird stuff that if it was to be decided today it would probably be done differently, at least if people with logical brains were to decide. Still it is easy to argue that it is logical to keep it in a way most people are used to. I have heard several Americans wanting to go metric, still not simple when one is used to doing things differently. American legal documents do actually to a large extend seem to follow day/month/year, as recommended by some written language institute. But honestly it is only helping clean things up a wee bit, I would like to to go more extreme, much like the naming of species, always start general. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know for certain, but I suspect it is due to organization purposes. If you organize by date, and the first two digits represent day, your files will not be in chronological order. However, if your first two digits are the month, your files are in chronological order. EDIT: I never expected so many comments on such a silly issue. I would like to add, I suspect this has something to do with the evolution of technology. I say this because at my work we have tens of thousands of old engineering drawings. They are all stored on microfiche. The drawings go back to the 1800\u2019s. The current system of storage, as best I can guess, was set up in the 1960\u2019s. It would have been impossible to store all this in a single drawer. So, the logical division was by year with each drawer organized by MMDD. It is a clean and effective solution. As Americans transitioned to computers, I suspect they kept the same organization system. This system then bleed out from the workplace into personal lives. People wrote month first, as it was viewed as the primary piece of information, and the year was tacked onto the end. An alternate theory I have is that the date was written DDMMYYYY originally but was ineffective for organizing chronologically. To improve organization and change as little as possible, the month and day were switched, but the year remained at the end as moving it wasn\u2019t necessary for chronological order. ",
