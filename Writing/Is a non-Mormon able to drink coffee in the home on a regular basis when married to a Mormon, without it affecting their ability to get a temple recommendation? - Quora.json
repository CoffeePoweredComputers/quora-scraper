            "answer_text": "I had relatives who were non-Mormon. When I say had, that means they have since passed away. As was previously mentioned in another answer, non-Mormons cannot get a temple recommend nor attend the temple. That being said, my relatives (in-laws), were still important and loved members of our family. These family members smoked, drank coffee daily, and socially drank. Just because you have family members who are non-Mormon-it does not affect your worthiness in the church, or your ability to keep the commandments- including the Word of Wisdom. This is true even if they smoke or drink around you, or store it in your home. Your church membership and worthiness solely rests on you, and you alone. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it doesn\u2019t affect the Mormon spouse\u2019s temple worthiness at all. The temple recommend question concerning this says only, \u201cDo you keep the Word of Wisdom?\u201d My best friend\u2019s mother is Mormon, but her father is a non-member, and my friend grew up with a coffee maker on the counter and beers in the fridge. It\u2019s not ideal, but it has no effect on the Mormon spouse\u2019s temple worthiness. Not being temple worthy is not contagious. We have a colloquialism (not sure how widespread it is) that says \u201cdon\u2019t look beyond the mark,\u201d i.e., don\u2019t make up commandments and rules that God never intended. This might be an example of such a time. ",
