If you want to be successful, like any other business, you need a plan. I'll share a little bit of what I have learned with affiliate marketing! also if you are interested I can share with you the best strategy I found to learn about this stuff just email me at easybrezeegirlll@gmail. com Remember, it is very important to really be interested in and understand the niche you have chosen. Pros and Cons of Affiliate Marketing As with any marketing program, there are advantages and disadvantages to this. While affiliate programs can seem quite lucrative, especially for bloggers or individual entrepreneurs, let's get to know better about their benefits and potential pitfalls. The Pros Of Affiliate Marketing Let's start with the pros. Low start-up costs. Generally, you don't need to pay to join an affiliate program. Plus, the company takes full responsibility for the services and products, which means you don't have to worry about inventory or supplies.Easy to join. The threshold for entering the affiliate program is very low. In order to join and start promoting, you usually just need to fill out a form, although in some programs this process is a little more complicated.You are not in the business of shipping or returning items. All you have to do is promote the seller's brand, product, or service. The product or service itself is entirely handled by the seller.You are not creating products or services. Again, your job as a partner is to bring in customers. The seller will take care of the rest. This is very convenient considering that launching your own online store can take a lot of time and effort.No special requirements. You don't need any special knowledge or special license to effectively promote affiliate products or services.Passive income 24/7. Just like any other online business, you can do affiliate marketing anytime, even while you sleep!Cons of affiliate marketing As ideal as affiliate marketing may seem, there are disadvantages to this way of making money online. Referral referrals are a matter of time. It will take a lot of time to collect enough referrals for a normal amount.You will need internet marketer talent. Yes, you do not need specialized courses to participate in the affiliate program. But if you want to be successful, you need to understand internet marketing.Advertising restrictions. Some affiliate programs prohibit email marketing or PPC advertising with specific keywords.Payment requirements.

            "answer_text": " Yes! You can be SO successful at Affiliate Marketing without writing blog posts or setting up a website. However, it's NOT cheap. You need to spend some money. These are some of the ways you can do that 1. Buying Solo ads: You don't necessarily need a website or write content to make solo ads work. However, it is advisable you send your solo ads visitors to a squeeze page to collect emails first, so that you can still promote more offers to them (Many of them won't buy at first). However, you don't need to do any serious writing. You can find quality solo ads seller on Udimi. Note, you should buy from sellers whose price is AT LEAST 40 Cents/Click. Anything less may not convert well 2. Buying Banner space: You can buy banner space on third-party networks that will display your affiliate banner on various sites for a specified duration. Visit BuySellads to see websites in your niche that are selling banner space 3. Youtube/Instagram Influencer Marketing: In this case, you are not going to create a YouTube or Instagram channel. Instead, you contact an influencer with a large following in your niche. Pay them to include your affiliate link in their Instagram post or YouTube video (This could be an existing video with a lot of traffic already or a fresh video that will be created for you) 4. Buy Private Label Rights Ebook: By an already written eBook which you can resell. Edit it and put your affiliate links WHERE NECESSARY in the eBook. Start selling the ebook online. You could even sell the ebook on Fiverr, where the buyer pays for the book and also generate affiliate income for you by clicking on the affiliate links in the book. You may also give the book away for free and upload on PDF sharing sites like Scribd.com 5. Pay Per Click Advertising: This means you have to run paid ads on ad networks like Google or Bing. Please note: you can't link directly to your affiliate offer on many networks. So, you still need to create a bridge page or landing page. There isn't so much writing to be done. Again, this will cost you some money and you need to do some split testing to know which ad copy works best. Once you get a winning ad campaign, you can scale up to make more money. BONUS POINT: YOUTUBE MARKETING: Yes, you have to create a YouTube channel BUT you don't need to write any video script. You will simply convert the email swipes provided by the product owner to videos (Most Clickbank products have email swipes in the affiliate section). Back then, I used to convert email swipes into cool videos using Content Samurai ( by the way, content samurai is now called Vidnami) without doing ANY writing. I hope these tips help you Enjoy your day!!! ",

Though emails are more personal but it's still content that needs to be written. It seems you want to do it without working and that's just not the case. Affiliate Marketing isn't some push button system that generates money fast and without work. It requires a lot of work\u2026 like any other business model. ",
