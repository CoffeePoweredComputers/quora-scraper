            "answer_text": "Historically, manga scanlation (scanned translation) did not begin with scans. Inside Scanlation, an oral history website documenting the birth and growth of scanlation, documents the evolution of this activity quite well. Before the 1990s, manga fan translation projects started simply as text translations of manga scripts. These translations were passed around as e-mails among friends before the boom of the Internet. The earliest recorded fan translation is allegedly an unauthorized 1977 translation of Osamu Tezuka\u2019s Phoenix created by a team of four which included Frederik Schodt, who today is a manga scholar and professional translator. According to manga editor Jason Thompson, these fan translations were later spread around as text files among circles who had access to the original manga volumes. Considering that anime had found a niche by the 1990s, some fans were interested in acquiring original Japanese manga even though they did not know how to read them. Thompson indicated it was not until 2000\u201301 did scanned and translated manga pages begin to circulate on the Internet. This timeline seems reasonable given the fact that image scanners did not become generally accessible to the public until the late 1990s and early 2000s. One can assume that fans in more developed countries (including Japan and the U.S.) who had access to both manga and the means to scan them then began sharing scanned manga pages more widely among friends and to the rest of the Internet. Today, scanners are generally accessible, and some Japanese readers (and increasingly, Chinese readers as well) acquire manga with the intention to upload them on the Internet. These scans are then uploaded to underground websites and peer-to-peer file-sharing networks as a pipeline to groups and individuals who produce the scanlations. ",

Stuff gets scanned in Japan for the Japanese community and some Americans stumble across it or are part of these groups. Sometimes, if someone really wants a particular manga and can't find it they will order it from Japan, or but it there if they, or someone they know live / travel there. ",
