            "answer_text": " First, 2000 words sounds rather short for any journal article\u2026perhaps this is a conference paper? In which case you could bang this out in a few days. Usually, academic papers take much longer and contain 5\u201310k words, depending on the target journal and the submission type. Last month I had an 8.5k word article accepted at IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. The first draft of this paper was written over a year before being accepted\u2014this is extreme but not altogether uncommon. In reality, from conception to accepted manuscript, writing an academic paper can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few years. The window has to be this big so to allow for all of the inevitable complications that come with academic research publication. A few of these challenges might include: (i) infeasible methodology prevents you from obtaining workable results, (ii) inefficiencies associated with working with co-authors, or (iii) unfavorable reviews at the publication of your choice. Insufficient Results I am often tempted to draft a paper before I have final results. While this sounds crazy, I\u2019m sure it happens to many professional researchers because of the multiple miniature versions of their papers they typically must present on the path to creating a final journal article. These minipapers are presented at symposia, conferences, or maybe just internally among peers. Having so much written material for a project often makes me anxious about what results I will eventually include in the final manuscript. I often feel held back from submitting it to a journal because I am missing an important element of the results which make it journal publication worthy. This can sometimes be an interminable wait. As you can imagine, many papers are never written because the necessary results are never obtained. Co-author Woes Teamwork is tough; team-writing is tougher. Each member has different ideas regarding style, pace, organization, priority of results, or (god forbid) interpretation of results. These differences of opinion can dramatically slow the progress of preparing a manuscript or even bring it to a total standstill. Usually, it is the job of the senior author to mediate conflicts, but when multiple senior personnel are in conflict, expect writing to grind to a painful halt. I have found it best for a single person to write the first draft and then for the team to all participate in the editing process. This ensures consistent style, limits lumpy logic, and prevents the piecemeal storytelling that typically afflicts collaborative writing projects. Unfavorable Reviews Upon submission to a journal, the editor will identify at least two reviewers to provide a manuscript with a recommendation: rejected (do not resubmit), rejected (major revisions), rejected (minor revisions), or accepted. Even a good manuscript is not likely to be accepted on the first submission and may progress, with a set of reviewers, through several of these steps: from major, to minor revisions, to accepted. This process takes time. While many modern and leading publications claim they deliver a first decision within a few months, progressing through each of these steps could take a few months more! Now imagine receiving multiple rejections with major revisions only to eventually be rejected without the option to resubmit: you would be left to start the whole process again at a new journal. There are other potential delays that crop up but these are the big killers. Avoid them by planning for them. ",

If the topic is alien to me, I may require anything from 1 hour to 1 week to research about the topic. Once I know what I\u2019m writing about, the writing part will not take me more than three hours. The writing part is easy, what is not easy is to make your writing sound genuine, convincing and worth the readers\u2019 time. What is the use of writing an article about a topic which is not in-depth and doesn\u2019t shed new light on the subject? After writing the entire article, I usually edit it carefully until I am satisfied that I have done a good job. I read it at least four to five times, at least. Every time I go through it, I find some place where I think, \u201cLet me change this word. No, the sentence structure needs correction,\u201d and so on. Five hours is good enough. ",
