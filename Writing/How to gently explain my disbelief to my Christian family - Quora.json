            "answer_text": "I, like you, have a wonderful grandmother whom is strong in her faith. She, however, got her wish\u2014when I married my wife\u2014whom is a faithful Christian. But I sat with my grandmother and explained it this way. I was born in West New York, NJ. You and my parents were Christians. Catholics, to be more accurate. You had a variety of beliefs that you tried to instill in me. While most of them were objectively intended for me to be a kind and compassionate person. Many were strange habits, none of which were even written in the book you have always follow. What if I was born in Iraq? \u201cHad I been born in Iraq to Muslim parents, I\u2019d be Muslim.\u201d\u201cHad I been born in India, I may likely be Hindu or a Buddhist or something else.\u201d No matter where we are born we\u2019d be affected by the customs and beliefs of the area. We\u2019d have a different religious backgrounds. If I sit with a Christian, a Muslim, a Buddhist, a Jew, a Hindu, and any other number of people of faith. We could have a nice conversation but we\u2019d never be able to prove to each other in what we believe. Never. We could only showcase our belief and the extent of our belief\u2014-and even that is not easy. But no matter where I was born and no matter what beliefs I had. I\u2019d be able to show each of these people, of different beliefs\u2014-math. They\u2019d be able to do that math and verify the same answers to which I arrive. I\u2019d explain that not believing in her faith does not make me any different from who I was, that I am the same grandchild she adores. Not to worry. If she truly believes when she dies she is going to heaven, none of the worries or concerns she has on earth will follow her. I\u2019ve had other explanations and debates with her about faith and religion. But the above rung the most true to her. It was a moment of clarity. Even if it could have been seen as an intent to devalue her own faith. It wasn\u2019t, it was a way to showcase my focus on being empirical and a man of math and science. ",

            "answer_text": "I was born in a strickt christian family. When I started to think for myself and went through some experiences, like finding cientifical proof, I lost my faith in the religion of my family. Luckily my brother, my only sibling, went through the same. And so one day we simply had to say that we lost faith. My mother was not interested in any discussion, but we did talk to my father and explained him the reasons why we now thought as we did. Bit by bit we could convince him, because he was open to the facts. But with my mother we got nowhere. I realised then that this was because she had lived her whole life doing things she didn't like. She sacrificed her pleasures, even her freedom in the belief she would be rewarded with an afterlife of happyness for ever. She simply COULD NOT let go of her belief, because this would mean she had wasted all these efforts and sacrifices, basicly wasted her life. So I would say, depending of the familymember that you talk to, tell them why you cannot follow their belief anymore, or, probably in the case of your grandmother, let them be. Postpone an answer or tell a little white excuse if they pin you down with a question. Let her keep her peace. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the nature of your disbelief? Have you concluded that God doesn\u2019t exist? Or, are you just backing off from the religion of your birth? Most young adults go through a period where they question what they were taught growing up. I did. It wasn\u2019t until I had children of my own that I started seriously exploring what I believed and why I believed it. There is nothing wrong with doubting, and dealing with doubts is how you grow, but if you\u2019re not yet 30 and have decided that everything you were taught growing up is a bunch of nonsense, I\u2019d suggest you might want to slow down and take a deeper dive into the topic. Many young adults go through a rebellious period, particularly those who leave home for college after growing up in a fundamentalist Christian denomination, but there is a very rich intellectual foundation you\u2019d be wise to consider before you kick Christianity to the curb. You still have a lot of life experience ahead of you if you don\u2019t have children and haven\u2019t ever been married and desire to make children and marriage a part of your life. ",

When it comes down to it, we are all individuals thinking and believing different things. If we\u2019ve managed to live this long believing what we believe, who are we to judge? Flip that question around taking the spotlight off you and dissect the people around, BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND Remember that variety is the spice of life, meaning you are bound to meet someone with an opinion different than you\u2026 That's life! Better get used to it. ",
