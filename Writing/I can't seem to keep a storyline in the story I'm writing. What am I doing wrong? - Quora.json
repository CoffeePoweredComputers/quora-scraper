            "answer_text": "I have found that this happens when we don\u2019t know our characters well enough, or when we are not willing to expose all sides of a character for some reason. Characters are the building blocks of a story, and if we hold back on them or don\u2019t know them well enough, their actions become stiff, stilted, non-existent and flat. Thus the story falls apart.  In screenwriting, invariably this happens somewhere between pages 55 and 75 or so, because we are required to have a strong Plot Point II in the structure. Without strong, clear, vivid characters, they cannot carry PPII. It is not possible, so they wander around doing aimless things, and the storyline just waffles and floats around till the writer finds something interesting on TV, or a new movie or a bar, exercise or some other more tamable project to deal with. Dadblasted wayward story! It can happen in any kind of story however if you don\u2019t know the characters well enough. So the answer I have found, for myself and my students over 20 years, is to go back and do a full character background on your main characters first, and anyone who has a vast influence on their lives. Then do it for your prominent secondary stories.  To use a prominent figure, for Donald Trump\u2019s story, we\u2019d have to do not only his character background but also Fred Trump, his father, in order to understand how to keep the story of Donald going smoothly, or at least ahead. He is a product of his father\u2019s thinking and actions, clearly. If you tried to write a story about Donald without Fred, the story would fall apart and he would make even less sense than he does already. Same would be true for Barron if you tried to write his story without doing a character background on Donald. Even more important for story consistency and rationality are the relationships that are missing from a character\u2019s narrative, like Donald\u2019s mother, who we never hear about or know much about. The lack of information about her also informs a character who has no respect for women, except in a cursory manner that relegates them to objects for his amusement perhaps. That makes sense for a person whose own mother is persona non grata or at the very least, treated fairly unimportant. All things are connected, and a story is only the summation of connected relationships, or else they just keep falling apart and going nowhere. Without Fred, Donald would not be in real estate, lean toward racist behavior apparently from Fred\u2019s background, would have no career since Fred staked him, and might have a different attitude about women. Had his mother been a stronger character in his life, he might never have the audacity to say something as disrespectful as \u201cgrabbing women in the private parts\u201d and think it makes sense for him to do that. He certainly would not have a wife who cosigns that behavior by saying \u201cboys will be boys\u201d had he had a strong, positive mother presence. It is the absence of a strong mother that would make this deficit in his personality possible. If you are writing a story about him, you\u2019d have to research enough to understand this and convey these serious character flaws in his personality.  On the other hand, you\u2019d also have to understand how even though he is a philandering, cheating womanizer, there is something in his relationship with his parents that created a strong father figure to his children, and a need to bond with them that is clearly unbreakable, beyond reason. They are clone like, hard like he is, ruthless like he is, and deeply bound to him. People are complex, and your characters must be for a story to take hold and continue. People watch character\u2019s stories that are interesting - good or bad. Character understanding and details are the key to flowing and moving stories, be they novels, short stories or screenplays and good poetry too. The better you know the character the more smoothly the plot moves. We have a character building class in WriteMoviesRight! that can be a stand alone class for Screenwriters and Novelists, as well as short story writers. We do use films to show examples because it is a visual you can see and thus identify with quickly and thoroughly. If you plan to continue writing, especially if you are going to do it for a living, it is well worth the price toward continued successful projects. You can find it here: Character Building and Development Best of skill to you, as writing is about skill more than luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Several possibilities and I can\u2019t cover all of them, but a scant few are: *You aren\u2019t telling the story you think you are. Instead you are telling the story that your subconscious wants you to tell and keeps veering you towards it even though you don\u2019t realize it\u2019s happening. Stop a while and think things through to figure out if this is what\u2019s happening. Are you always leaving the story line to follow another one and that wrong storyline is always the same one? If so, this could be your problem and you just have to figure out which you want to tell. *You are letting sub-plots take over. Or characters that shouldn\u2019t be important are crowding out the main characters. Again, stop and think a bit. Did you outline? If so, are you sticking to it? If not, how and where did you get off track? Go back to that place, get back on track, and go from there even if it means throwing out many, many pages of very nice but wrong writing. Or figure out which character is pushing your main characters out of sight. Get rid of him/her. Be merciless. *You don\u2019t know what story you are telling so you let your imagination wander everywhere. Make sure you know your \u2018elevator\u2019 pitch, that one (or at the most two) sentences that you\u2019d tell someone to explain the story if you were in an elevator and that was all the time you had. If you can\u2019t do it, then don\u2019t write another word until you can. Along the same lines, make sure you know exactly how your story will end because knowing that will do more than almost anything else I can think of to keep you on track because it will give you a light at the end of the tunnel that you\u2019ll always be heading towards. Hope this helps. ",
