            "answer_text": "One is thankful to other because some good deed is done by him for one . One could not be thankful until and unless one don't know glory and power of God ! Our holy scriptures narrating virtues of supreme God who created whole nature ! Like in ancient scripture Vedas Glory of supreme God is narrated that he- God take 3 type of forms to take care and nourish whole souls living in 3 places. i.e. mortal place - Lok of Brahm & Par Brahm and eternal place - lok of Purna Brahm. Actually we all souls who are living in different form of creatures here , were living in eternal place of Purna Brahm . We had been trapped here i.e. into lok of Brahm and forgot about real home - eternal place. Father - supreme God of all souls comes to us for giving knowledge of himself, his eternal place and to give right way of worship to achieve his eternal place !! Because we left father's home by our silly mistake but father didn't forget his children !! In holy Bible chapter Genesis , it is mentioned that how god has created whole world in six days \u263a\ufe0fIn Quran knowledge giver of quran tells to paigambar that trust that God who is immortal !! Thus, one could be thankful to God who created us and whole nature ! ",
