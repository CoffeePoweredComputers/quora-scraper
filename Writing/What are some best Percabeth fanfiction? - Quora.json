Honourable mention to The AU girl, couldn't include her in the list \u2018cause she hasn't completed her thirteen reasons why AU for percabeth that she started. This ones on Wattpad. Amazing really, and not at all the imitation of thirteen reasons why, in fact a whole other story written in that context, Annabeth being Hana and Percy being Clay. I hope she updates\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I personally love the Split Souls Percy Jackson and Avengers crossover on Wattpad. There are two books so far, Before I Die, and the second one is We\u2019re Not Dead Yet. While there is Percabeth in it, there isn\u2019t much, but it is a great book series and sure is worth the read! The second one is still in progress, but it is really good! It\u2019s by MarshmallowMilkshake, if I\u2019m not mistaken. ",
