            "answer_text": "To review, an essay\u2019s structure looks like this: An introductory paragraph which orients the reader to the general topic, asks a question, and proposes an answer (the thesis)Multiple body paragraphs that present the evidence supporting your thesis, with one main idea per paragraphA concluding paragraph, which restates the thesis and summarizes your points in favor if itThe number of paragraphs is therefore constrained by the number of supporting ideas you need to include. In most academic short essay assignments (around 1,000 words), you\u2019ll typically be expected to make 3 to 5 points in support of your thesis, which would mean a minimum of 5 to 7 paragraphs. Long or complicated paragraphs might need to be broken up, so you might end up with one or two more than that. However, increasing the number of paragraphs leaves fewer words for each paragraph, so you have to be careful you leave yourself enough words to fully support each point you want to make. Most instructors won\u2019t mind if you go a little over the limit if you need to, though. Since your word requirement is a little longer than 1,000 words, you should probably aim for 4 or 5 ideas and 6 or 7 paragraphs at a minimum. ",

            "answer_text": "From the number of queries about essay paragraphing essay that are currently showing up, it looks as though someone is really anxious about paragraphing, so here are some suggestions. A 1200 word essay is about 4 pages (11 point Ariel). I think a page looks pleasing if it has 3 or 4 paras on it. So from that point of view, it would be about 9\u201312 paragraphs. That would fit with a page being about 300 words, with 100 or so in each para. This is a mechanical way of going about it, and it is an aesthetic view; it says nothing about content, and does not tell you how to construct a paragraph. I have noticed that a solid block of text can be divided into paragraphs in a number of ways. Where you make the para breaks governs how the importance and meaning of the points are perceived. I suggest you try it - take a block of sold text and try breaking it into paragraphs in different ways - there is always more than one solution. You may feel that breaking it one place makes for more satisfactory reading and understanding than breaking it in another place. I am sure there will be better and more detailed guidance available from writing specialists but for now I will provide some basic advice - guidelines rather than rules! For one point, make one paragraph -you start a new para when you move to make a new point.The first line of a para makes the key point - the rest explains it or elaborates upon it.You can \u2018turn\u2019 the end of a para to face the next one coming along - you chose words that will lead the reader to the next paragraph. This helps the flow of the essay.You can check the sequence of your paras by putting, in the margin of each para, one or two words saying what it is about. If you cannot do this in one or two words, then you have too much in the para and need to break it up.You scrutinise the sequence of these words to see if the content of the essay moves forward smoothly and sensibly.If you get stuck, this technique often shows that you have doubled back on yourself and have returned to a point you have already covered. You can deal with it by using \u2018cut and paste\u2019 to move similar content together and break the loop you have made.That is everything I know about paragraphs - I am sure others may be able to tell you more. I would only add, please be careful about sentence length. For readability I was taught to use only 10 or so words in a sentence when the content is difficult or unfamiliar; 16 words when content is moderately familiar, and only 24 or 25 words when the material is easy or very familiar. Sometimes I read a para that is one single sentence, 300 words long; it is very hard to hold onto the meaning when that happens. This is a very \u2018nuts and bolts\u2019 approach but I hope that these points will help the writer to move forward. ",
