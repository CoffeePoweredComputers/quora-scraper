            "answer_text": "Considering the fact doctors aren\u2019t your typical mentally ill person. The gap in mindset could create a massive bias effect. What if the neurotypical mind/the normal majority are actually in the most intrusive and thus most mentally ill group of them all. Except we would never know because that\u2019s the majority, and the concept seems absurd at first glance But who has fucked up the entire earth in only a small % of humanities existence Yep it was cow farts, we destroyed the ozone layer by murdering and slaughtering animals So I\u2019m not quite sure if the majority of researchers are making the critical connections required. might be like the mentally ill person trying to teach another mentally ill person to act like the other\u2019s mental illness, which is honestly a retarded idea. Yet acting more normal is somehow beneficial Sheeple, sheep people. Asleep and unaware of real life What if we are actually prey animals and that all acts of violence are out of perpetual paranoia and fear We aren\u2019t predators, they don\u2019t fear the things they fight I know that really isn\u2019t the issue but the Problem with the research is that they are looking at it from only a neurotypical lens Which is not the right lens You need multiple lenses They need to have more mentally ill doctors and psychiatrists badly But the fact people have issue with sex or race Makes me wonder if we are too stupid of a species to really make any objective judgements upon one another. It\u2019s like calling the sun stupid for being hot and killing all life on earth. That would just be another angry human externalizing their guilt upon the poor sun, which just is and doesn\u2019t give a fuck Unlike the people hating on it Projecting on it their beliefs Like how the Romans made Germanic druids of old, out to be just some dumb savage barbarians who sacrificed actual people on an alter lmao Projecting your own values on others, just to justify conquering them Damn\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The research itself isn\u2019t, so long as it\u2019s done correctly and hasn\u2019t been subjected to things like p-hacking. However, the way the research is interpreted is somewhat subjective. For example, there is a correlation between high intelligence and a tendency to stay up and sleep in later than average. This in itself is not scientifically \u201cbiased\u201d. However, different psychologists may make different inferences about the research. Some psychologists believe that smart people are likely to stay up and sleep in later because it\u2019s an evolutionarily novel thing to do. That sort of interpretation is logical but somewhat subjective, other psychologists have different theories on the link. ",

In conclusion, if you do research with the purpose of examining behaviors \u2018in a certain context\u2019, then do so; but do not generalize; otherwise you will end up with the conclusion that Vladimir Putin sings like Feodor Chaliapin just because they are both Russian\u2026 In Peace and Friendship, Pierre ",

            "answer_text": "What you are suggesting is a much deeper problem. \u201cAre psychological claims from experiments repeatable, and verifiable?\u201d. This is a huge problem with the science of behaviour. Is it really empirical like the other hard sciences such as chemistry and physics? An article in \u201cPsychology Today\u201d magazine a few months ago went into this for a few pages. A surprising number are not. Psychological researchers who have looked into this have been singled out for ridicule by other psychologists because of the possible impact of their findings. Beware. ",
