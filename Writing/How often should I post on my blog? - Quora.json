            "answer_text": "Look at your blog contents from a readers view point. You will realize then that broadly readers of blogs would want the following: Quality in the content - both in terms of relevance of the content as well as they style and presentation of the content.They would visit your blog if there is regularly updated quality contentNew readers would be keen to explore your blog if there is ample content to go throughSo when I first started my Inspirational and Motivational blog Actspot's Blog I kept a broad target of writing around 300\u2013500 words every day. I must admit it was ambitious and stressful. However, by the year end I had over 300 posts. Frankly I was getting enough views to keep me motivated but then I didn\u2019t have a target for the next year. The number of posts I managed the next year was hardly 40 posts the whole year but by then I was getting readers because of the ample content. Currently I have a target to update my blog once a week, which I am managing to do. My blog has 300,000 views and around 1280 followers. So my suggestions are: Choose the blog topic and style after great thought. Focus on what your reader would want and why she/ he should visit your blog.In the initial days write as often as possible. Maybe even twice a week but definitely once a week is a must.Ensure each blog post has appropriate content, the language and grammar are in order, and you have developed a good style to hold readers interest.Once you have ample content you can scale down your writing but ensure you continue to update the blog regularly.No one will visit your blog unless you promote it. So be disheartened if you have poor numbers in terms of views. Promote your blog after you have at least 50 - posts so that readers have ample content to appreciate your blog contents.Best Wishes ",

Your primary goal should be producing valuable content that you readers find useful, enjoyable and interesting enough to stay engaged. You must learn how to balance the two: Consistent Quality & Consistent Publishing Schedule, as that can prove to be the key to your blog's success in the long run. Blog regularly, but not too frequently. A few well-researched outstanding posts will take you further than just throwing out a ton of mediocre ones. The trendsetters of content marketing world like Buffer and Hubspot blog everyday. But the quality of their content is never compromised. So what should you do? Blog every day or once in a week or 2\u20133 times per week or once a month maybe? Whatever floats your boat! Just make sure you stick to a schedule and don\u2019t compromise with the quality of content.

            "answer_text": "When you first start a blog, the goal is to get a decent amount of blog post up as quickly as possible. The trick is to keep up with enough consistency that you don't burn out. At the beginning I would suggest trying to blog at least twice a week period because you don't have a lot of content, it's going to be very difficult to interlink your blog articles. You also don't have a lot of content to keep people on your blog. Once you have a decent amount of posts, enough so that your ideal reader can get a sense for who you are and what you know about, then it\u2019s OK to drop down to one blog post a week. But I wouldn\u2019t go any lower than that. Key to all of this is the quality. At the beginning, your stuff is probably going to stink. That\u2019s OK. We all have to start somewhere! That\u2019s why it\u2019s OK to start publishing frequently. Once you start to get better, you\u2019ll realize just how much it takes to write a good post. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll want to drop down your posting as it\u2019s going to take you a lot longer to get a great post up. Be persistent and blog what you love! ",

I wrote content in 2016 which continues to bring in the most traffic to my site today. My recent work hasn\u2019t had such a big impact. Why? Well I believe there\u2019s three main reasons the \u2018old\u2019 content works best for my site: It\u2019s had time to organically climb the Google rankings and deliver more traffic.I\u2019ve refined the SEO/Keyword strategy through trial and error.It\u2019s evergreen content that won\u2019t expire any time soon.I haven\u2019t tried to out-do my competition by making frequent posts. I just focus on keeping the content up-to-date, and ensuring that it\u2019s of high quality. It works for my blog (see Punter2Pro). Granted, many niches thrive by producing content that\u2019s current. For instance, weekly podcasts about the latest sports news, rumours and results. They\u2019re fuelled by recent events. Even if your blog requires up-to-date content, I personally wouldn\u2019t fixate on the frequency of your posts. The quality of our content, how you market it, and how it performs SEO-wise is more likely to dictate it\u2019s success.

I have other sites, that could be considered blogs, that I post to at least weekly (https://fourstatesnews.us) and still others that I post to once a month or so. From SEO experts, they usually say post at least one new post each week to maintain your SEO level. If being at the top of search engines is your goal, then I would post at least weekly. If you have a specialty blog, like my Commodore Computers blog (http://commodorecomputers.us) then you may have a post every month or so. The best advice I have heard is to post at least weekly for good search engine results, enjoy what you post, and have fun. If your goal is to make money with a blog, then you need a lot of advertising and the kind of post that draws readers no matter how frequently you post. If your goal is to have fun or reach a specific group of people, then set your own goals and your own deadlines and don\u2019t worry about what other people say! ",

The benefit of posting a blog once or twice a week is that you can think on the particular topic in depth so the outcome of the blog that you get is also good. It will increase the reader's engagement on your site. Always make sure the following points while posting a blog once or twice a week, Look at which content on your blog is most popular, so you can make every single post a successful one.Experiment with longer posts, perhaps 1,000+ words.Always try to focus on evergreen content, so that each post will stay relevant for years.Don\u2019t change things too abruptly: try going from five posts per week to three posts per week, for instance.Consider surveying your readers to find out whether they\u2019d like more or fewer posts.Experiment with writing posts ahead of time, or with creating a content calendar.I hope the mentioned information is sufficient for you.

Based on that assumption, here\u2019s my answer\u2026 As a beginner blogger, the most important thing for you is not the number of post you\u2019re updating on a weekly basis. The problem you solve with your content and the reach you\u2019re able to have are more important when it comes to getting a decent traffic for your new blog. So before getting started, you\u2019ll want to ask yourself, what length of post can i write to bring out real value for my readers. And what duration of time can i spend to research and write this post. The answer here will guide you as regards the amount of time you\u2019ll spend to write a single post and this will decide the duration of time you\u2019ll allocate to writing blog posts per week on your blog. In a nutshell, at least 2\u20133 posts per week is good for a beginner on a non news blog. Also Remember, networking, guest posting and social media sharing are also very important drivers of traffic and engagement back to your website. These should also be included in your weekly posting plan. ",

There are so many variables to the answer to this question that I really couldn't possibly give you a concrete answer.  But what I can tell you is this - quality of your post matters more than quantity of posts. There are well known, successful bloggers who blog once a week, or even once a month. There are others who post every day.  The real question is how often can you post high quality, high value posts? How often can you create an article that is actually worth someone taking the time to read? That's how often you should post.  Don't get stuck with the idea that \"ok, it's Monday, I have to get a post up because it's Monday\".   And remember - at least 3/4 of your time should be spent on promotion. Until you've got some readers coming to your blog, creating a lot of content doesn't do much good because there's no one to see it.  You're better off creating five or six AMAZING posts, then marketing the hell out of them to build up a readership. Once you do have some readers and a few people signed up to your email list, then it becomes important to be consistent. Once a week, twice a week, twice a month - just be consistent so your readers know what to expect.  You can click here to see what else I had to say about it -How Often Should You Update Your Blog?

If you\u2019ve got tons of free time and energy and can post twice a week do it. But I personally think it\u2019s way more about quality over quantity, there are a lot of bad posts out there because people think they need to push something out. They don\u2019t. If you write great stuff it doesn\u2019t matter how often you write it, people will read. Whatever you do choose, I think it\u2019s important to write consistently. If its every other week, make sure that\u2019s in your schedule. If it\u2019s once a month, make sure that is in your schedule. Just set a time on your calendar and go with it. ",

Some top blogs, blog about 2-3 times per week and it keeps them going plus this routine they've got used to over the years and it has in so doing helped their site traffic too. The question about how often you got to blog, is a personal thing. You could choose to blog 7days a week with say 400words a piece or 1,2,3,4 or even 5 times a week with at least 600-700wrd pieces that gives value. Nonetheless, if you can keep up to it (blogging 600-700wrds per week consistently), then go with it. The most important thing is that you have fun while blogging to EXpress yourself and not IMpress.

The variety of solutions tells you that there is no magic number. Instead of focusing on frequency, you should focus on providing quality, helpful content. One high-quality post will benefit you much more than ten mediocre posts. Quality, helpful content answers a question or helps people solve a problem. It'll increase the chance of your blog getting noticed. It also makes it more likely that readers will engage with you through comments. Finally, quality content increases the likelihood other bloggers will link to your post. These all help your SEO. The bottom line is that you want to work hard to establish your blog's authority. Quality content does more for that than quantity ever will. So, you should focus on quality. ",

I have written longer post but have broken them at the 2 to 3 k words to make sure my audience stays on target. I write about web and publishing technologies. My writing can go faster or slower as I also research the subject and write code to go with most posts. I also schedule posts in advance as they are written.

It depends also on which kind of blog you\u2019re running (e.g. fashion vs technology vs food, etc\u2026) and how much you\u2019re famous.

Follow the principle, \u201cSlow but steady wins the race!\u201d No need to publish one post every single day. Don\u2019t be so rude to yourself. Make a plan to publish a post or two weekly. Also don\u2019t compromise with the quality of your posts to increase the quantity. Not necessarily all of your blog posts need to be of 2000 words, it may be of 600 words only. But it should be informative and useful for your readers. This will build trust in your reader\u2019s mind. ",

It does not matter if you publish only twice a month as long as you do not miss any publishing date. That way your readers will know when to come back for new content.
