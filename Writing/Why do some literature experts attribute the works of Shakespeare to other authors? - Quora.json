            "answer_text": "Aha, the Sir Francis Bacon (etc.) conspiracy theory! Most of these are based in Shakespeare\u2019s not having had as much formal education as some of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s courtiers, including his fellow writer Christopher Marlowe. The theory generally goes that he wouldn\u2019t have had the ability to compose the works that bear his name because of this, which I frankly find a bit classist. Shakespeare did two things that you don\u2019t need a formal education to do: He blatantly stole plots: Macbeth and Romeo and Juliet are just two examples of stories that had already been used by writers, just not the way Shakespeare did. The story of Julius Caesar was also pretty much \u201cpublic domain\u201d at that point, although the concept didn\u2019t exist in those words yet.He made up words and phrases all over the place. Seriously, I have a good-sized poster of Shakespeare\u2019s coinages. (He invented the word \u201cbedroom,\u201d although the way he used it, he didn\u2019t mean \u201croom in which you sleep,\u201d but literally \u201croom in a bed\u201d \u2014 think \u201cI would seriously consider giving bedroom to Jason Momoa.\u201d)In short, I don\u2019t think much of these theories and find the premise of them fallacious, at best.

            "answer_text": "Very, very few people who are actually academic literature experts do not believe William Shakespeare wrote the works most frequently attributed to him, although a small number of those works were collaborations between Shakespeare and other writers. The theory that Shakespeare did not write the works is a conspiracy theory put forth mostly by bigots who believe only members of the upper class could possibly have the talent and knowledge to write the plays. If that were true, Donald Trump would write better than Alexander Hamilton. ",
