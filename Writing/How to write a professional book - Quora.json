            "answer_text": "Having written a Tech Note, 3 Tech Reference Booklets, and a dozen Tech Training Texts, I can basically say, Get Organized! 1) Review your intended audience. Is there a use for your book idea?2) Plan on how you will publish it.3) Create an outline of precisely what your book will cover4) Write at least one sample chapter.5) Line up a good editor.-----When working, be sure to:1) Select a word processor, computer (& OS), and printer that will work for you and your editor. (I've used UNIX & vi, Apple Write & a Fat MAC, Word & Windows 98/XP/7, and others. And, I like Word & Win7 the best.)2) Have a backup HDD & make off-line backups frequently.3) Work with the editor. My method is to create & proof my work. Then hand it off to the editor with the instructions, \"Don't red-line stuff. You go in and change it. I trust your judgement & skill. I'll review your finished/edited work & then meet with you to adjust anything that needs to be changed back.\" This works wonders as the editor learns the tech info & the re-corrections decline over time. It also dramatically reduces turn-around delays!4) Be patient, it will still take time to complete the draft, proof it, and edit it.5) Have your sales game plan ready to go for either your management, or planned publisher, as you will have to sell the idea/book.  And, finally, expect some guidance/push back from all involved. Don't take it personally. It's the nature of the business. Best example is JRR Tolkien's Hobbit. No one would publish the book! Finally, Allen Unwin took up the project on a profit sharing scheme *after* all expenses were paid! Soon, Mr. Tolkien was having trouble with Inland Revenue (England's IRS) due to the profits generated by it and the LOTR books! PS. I knew that I had a winner in one Tech Reference Booklet when I heard that it was being stolen by our company's customers for their own use on competitor's equipment! ",

            "answer_text": "Words, said Lord Byron, are things, and small drops of ink, falling like dew upon a thought, producing that which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think. Words should be written obsessively, incessantly and with maddening hunger. They should be written to the point of suffocation, to the point where the reader develops a connection so strong with the characters, that he doesn\u2019t know where he ends and where they begin. This is why they say that a good book is very powerful. Because it has the power to destroy you. You become the character in the book. You go to places with them. You start loving them, hating them and understanding them, because there is a writer within you If you are someone who writes, you are a born storyteller. You are someone who understands both the simplicity and the depth of the written word. Your hero is no movie star or singer, but he is a philosopher or a poet. You feel that writing is the only way to explore life\u2019s mysteries. You feel connected with someone who reads the same books as you do. If you write, people can hear your voice in your words. You are someone whose mind bursts into flames with an idea at 3 am. Write, if there is a book within you. Write, if you have a story to tell. Write, even if the writer within you percolates under the covers of your fear and insecurity; because if you do not write, they will cloud your consciousness and haunt you. You will never get finished until you start. Start from anything and anywhere. It can be the beginning, middle or the end. Once you start giving words to your thought, they will flow automatically. There are a number of online English book publishing companies which can help you give a start to your dream. Browse through their website to get more information about self-publishing and becoming an author. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to write a book\u2026just start writing. It helps to create a structure, framework or outline before you start writing a book. Research books in the genre you want to write your book in. Write about what you know or enjoy most. Write to express and not to impress. Write a book knowing it is the best medium to promote your skills, expertise, knowledge, or experience. Write half-page every day and you will complete a book in less than a year. Writing and storytelling are two different things\u2026so write keeping it simple, clear, concise, and engaging. ",
