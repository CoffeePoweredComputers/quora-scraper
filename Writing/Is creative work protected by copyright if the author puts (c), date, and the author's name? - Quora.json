            "answer_text": "Yes. (Answers apply to the US) It\u2019s also protected by copyright if the author does not do that. When is my work protected? Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. Do I have to register with your office to be protected? No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created. You will have to register, however, if you wish to bring a lawsuit for infringement of a U.S. work. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section \u201cCopyright Registration.\u201d Why should I register my work if copyright protection is automatic? Registration is recommended for a number of reasons. Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration. Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if registration occurs within five years of publication, it is considered prima facie evidence in a court of law. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section \u201cCopyright Registration\u201d and Circular 38b, Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), on non-U.S. works. Copyright in General See also: https://www.newmediarights.org/business_models/artist/do_i_need_put_copyright_notice_my_work Do I need to put a copyright notice on my work? No. Although years ago the law required a work to have;a valid copyright notice;printed on it to receive protection on published work, this is no longer the case. Adding the symbol or any other copyright notice is no longer necessary to receive protection. Now, you receive absolute protection as soon as you create your work. You don\u2019t need to take any other action or go through the official registration process;if you don\u2019t want to. As soon as you create any creative work that meets the minimal standards for copyright protection then you get protection. ",
