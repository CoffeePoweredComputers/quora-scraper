            "answer_text": "Well, I am in the same situation as well from time to time. I don't get along with anyone in my friend group very often. This may just be because you and your friends disagree, or you do things they don't agree with. I am a very bold person with a large personality, and my friend group consist of people have large personalities too, so most of the time we are all fighting for control basically and pushing each other around. So most likely nothing is your fault, your friends just probably don't get a long with you. You should search for new friends that are more compatible. Or, if you wanna keep your friends, you should try changing or talk to them about changing, so you guys can continue being friends. ",
