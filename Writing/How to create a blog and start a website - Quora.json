            "answer_text": "Starting a blog is the easiest way to share your ideas and expertise with the world. And if you want to, you can use it to promote your business\u2014or make money straight from the blog. Luckily, in 2017, making a blog is easier than ever. It used to require lots of coding skills: HTML, CSS AND PHP, but today starting a blog can be as simple as creating a document in Word. That is, if you have simple instructions to follow. 1. Choose Your Blogging Platform Start your blog with step 1 When starting your blog, there are several platforms to choose from (tumblr, blogger etc..). However, one that really stands out from the pack is WordPress. It\u2019s FREE, very user friendly, and perfect for people who\u2019ve never built a blog before. Why People Use & Recommend WordPress? It\u2019s FREE (you only need a web host & domain name)There are 5,000+ free & paid WordPress themes available to make your design look top-quality.They have a super helpful support forum.It offers 45,000+ free plugins to help your blog run more smoothly and efficiently.91% of all blogs are running on WordPress and WordPress are also used by 62% of the top 100 company blogs. Why you SHOULDN\u2019T create a blog on a free platform It\u2019s true, you can create your blog free. But it\u2019ll be very limited in functionality, it\u2019ll look boring, and the address will look somewhat childish (e.g., All about you), which diminishes your credibility. There are some serious flaws in free options you need to know about: No Control \u2013 Your blog is being hosted on another website (e.g., WordPress.com: Create a website or blog, Sign up | Tumblr, Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free.). If you violate their terms of service (even by accident), they can shut down your blog anytime (it has happened before).No Customization \u2013 You can\u2019t use all the free plugins or themes. Heck, you can\u2019t even use custom themes to really make your blog stand out.Other Limitations \u2013 Free space of only 3GB. For posts, images, and perhaps videos\u2014that\u2019s just not enough.In short, don\u2019t create a free blog, especially if you\u2019re serious about starting a blog. Later migrating to a better option from a free blogging platform can be very time consuming and tricky. Instead, create a self-hosted WordPress blog where you don\u2019t have any limitations. Plus, you\u2019ll be able to use your own (professional) domain name. 2. Choose a Domain Name Before you go any further, you need to choose a domain name. Your domain name is important because: It\u2019s your \u201cfirst impression\u201d to website visitors.It affects your rankings in search engines.It defines your brand.With that in mind, you should put some thought into your domain name, but not too much. If you come up with something you like within 5 minutes, give it a go. (You can change it later). But here are a few domain tips to get you started: Choose brandable over generic. A brandable domain name is unique and stands out from the competition, while a generic domain name is usually stuffed with keywords and unmemorable.Keep it concise. According to research from Resources for Entrepreneurs, a magazine for entrepreneurs, the top-100 websites have approximately 6 characters in their domain name.Easy to type and pronounce. Your domain name should roll off the tips of your fingers and the tips of your tongue without any problem.3. Sign Up With Web Host and Install WordPress What is Web Hosting and Why Do You Need it? Web Hosting is the service that keeps your blog accessible for everyone. It stores all the files, images and content that your blog has and displays it to the visitors. If you don\u2019t have a web host, you won\u2019t be able to set up a blog for others to see nor will you be able to use your own domain name. There Are Good & Bad Hosting Companies Choosing your host is one of the most important aspect of creating your blog. Bad web hosts cause most of the issues people have related to their blog. For example, unhelpful customer service and hidden fees are quite common\u2026 Many cheap hosts also overuse servers to cut their costs\u2014and that leads to your site potentially not working just because many people are visiting some other site. Only some cheaper hosts control the resources well, so that your website always works right. Here\u2019s a simple step-by-step guide for creating a blog on Bluehost (or any other web host) Sign up with a web hosting (I recommend Bluehost).Choose the hosting plan (you can pick the cheapest one).Pick a domain name for your blog.Complete hosting registration.Install WordPress.Log in and write a blog post.Altogether, this takes about 5-10 minutes if you follow the instructions (and you have chosen your domain name). So, you can start writing your first post in just a few minutes. 4. Customizing and Choosing a Blog Theme Once you\u2019re inside WordPress dashboard, you can start customizing your blog. We\u2019ll go through everything you need to do to get your blog ready and your first post published today. You should get familiar with the look and items of the WordPress admin menu. Here are the various admin menu items: Dashboard \u2013 This is the page you see right after logging in.Posts \u2013 Here you can write and publish new blog posts and view and edit old ones. We\u2019ll go through this once we\u2019ve set up the blog otherwise.Media \u2013 This is your media library with all the images, PDFs, videos, etc. you\u2019ve uploaded.Links \u2013 Many blogs don\u2019t use this at all. You can skip it for now.Pages \u2013 Here you can write and publish new pages and view and edit old ones. We\u2019ll look at this after choosing your blog design.Comments \u2013 Everything related to comments. You can get familiar with this when you\u2019ve published your first post and readers leave the first comments.Appearance \u2013 Here you can change what your blog looks like. We\u2019ll go through this in detail below.Plugins \u2013 Here you can add and remove plugins, which add functionality to your blog. We\u2019ll go through this after selecting the theme.Users \u2013 If you create your content with others, you can add them as users here, so they can edit posts. Otherwise, you can skip this for now.Tools \u2013 Here are some additional tools you can use for publishing posts. You can skip this for now.Settings \u2013 Here you can edit your blog\u2019s settings.Choose a FREE Theme for Your Blog I think choosing your new WordPress blog design is the most fun step. The good news: You can do it all on your own.You can get a FREE WordPress theme that makes your blog look great.You can change it later (just don\u2019t change it so often that your readers can\u2019t keep up).The bad news: You can spend a LONG time looking for the perfect theme.A WordPress theme is responsible for how your blog looks, so it\u2019s an important decision.In other words, a WordPress theme is like your car\u2019s frame. It changes how the car looks, but doesn\u2019t impact the features or performance too much. Luckily for you, WordPress has thousands of great-looking themes already optimized to fit any brand, niche, or industry. Here\u2019s what to look for in a WordPress theme: Simplicity: Unclear design makes it difficult for readers to navigate your blog.Responsiveness: The theme needs to adjust its layout across different screen sizes and devices. In the highly mobile world we live in, responsiveness is a necessity.Speed: Although most themes don\u2019t slow down your blog significantly, it\u2019s still good to test it. To test a theme\u2019s speed, use the Pingdom Website Speed Test, enter the URL of the theme\u2019s demo, and see how long the page takes to load. If the load time is longer than three seconds, you might want to find a different theme (ideally, the load time is below two seconds).Ease of customization: It should be easy to customize the theme\u2014otherwise, you\u2019ll struggle every time you want to tweak something. Fortunately, many themes offer plenty of easy customization options.SEO readiness: The theme shouldn\u2019t make a huge difference to search engines. But it\u2019s still better to choose a theme that\u2019s designed with SEO in mind. (Look for \u201cSEO Optimized\u201d or \u201cSEO ready\u201d in the theme description.)Security: Themes don\u2019t generally create security issues. But it\u2019s anyway good to check some user reviews and comments\u2014and while doing that, check if people have had security problems with the theme.Keep these factors in mind when choosing a theme. But most importantly, pick something you love and want your readers to see. 5. Adding Posts and Pages Okay, now you should be all set up with WordPress. So, now for the fun part \u2013 it\u2019s time to create your first blog post! I\u2019ll take you through each step of this process to make it easy for you. Go back to your WordPress admin panel (http://your_domain.com/wp-admin/) and then to \u201cPosts \u00bb Add New\u201d (or \u201cPages \u00bb Add New) from the left sidebar. What you\u2019ll see is a very friendly editor screen that should remind you of MS Word or Pages on Mac:  Let\u2019s break down what you\u2019re seeing here: Title Area: This is where you write the title of your post.Content Area: This is where the body text of your post goes. The whole area works just like text editing in Word or Pages. You can also add images and other media to your post by clicking the \u201cAdd Media\u201d button.Standard Editing Tools: Here are options like bold, italic, lists, paragraphs, and headlines.Publishing Tools: This is where you get your post shown to the world; chief among them is the big blue \u201cPublish\u201d button. You can also set a publication date to schedule your post in the future or save the post as a draft for more editing.Additional Fine-tuning Tools: Update your blog post and categorize it (you can learn more about WordPress categories and tags here).Here are a few things to keep in mind: Adding links to your posts: You should use outbound links to other websites when needed to back up your claims. For example, if you\u2019re writing an article about meditation, you can link to a study that showed that meditation helped people feel calmer. To add links to your posts, highlight the desired text, then scroll up to the blog menu.  Click the paperclip-looking item to the right of the \u201cAlign right\u201d item (above the \u201cAdd BWS Shortcode\u201d).  From there, add the URL you want to link to:  Then, click the Settings icon on the right (the wheel-looking item above, next to the arrow).  Click the \u201cOpen in link a new tab\u201d box. This is important\u2014you don\u2019t want people to leave your site when they click on a link! Adding Images to your posts: I touched on this briefly before, but I\u2019ll explain it more here. Start by scrolling up to the top of the blog menu and click \u201cAdd Media\u201d.  From here, select the files you\u2019d like to upload. You can find previously uploaded files from the \u201cMedia Library\u201d at the top-left corner next to \u201cUpload Files\u201d.  Once you\u2019ve uploaded an image, you can choose its size and placement. To add a featured image (the image that will be at the top of your post and in the thumbnails of your article), scroll to the right sidebar of your blog menu. You\u2019ll see an option titled \u201cSet featured image\u201d. Click that, then go through the same uploading process to add in a featured image here. Adding videos from YouTube: Adding in a video can spice up your post. This process used to be a bit complicated, but after some recent WordPress updates, it\u2019s easy. All you have to do is copy the YouTube video URL into the content area. Make sure that the URL is on its own line and not clickable. When you publish the post, the video will appear. I told you it was simple! Our friends at WPBeginner have a guide for this if you need any further help\u2014check it out here. Creating the slug: Your slug is the URL of the post. You want to make this slug clear and concise. This will make it easier for people to share it on social media, and overall it will just look better. You can find the slug underneath the post title. It will say \u201cPermalink: http://yourdomain.com/post_title\u201d. Sometimes, the title of your blog post will make the perfect slug. But usually, it will be too long, and you should change it, so that it\u2019s no longer than 2-4 words. Here are some tips for optimizing your WordPress slugs: Target SEO keywords. Think of what people would type to Google when they search for the information you share in the post\u2014those are SEO keywords.Avoid duplicates (make sure it\u2019s not the same as another slug on your website).Don\u2019t change the slug after publishing the post (unless you absolutely have to) as this will result in lost traffic.Adding headings: Headings help you structure your content and make it easier for people to read. Consider adding headings for each of your main points. To add a heading, scroll up to \u201cParagraph\u201d drop-down menu. Select the heading you\u2019d like to use. Note that the \u201cHeading 1\u201d is usually reserved for the post\u2019s title, so stick to the smaller headings (with larger numbers) inside the post.  Publish Your Post (or Page) When you\u2019re done working with your post, click the \u201cPublish\u201d button and then the \u201cView post\u201d link that\u2019s going to appear at the top of the page (you\u2019ll see your post live on the site). Congratulations! You just published your first blog post. Before you share it with others (which is the next step), let\u2019s add a simple tracking system to your site, so you\u2019ll see exactly how many people you\u2019ve reached. 6. Get Traffic and Monetize Your Blog No blog is complete without compelling content. To start, you should figure out the topic(s) that your blog will focus on. Then, come up with 10-15 ideas for new posts. Make these posts a mix of informative and entertaining. You\u2019ll also want to err on the side of creating evergreen content (content that doesn\u2019t become dated/is always relevant) versus news/current affairs content (which becomes dated and irrelevant). Evergreen content will continue to generate traffic overtime, while other content will run its course and become irrelevant. Here are some tips for creating strong blog content that your audience will love: Start by creating a lead-generating content marketing strategy.Follow this guide for creating strong blog posts.Develop a reading habit, so you can internalize how great writers write.Make your content scannable with headings, short paragraphs, and high quality images.Write content that helps your audience solve a problem.Follow this strategy to become a better blog writer in 30 days.Use this formula to create stronger headlines (if your headlines aren\u2019t compelling, people won\u2019t read the content!). Promoting your blog: If you want more blog readers as well as the opportunity to monetize your blog, you need to promote your blog. Turning a blog into a profitable business is doable if there\u2019s enough traffic. Traffic = customers and money. How to make a blog with sustainable traffic? All you need is: A content plan (i.e., what will be your blog\u2019s main topic)A game plan for social media (i.e., which social media sites you\u2019ll use and what content you\u2019ll share)Some basic knowledge of SEO (traffic from Google)For now, here are some tips to get started promoting your blog: Start collecting your blog visitors emails by setting up an email marketing software.Read through this for SEO, usability, and Google guidelines.Check out these videos on YouTube about SEO.Don\u2019t be spammy on social media. Instead, aim for a good mix of social media content\u2014share blog posts and videos, as well as content from other influencers, and also share other interesting and value-adding statuses.Answer questions on http://Quora.com and link back to your blog.Post and promote on relevant Subreddits on Reddit.Use republishing to get featured on large websites.Next steps to start your blog todayNow that you know exactly how to start a blog, it\u2019s over to you. So, I hope you\u2019re ready to take action! If you want to share your ideas or expertise with the world, build an audience or community, or make money with a blog, start now by getting it set up. It only takes a moment, but still many people get stuck with it thinking, \u201cI\u2019ll do it a bit later.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Why not DO Both? One way to start out building a business on the net is to start with YOURSELF, build your brand. THe FIRST thing you need to do is to register a domain name, preferably a .com name in YOUR name e;g. www dot your name dot com , and start to build your brand. The good thing about this approach is that people will see you as REAL and will relate to you more, also, you can then have as many sub-domains under your main domain, so you can create many other businesses My approach would be to : Build your website with your nameAttatch a blog to itBuild some sub domains related to the Niche (business) that you are interested in.People need to Know, what you know, in other words, you obviously have a story to tell, even if it is \u2018how I make paper planes that fly really far\u2019 , whatever you interests, there are people out there that NEED TO KNOW what you know, in other words, you are in a great position to help hundreds or thousands of people who are going through the same problems that YOU have been through, you already know some of the answers that can help them, just start to tell them about it .ANother great approach that will bring traffic to your website and also give you more credibility is to write a book. This is easier than you think and although a little off topic this is the two minute version of writing a book on ANY subject:Step 1: Think of a Topic Step 2: Write down a list of 5 things that people need to know about that topic. Step 3: Now you have your 5 things about your topic, these are actually your Chapter titles, now fill in the details of your chapters and write a few paragraphs about each. Step 4: Publish your short book on the Kindle platform, it is free and will give you instant credibility for your website also. All The best! ",
