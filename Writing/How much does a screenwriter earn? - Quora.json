            "answer_text": "There are many different levels of payment, usually based on their resume, which builds with each project. And it depends on what type of project they're working on. To generalize, you're looking at low five-figure deals to start off writing for MOWs (Movie of the Week) and whatnot. You get into the high five-figure deals (WGA scale) for smaller films and studio writing assignments (again, when you're first starting out). Then, IF you get some produced credits under your belt and are getting more high profile jobs, you'll get into the six figures. Selling scripts can go from WGA scale (high five figures) to seven-figure deals (really not the norm anymore, unless there is a bidding war). Usually, it's low to mid-six figures for a studio to acquire your script. The Catch of Contracted Drafts BUT, here's the catch. Most people think it's a winning lottery ticket. It's not. The contracts break up those figures. They stipulate that you get paid per draft. So if you're writing on a mid-five-figure deal, divide that dollar amount by four drafts. Then, divide each of those in two because you'll get paid half of a draft up front and half upon delivery of that draft. There\u2019s a catch. There's no guarantee that you'll get to write all of those drafts. If your first draft is terrible \u2014 or if they want to go in a different direction \u2014 they'll either kill the project or hire someone else. So that five-figure deal amount turns into you just making a fourth of that. And this can happen at every level with each draft you turn in. For the bigger deals, you'll see in the trades that Jane Screenwriter signed a deal for $200,000 against $500,000. What that means is she'll get $200,000 first (usually broken up as mentioned above) and then if the film actually goes into production and gets made, she'll be owed another $300,000. Once again, you have to divide that dollar amount into generally four draft payouts \u2014 all of which you can be fired after. Bonuses Then you work in various bonuses that are offered in the contract. If the script gets made and the film breaks $100 million, some contracts allow the writer a bonus. Awards can come into play as well. It depends on the contract that is negotiated. The seven-figure deals are anomalies these days, saved primarily for a few scripts a year by hot and established screenwriters. Back in the screenwriting boom of the 1990s, high six to seven-figure deals were more prevalent. Many of those screenwriters have now written screenwriting books and told those stories, making newcomer screenwriters believe this can still happen. Not so, sadly. Even selling an original script these days happens few and far between in the grand scheme of things. Most spec scripts are used for calling cards, getting into meetings, and for being attached to writing assignments. Option Contracts Most screenwriters will also ask about options. Options refer to a production company, producer, or studio paying a screenwriter a smaller amount of money to take their script off of the open market so the powers that be can take the time to develop it and shop it around to talent and financiers. Options usually last from 6 to 12 months, which means that during that time, the writer and/or their representation cannot take the script out to any other prospects. Options used to offer a one-time payment of anywhere from $2,500-$10,000. These days it's more like $2,500-$5,000 if you\u2019re unestablished. When the option expires, the powers that be have the option of renewing, usually for the same price. However, especially since the 2007 strike, options are not offered that much anymore these days. They still happen, but few and far between. And most are either free options or shopping agreements, which are basically options where you don\u2019t make money until they sell it \u2014 which usually doesn\u2019t happen. Most professional screenwriters like myself out there are what I call \"blue-collar screenwriters\". They make a five-figure living and are lucky to be doing even that. Only the top one percent make consistent six to seven-figure earnings annually. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s by negotiations, which is why you need an agent. Initially they can offer you anything from $500 to $100,000. You decide what to accept and they decide when to stop talking to you. (That means you lost the sale.) However the Writer\u2019s Guild does have minimums and minimum rules. But you have to be in the union to get these and to get into the union used to be based on \u201cPoints\u201d for different types of writing. Sitcom story got so many point. Sitcom script got so many points. Hour drama, etc. Some get into writing by going the production route. You might get an internship. Then be offered a management job like Story Editor, then each year if you survive and show survives you get upped to Executive Story Editor, Script Editor, Associate Producer, Co-Producer. By then you\u2019re probably in the Writer\u2019s Guild and you\u2019re now a Writer-Producer that is usually just credited as Producer on the TV shows. You still get minimums and residuals, but you\u2019re a salaried member of management. Doing day to day management work that can including rewriting poor scripts. The Union rates are based on type of production (e.g. cable TV show, network TV show, daytime program, news and documentary production, low budget feature (under $10 million) or high budget feature (over $10 million). And in TV it\u2019s based on running time. Staff writers make just under $5,000 a week. Which sounds great except the show can be canceled after 8 episodes. So your get about $25\u201330,000 after taxes, health and welfare, dues, 10 or 15% agent fees. Now you are on unemployment and looking for a job and your last credit was staff writer on a show that got canceled because it lacked ratings or was poorly written. Sit com stories around $3,500. Full sit come script around $12,000. Hour drama around $24,000. Low budget movie or made for TV movie about $50,000, high budget movie $100,000. But by now your agent is negotiating and you might be making more than scale, especially as a screen writer doing high budget features or as a TV producer-writer. Writer-Producers make between $10,000 and $30,000 per episode. Show runners and top executive producers make more. If you CREATE a TV show you get a royalty for every new episode made. If you create a recurring character you get paid whenever the write that character into the script, even if you don\u2019t do the writing. You also get residuals for syndication, foreign licensing and DVDs. Syndication is generally 100% of MINIMUM for the first run and then as it gets re-syndicated it drops to 90%, 80% and finally down to 10%. I believe only actors, writers and directors get this contractually. Producers get their share by negotiations, although if they were credited as writing a script they will get residuals for that script. Top writers have been none to make a million dollars on a movie script and may get to own net or gross points in the movie. The Writer\u2019s Guild Rules say you must be paid an advance before you write anything as a freelancer (staff writers get a weekly salary). This is generally 40% of the type of writing. Usually this is sit com, hour drama, or TV movie. You may have a certain amount of time to turn in a first draft. The producer either accepts that and pays the 60% remaining or tells you what changes they want and you get to do the second draft. At the end of that you get your 60% remaining. Freelances go in and \u201cpitch\u201d to the producer. They\u2019ll pitch their story idea and if the producer likes it and knows they can deliver, a deal memo is made, a check is cut and they either work in the office or from home and they must deliver a script on time. Network prime time is an assembly line. It\u2019s a sweat shop. It\u2019s 16 hour days 6 days a week for everyone except the producers. For them it\u2019s 7 days a week. Production might start in late July or Early August, but November they are on hiatus and waiting to hear how they did in the sweeps, which either means more episodes or they get canceled. They come back after New Year (or in the case of some shows today, their year ended in November and they are unemployed until next July if the show gets picked up for another 8 or 10, like a lot of shows are getting today, especially on cable and streaming). If they are a full 21 episode network show they write until maybe March and that\u2019s it for the staff writers, story editors, script editors. Unemployment until July or August. Directors and actors get a few more weeks then they get laid off. Producers and technical people stay on until April or even early May. The head writer-producer (the showrunner) is responsible for the budget, for getting episodes in on time (least they be \u201cpreempted\u201d or rerun), keeping up the quality, keeping up the ratings. And getting each episode done one time from Story pitch to uploading to the network for review, editing, commercial placements, video blanking. Then it gets slotted into the feed for the given day and time slot. This person is the one the networks and studio can kick around without worrying the union will put them on trial or fine them. This is \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d person. You have two weeks or less to write an episode (Joss Whedon did one in a weekend), get it to the production manager and director for budgeting, breakdown and to the actors for table read. It may go through more rewrites as the director casts and scouts location. While this is happening another two week script is being written. This goes on and on and on for three months or so until hiatus. Then maybe another three months to do a full 21 episode drama. So as a freelancer you have to write fast or you won\u2019t be called back. You don\u2019t get the assignment in August and turn it in during December. It gets turned in during August. ",
