            "answer_text": "I did this as a poem at one stage. Hyperbole We raised it well with kindnessCatered for its many needs;Held it closely in our armsAnd carefully did feed. It started as an infantNurtured \u2019til it grew so strong,Placed in a good enclosureSo that nothing could go wrong. At times we would release itAnd it curled about our feet.Forever choose forgive itIf it sat upon our seat. Then back into enclosureThere resides in happy state,When leaving time\u2019s upon usWe depart both good and late. Tomorrow is a new day,to our little friend return.Who waits there for us patiently,Such friendship we\u2019d not spurn. Huddling near to idleRubbing closely at the doorHoping we would feed it soonSweet little metaphor.[1] Footnotes[1] Greg Burns's answer to Is poetry always about uncovering the meaning behind it (for the poet & critic)? Why is that a problem?",
