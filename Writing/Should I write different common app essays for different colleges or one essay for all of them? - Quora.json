            "answer_text": "Should I write different common app essays for different colleges or one essay for all of them? It depends, but no such restriction that you need to change for each college - If you had chosen certain essay prompts and if you did not enter any college specific answers / responses to those prompt(s), you can reuse for other colleges. But, it makes sense to review, if you would like to take some other prompt for a different college, etc. and then review the response you had already made. https://www.commonapp.org/apply/essay-prompts/ is the official blog Common App has announced that the 2020-2021 essay prompts will remain the same as the 2019\u20132020 essay prompts. 1. Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, please share your story. 2. The lessons we take from obstacles we encounter can be fundamental to later success. Recount a time when you faced a challenge, setback, or failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience? 3. Reflect on a time when you questioned or challenged a belief or idea. What prompted your thinking? What was the outcome? 4. Describe a problem you\u2019ve solved or a problem you\u2019d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma \u2014 anything of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution. 5. Discuss an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. 6. Describe a topic, idea, or concept you find so engaging it makes you lose all track of time. Why does it captivate you? What or who do you turn to when you want to learn more? 7. Share an essay on any topic of your choice. It can be one you\u2019ve already written, one that responds to a different prompt, or one of your own design. ",

            "answer_text": "Write one Common App essay and use it for all colleges. To support that suggestion I offer two points. One is that on multiple occasions, I have students use one essay and get into a range of schools, including Harvard, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Williams \u2026 you name it. My point is that there is that there is no need or advantage in \u201cgaming\u201d your essay choice to align some perception of what a school \u201cwants.\u201d The other point is that your Common App essay is about you. It should focus on your defining qualities. These are a constant. Right? So changing them from one school to the next may lead you to use weaker material. So the good news is that you can write one Common App essay. Just make it a good one. ",

            "answer_text": "I see the answers are not consistent. The idea of the common app essay is one essay goes to all schools. However, technically, you can make changes to the essay for college B after submitting to college A. This is a Q and A from the Common App site Your future starts here that explains this: Applicant Support Can a student make changes to their Common App and/or Member Screen answers after they have already submitted to our institution? Once applicants have submitted the application to your institution, they are unable to make any changes to the parts of the application that they have submitted to you. A student is permitted to edit their Common Application for other institutions to which they have not submitted, however please know that once submitted to your school, any changes they then make to their Common App will not reflect in your records.
