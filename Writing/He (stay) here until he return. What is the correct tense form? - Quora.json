            "answer_text": "This is a very confusing sentence. On the face of it, it appears that the first he and the second he refer to the same person, and if that is so, how can he stay here and yet return (from somewhere)? However that may be, the subject he is singular and therefore the verb has to match. The singular form of the verb stay is stays and of the verb return is returns, and therefore, the correct sentence should read He stays here until he returns. ",
