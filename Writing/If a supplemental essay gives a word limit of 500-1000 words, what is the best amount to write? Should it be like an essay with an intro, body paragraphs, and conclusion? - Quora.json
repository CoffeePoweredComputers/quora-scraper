            "answer_text": "Your limit is 1000 words, unless you want to write less than 500 for some reason. Your structure doesn\u2019t change, because what\u2019s being asked of you is to examine an idea critically. The challenge is whether or not you can manage that critique in the space allotted. So, your true companion is your outline. Take time to craft your thesis and clearly delineate our main points and the evidence you will use before you ever write any actual words of the essay in question. If you are organized, there is very little chance you will over-run your word count, because you will have pre-measured each section of your essay, as it were. Length is of minor importance. The clarity of your thought is paramount. ",
