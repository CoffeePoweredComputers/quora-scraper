            "answer_text": "Physically, yes it is possible to write or type two pages an hour for five hours. However, if it is any sort of essay, likely you will need to do research, provide properly formatted citations, have a good argument or analysis in which takes up a lot of time in terms of the amount you have. Realistically, if you haven\u2019t started a few days before, there is almost no chance you will be able to finish it. The only possible situation I could think of is either all the research and planning and citations have been finished and therefore you just have to fill up the ten pages by going into more detail than your essay outline, but even then that is still really hard, unless you perform much better under stress and are one of those people who can write a 2\u20133 page essay in under an hour. If you perform poorly under stress then finishing a 10 page paper isn\u2019t realistically possible. Also, the biggest part of the paper is not only knowing the right words you want to put down, but also reviewing your paper and thinking about it critically. Normally coming up with a good idea for a paper may take several hours\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can write it in 2 minutes and you don\u2019t even have to write it if you balance something heavy on one of the letter buttons on your keyboard. You are measuring using the wrong metric. However long it takes you to generate something meaningful to say, and say it is how long it takes. I took 3 months (10\u201320 hours a week) to write a pointless 8 page journal article that went nowhere. My most cited, and compelling work was a 6 page paper that I wrote in an afternoon. ",
