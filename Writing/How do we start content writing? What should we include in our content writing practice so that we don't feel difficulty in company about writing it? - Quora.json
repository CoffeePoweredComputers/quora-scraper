            "answer_text": "I have a very simple answer to your question- \u201cBy writing one word at a time.\u201d Sounds obvious. Doesn\u2019t it? This answer was actually given by Stephen King when he was asked how does he write in an interview. The thing is that there\u2019s no trick to writing. You start with patience and you grow by practice. Although there are a lot of things that you can do to improve and get going with writing. I\u2019m listing some of them here but before even going through the list make sure that you want to actually go ahead with writing. I\u2019m not trying to discourage you with my statements but it is important to consider writing as your interest before diving into it. It can be really frustrating at times to write and still go on and I bet if you are into writing, you can go the long way. So without further ado, here you go. Read a lot- Always be on a lookout for magazines, newspapers, novels, advertisements, proposals, brochures, social media channels etc. You\u2019ll get a chance to grasp different types of content which will eventually benefit your writingFix your writing word count for the day. For example, if you decide on writing 500 words per day, make sure you do that on a regular basis. And the best part is that you can write about anything you like. Tip: Pick up a debate topic and write your view along with supporting factsIf you\u2019re looking forward to work as a content writer for a company, make sure you develop an understanding of the industry. As I\u2019ve worked for several IT companies that develop products or provide services, I\u2019ve groomed myself to understand their nature of workAnother tip that I learned while writing for companies is that you must learn the basics of marketing in order to enhance your writing such as how to write an SEO optimized blog post. Though SEO might not interest you much, you must learn about it in order to make the most out of your writingI think if you start with these basic steps, you\u2019d eventually discover more by yourself in the later stage. For starting, these tips would do the trick for you but remember, consistency is the key to good writing. Hope this helps. Cheers! ",

Just make sure that your writing is impeccable. You can take help from English Tutorials on YouTube, as of https://www.adda247.com/ wherein you can find Anchal Sharma\u2019s tutorials really helpful. As far as content writing is concerned, you can opt for content writing course from Hubspot academy, which is online available. It will help you to procure a certification. Thereafter, you can apply for the same position in eCommerce, banking or many other companies. About writing practice, i suggest putting forth your creativity, relentless exposure of master pieces of writing, going through news and articles and make sure that you have knowledge of digital marketing, as most of the companies suppose you to possess the knowledge about keyword density, online visibility, keywords and online research. Rest is your hard work and passion to take on the challenges. ",
