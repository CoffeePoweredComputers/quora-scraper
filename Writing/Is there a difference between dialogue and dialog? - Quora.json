            "answer_text": "Dialogue differs from dialog mainly in spelling. What significance does UE have after g? Some other gue words are guess, guest, tongue, brogue, Prague, plague, intrigue, league, argue. Note que has close parallels: quest, torque, Baroque, plaque. A guess that UE emphasizes whether the shape '9' is g or q kinda gets shot down here... and UE to assure g is pronounced like in gut and not judge hasn't great merit, since q doesn't use it for any such distinction. Perhaps art is employed here to infer that the terms in which it exists represent works that are ever- art- bound, and logical perfunctory symbolism isn't always evident in English. Perhaps p b and d, other music loops in the alphabet like UE also: due, duel, imbue,....puesto...puegnant, pueblo, puerist It seems p has trouble with this UE thing in English. Dialopue...opulence? Maybe dialogue has art for us regular folk. ",

            "answer_text": "Dialog is the American English version for the old British word Dialogue. That being said, Merriam Webster defines dialog as a different word, referring to the computer concept https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632588(v=vs.85).aspx specially popularized by Microsoft's Windows operating system(s). The reason why it would be a different entry in itself has to do with the roots of such programming being prominently in the U.S., where dialogue was spelt as dialog. Also, many people in the U.S., associate the word dialogue with an actual conversation, and, the word dialog, with the dialog box. ",
