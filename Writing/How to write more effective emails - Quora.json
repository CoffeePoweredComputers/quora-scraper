            "answer_text": "To:  Mary, Johncc:  Ted, Tombcc: my file, Boss Subject:  Composing Effective Emails Hoping this email finds you well. Use appropriate and clear subject lines.Adopt correct procedures for who belongs on the To: line, the cc: line, and the bcc: line.  The \"To:\" line is for people who must know or need to take action.  The \"cc:\" line is for people who are interested parties but have no need to take action or respond.  The \"bcc:\" line is for those who are interested parties but who are not directly involved, and therefore don't want to be included in any ensuing \"Reply to All\" nonsense.Use a business font and a clear, crisp format.  Do not use emoticons, pictures, special effects, colored backgrounds,  personal designs of any kind.  Black and white only.  No graphs, no  charts, no more than 2 columns and 5 rows.  Put any such items in  attached files or document links.  Remember that some people may be reading your email on a cell phone screen.  No clutter, please.Set up different signature lines for in-house peer-directed and subordinate-directed emails (including first name and direct phone line),   in-house upwardly directed emails (including your full name and title and direct phone line),   and an outward facing signature including your company's prescribed format and logo with your full name, title and all points of contact (phone, fax, cell, email)  I call these signatures me, myself and I.Arrange your email so that the most important items are introduced at the beginning, with less important information or minor details dropping to the bottom.  Like a newspaper article.  Email is not an essay contest.  Use bullet points or ordered lists wherever possible.  More than 10 items is unwieldy.Do not put unconnected issues in a single email.  Use the right tools for the job.  If you're passing out assignments, send Tasks.  If you are setting up meetings, send Meeting Requests. If you're taking a survey, use Voting Buttons.Don't be afraid to be concise and crisp in the body of your email, but don't compose like you're Tweeting.  Use complete sentences and full words unless all acronyms are well known by all recipients.  You can take the edge off by using friendly greeting (as above) and closing (as below).   Happy trails...

            "answer_text": "I strongly believe that in order to write clearly, you really have to think with clarity. Aside of that, your emails have to exude assetiveness and a sense of ownership. That seems like a lot, but it really is not that hard. What steps can you take to get there? Here are a few tips: 1) If you think/realize your emails are not effective, you probably have compared them with someone else's already. What do you think makes their emails better? Jot down the points - for example, the emails are concise, they have clarity, they are able to put forth a point well, et cetera. That is the first step to learning - from a better peer. Use the internet to read up email samples too. There are quite a few good ones that you can learn from.  2) Consider breaking down your email into bullet points. Now, i'm not saying you end up saying 'a) I'm going to be out of office b) I will be out from 5/8 through 5/25 c) i'm going to Hawaii' , but you get the idea. Even if you do not send out a bulleted email, creating a set ot sentences that flow into each other helps you think and hence write with clarity.  3) A lot of why emails are ineffective is because they are unnecessary. This morning I got an email that was a response to an issue. The body of the email said 'this is weird. I don't know what is going on'. That is an ineffective, unnecessary and pointless email. Such emails coming from managers should always, at the very least, have a status on something and the next steps with Expected Time of Arrivals.  4) Very related to the point above but slightly elaborating - work emails are supposed to communicate relevant, important information and not your emotions. Of course, there is occasional humor and pleasure/displeasure exhibited in emails, but the idea is to keep it as professional as you can. If you need to vent/rant, pick up the phone or walk over to someone's desk. Better still, open a word document and write yourself an email about how unhappy/happy/upset you are.  5) Learn to own up for mistakes and take up credit. The use of 'we' instead of 'I' and passive voice instead of active voice is overdone and is most definitely distracting.  6) Read and re-read your emails. Go for a coffee break and come back and check if the email still has the right tone and makes sense because if it doesn't make sense to you, chances are it will not make sense to anyone. (This is the best case scenario. The worst case scenario is that your email will be misinterpreted).  Hope this helps. Be well, and all the best. ",

            "answer_text": "If you still hesitate over what samples email sales pitch to choose for the business, try another approach. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. You can follow certain prompts to lift your commercial activity to the higher level. If you feel like you need some extra knowledge on the topic, do check out the article by Geoffrey James on Inc. 1. Subject Electronic mail is a fast and feasible way of interaction that offers a plenty of benefits. Still, some of its essential parts are usually neglected. For instance, the email subject is often considered to be the secondary element. At the same time, choosing the perfect email title is undisputed. It can be compared with a hook to catch a lead\u2019s attention. You can follow the \u201cThree S Rule\u201d namely simplicity, shortness and strength. Such attributes of email title will increase the open rate of the electronic letter. 2. Problem - Solution It was already mentioned, but you can never be too thorough. If you've managed to convince leads to read your pitch, provide them with a problem to solve. For instance, the necessity of a pen is highly acute when a person needs to write or sign something. Otherwise speaking, a product/service is the best solution for resolving an issue, which should be described in the pitch.  3. Facts A game of figures is quite popular among the population. People would like to know rates and percentages of different activities as well as facts that may seem irrelevant at first glance. Still, figures are not the only argument to persuade leads to buy something. Such impactful tools as feedbacks, studies, reviews, awards, and other acknowledgments increase the reputation of your product/service. 4. Purchase The content of the sales pitch should have a sole purpose namely to induce leads to purchase. Certainly, you should pack your presentation with various data by means of the above-mentioned tips. Still, all that is required to close a sale. On this account, say it directly to a lead. 5. Shortness The value of the presentation length is relevant. Making a long-read pitch can be a failure since the potential client may lose interest. The too short email is also hardly a fit. There is no exact value of words or characters to include in the text but you should put yourself into the lead\u2019s shoes.. 6. Grammar Having written the final sentence of the presentation does not indicate readiness to click the Send button. As soon as you finished crafting, the spell check is highly recommended. Numerous mistakes or mistypes made in haste will harm the quality of the presentation. So, do not spare a couple of minutes to reread the text and identify possible defects. 7. Follow-up An unanswered email is not the reason to stop the communication with potential clients. There is a plenty of reasons to explain why your sales presentation was not opened. Even if the lead was unwilling to open your electronic letter at a certain moment in the past, there is a probability that he or she would change their mind and you would succeed. Therefore, keep trying and do not lose heart. To learn more about sales mailing visit blog post Most Effective Email Sales Pitch Samples ",

            "answer_text": "I worked in IBM India Pvt. Ltd. for 2+ years and my job required a lot of email writing. I am writing based on my experience. Email is a written form of communication so is more powerful than verbal communication when it comes to proof. A manager spends most of his/her time on communication. Effective communication is vital for proper management of resources. I have highlighted few points to improve email writing.   First of all, do not take email as just a form of communication. Your email should deliver proper message as well as motivation. To have a proper subject is important which should made it clear the purpose of message. For instance if it is FYI or Appreciation or Action required mail. ( Self - Assessment of 2015 - Action required by May 15)Do not copy everyone if he/she is not to be informed. Know your audience/receiver. Also while replying mails copy only intended receivers. Salutation in official mail should be as simple as 'Hi Sam'.Body should be precise with all details of information you are seeking or disseminating. Do not write just like conversation. Take an example: Ok Sam, send me that report. can be written asHi Sam,Would you please send me Q3 review report that you were working on by the end of day? Email signature should include your name, designation and your address at office along with your contact number and email.",

            "answer_text": "You question is a bit general, but here's some ideas based on emails I've received: Use a meaningful subject line. Do not be too generic; indicate if it is an FYI or if some action is expected. For example, \"Draft of xxx report for June 1 review\" is better than simply \"xxx report\". Don't send a question or assignment to a bunch of people without clearly indicating who should take action. It's easy to assume that someone else will handle it if no one is explicitly assigned.Include a clear call to action and important information like due dates early in the note. If you need to expand on something, make sure you have your reader's attention first - and it's easier for them to find again in their ocean of email.Break your text into paragraphs, bullets, or whatever else may be appropriate for the topic. People scan their emails; no one wants to read a long, dense wall of text.Don't spam your team. If a note was sent to everyone in the company, don't forward it again with a \"please read\" message. If you don't know if everyone is already getting those emails, ASK THEM.",

Always know your recipients specifically. Unless you don't know who is the right person, always put only one in To list. If multiple persons in to list, it is very likely that all of them ignore it. Probability of response is inversely proportional to no of recipients in to list. Understand recipient's perspective. Average time spent on e- mail is less than 3 sec.

Written sales communication is different from the verbal pitch-in where you have the benefits of your tonality, facial expression and gentle appearance. On the other hand, sales mailers have only words which needs to be professional yet personal. There are three prominent parts to every sales email: The Opening: This is the most crucial part. It includes subject line and the first introductory words that sets the tonality of your mailer. If your subject line caters to the needs of consumers, the email gets opened. The Value Preposition: This part explains the unique selling proposition of your products/services. It represents your identity in the sector you are operating. It gives your brand a worth and describes why your customers should be interested in what you offer. If your value prepositions are clear, then the email gets read. The Closing: This is where you tell your audience what to do next. It includes Call-to-action button along with the redirecting links to your website or landing page.
