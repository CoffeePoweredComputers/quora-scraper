            "answer_text": "Writing about your business is a great Opportunity to record your journey in the business world. There are so many challenges you face that it never gets boring. How often you will write in your business journal is the first thing you must decide upon. Will you keep it daily, weekly or monthly? You can choose any option but commit to this schedule. By doing so you will be able to reap all the benefits a journal can bring to you. What could fit in your business journal? Write about possible business ideas. What do you think about them and how you would implement them. How you would finance them and what would be your plan B. How to evolve your business further, cooperation or new product lines are important to survive. Write about your present business status. What is going well, what needs improvement. What did particularly did well today. How many sales you had and what you think the reason is for this outcome. Write about your goals. Create lists pointing out your short and long-term goals and compare the results from time to time. Time is the defining measure here. Did you reach your goals in the anticipated time? Write weekly what did you do to come closer to one of your goals. How much did it cost to achieve your goal? Can you pursue bigger rewards? Write about Kudos you received from customers. Over time if you have a great product/service you will receive lots of it. This praise will not only cheer you up on more moody days, but it can also be used in your marketing efforts. Write about your competitors. Honestly what do you think of them. In what area are they better then you, how could you come closer? You can begin making a SWOT analysis about them or keep it casual like, Competitor A has great design, particularly I like their logo, because\u2026 In this section, you will become clearer, which points you have a competitive advantage over them and which are areas you should focus on to improve. You can set up a motivating cliffhanger. Nothing is more dangerous in business than procrastinating. You can establish an entry which serves as reminder to where you stand. It can have a quote you admire and than some questions which help you getting started. One problem that needs a solution5 things you should do tomorrow.By answering them on a repeated basis and following up with actions you do actively improving your business.  You can, of course, choose to write about more stuff in your business journal. These points are the ones I find important and keep in mine. Mynlo the online journal I own, has a list and kudos section. You can setup easily all the others if needed. Hope you will enjoy your Entrepreneurship. You will reflect one morning back to these days and wonder how much you achieved. That\u2019s only possible by keeping those moments close to you in written form. ",
