            "answer_text": "LinkedIn Content Marketing is divided into 2 main parts. The Hero\u2019s JourneyExpertise Framework.Here is why and how to write your first post on LinkedIn. But before I share with you the first framework, it\u2019s important to understand the rule of two I explain in my LinkedIn Content Marketing Book. The start: the rule of twoWhen writing a LinkedIn post, it\u2019s important to understand how your content is being showcased on LinkedIn. When people scroll through their feed, they won\u2019t see your entire post. They\u2019ll only see a part of it. The first two sentences, as you can see here below.  Writing content on LinkedIn is like writing an ad on Facebook or LinkedIn. If you can\u2019t grab the attention within the first two sentences, you may have lost your audience and opportunity to inspire. Here are a couple of ways to get started: Write a bold statement most people might disagree with:  Start with wisdom:  Sparkle curiosity:  Research questions your target audience has and use it to start your post:  Start with an emotion like stress, anger, insecurity, anxiety, jealousy:  Start with a challenge:  Now you know how to start, but what about the rest? This is where frameworks come in handy. As mentioned above. 50% of the writing is about your own journey. 50% is about showing you are the right person to solve your customers problem. The first framework will help you write about your own journey. 2. Hero\u2019s journey framework Why reinvent the wheel if you can use proven models to write your LinkedIn stories. Models that have been used by great storytellers all around the world, over and over again. One of these models is called the hero\u2019s journey framework. A 5-step framework, tweaked by my friend Pim Hogeweg, to win at LinkedIn Inbound. This is what it looks like:  Challenge: In this case we are going to start with a real challenge.Problem: Now that you\u2019ve got the attention of your readers, tell them why this challenge was a problem to you. What was the impact on you or on important people to you? How did you suffer? What were the negative results?Help: Problems are there to be solved. What did you do to try to solve the problem? Don\u2019t forget, most of the time your first try is not the best solution. So who or what helped you out?Solution. Through some help or experience you\u2019ve solved your problem. Awesome! What was the result? How did you feel afterwards and do you still feel the same way ? Tell us how \u2018the help\u2019 helped you.Learning: Thank god, you survived! Maybe you have a better life now. Tell us what other people can learn from your experience. How can we solve problems like the ones you experienced? How can we become better people or have a better / meaningful life too?Alright, enough with the theory. This is what it looks like in practice:  Here is what it looks like from a framework perspective: Challenge Problem Help Result Learning As Pim would say it: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a hero to tell a good story. Good stories start with ordinary people. It\u2019s how ordinary people solve real problems that makes them hero\u2019s.\u201d Go write your first hero story. 3. The expertise framework Now that you know how to write your personal stories, it\u2019s time to dig deeper into writing about your expertise. Expertise you\u2019ll share to convince your audience why you are the one to solve their problems, and not your competitor. Let\u2019s get started. There are a couple of ways to write about your expertise. My favorite is when you blend in a personal experience with your expertise. It\u2019s a 4-step framework we have developed together with our clients to create your post: IntroProblemSolutionLearningHere is an example of one:  I used a personal story to blend in my expertise within the B2B marketing space. This is what it looks like within the 4-step framework: Intro Problem Solution Learning Now you have 2 frameworks to work with. Now it\u2019s time to start writing. Because, last time I checked, they won\u2019t write themselves. Looking to learn more about the full picture of LinkedIn Content Marketing? Here is a 14 step process to getting started: A step by step guide to B2B inbound marketing on Linkedin (hint: writing your first post, is number 14). Happy growth! Ricardo Ghekiere ",

            "answer_text": "Posting on LinkedIn is a great way to stay top of mind with your audience and scale thought leadership. People will like, comment and share. This will increase the reach of your post across first, second\u200a\u2014\u200aand\u200a\u2014\u200aif it\u2019s truly epic\u200a\u2014\u200athird-degree connections. People will want to know more about you. But what is it that makes posts on LinkedIn magnetic? Here\u2019s 4 types of posts you can try out to build engagement and influence. #1. The Thought-Provoking Influencer These are personal opinions that are (slightly) controversial and serve as food for discussion.  (Gabe Villamizar\u200a\u2014\u200aHead of B2B Marketing at Lucidchart) Not a lot of people have the balls to come out and challenge the status-quo. The ones that do tend to get appreciation and following quickly. They blow the whistle on trends that need to be talked about. This is a powerful way to becoming an influencer in your space.  (Alfie Bektas\u200a\u2014\u200aAffiliate Marketing Director at Blue Owl) Start off with powerful one-liners to grab attention. Use blunt language and don\u2019t be shy to use capitals for emphasis. Avoid adverbs and adjectives. End your post with a powerful question or call-to-action to drive discussion and engagement.  (Brandon Redlinger\u200a\u2014\u200aDirector of Growth at Engagio) Brandon Redlinger totally nailed it in this post as he grills sales spammers. (Brandon was mentioned as a pioneer in this excellent Autopilot blog post on LinkedIn Publishing)  (Scott Ingram\u200a\u2014\u200aStrategic Account Manager at Relationship One) Post #2: The Universal Wisdom Beautifully phrased wisdom bombs that inspire and empower. It\u2019s the kind of stuff that flips your world upside-down as you read it. It hits you hard because you know its true. Gary Vee is an absolute badass at this. I can just randomly pick a post from his LinkedIn feed. Every single one of them would prove my point.  (Gary Vaynerchuk\u200a\u2014\u200aUniversal Guru) You don\u2019t need to be Gary Vee to pull this off though. One guy that\u2019s really rocking LinkedIn lately is Thomas Ma. His posts are a blend of his personal, hard-fought journey as he tries to make it as an entrepreneur and powerful lessons he learned along the way.  (Thomas Ma\u200a\u2014\u200aCo-Founder Sapphire Apps) These are the type of posts that lift you up out of everyday confusion and fill you with heavenly inspiration. Post #3: Episodes Of Personal Growth Thomas Ma has reported being inspired by Gary Vee\u2019s idea of documenting rather than creating when it comes to connecting with content. People love stories about other people because it\u2019s easier for them to connect with. Document your personal journey in a way that it inspires people. Here\u2019s another one of Thomas\u2019 updates:  Note how the picture makes the share even more easy to empathise with. The takeaway here is to share your journey by sharing everyday stories about personal, yet professional wins your audience can easily relate to and learn from. Stories always connect. Especially stories about common heroes working their way up to the top. You can treat your status updates as a tear-off calendar: teeny-tiny episodes in the larger story of your personal growth that work as daily inspiration for your audience. Post #4: The Heart-Warmer These are the kind of posts that restore your faith in humanity. They make you feel all warm and optimistic. Take this post for example.  (Kenny Goldman\u200a\u2014\u200aSales & Customer Success Helpful.com) They\u2019re stories that warm your heart to an extent that it almost feels like the poster had to share them, as a service to the rest of mankind. It\u2019s hard to do these kind of post on command\u200a\u2014\u200astories like these happen to you or they don\u2019t. The key takeaway\u200a\u2014\u200aalso from other post types\u200a\u2014\u200acomes down to not holding back on sharing stuff from your personal experience. You\u2019ll be amazed by how many people you can inspire by stuff you encounter in your daily life, especially if they come with inspiring lessons.  (Punit Soni\u200a\u2014\u200aCEO & Founder Learning Motors) Here Punit combines a heart-warming story with a Universal Wisdom. Just look how many people appreciated him sharing ex-colleagues reaching out to him and wishing him good luck. Mankind at its best. ",
