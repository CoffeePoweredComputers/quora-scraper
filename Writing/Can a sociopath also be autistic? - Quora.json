            "answer_text": "I don't know, to be honest. But I don't that that's a likely thing and I'll go on and explain why. What looks like sociopathy could just be part of your autism, especially if, like me, you have a bit of the ' Sherlock Holmes' personality or you Seem ( key word=seem) not to care about other stuff as much as others do and that makes some people perceive us as sociopaths. But to be a sociopath you must have certain traits consistently and it really requires a diagnosis from a professional. I think when ignorant people label autistic people sociopaths they're kind of downplaying how their disability might affect them and it's making a lot of biased assumptions. Plus if you consider that as autistic people we are usually developmentally younger in some ways than our chronological age, it makes sense that we could appear a bit sociopathic, as a lot of behaviour children do you wouldn't think appropriate of an adult. I'm not saying autistic people are completely like children, not necessarily and in my case definitely not in understanding and maturity but, especially if one is in a burnout phase, their symptoms might manifest more severely. Basically it's really not fair to label someone sociopathic if they have a severe disability, IMO. Not even to label yourself that. You can see a therapist if you're concerned that you might be a sociopath as well but in my view, autistic people on the whole are very different from sociopaths in a lot of ways. For one thing, sociopaths enjoy manipulating others for their own gain and don't care about the effects of their actions on others. From my experience and what I've seen of a lot of autistic people, many of us do usually care about what others think of us (even if it may not appear that way to someone who doesn't understand autism) and we don't go out of our way to deliberately manipulate or hurt people because we don't want to, wheras sociopaths often do. Autistic people often like keeping to ourselves and we can be naiive at times or too honest. Sociopaths tend to be more subtle with their words to manipulate people and take advantage of people who speak more openly. In my experience, a lot of ' normal' people act like sociopaths but don't see it that way and then accuse anyone they don't understand or don't like of being a sociopath. And anyway any behaviour that is antisocial, if that's what you're thinking about, is a behaviour not a diagnosis. And I think this is one of the reasons that sociopathy is perceived by some as a wishy washy label because it might encompass a set of traits that could occur in various different people but which could have very different causes in different individuals. However, I guess if an autistic person has been raised in the kind of environment that could foster sociopathy, then a dual diagnosis might be more likely. But then it might still be unclear what's more down to their autism or due to their environment. I guess it's still really a matter of how these two interact with one another. In my experience moral scrupulosity makes it extremely difficult for me to ever intentionally cause people harm. If you don't have moral scrupulosity it's possible that you could be more sociopathic in some of your behaviour. Basically if you're still unsure, I think that you should seek support from a therapist but I don't really see the point in getting more labels unless you think that would really help you. It's actually a stigma, wheras getting therapy for whatever problems you're having is still a good idea and may help you more than any label could. Especially if you feel that any of your behaviour is very disruptive to yourself and others. Also I think that you have to be an adult- ideally your brain being fully developed and everything- to be given a \u2018diagnosis\u2019 of sociopathy. And I'm guessing you'd benefit more from help than a label that might serve nothing better than making people afraid of you if they aren't already. But maybe you wouldn't have to reveal it to anyone, I'm not sure. My knowledge of this ends here I'm afraid. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. He/she can be a logical reasonable sociopath.  What you mean by being a sociopath is probably someone who ignores general rules that most people accept (morality, rules of interaction, values,...). In that sense, an autistic person that is not well accompanied and socialized can develop interests that can lead them to become hostile to people, whom they can view as a nuisance. To an autistic person, people can easily look as irrational stupid destroyers who respect nothing and have no no understanding of logic. People usually don't see the beauty of the world as autistic people do. They see plain reality where autistic people can see patterns, or simply a fascinating subject. Basically, all that comes back to the fact that an autistic person can easily become a sociopath by :- hating people for being the irrational illogical unpredictable beings they tend to be. (usually because they get hurt by others, sometimes even their simple presence)- not having any empathy for others, thus considering humans as having the same value as a rock. In that case, humans can be hurt or destroyed without any moral problem. (by the way, it's something you can teach, by bringing autistic people in the circle of the human condition. It's easy to see oneself as not human when you are so radically different from EVERYONE else)- developping specific interests and values that do not include humans as important. (for instance, a passion for nuclear bombs can lead an autistic person to work in situations where they don't care about morality. I think that can be qualified as sociopathy. Same thing applies in other fields simply because autistic people tend to develop their own values if the ones around them seem illogical. Most people do not realize how deeply the values a society holds are emotional and built on emotional and illogical constructions.) ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe an autistic person could be a sociopath, but would they even be a threat if they were? Feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t the main threat or strength of a sociopath or psychopath that they are supposedly good at manipulating others? Autistic people don\u2019t have a good grasp of social situations, and we\u2019re limited on how much we can actually \u201clearn\u201d when it comes to social situations. It doesn\u2019t make us deceptive but extremely awkward. People often assume there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d and accuse us of being \u201crude\u201d and maybe even \u201cmean\u201d when we aren\u2019t trying to be that way at all. I would think that if I were to actually try to deceive or hurt other people, I would not only be doing myself a disservice but I also might be doing a disservice to those people who also want to leave good impressions on other people. A sociopath or psychopath, on the other hand, they\u2019re master manipulators. They can do the worst things to you and then charm you back with their charisma and fake warm personalities. When I think of someone like that, I think of the man who beats his wife and then goes to work, maybe as a singer or some kind of career artist, without acting like he\u2019s done anything wrong at all. I might also think of the woman who verbally berates, physically bullies, and emotionally manipulates her husband. I wouldn\u2019t peg someone like that as autistic, because they have too much skill in the social areas. This is one thing I think the uniformed get wrong about those of us on the autism spectrum too much of the time; we are literally not able to understand certain social cues or respond appropriatly in some social situations. We can\u2019t turn it on and off. If we\u2019re accidentally rude to the waitress, we\u2019ll probably accidentally be rude to the person we love. It\u2019s not something we do out of spite or out of not caring; it\u2019s simply because we do not know. An autistic person who stopped caring about social situations period or whether or not they hurt other people would probably be the first to get caught, the first to go to jail, pretty much the first to get punished, period, because we already give people all of the wrong non-verbal signals. It\u2019s a fairly strong incentive to stay on the right side of the law and not hurt other people, and I could see even a person with no actual feelings for other people respecting their own freedom and desire not to be punished enough to try to stay on others\u2019 good side. Maybe I\u2019m biased, but to my knowledge I\u2019ve never met anyone who had problems relating to other people who fell into the category of con-artist or violent manipulative sociopath; they simply lack the skills and knowledge to do things like that. It\u2019s more likely that they would just start avoiding people, or if they decided to try being around people, approach it gradually and learn from their mistakes. There\u2019s no room for deception, regardless of how cruel people can be. To an autistic person, trying to learn how to manipulate someone might be kind of like a kid who doesn\u2019t know how to add or subtract attempting Algebra. You\u2019d be able to spot our mistakes and read our bad intentions right away. ",

You see, the most recent findings of autism reveal that they\u2019re not devoid of feeling, but rather they have so much empathy it can drive them crazy and cause them to ignore the world around them otherwise they\u2019d go nuts with all the guilt. As an autistic person myself (hello!), I can tell you that this is true. It\u2019s incredibly easy for me to place blame upon myself and end up feeling guilty over the most ridiculous things. This is a common autistic problem, because the neurotypical mind doesn\u2019t really have empathy dialled up so radically. There\u2019s a nasty realisation to be had, here, of course. Yes. Unscrupulous NTs and sociopaths alike will abuse autistic people, they\u2019ll use that empathy to exploit them. This is why we become very aware of manipulative people early on, and we\u2019re likely to just shut them out. Neurotypicals use manipulations as part of the unspoken social contracts that make up their intuited interactions with others like them. To an NT, manipulation is simply an aspect of social bargaining. Autistic people are bad at manipulation and have an innate disliking of it. We\u2019re terrible liars, too, because it draws from the same set of tools. It\u2019s why autistic people are so honest and our lack of \u2018fakeness\u2019 can be quite disconcerting to NTs, it can catch them off guard. We\u2019re very open and blunt because we don\u2019t really know any other way to be, we\u2019re not unkind though so often we\u2019ll guard our words very carefully so that we won\u2019t hurt anyone. Sociopaths, on the other hand, excel at manipulation. It\u2019s what they do best. Their mind is designed to excel at the social games that NTs play, that autistic people try not to. Furthermore, a sociopath, unlike an autistic person, feels little to no empathy or guilt. The closest you can get is that they\u2019ll feel sorry for themselves if they get caught. You\u2019ll find communities of sociopaths online who\u2019ll talk about how much they enjoy manipulating empaths because they love seeing what they can get away with. A sociopath is in their oils when they\u2019re manipulating and exploiting people, most of all. Of course, when a sociopath doesn\u2019t get their way, they\u2019re likely to become aggressive, dialling the manipulation up to 11, and really bringing the predator out for all to see. If people start calling them on it, they\u2019re liable to go a bit crazy. They\u2019ll make a big, public display and try and manipulate everyone present, they\u2019ll be trying to play everyone against one another. If an autistic person is confronted, their first instinct is to escape because they can sense the manipulations present and they want no part of it. NTs and sociopaths alike revel in manipulations. Autistic people? Not so much. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve often theorised that there are two spectrums at play here with levels of severity. Autistic spectrum: Extreme <-[Autism]-[Asperger\u2019s]-[Introversion]-> Shallow NT spectrum: Extreme <-[Sociopathy]-[Agentic Extraversion]-[Affiliative Extraversion]-> Shallow This idea has been picking up steam as parts of it are slowly entering into the public consciousness. First of all, the hypothesis that introversion is the \u2018nonclinical\u2019 end of the autistic spectrum [you can read about that here]; The hypothesis that extraversion is split up between agentic and affiliative [you can read about that here]; This study showing that extraverts are much more likely to be unfaithful in relationships, more narcissistic, and display psychopathic traits [you can read about that here]; And this study showing that Internet trolls are extraverts with psychopathic traits [you can read about that here]. I hope these are enough citations to support my hypothesis. As I said, I think it\u2019s a growing realisation. And an interesting one, to be sure. So, yes, autism and sociopathy are opposites, but it goes deeper even than that. ",

            "answer_text": "There's been nothing indicating sociopathy/psychopathy is more or less common among autistic people. There's been no known case of an autistic person suffering from psychopathy. So the ultimate answer is: We don't know. However, if we were to assume that they are neither more common or more rare together than separate, as about 1/70 are autistic and 1/150 are psychopaths, we'd see about 1 person in 10500 be both psychopathic and autistic. Some of the traits of autism may be similar to some of the traits of psychopathy, but most traits are completely different. As Nell Rus says, we can have a hard time with social subtext and body language, while psychopaths are generally excellent at those things. We may have a hard time empathizing, but mostly because we have a hard time figuring out how others feel, unlike with psychopathy where it seems they can understand what others feel but are still not empathic. I will object to Nell Rus' description on that autistic people won't go out of their way to harm others. We are people, and like most other people we are different from each others and we're also not constant; just like allistics we change over our lives. Autistics are not more prone to go out of our way to harm others, but like, it's just not a trait related to autism either way. There are mean people with autism, there are peaceful people with autism. And even if one isn't a mean person, sometimes anyone can get vengeful or vindictive under the right (wrong) circumstances. I have yet to meet an autistic that doesn't like cats, though.  But, again, we have nothing indicating anything about this. It's a rather strange question, honestly. ",

            "answer_text": "Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by difficulties communicating and processing emotions. Because of this, in particular cases, especially with high functioning autism, (to somebody that doesn\u2019t understand them) the symptoms can mimic symptoms expressed by sociopaths. When it comes to physiologically induced mental disorders, you either have them or you don\u2019t, they're not aquired. It may be possible for a person with ASD to also be born a sociopath, but any person you may believe is a sociopath that has autism is most likely a construct of misunderstanding. An example of this is myself. Many times I'm emotionally expressionless and am very blunt with people. I acknowledge only facts and don\u2019t let emotions could my judgment and form a bias. However, at other times, I'm very creative and genuinely emotionally receptive, possess empathy, and experience the same emotional patterns as normally functioning humans. Right now I'm speaking in a calculated manner with little emotion, but at a future point in time I will be very friendly, funny, and more casual. Adequately responding in accordance with social constructs seems to be a great difficulty in people with autism spectrum disorders and thusly symptoms can occur at what can be \u201cimproper\u201d times.

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. My first reaction is to say no. Autism basically blocks you from seeing another person point of view or perspective. Then you don\u2019t even realize their is one, you only understand or see things that you hyper focus on it a sense. Sociopath has no empathy for other people or care to know what they feel or how they see things, they only feel things there way. This is kinda by choice and more of a personality disorder then it is a brain disorder and caused by your personality which is based off of your environmental and some genetic predispositions but mostly how you choose to react and look at things. But, we all have a capability of going there. Take a person who\u2019s a prison perole. It\u2019s as if their soul is gone almost or did when you meet them and they got out the prison after 20 years or more. It\u2019s a harsh environment they came from and they can read you better than a psychologist could. Of someone coming back from constant combat rotations in the military. I heard they have to work at it to feel empathy for other people again not to say their sociopathic. But sociopathic you can cure I believe or treat. Autism will be there for life. Psychopaths are more genetic disorders than sociopath is a personality disorder. But just cause your a psychopath or a sociopath doesn\u2019t mean your going harm people or have intention too. You just don\u2019t have empathy for other people or it\u2019s hard to understand how they feel or see their perspective or even care to know. ",

Most people with ASD have a sense of morality it a sense of \u201dright-and-wrong\u201d some see this as a sense of justice that is partly true due to the fact that a autistic person's morality like \u201cwhat's fair is fair\u201d one person getting jail things for theft while another person simply gets a fine, would be a good example of literal injustice. So most people with autism have a conscience. Now that being said they're can people that can break from this and but have a conscience and yes it is possible for someone with autism to develop a lack of conscience. However simply being antisocial, or appear to be apathic (the appearance of lacking empathy) doesn't count. Many people with ASD may display antisocial behavior, usually due to the fact that most autistics don't know how to interact or it can be a self defence measure. ",
