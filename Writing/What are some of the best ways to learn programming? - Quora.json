            "answer_text": "\u201cI will kill you if you repeat this conversation,\u201d Shlomo told me. \u201cI think this web thing is going to be big.\u201d This was 1995. \u201cI want to undercut all of the stores on the street and sell diamonds direct to people at cheaper prices.\u201d Shlomo was the wholesaler to all the retail shops in NYC\u2019s diamond district. \u201cBut my name can\u2019t be anywhere on the site at all or else these guys here,\u201d and he waved his hand around his head, \u201cwill kill me\u201d I had $0 in the bank. I knew nothing about diamonds. He showed me the \u201c4 Cs\u201d, he showed me what a GIA certificate was. He showed me his spreadsheet of all the diamonds he had. I told him we could make a website where people could search on price, any of the 4Cs, and then I would generate a GIA certificate that would look like the diamond and people would be able to buy directly. I would also make the content explaining the 4Cs and why each was important. \u2014-  \u2014- \u201cHow long will it take?\u201d \u201cAbout a month,\u201d I said. But I had no clue. I had no idea how I was going to do this. If I did this in C or C++ it would take me too much time. At the time there were no tools for making websites. No Wordpress. No Python. No MySQL. Nothing. Everything had to be created from scratch. And I had no idea how to generate graphics, like the certificate, on the fly. But I had been living in New York for over a year and I was living on a foam futon in Astoria, Queens with no other belongings and I wanted to make some money. He was going to pay me $17,500 cash. I would be rich.  When I got to NYC I had an undergrad degree in Computer Science and had spent two years in grad school for Computer Science. After I got kicked out of grad school (another story) I then spent three years as a programmer. I had put in my 10,000 hours of programming. I thought I was good. When I got a job offer at HBO to work as a \u201cjunior analyst programmer\u201d for $40,000 a year, I took it! I was so happy.  HBO felt like the real world. New York City felt like the real world. I bought a suit. I wanted my co-workers to like me so I would go down and talk when they took their cigarette breaks. But I was awful at my job. I couldn\u2019t do anything. It was so much harder than an academic environment. Whenever I asked \u201chow can I do this?\u201d my boss would say, \u201cif you want to work here you have to learn how to figure things out without asking.\u201d One time, only about a week after I started, he came into my cubicle. I had an 8x8 cubicle. He breathed loudly and took up the entire cubicle. My boss, Ken, spoke loudly enough so that everyone could hear. I turned red almost instantly. I was hoping he would quiet down. He said, \u201cYou are not doing well. But we want to give you a chance. We want you tp take a month or two of remedial programming classes.\u201d He gave me a pamphlet and told me to sign up. Everyone in the cubicles around me had all quieted down. Nobody was moving. I knew everyone was listening. I could\u2019ve reached over right then and grabbed Ken\u2019s neck and twisted it until he died. I thought about doing it while he was talking. If I were in prison I\u2019d have an 10x10 cell and my own toilet. Here I was stuck in my 8x8 cubicle and I was being punished.  I took the remedial classes. I got up to speed. But when I wanted to take this side job to build this website I felt a bit overwhelmed. I was afraid to fail. I didn\u2019t really know how to do it when I said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d But I wanted that $17,500. It was more money than I had ever seen before.  I called Chet. Chet was the best programmer I knew. He worked at IBM but we had been in school together. One time, from his apartment, he networked all of IBM\u2019s computers together so they would have the bandwidth to stream the Olympics live on the web. I think it was the first video streaming. Chet and I would hang out and he told me about the projects he was working on. I told him all of that was BS. \u201cJust learn the Internet,\u201d I said. And he did. He ended his career 23 years later at Google, a very rich man. [ Chet\u2019s latest:  ] One time he did me a favor that saved a business I had started. But that was a long time later. In 2008. I offered to give him a piece of the company in return for what he did. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease Chet, I owe you.\u201d \u201cConsider the debt repaid that I owe you.\u201d \u201cWhat debt?\u201d \u201cYou told me to switch to the Internet. Thanks.\u201d But that was 12 years later. Now I was stuck. How could I quickly program this diamond dealer\u2019s website. I didn\u2019t want to use C to go through his excel spreadsheet and I wasn\u2019t sure how to make the graphics on the fly. He said, \u201cNo no no no. What are you doing? Use PERL.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that.\u201d I was lying down on my foam mattress. I had a phone and a 3 inch black and white TV in the apartment that didn\u2019t work. Every night, if I got up to go to the bathroom, I had to jump up and down before opening the door. That would make all the cockroaches disappear before I opened the door. \u201cJust trust me. Get O\u2019Reilly\u2019s book on mastering PERL. Get it right now. Call me later.\u201d I got the PERL book. About eight hours later I called Chet. \u201cYou were right,\u201d I told him. \u201cPERL was the way to do it.\u201d \u201cDid you read the book?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m done with the whole project. The website is finished.\u201d  Many years later Chet stopped talking to me. I wrote an article saying no war could be justified. He didn\u2019t agree with me. He unfriended me and we never spoke again. I remember one time he stayed with me in grad school. I gave him a novel to read. \u201cCockpit\u201d by Jerzy Kosinski. I\u2019m remembering this because I\u2019m rereading the book today. We were once close friends.  I took the PERL book and here\u2019s what I did and here\u2019s how I learn every programming language I\u2019ve ever learned since 1984. It\u2019s sort of how I learn everything I\u2019ve had to learn ever since then. The key for any learning is: make it easy as possible, then get more difficult. SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT - Download whatever you need to do to program, compile, and run a basic \u201cHello, world\u201d program.DOWNLOAD SOME SIMPLE PROGRAMS YOU CAN MODIFYPLAY. Make changes in the programs. Simple changes. See if it works. Then change back. Then Play again, a little more aggressively. Use the book as reference.That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the way I\u2019ve learned every programming language before or since. And the same technique applies to learning everything. PERL turned out to be perfect for what I needed to do. I set up my environment. Started playing with some simple programs. When I made mistakes I used the book as reference. Eventually I modified the programs enough to make Shlomo\u2019s website.  Years later I wrote software to make predictions in the stock market. It used a new language I had never used before. I took a sample program that looked for certain patterns in stock prices. Without knowing the language at all, I changed the patterns. Whenever I made an error I would look up the specifics of the language until I didn\u2019t make errors. The more I modified programs, the more I learned about the language. These programs became the basis of my first hedge fund. This is the key: get a REFERENCEset up your ENVIRONMENT so you can program. This is the key part. Now you can play, program, learn.DOWNLOAD basic programsMODIFY themSTART MODIFYING to get closer to your final goal. MAKE THE TARGET CLOSER Tony Robbins once told me how he taught Marines how to shoot guns better. \u201cI was in my early 20s and they asked me to teach these elite Marines how to shoot better. I had never even shot a gun,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I watched them for awhile and then I had an idea.\u201d \u201cI put the target very close to each of the shooters. Maybe three feet away. They all shot bullseyes. \u201cThen I moved the targets another foot away. They all shot bullseyes. And so on. I kept moving the target further away until it was all the way on the other side of the room. \u201cThey told me they had never seen a class of Marines learn how to shoot faster then in that class.\u201d He looked at me and pounded the table to emphasize. \u201cAlways bring the target as close as possible. Start with that whenever you have to learn something. Then after you master it at that distance, move it slowly further away.\u201d  (from my slideshare: \u201cTen things I learned from Tony Robbins\u201d) \u2014\u2014 I delivered the website. Shlomo was very happy. \u201cSo fast?\u201d He was almost suspicious. But everything worked. He launched the website a few days later. It still exists (although has since been rewritten I think). diamondcutters.com. He gave me the $17,500, in cash, in a paper bag. I took it immediately to The Chelsea Hotel on 23rd Street and paid for a year in advance to live there. Shlomo was my first client. I started a business making websites. It changed my life. It began a period that was the worst decade of my life. Life was stress-free and simple before I started being an entrepreneur. Many years later, Shlomo died in a plane accident over Namibia. He was looking for uncut diamonds and crashed. \u2014  \u2014 Shlomo had a secretary that I had a crush on. She had a big red wine stain birth scar that stretched from the corner of her eye, across the landscape of her cheek, and touched the end of her smile. I would stare at it when she spoke to me. I would try to make her laugh. To see that wine-stained smile. I wanted to lick the scar right off of her face. ",

            "answer_text": "You can learn to code in so many different ways now that we have something called the internet.  When I was in the 8th grade, I was introduced to something called HTML in my computer class. It was incredible. My friends and I used to have competitions on who could make the coolest website. We were beginners having the time of our lives! This led me to learning new languages that can make my site look awesome like CSS and Javascript. The thing you have to know is that, generally, there is no best way to learn programming. It\u2019s all about you. If you want some of the paths you can choose from, here: You can go to college, get a CS degree, and learn how to code from your CS knowledge. This is the most common path but if you\u2019re older, can\u2019t afford this, or just don\u2019t want to go to college, there are still many other ways.You can go to a coding bootcamp. This method is becoming very popular nowadays and people are choosing to go this route over an expensive CS degree. Some famous coding bootcamps include App Academy, Make School, Ironhack, Flatiron School, etc.MOOCs. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Massive Open Online Courses, they are online courses used to teach yourself a certain skill. You can learn any programming language with a bit of practice and a MOOCs. They are incredibly cheap and even some are free. You can take intro to CS on Coursera for absolutely nothing.Building projects. This method can be a really fast way to get a great understanding of programming. And the best part is you will be engaged in the whole process of learning! Say you want to make an Android app that gives users the opportunity to find a mentor in a specific field. You will want to make your idea a reality and do whatever it takes to build it as long as your committed. This gives you drive and inspire you to writing code. As you\u2019ve seen above, there are many ways you can get into programming. But at the end of the day, it comes down to one thing. Writing code. If you are passionate about becoming a software engineer or programming for the fun of it, the only way you can become good at code is by writing code. Think about it this way, if you want to learn to swim you can\u2019t just watch videos and read about how to become a swimmer. You must take action! Building a skill is a matter of practice. Practicing with a growth mindset will make you unstoppable. Practice. Practice. Practice. I cannot stress this enough. The people that actually become software engineers don\u2019t become software engineers by just reading about the perks of working at Google or Facebook although it can be tempting. They practice. And when the going gets tough, they don\u2019t give up. Why would you give up if you\u2019re in it to win it. There is a saying that goes \u201cwhen the going gets tough, the tough get going.\u201d Learning to code isn\u2019t easy. Why do you think software engineering jobs pay so well. It\u2019s not a stroll in the park. You\u2019ve got to know your stuff. If you persist and keep going when it gets hard, you\u2019ll make. That is the difference between success and failure. So if you really want to become a programmer, keep on coding. Never give up. Never. Never. And I mean NEVER.  And if you make it past the obstacles, you\u2019ve now got a whole new perspective of the world. Hello World :) ",
