            "answer_text": "Well, Harry Potter is pretty mixed up. Wizards need wands, what is up with that, when actually we see young wizards, sometimes older ones, and every other magical being use magic without them. Wands choose the user and can\u2019t be used properly by someone else - even though we repeatedly see wands taken and used by others, even the owners enemies, quite effectively. Spells can be cast just knowing the right word even if you don\u2019t have a clue what the spell is meant to do - how are there not massive disasters from this. Superlative magics exist, that can put things beyond detection, except those other magics that seemingly easily detect. Classic unresistable force against immovable objects. For example a cloak of invisibility that can hide the user from even death himself, except that a simple magic map held by a couple of junior students can overcome it. etc etc etc ",
