            "answer_text": "As a stand-up comic, I do a lot of storytelling, and while I won't say I am a great storyteller, I can share some things I've learned. I also have a lot of bad habits I can recommend against.  In general, we tell stories to entertain, inform or amuse. Every good story has an arc. That means it should have classical storytelling elements like a setup (setting the scene and introducing the story); rising and falling action (a description of what happened with key moments and events emphasized), and a conclusion (the outcome, and a lesson learned, if there is one.) You can read a complicated explanation of this here: Three-act structure Your story should be \"tight.\" Avoid the temptation to give a long, meandering narrative. Think about what's essential to the understanding of the story (and why you are telling it) and eliminate the rest. For example, if you're telling someone about something that occurred at Starbucks, there is no need to say \"I went to the Starbucks on 23rd. You know the one? I usually go to the one on Madison but I thought the line would be too long. You know, the one we went to?\" Say, instead, \"I was at Starbucks.\" Even as you begin the story, think about where it is going. The end of your story is, in a way, the punchline, even if it isn't funny. It's OK to tell the story in way that sets up suspense about the outcome. That's good storytelling, and draws people in. But avoid the temptation to manipulate your audience by withholding too much of the story and drawing it out to build suspense.  Although most of your friends and family are probably quite understanding, you'll know right away if there are \"flaws\" in your story. Listen carefully for signs you are going on too long like \"Yeah? Yeah? What happened then?\" Some people will even say \"Get to the point!\"  Use these cues for two purposes. First, you can use them to improve the story as you are telling it. This is your cue to wrap it up. Don't ignore this. Figure out a few details you can drop and deliver the key points of the story. You should also remember these points and refine your story for the next time. Because you will tell it again. If you really want your stories to be great, keep adjusting them based on your experiences telling them. All comics tune and refine their jokes constantly, sometimes changing them after every telling. Also, I have had jokes where the audience laughed at the \"wrong\" time, and not at the time I intended them to. That helped me identify what other people find more universally funny about the story and to get outside of my own perceptions. Finally, I would suggest you not worry too much. You're probably a much better storyteller than you give yourself credit for. Even the fact that you want to be sure you are better at it suggests this. Have others given you reason to believe you are not a good storyteller? Don't think too hard about being a good storyteller (despite my advice and what you read here), and just be yourself -- intelligent, considerate and interesting. Those who don't enjoy listening to your stories will lose out, not you. And finally, finally, my answer is way too long. And now you see another of my storytelling deficiencies. ",

            "answer_text": "Most great story tellers are empathetic, passionate people who own the stories they tell. By owning the stories, they captivate their audiences and bring authenticity to the plot. While telling the story, they do not think about themselves, how the audience views them or what are the right words to use. Often, a great story teller has a touching piece they want to share. They may fumble for words in the beginning when speaking to a new audience, but once they have started, the story takes them over and what you hear is only a great story! To become a great storyteller, practice, practice, practice. Tell stories about everyday things, repeat stories you have heard or read. Tell stories to the people you live with and those you know. Write your stories and soon, you will find that there is a story in almost everything around. I had been telling stories for so long, I did not even realize that I had developed the annoying habit of seeing a story in every story I heard, until a friend told me so. I still remember stories related to everything people share with me, but I keep them to myself for an appropriate time or not. I used to worry about making mistakes when telling my stories, but I realized that I have been telling stories for so long, it is no longer difficult to piece together any story that I have and tell it passionately to my group. It can be both true and fictitious, but I still tell it well and with passion. ",

However, I will vote for \u2018attention gripping\u2019 element as the most crucial one in modern story telling. Why so and why I use the words \u2018modern times\u2019? Today your audience has no time. If they happen to find your tale you are lucky. If they choose to look beyond the first line you are luckier. Hereafter, it\u2019s your job to catch and hold attention. You have to surprise your audience, give them twists and turns and jolts and above all a shocking climax. Besides, you have to have a persona. Never forget that you create a unique audience which is interested in the style and niche that you excel in. So you have to write for them. At the next position, I place the connectivity factor. Ask yourself this before you publish or tell your tale: DOES MY STORY CONNECT TO A PERSON CONSTITUTING MY AUDIENCE? You will get an answer and if you find your tale deficient in this, go for a tweak.
