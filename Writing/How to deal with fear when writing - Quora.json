            "answer_text": "I've been writing professionally (day job) for some years now, and I estimate that I've written thousands of pages for websites, whitepapers, articles, etc. I wrote my first novel almost a decade ago. Currently, I'm working on my 8th novel, and you know what? I get sick to my stomach every single time I start something new. I mean, feel like I'm going to puke my guts up afraid, and this voice in my head keeps saying, \"What were you thinking? This is too hard. You'll never be able to pull this off. This is a mess. Too hard. Too hard. Too hard.\" That voice gets louder as the day goes on, and the more things I use to try to get it out of my head (procrastination), the louder and more present it becomes. I've found one way of getting it to shut its mouth, and that's by getting up really, really early. Like 4AM early. The more worried I am that I'm not going to be able to pull something off, the earlier I get up to do just that. What I've found is that critical voice has to wake up, and the more time I waste, the more urgent it becomes. So, I just don't give that left-brained critical part of me time to wake up. I roll out of bed, make a cup of coffee, light a candle on my desk and go to work. Because at 4AM, I don't care if it's good or not. I don't care if it'll ever sell, or if my client will want multiple revisions. All I care about is getting the words on the page, and that, in my experience, is all that matters. Find a way to shut that critic up, and get the words on the page. ",

            "answer_text": "I disagree with this suggestion: Don't write about anything until you know what you're talking about. I was timid about writing a blog at one point, and a writer I know made a point I will never forget: What is it going to break?  What he meant was, so you have a pile of words on a piece of paper. So what? Nothing. Nothing whatsoever has happened yet, except some paper has some ink on it.  Create a safe place for yourself to write. If you like notebooks, get a basic one, one that's inexpensive enough you don't mind \"wasting\" the paper. Otherwise, pixels are pretty cheap, too.  Now write. I assume if you're asking you think you have something to say. Say it to a blank piece of paper (or screen). Paper is infinitely patient. My suggestion, however, is to get going and spill the words out as fast as you can write, type or think of them.  Do not worry if they aren't right, or aren't right yet. You can edit later, but only if you have words on the page. If you don't like the result, don't show it to anyone. Burn it, if you would rather, or simply bury it. I have an entire novel which I would not print out to prop up the too-short leg of a sofa, but by writing it, I learned what it was like. The three novels I've written since then aren't great, but they're a whole lot better, and were far easier to write, than the first.  Or, if you think there is something of value in there, edit and rewrite it to your heart's content. This is the important part: you decide whether and what to publish, whether to show it to one person whom you trust, whether to put your name on it or not if it goes online. Separate the process of composing the words from the act of publishing them, or deciding to. One topic you might explore, if you dare, is what you find so intimidating about writing. Are you afraid of criticism, or looking bad? Are you afraid of being controversial? ",
