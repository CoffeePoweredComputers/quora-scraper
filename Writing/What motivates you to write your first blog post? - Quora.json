            "answer_text": "It always has to be about the passion, about something that moves me enough to write. You don't have to use big words, but if the passion is there it really comes through and people respond to it. For me, it's about what I see around me in life. It can be about people or places or issues that are close to my heart. Then I just get the urge to share my feelings or points of view with others, so we can talk about them and debate ideas. It's been a long time now but I think my first post was about the homeless in Singapore. ",
