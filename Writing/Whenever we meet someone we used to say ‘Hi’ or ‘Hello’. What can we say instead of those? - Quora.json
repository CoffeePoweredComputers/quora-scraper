Instead of immediately saying \u201chi\u201d or \u201chello\u201d, present yourself. \u201cMy name is _____, and you are?\u201d Remember to smile when you say this to look friendly if not they will think you are just a creepy stalker guy. If you are meeting a friend, you could say his name. Let\u2019s say I see my friend Lucy in the park, I\u2019ll go \u201cLucy!!!\u201d. If you need more, by searching on the thesaurus, some synonyms of hello are greetings, howdy, bonjour, what\u2019s up, hey\u2026 There are a lot of them. You can just pick. :) ",
