            "answer_text": "I have. Twice. To the same girl. The first time I saw her was in 1964 when her family moved across town and she joined our school, and my class. I only caught a fleeting glimpse of her and her wildly, curly, red hair before she was sat at the other end of the row I was seated at. I was captivated! I had not turned 14 yet, and she turned out to be 3 months younger. My first \u2018love letter\u2019 was a hastily scribbled notes; passed serupticiouly, hand to hand, across that room. In it, I said she was beautiful and asked her to be my girl. By the following day \u2014 she was. We were an item for almost a year. After which we went on our own, separate ways. One afternoon, in very late 1967, I was just leaving my work place after a 6am to 2pm day shift at a steel works in Northamptonshire, England, when I, literally, bumped into her younger brother. He was going into the complex to start his afternoon shift. The same thing occurred the next day. But, this time we had time to chat. He told me that he had mentioned seeing the previous day, to his sister, and she had said, \u2018I still think he is cute.\u2019 (That would be me, folks!). That afternoon, I scribbled my second \u2018love letter\u2019 on a 4 inch by 3 inch scrap of notepaper. It contained about four lines, including, \u2018I think you are cute too\u2019, and a request to meet for a coffee. We met, and dated for a while. In October the following year \u2014 1968 \u2014 we were married! A couple of months ago, in October 2018, we celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary! My wife carried that last \u2018love letter\u2019 constantly, for many years, until it finally disintegrated. Fortunately, our love marriage survived. Love letters, eh? Can't beat them!  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes yes yes. There's something about the ink being plastered on the white pages - as if it's almost laying your thoughts permanently. My then boyfriends never demanded but I did it more out of pleasure and for the sheer joy of writing letters. My first boyfriend told me it was like as if he was reading essays ;) and they never read beyond comic books so I'm glad at least I made them read a little more. Not just like love letters but I used to write to my family. I studied in a boarding school and often we write to each other. I love reading letters more even if the same words were sent over a text or an email. I treasure mummy's letters with her beautiful symmetrical hand writings. I may still have a traditional approach towards romance but letter writing is a beautiful art.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ah , young love in its finest form is love notes , is it not ? In Elementary School , I had a crush on one of the cutest girls in my grade . Being young and naive I would daydream about what to say to her all the time . Eventually I gathered up the courage to approach her with a note and a box of chocolates , asking her to be mine . My most heart breaking moment in dealing with the opposite sex came when she opened the letter , laughed in my face as she ripped it , then threw the chocolate in the trash . As a child , I thought my life was over . I poured all of my young emotions into this letter of admiration only to have it dismissed like an old handkerchief . I didn\u2019t have enough money to buy more chocolate , Especially since my parents were middle class citizens and were barely making ends meet . It took me two weeks to save up the money to buy the chocolate and she threw it away within seconds . I guess what hurt the most was I put a lot of time and effort into a gift that would never be appreciated . After that event , I never wrote another love letter again \u2026 ",
