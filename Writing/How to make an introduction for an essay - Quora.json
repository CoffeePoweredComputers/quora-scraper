            "answer_text": "Introductions can be tricky. Because the introduction is the first portion of your essay that the reader encounters, the stakes are fairly high for your introduction to be successful. A good introduction presents a broad overview of your topic and your thesis, and should convince the reader that it is worth their time to actually read the rest of your essay. Below are some tips that will make writing an introduction a little less daunting, and help us all to write essays that don\u2019t make our professors want to bang their heads against the wall. Start your introduction broad, but not too broad. When I first started writing formal essays, I didn\u2019t really know how broad to go with my intros. A brief paragraph on Hamlet would suddenly include irrelevant details about Shakespeare\u2019s childhood, then grow out to be a history of Western literature, and then a history of the universe itself. Do not write an introduction like this; this kind of intro is confusing and makes the reader wonder where exactly you\u2019re going with your essay. Your introduction should provide the reader with a sense of what they should expect out of your essay, not to expound upon every piece of knowledge ever developed by man. Go ahead and start relatively broad, then narrow to your thesis, but make sure you\u2019re still on topic.Provide relevant background, but don\u2019t begin your true argument. It\u2019s fine to give a bit of context to your essay in the introduction, but the real meat of your argument should be located in your body paragraphs. A good test to see if information should go in a body or introductory paragraph is to ask yourself a few questions. Is this providing context or evidence? Does this introduce my argument, or try to prove it? True evidence or proof deserves a body paragraph. Context and background most likely belong in your introduction.Provide a thesis. The majority of the time, your thesis, or main argument, should occur somewhere towards the end of your introduction. It is a typical convention to put your thesis as the last sentence of your first paragraph. My personal opinion is that it can sometimes be awkward to shove your thesis in one specific place if it doesn\u2019t necessarily fit, but if your thesis works in that position, that is the best place for it. That being said, if you absolutely can\u2019t include your thesis in that location, go ahead and stick it somewhere else.Provide only helpful, relevant information. Anecdotes can be an interesting opener to your essay, but only if the anecdote in question is truly relevant to your topic. Are you writing an essay about Maya Angelou? An anecdote about her childhood might be relevant, and even charming. Are you writing an essay about safety regulations in roller coasters? Go ahead and add an anecdote about a person who was injured while riding a roller coaster. Are you writing an essay about Moby Dick? Perhaps an anecdote about that time your friend read Moby Dick and hated it is not the best way to go. The same is true for statistics, quotes, and other types of information about your topic.Try to avoid clich\u00e9s. Some types of introductions may have once been successful, but have been used so often that they have become tired and clich\u00e9d. Starting your essay with a definition is a good example of one of these conventions. At this point, starting with a definition is a bit boring, and will cause your reader to tune out.Don\u2019t feel pressured to write your intro first. Sometimes it can be difficult to figure out exactly what information is relevant to your introduction until you\u2019ve written the piece itself. Personally, I find that my writer\u2019s block is always strongest when writing the introduction. If you are having trouble with your intro, feel free to write some, or all, of your body paragraphs, and then come back to it. You might find it a bit easier to write your introduction once you\u2019re more comfortable with the essay as a whole.Convince the reader that your essay is worth reading. Your reader should finish the introduction thinking that the essay is interesting or has some sort of relevance to their lives. A good introduction is engaging; it gets the audience thinking about the topic at hand and wondering how you will be proving your argument. Good ways to convince your reader that your essay is worthwhile is to provide information that the reader might question or disagree with. Once they are thinking about the topic, and wondering why you hold your position, they are more likely to be engaged in the rest of the essay.",

            "answer_text": "Ok, this question has variant answers depending on the type ofnessay, level of essay designated (HS, Early collegiate, advanced collegiate and beyond), format- MLA, APA, Chicago, Turabian-, and the type of thesis desired by the student and/or instructor. However, a few good rules to keep in mind are that the intro is literally your (the author's) presentation of the start to a perspective of a topic, the fundamentals to understanding how and why that perspective can work need to be lain out (terms, new twists to ideas, ideas in general, and RELEVANCE), the thesis (argument) needs to be lain out, and TRANSITIONS. Everyone seems to forget about transitions, but they create the flow and integrity of the paragraphs and inter-paragraph cohesiveness. Starting the intro you need to ask what and why is the point to this topic? Ask this over and over again until you have hit q&a bedrock. When you have a strong, relevant point, that will be your thesis. The phrasing will be bent to suit the phrasing of the instructor\u2019s question, but there are two primary means to do such: the three prong thesis and the universal thesis. The three prong (or point) will be where you develop 3 key evidentiary supports to prove your thesis, present it in a 1, 2, and 3 prove the metaphoric imagery in Hills like White Elephants remains crucial to the understanding of the X theme. Or The universal thesis would be simply The metaphoric imagery in Hills like White Elephants remains crucial to the understanding of the X theme. The 1, 2, 3 provides a road map to your 3 body paragraphs but also tips off the reader to the evidence. The universal thesis allows for more variable but may lead the author down a self-inflictes rabbit hole. From this point you need to lead into the first body paragraph. Creating a transition SENTENCE is preferable to the generic transition words (firstly, secondly, lastly, etc) where the conceptions of the general intro is interwoven into the specifics of the first paragraph, thus creating an interlocking written structure for the remainder of the paper as this process will be repeated for the second and third paragraphs, relying upon the previous paragraph. I hope this helps. ",
