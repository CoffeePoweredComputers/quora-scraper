            "answer_text": "Most of the answers are incomplete, as only one image in visible. People did not see two other images. It is a Hindu spell/mantra , written using Devanagari Script and Sanskrit Language. \"Om Namah Shivay\" \u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f This mantra is chanted while worshiping Lord Shiva. It is also called Panchakshari Mantra. Means the mantra containing five letters. Actually, \u0950  (Om/Aum) is a mystical  symbols used very widely by Hindus. None of the mythological book, mantras and any form of prayer or offering can be considered complete without using \u0950.  In this mantra,  \u0950  is preceding and has no meaning. Infact, saying that it has no meaning, is just avoiding to write a long answer. \u0950  has a very detailed meaning and importance of same can't be understood by people with intellect like me. This is a belief in Hinduism. The most popular meaning is when three most prominent Gods (Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh; i.e. Creator, Preserver and Destroyer) unite into one entity then what we can see is called \u0950. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om Now comes Panchakshari Mantra, \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f (Namah Shivay). Namah is the  act of saluting  and Shivay represent the name of Lord Shiva (The Destroyer). He is considered most powerful of the three. Om Namah Shivaya Concludingly it means, We/I salute Lord Shiva.  And most importantly, it is not Arabic, it's Devanagri only, on the top you have taken correct picture. Devanagri script has a horizontal bar above it's letters. Images are corectly clicked.  Hope it help ",
