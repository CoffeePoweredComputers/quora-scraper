            "answer_text": "I am complicated. I am a short girl with lots of issues. I am a former foster child and now adopted child. I am almost a legal adult who is scared of being on my own and fully responsible for myself. I am stunted mentally. Sometimes I act like a little kid and will throw fits. This is because my brain hasn\u2019t fully grown and developed to be where it should be completely due to my past traumatic experiences. I play mind games with myself and my mom even when I don't mean to. At times I will hate her and push her away, and other times I will need her desperately and be super sweet. I am overweight with low self esteem. I am not dumb, but I am also not smart. I am a big sister to two sisters. I love both of them, but I have a stronger devotion to my youngest sister because she is so young, beautiful and innocent. The other one I still love, but she went with me through foster care and experienced the abuse with me so we take out our anger on each other and sometimes abuse each other (mostly with our words). We always make up, but I hate it. I am not respected by anyone. To everyone else, I am a joke which infuriates me. I am someone who wants to be taken seriously. I am a hopeless romantic who has never had a someone else, but I am waiting patiently for my \u201cone true love\u201d. I have anger issues and a nasty temper, but only with my family. I have no issues outside of my home. I am a good student. I am lonely because I have no real close friends. I would be the bestest best friend to whoever would want me. I am understanding and empathetic to those who are broken and hurting. I am a strong willed, but passionate person who\u2019s only dream is to help people. At times, I am shallow and desire popularity or fame. But other times I look into the deeper meaning of life and only desire to be happy in my lifetime. I am unstable emotionally and am determined to be the best freaking mom to my future kids one day. I am someone who lost my child innocence too early and put on a hard exterior in order to protect myself. I am judgmental of others and hypocritical. I don\u2019t even know myself or understand why I do things the way I do. I am complicated. ",
