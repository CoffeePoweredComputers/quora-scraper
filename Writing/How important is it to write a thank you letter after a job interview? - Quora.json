            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important, and (probably) can\u2019t hurt your chances of succeeding in the interview. Think of a thank you email as an opportunity to show how you would interact on the job, and a way of showing interest. To do this well, remember to ask for an itinerary of the people you will be meeting, or at least write their names down. Do\u2019s: Do send it within 24 hours (shows your timeliness and follow through)Express your interest in the job, and why you think you\u2019re a matchAddress any mistakes that happened in the interview, or a question that you missed (e.g. I thought more about that design problem after the interview, and here is the solution I\u2019ve come up with\u2026etc etc.)Send a separate email to each person you met (ask the Recruiter for their emails if you don\u2019t have them)Be specific and reference something you talked about with each personKeep it short and sweet. A paragraph is enough.Ask what next steps will be. (You should ask in the interview, but if you haven\u2019t\u2026this would be a good time!)Check your spelling and grammarDont\u2019s: Don\u2019t overstate your interest in the job and inadvertently appear desperate for an offerDon\u2019t ask for a specific salary or job title (find out if they like you first)Don\u2019t send a thank you note expressing interest in the role, if you don\u2019t feel the position is a good fit for you. Simply thank them for their time and then bow out if/when they follow up with you.Don\u2019t leave out any interviewers. If you met them, you should thank them. If it was a short meeting, it\u2019s OK to ask the Recruiter or the hiring manager to pass your thanks along.It takes a bit of time to add this extra touch, but will also help you to stand out. The hiring manager and the recruiting group likely take significant time to schedule you, and showing appreciation will make their efforts feel valued. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! It is really important to send a thank you email/card after a job interview if you are really interested in the position. It never hurts you, it only adds more gains to your image. To me, this is an opportunity to separate yourself from the rest of the other candidates. If you follow up with the recruiter as well as the interviewers with a thank you note, you will be already ahead of some of the other candidates because you are showing a sense of interest and consideration. To help you with this, my advice is to first jot down the names of the people who interviewed you and then afterwards, send them a thank you note. You could send them an email or a personalized thank you card. Overall, the objective is to show the interviewer you are interested in the position and appreciate their time. Be genuine about your message as well. Feel free to go here to find out more about this subject: http://www.myinterviewinsider.com/interviewthankyouletter/ Here is an example of a thank you email that you can customize to fit your situation: Thank you (insert interviewer name) for your time and consideration of me for the role of (list job here).
