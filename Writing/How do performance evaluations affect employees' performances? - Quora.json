            "answer_text": "Things that would affect employee performance. The way you evaluate, clear, concise or dependent on supervisor prejudices. oh all gujjus get a 10% and the rest 5% :)The way you present the end result, as a cold \u201cAverage\u201d or detailed report on how the employee can improve. Bell curve is the easiest morale killer.Frequency of the evaluation, annual evaluations are a definate NO. Try monthly instead. oh now you come to me to tell me I suck when its increment time :)If evaluations are linked to money are invariably fail as there is nothing else that matters when quality of life is on the line. Disconnect evaluations from increments.Transparency, can the employee evaluate his supervisor as his supervisor evaluates him? How did you calculate the scores and why? Are things open to discussion?Measurement scale that you used to evaluate performance, was this clarified at the time when the employee joined or are you just springing it up on him now when its time to pay up :)Is the employee truly engaged in the effort or is he a fringe player who was never brought into the team and never listened to, be ready for a venting :)Cloud based appraisal softwares are super cheap and there are 100s available cheap. Data is all you have on your side :) ",

            "answer_text": "In my brief 2 year experience at an American company's overseas office, I have been evaluated twice- rated 4/5 each time. Being close to some of my colleagues who received a 2/5, I have realized the marked differences. While I am fully aware that the company recognizes and appreciates my contributions, it is obvious that on the other end of the spectrum, people don't want to do anything special or meaningful for the organization.  My motivation skyrockets each passing year, striving to deliver enough to earn a full mark, a significant promotion. Others, they just can't care less. They put in a 9-5, deliver the task with the least amount of effort possible and eliminate the chance of being fired. That's it. Nothing less and nothing more. The company doesn't mean much to them other than employment. So in a nutshell, the performance evaluation determines the employees' future contributions a whole lot more than weighing the past. ",
