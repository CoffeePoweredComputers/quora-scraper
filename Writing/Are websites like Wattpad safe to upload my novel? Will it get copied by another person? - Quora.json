No one wants to steal your book and paying to copyright it is pointless, no matter what people in the thread say. If this is a fear you have, why would you put it on Wattpad, where it will be available for free to anyone with a modem? Who\u2019s going to \u201cpirate\u201d something that\u2019s there for the taking? Put it on KDP and charge $0.99 per copy. You will quickly realize that no one wants to steal your book because no one wants to buy your book. You want to steal something that\u2019s free? Go to my website. I\u2019ve got three of them there. Each one is Creative Commons, which means you can do just about anything you want with them - without paying royalties, mind - as long as you keep my name attached and your own product is CC as well. I\u2019m not even joking. If you really think that there is money in stealing books, then click that link, download a copy of The Fabulist or Nerd World or All the Stars Within Our Grasp, and then put it on KDP. You will very quickly learn why it is that no one steals books. ",

There have been reports of people taking things, putting THEIR name on them and publishing them on Amazon and Wattpad will do NOTHING to help you. But it can also help build a following that can buy your books when you do publish at Amazon. To be safe, POST a copyright notice and pay $35 to file a formal US Copyright. Amazon responds quickly to those! ",

Look, I know you love your novel, but you\u2019re a beginner, and you have a lot to learn about the craft of writing. Even if you have that magic something that makes readers turn the page and nag you to write another chapter, you still don\u2019t have the skills to write at a level that will make anyone steal it. Wattpad is great for getting feedback on your first draft, if you can get people to read your story. There may well be people who tell you why your story sucks, but they won\u2019t try to steal it.

As to somebody copying it, they could. But the website\u2019s rules also (or should) provide for your protection. And the time and date of posting a story or chapter is proof of original publication.
