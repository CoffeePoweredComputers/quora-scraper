            "answer_text": "No, absolutely not! And please don\u2019t take my emphatic no as being disrespectful, it is just that I know they weren\u2019t; it is not a judgment against African Americans and their capabilities. Some African Americans and European Americans both have been led to believe at different points that they were the first Native Americans. In fact, relatively recently the ancient skull of what was first believed to be a European, (because of the European like features), was found in North America. We all thought that this was an interesting upset of what we had all previously thought to be true; that Native Americans were the first to arrive here. This \u2018upset\u2019 was later proven to be untrue. DNA tests revealed that the skull was actually an Early Native American, and through the DNA markers, was found to be an early ancestor of many Native American tribes. There were no European markers. I am assuming that there were no African markers as well, as that would have made the news. This doesn\u2019t prove that African Americans weren\u2019t the first here, just that that particular skull had no African DNA markers. Because of what I, my family and my people have Suffered, I see a big movement against Native people, to try to discredit them, take what is theirs, including their historical \u2018rights\u2019. African Americans, please don\u2019t contribute this, you know suffering, as we know suffering. In Canada, there is a Big move of European Canadians trying to claim Native or Metis \u2018status\u2019. It\u2019s interesting that many of the Exact Same People who protested against First Nations and Metis people getting the hunting and fishing rights promised to them in historical negotiations, are now trying to say that they Themselves are Native, in order to \u2018get a piece of the pie!\u2019 So Many Europeans are now claiming Native Status, that it is statistically significant, and thus, all over the news: Native people are having a population BOOM. I checked with statistics Canada, and Native women are Still only having 2.2 children per Native woman, so the population \u2018boom\u2019 isn't due to us. Throughout history, Europeans have tried to Erase Native people, Remove them, and Destroy them. Now they try to claim they Were them! (Please don\u2019t think that because you are European Canadian or European American I include you in this group, I take each person individually, for who you are and almost all European Americans and Canadians are Not racist, and would never do such a thing) By saying we weren\u2019t the first, it is an attempt to belittle the historical crimes against us, and gives them an excuse to continue to deny us the rights and respect as the Native people. It makes them feel better about what has been done to us, as they are trying to say we did that to the Europeans or the Africans who were here before us, so we deserve the \u2018same treatment\u2019 we gave them. You will see their opinions all over, how there \u2018are no Native Americans\u2019. We all came from somewhere else. Of course, we did! But we all settled in our respective areas: Europeans in Europe, Africans in Africa, Asians in Asia, and Native Americans in America. We adapted, over thousands of years, to our specific places and environments. Europeans developed lighter skin, and many of them are tall and slim compared to other races of people. Native Canadians and Alaskans have adapted to the cold, arctic environment by developing a nervous system that won\u2019t shut down in the cold. Other \u2018races\u2019 of people who come over here haven't adapted. When our extremities get cold, our bodies continue to circulate blood to that area to allow us to continue to work and survive in our harsh environment. Other races of people have a nervous system that will shut down their extremities, and preserve the core temperature until they can be rescued. They are adapted to Europe and the European lifestyle. If a European person gets cold, their bodies try to preserve their heat, because getting cold like that isn\u2019t \u2018normal\u2019 for a European, African or other. Their bodies go into \u2018safety mode\u2019. Our bodies were made to be outside working, hunting and gathering in our extreme environment. When we get cold, it's no big deal. We are always out working in the cold. It is not an emergency to our system, our system was built for this. If our bodies were to shut down the way yours does, there is No Way We Would have survived here for so many thousands of years. YES! We are NATIVE to North America! There is No Other Way to Put it. We adapted to our environment over thousands of years here, and We Are Glad You Came to Join Us! Happy to have you here; wish you had done a better job \u2018integrating\u2019, though, \u2018you\u2019 could have been less barbaric about it, but that is in the Past, lol! We REALLY would never \u2018send you back\u2019 so to speak, but you can be difficult people to deal with, sometimes. Thank you to most of you (Europeans, Africans, Asians and other) who are the Best People Ever, and I\u2019m proud to call you my friends and Family. When Europeans first came over, they took license with paintings depicting Native Americans. Most artists had never actually Seen Native Americans for themselves, so they painted whatever they fancied. They copied some of what they \u2018know\u2019 from paintings of the exotic \u2018Africans\u2019, including the \u2018clothing\u2019. Some slave owners had paintings done of their African slaves in fanciful \u2018Native costume\u2019, depicting them hunting, and playfully calling them Natives, and referring to them as Natives, when they were their African American slaves. They thought it was amusing; now they\u2019ve caused such confusion people actually think it was real! Also, in Africa, the African people Were called the \u2018Natives\u2019, by the colonialists. We cover Two Entire CONTINENTS! We have a range of skin colors, facial features, body types and stature. We had a variety of different hairstyles, including braids similar to Egyptian type hairstyles. We had thin and thick lips, we were round and tall, we had long and short noses, pointy and flat, large and small. If the first Native Americans were African, then they would Still be around. There would be actual African tribes still around. There would be enough of them, if they were the first people here, to remain separate tribes, or we would at least see certain markers in the DNA, that remained constant throughout the generations, to be able to say, the first people came from this certain group from Africa. Having random DNA from Africa is not enough to prove the first people were African. It only proves that slaves brought over from Africa mixed with the Indigenous people. Both the Indigenous people and the African descendants of those who mixed are proud of their strong, unique racial mix. These two \u2018races of people\u2019 both have babies who can hold their heads up at quite a young age; the Aboriginal and the African people. This demonstrates one of the amazing ways we both have adapted to our rigorous environments. In the beginning, the colonists took all the men away from one Native tribe and sent them to Africa. At the same time, they brought in African slaves so that they would get lighter-skinned slaves. There was also the adoption of runaway African slaves into tribes. This is not proof the first peoples were African. Mayan (or other South American nations) ruins also do not depict African people. It was us. As I said, we come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. The ruins could be depicting wars with tribes who were darker than them. Also, they would emphasize the differences, and they would exaggerate the looks of the enemy. South American Native people have type O blood. They have been here, with type O blood for thousands and thousands of years. That is very specific and shows that a relatively small group of people came over and populated South America, and remained isolated all this time. They are the only group of people to have one homogeneous blood type. This preponderance of blood type O continues all the way up through North America, though not as pure, but doesn\u2019t include the Inuit and their descendants. My husband and I are examples of this, though it is only an incidental example, and neither of us is \u2018pure\u2019 Aboriginal, so, like I said, an incidental example, not scientific in any way. My husband is 56% Cree \u2018Indian\u2019 and is type O blood, and I am Inuvialuit, and Cree (though only 33%) and am type AB. As we mix, we change, and Inuit are different and have \u2018newer\u2019 origins than the First Nations people. It is popular in the US to be able to say you have Native blood, not so much in Canada, and also not so much racial mixing in Canada. The US fought a rigorous war with the Indigenous people, and that brings a certain amount of respect. In Canada, we just starved people to death. We made deals with people, then once we had control, we just devastated them. Our psychopathic government bureaucracy knowingly killed thousands upon thousands of First Nations people. We starved between 20,000 to 25,000 people in a short period of time in Saskatchewan alone! We will never know the number of deaths we caused all over Canada, and I really don\u2019t think any of us Want to know the truth. It forces us to have a hard look at ourselves, and I don\u2019t think any of us want to \u2018go there\u2019, including the First Nations people. ",

            "answer_text": "The ugliest things about these claims is their denial of the slave trade across the Atlantic. According to them, Africans were already in the Americas when enslaved. So all the accounts we have of a high death rate in the slave trade, of wars in Africa fought to capture slaves, of tens of millions of African deaths, these claims say that never happened. This is as bad, as illogical, and as offensive as someone Jewish claiming the Holocaust never happened. There is an entire mini industry of outright cults behind these claims that target Black Americans, try to take their money and entrap them in this pseudo history and abuse them, sometimes even sexually. Stay far away, and warn anyone you know falling for this. These groups are incredibly dangerous, on top of being loony. The Nuwaubians, the Washitaw, and several groups claiming to Yamassee, all peddle these ideas. Most of them are heavily armed. The Nuwaubians stockpiled automatic weapons until they were seized in an ATF raid. Its leader Dwight York abused and raped over 80 children. The Washitaw have ties to other militia groups like the \"Republic of Texas\" and some members were imprisoned for a scam trying to defraud for billions (with a B) in phony IOUs. What these con artists also do is try to take advantage of Blacks with stories of Native ancestry. Many of those stories are themselves dubious and likely made up to hide white ancestry in Black families, often the product of rape by slave owners. But even if Blacks have Native ancestry, a cult is obviously the worst way to pursue or find out about it. Nothing can replace doing the hard work of genealogy and then learning the actual true history and culture of one's ancestors. There are some scholars who think the Olmec heads may be depictions of Africans. But guess what? They were still carved by American Indians. If I make a sketch of George Washington, it does not make me a founding father. It means I know what he looked like.  There are some accounts of African explorers to the Americas, like King Abubakari of Mali. Those accounts are disputed. But even those accounts themselves say he returned. He was from Africa, not the Americas. ",

Twenty men of the tribe were left at St. Augustine, Florida, in 1743, and they were absorbed by the Seminoles. The Yamassee, or Jamassi, were one of a small number of isolated tribes, of dark complexion, found widely scattered among the inhabitants of North and South America. Supposed to have been immigrants from Africa prior to the European discovery of America (See Human Species, by A. De Quatrefages). If this be so, it explains why D'Alyon persisted in slave hunting about Beaufort (1520), these http://Ne.gro.es being valuable as laborers, while the Indians were worthless. It were strange, too, if http://Ne.gro.es first occupied this section where they now predominate.\" http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/ce\u2026  \"A branch of the Wamonkeyaw Moors called \"Jamassi\" migrated to an area of Georgia in the United States called Rock Eagle Mound that was built by the earlier Moundbuilders. The Jamassi or \"Yamassee\" were a gentle tribe of black Native Americans who even practiced their ancient Moorish religion of Islam. The word \"Yamasee\" means \"Gentle.\" The tribe lived along the Ocmulgee River not far above it's junction with the Oconee. In 1715 the Yamasee rose in rebellion against the English who started getting involved in slavery... After the 1715 war, Native American power collapsed in the South. Many of the Yamasee escaped to Florida joining Ne.gr.o slaves and other black tribes to form what would later be called the Seminole.\"  http://udaisd.proboards.com/index.cgi?bo\u2026 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Here is an interesting blog on the blackamoors (decorative arts) Moors & Africans in Green Vault, Dresden - Alain.R.Truong Moor with Emerald Level, Balthasar Permoser (sculptor), Wilhelm Kruger (sculptor), Johann Melchior Dinglinger (jeweler) The young, powerful man in dark brown lacquered pearwood, the associated border on a tray of tortoiseshell presents casual and smooth the Colombian Emerald level, is not a resident of AFRICA but an INDIAN.

            "answer_text": "There's a lot of people disdaining the idea that American Indigenous people could be black.  If we look at the distribution of the R1 Haplogroup we see it in the region of Central Africa that many slaves are supposed to come from. It's also very funny that its the second most common Y DNA haplogroup among American Indians. Furthermore, there are the similarities between the Micmac hieroglyphs and Egyptian ones. There is also the proven scientific presence of American substances in African mummies (Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact theories - Wikipedia ) I feel like some people just don't want it to be true for racist reasons. To further my point.  Andamanese People  Melanesian People   If you look at Y-DNA haplogroup Q which its a common Y DNA of American Indians, it descends from haplogroup K which produces Melanesians. Haplogroup K-M9 Haplogroup K2b1 is the ancestor of the Y DNA Haplogroups that produce American indians. Haplogroup K2b (Y-DNA) - Wikipedia Therefore anybody who says that American Indians cannot phenotypically resemble Black people in America are willfully ignoring the science. If the K haplogroups make people like Fijians, Andamanese and Australoid people, and the K haplogroup is the parent of Q, and R which produce American Indians. As we can see from this study. Asymmetric Male and Female Genetic Histories among Native Americans from Eastern North America Haplogroup Q is there and we know where it comes from. UPDATE. This Man's DNA Is the Oldest in North America This bit of genetic evidence shows that particularly eastern woodlands tribes descend from Pacific Islanders. You know like people from Fiji or the Solomon Islands.   Funny how phenotypically these people resemble American Black people. My grandmothers brother registers Pacific Islanders and American Indian DNA. How does a black man from Mississippi end up with Pacific Islander DNA? He doesn't it's a lack of understanding meant that it wasn't properly coded with his native DNA. ",

The man lived near lake Baikal, north of Mongolia. Read more: Earliest known man with Native American DNA ancestry lived in Siberia **********************************************************************************************  No, absolutely not. There have been studies on skulls from Lagoa Santa that indicate Australasian origin but that has been mostly debunked using latest genetic techonology. The new face of South American people If you dont\u2019 want to read below, check out this video:  \u201cThe well-known forensic facial reconstruction of Luzia was performed in accordance with this theory. Luzia is the name given to the fossil skull of a woman who lived in the Lagoa Santa region 12,500 years ago and is sometimes referred to as the \"first Brazilian\". The bust of Luzia with African features was built on the basis of the skull's morphology by British anatomical artist Richard Neave in the 1990s. \"However, skull shape isn't a reliable marker of ancestrality or geographic origin. Genetics is the best basis for this type of inference,\" Strauss explained. \"The genetic results of the new study show categorically that there was no significant connection between the Lagoa Santa people and groups from Africa or Australia. So the hypothesis that Luzia's people derived from a migratory wave prior to the ancestors of today's Amerindians has been disproved. On the contrary, the DNA shows that Luzia's people were entirely Amerindian.\" \u201d A new bust has replaced Luzia in the Brazilian scientific pantheon. Caroline Wilkinson, a forensic anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and a disciple of Neave, has produced a facial reconstruction of one of the individuals exhumed at Lapa do Santo. The reconstruction was based on a retrodeformed digital model of the skull. \"Accustomed as we are to the traditional facial reconstruction of Luzia with strongly African features, this new facial reconstruction reflects the physiognomy of the first inhabitants of Brazil far more accurately, displaying the generalized and indistinct features from which the great Amerindian diversity was established over thousands of years,\" Strauss said. The study published in Cell, he added, also presents the first genetic data on Brazilian coastal sambaquis. \"These monumental shell mounds were built some 2,000 years ago by populous societies that lived on the coast of Brazil. Analysis of fossil DNA from shell mound burials in Santa Catarina and S\u00e3o Paulo shows these groups were genetically akin to the Amerindians alive today in the South of Brazil, especially the Kaingang groups,\" he said. Here is more dna result from early Amerindians. kennwick man - \u201cAdvances in genetic research since the first work was done on Kennewick Man has made it possible to analyze ancient DNA (known as aDNA). In June 2015, new results of such aDNA analysis were announced, suggesting that the remains are more closely related to modern Native Americans than to any other living population. His genetic profile was particularly close to that of members of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Of the five tribes that originally claimed Kennewick Man as an ancestor, their members were the only ones to donate DNA samples for evaluation. The lack of genomes from North American aboriginal populations have made it impossible to ascertain Kennewick Man's nearest living relatives among regional Native American tribes. His Y-DNA haplogroup is Q-M3and his mitochondrial DNA is X2a, both uniparental genetic markers found almost exclusively in Native Americans.\u201d here is a picture of him. Let me know if he looks African:  Naia The original report stated that \"HN5/48 is among the small group of Paleoamerican skeletons, a group that is morphologically distinct from Native Americans.\" Genetic testing indicated a genetic link between Paleoamericans and modern indigenous peoples of the Americas as testing found MtDNA haplotype D1. Haplogroup D (mtDNA) is believed to have arisen in Asia. D1 is also found in Central Asia and is one of the founding lineages in the Americas. Subhaplogroup D1 occurs in 10.5% of extant Native Americans, with highest frequency of 29% in indigenous people from Chile and Argentina. The report concluded that \"HN5/48 shows that the distinctive craniofacial morphology and generalized dentition of Paleoamericans can co-occur with a Beringian derived mtDNA haplogroup. This 13\u201312 ka Paleoamerican skeleton thus suggests that Paleoamericans represent an early population expansion out of Beringia, not an earlier migration from elsewhere in Eurasia. This is consistent with hypotheses that both Paleoamericans and Native Americans derive from a single source population, whether or not all share a lineal relationship ... the differences in craniofacial form between Native Americans and their Paleoamerican predecessors are best explained as evolutionary changes that postdate the divergence of Beringians from their Siberian ancestors.\" Here is a picture of Naia:   She retains many of Australoid features (African features) but her mtDNA is not African. My personal theory is that during that time, the Y-DNA K group Haplogroup K-M9 - Wikipedia has split into K2a and K2b for about 30,000 yrs. and so originally we all look Australoid/Melanesian. Including ancestors of R1a, R1b, Q, N, O (I am O1 being that I\u2019m from China). So it\u2019s likely that during that time some Asiatics still retain Australoid features like some Phillipinos today.  Manny Paquiao with his wide nose and thick lips. Update 6/1/2020************************************************************************* Here\u2019s apparently article that discovered Mysterious link emerges between Native Americans and people half a globe away.(2015) DNA traces of Melanesians appear in certain populations of ancient Alaskan islands and populations in Brazil. \u201cBoth models \u2026 see in the Americas a subtle signal from\u201d Australo-Melanesians, notes Science co-author David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. \u201cA key difference is when and how it arrived in the New World.\u201d The Nature team concludes it came in one of two early waves of migration into the continent, whereas the Science team concludes it came much later, and was unrelated to the initial peopling. For the Science paper, nearly 4 years in the making, researchers sequenced 31 complete and 79 partial genomes from people in North and South America, Siberia, and Oceania. They compared these with previously sequenced genomes of three ancient skeletons: the 24,000-year-old Mal\u2019ta child from Siberia, the 12,600-year-old Anzick child from Montana, and the 4000-year-old Saqqaq individual from Greenland. The team examined the genetic differences among their samples to determine how long ago various populations diverged, using the ancient genomes to calibrate this DNA clock. They concluded that all Native Americans, ancient and modern, stem from a single source population in Siberia that split from other Asians around 23,000 years ago and moved into the now-drowned land of Beringia.\u201d In explaining how it is possible the melanesian dna exist in todays\u2019 native american populations: \u201cDifferences in the shared DNA suggest this ancestry did not come directly from these populations, the team concluded, but through a now extinct population they call \u201cPopulation Y\u201d that may have lived somewhere in East Asia and contributed genes to both very early Paleoamericans and to Australo-Melanesians.\u201d So Surui people are descendants of Beringians who had contact with a group of Melansian-related population before coming to the Americas. Here\u2019s a picture of the Karitiana people of Brazil who carry 2 % melanesian DNA:  ******************************************************************************************** Chan Hol The first fossil, Chan Hol I, was discovered in 2006 by Alexandra and Thorsten Kampe at a location in the cave system around 530 m (1,739 ft) northeast of the cenote entrance, at a depth of around 8 m (26 ft) underwater. Nicknamed El Joven, the fossil is dated to around 9194-8792 BP. The skeleton had fossilized while the cave system was still dry.The skeleton shows evidence of intentional placement of the dead body. Chan Hol II The second fossil, Chan Hol II, was discovered in 2009 by Harry Gustat a location in the cave system around 1,240 m (4,068 ft) southwest of the cenote entrance, at a depth of around 8.5 m (28 ft) http://underwater.In February 2012, photos of the skeleton spread on social media.In March 2012, the site was vandalized and looted.Most of the skeletal remains, including the skull, were stolen. In October 2012, researchers collected the leftover fossil fragments from the site. Although Chan Hol II was given the nickname La Ni\u00f1a,, later osteological analysis shows that the remains likely belonged to a young male.The fossil is dated to around 11,311 BP.The individual had died while the cave system was still dry. The skeletons of two ancient Paleoamericans were discovered within the Chan Hol cave system. Both skeletons exhibit sinodont dental morphology.  There have been claims that Olmecs are black. they claim that hair braids are black culture.  Here is Bear Bull from Blackfoot tribe.   They also fail to point out that Olmec heads look like many natives today or that many small figurines have Asiatic features.         Maybe they are Africans? Or maybe they are Chinese? or maybe they are native americans. Then they move on to say Native savages can not build great pyramids without the help of great African scientists and builders. Sound familiar? But they fail to mention there is no evidence of pyramid building in all of West Africa which is where they surmise the Africans came from. How far is Nubia from gulf of Mexico? Also during the time Olmecs were building these pyramids, the nubian pyramids were much smaller in comparison. Nubian pyramids - Wikipedia The paintings of black people in their ritual ceremonies could be an indication of presence of African people but it could also be body paint. There is just too much we don\u2019t know about the Olmecs.  Afrocentrists also claim Mende script is related to Olmec writing. What they fail to mention is that Mende script is of Arabic influence and was created in 1800\u2019s. how that is logical is beyond me. Mende Kikakui script - Wikipedia I will write more as more evidence is found and discovered. But no source points to direct evidence of African contact with the new world before Columbus. Actually Afrocentrists can\u2019t even agree on when they came in. They make up Three fantasy scenerios: they were the first people to cross Siberia before Mongoloid people ( There is no evidence of that)They came from Egypt around the start of Olmec civilizations based Olmec heads. ( Well at that time Egypt already stopped building pyramids themselves)They came from West africa around during the time of Mansa Musa.which one is it? or perhaps all. My job here is not to convince anyone. I can see many people are clearly justified in taking away other people\u2019s culture and accomplishments and I have no hope for them. I just wanted to share the facts and evidence. You interpret however you want. ",

            "answer_text": "As the pages of history are turned through time it reveals what we are learning and is making us more aware of what our history holds. Those who came from Europe wrote of what they found when they got here. One description was what could easily be described as what we commonly call, 'African Americans\u2019. These people were labeled, 'American Indians' by these European explorers. Prior to the official launch of the colonization of this country the plan was written in black and white: black skinned people of this continent were to be enslaved, the \u201csavages\u201d were to be sanctioned off onto barren lands and no immigration from Africa would be allowed. Colonizers came and enslaved all natives that they did not murder or poison with diseases. This was done long enough to get enough European people on the land with as few casualties as possible. Once this was in place treaties were made with the natives and the lighter skinned natives were set free. At this same time, America started bringing in 'African slaves' and did so until trafficking was made illegal. Very few Africans were brought over to America, consequently. The math does not add up and the capabilities were not there. The 'American Indians with Black and darker skin were never allowed off the plantations and kept there under the promise of treaties, which were continuously broken. American Indian slaves' were kept separated from those bought in from Africa, however, when trafficking of slaves became illegal our government (in 1700s) RECLASSIFIED American Indian females from American Indian TO Negroes. With the whip of a pen our government made millions of American Indians disappear and all babies born of these dark skin American Indians once born free\u2026suddenly born slaves. This was the answer to no longer being able to traffick in slaves from Africa. In the 1800s our government RECLASSIFIED American Indian males from American Indian TO Negroes, forced all Native American lighter skin (who were not of the so-called civilized tribes for the most part) onto barren lands and VOILA!! AMERICAN INDIANS were RECLASSIFIED in our government documents as EXTINCT\u2026paper genocide. Archeological and historical recall by those there who documented their findings testify that, yes, the people that we once called Negroes, now call black or African American are, for the most part, direct descendants of some of the original people of these lands. They are the Niji, which is a mixture of many native tribes and descendants of chattel slavery in America. Consequently, also in the mid 1800s there was a 'Black to Africa\u2019 movement in which Europeans went through out the nation and gathered all of the \u201cfreed slaves\u201d that they could encounter onto ships and sent them back to Africa to Sierra Leone and Liberia, purchased by America for this purpose. Not ALL black skinned Americans are Niji as Africans have immigrated here since post civil rights and some before and these have no historical connection to American slavery\u2026 some of the \u201cAfrican Americans\u201d are in fact descendants of the Africans brought over whom were not caught up in the back to Africa movement\u2026.but most so-called AAs are Niji.

            "answer_text": "Umm, NO. As a Native American (Shawnee Nation), there is nothing better than seeing other people tell you who you are or try and hijack your culture. DNA and modern science trumps what something \u201clooks like\u201d. There's statues of entities with bird heads and dragon heads. I guess that's evidence enough to prove someone got it on with a peacock or banged a mythical creature. Some statues show a sun around a person's head. You know why? Their parents had some hot sex with a fiery celestial object called a star! (See what I did there? Get it? Sun, hot sex\u2026 HA!) You know what, I'm sorry, that was too rash. Perhaps I should attempt to use such a method before I discard it out of hand. Okay, let's see. In Africa there are light-skinned people who use paint for rituals, warfare, and religious practices. There are also those who use animal hides for clothing and bones for jewelry and tools. OH! It just hit me! These people must be descendants of Native Americans that went to Africa and influenced their cultures, physical characteristics, and practices. The Native American presence in Africa has just simply been removed from history because Africans discriminate against Native Americans and have racist tendencies against them. Some Mayan/Aztec/Olmec structures look a lot like Egyptian pyramids. You know why? The Egyptians built them. They came over to restart their civilization after it collapsed in Egypt. They just forgot to write it down, there or in Central America. Airplanes look a lot like birds. They must have been invented by secret, unknown, uber-intelligent Dodo birds who wanted to fly again because they got tired of walking everywhere and developed an inferiority complex. There. How'd I do? Did I do that right? Like it's not bad enough that almost 90\u201395% of our people died, cultures almost completely eradicated, and the land taken, now someone else is trying to lay claim to what little is left! Anyone else got a claim to anything that's left? Just get it out in the open now so there's no more surprises. Don't want to relax a little and then find out someone else is owed something. I mean seriously\u2026 WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! *Later Addition: Okay, so my wife informed me that we're going to have our third child, and I got it in my head that it would be cool to get our family's DNA panels. I thought the results would be really interesting. My wife is Filipino, so my two, and my soon to be third, are all good ol' Heinz 57 mutts that can only be accomplished in the US. They could have a \u201cMade in America\u201d tattoo across their butts. Anyway, I got the results of my specific DNA results. Some very loud and long claims in some of the answers found for this question that Native Americans are actually African, and the establishment is simply trying to fervently keep this truth down. So, my DNA results say, now prepare yourselves for this\u2026 I have no African blood in me. Though it does, obviously, list Native American prominently. Just a side note, but my boys have listed: Native American, Southeast Asian, Iberian, British Isles, and somehow or another, a little Germanic. I'm fairly certain that the Iberian is the Spanish, that when combined with the Asian, pretty much makes up the Filipino that is my wife. The British Isles is the English from my Dad's father's side, so that means some German slipped into my wife's family's bloodline somewhere along the way! Like I said, MADE IN AMERICA. **War Chief Tecumseh's Poem: \u201cSo live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their views, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none. When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision. When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.\u201d -Tecumseh ",

            "answer_text": "Being of both Persian Jewish (Iranian) and Native American decent with a Genetic DNA test to back this, I can tell you most definitely NO. Both my Native American (Iroquois, Cherokee, Arapaho, Crow, Lakota, and Apache) and my ancient Persian Jewish(maiden name is Asher and my dad immigrated from Iran in 1968 not to be confused with Arabs which are Persian, Western European, Asian, and African ((silk trade mix)) ancestors are not African or even related. I can honestly say what your being told is a lie. I do have some Haitian with my Native due to a Creole mix from 4 generations ago. The reasoning they will try to make this logical is due to the adaptations that happened once the cro magnon man made as they settled and adapted to their chosen new land. Oh and by the way, Haitians were not the original natives just like the bi-racial breeding of Seminole with escaped slaves. Haitians and darker \u201cnatives\u201d came from African slaves brought over by the Spanish and French from Europe. I have both light skin and medium (red) skin native (depended on the environment they lived in and the sun exposure they endured). Also, my ancient Persian to the fellow above who tried to say Jesus was Black (not all Africans are black e.g. Egyptians) is 100% wrong. We are actually light olive skin toned. Don\u2019t believe me? Look up my last name in the Bible under the 12 tribes of Israel. Also, Persians and natives both can have green hazel or grayish colored eyes due to having split at cro magnon man with both ancestry in my DNA showing in stagnant and without major migration place (current studies show) about 4\u201312,000 years ago. We are actually an extremely old race and mixed between other tribes (Both humanly and no so humanly) but, were always of a neutral olive shade and not much darker than that till Black slaves came over. Natives would mix for cutting up the genetic pool for better breeding like we would do our horses which were also not native to North America or Persia and came from Spain. If you do have native in your genetic DNA test, it would be a mix not that Black African are Native to the Americas. They developmentally did not have the correct ships to sail or migrational pattern for this to even be a possibility like the possibility of Vikings, Persians, or Asians did. Sorry\u2026 ",

There were \u201cAfrican\u201d seafarers who founded and settled this land mass long before \u201cMongoloids\u201d came across the Bering Strait. On Amazon Prime there is a movie called Out of Darkness, watch it, it goes deep. European indoctrination separates us by labeling the aboriginals of this land with names such as \u201cblack\u201d, \u201cAfrican-American\u201d, Native American, mestizo, mulatto, etc. After the prohibition of the African Slave Trade Act the slave population went from approx. 500,000 to over 3,000,000 by the end of slavery. Mind you, a lot of slaves did not live to see 30 years old. If they were no longer shipping in slaves from \u201cAfrica\u201d (I believe U.S. was the last to stop the importation of \u201cAfrican\u201d slaves) where were they getting more slaves from?\u2026The indigenous people. The Europeans/\u201dwhites\u201d reclassified the aboriginal tribes as \u201cNegros\u201d, afterwards the Jackson administration decided to \u201crelocate\u201d the remaining tribes Trail of Tears - Wikipedia who were mixed with Eurasian blood, which later led up to the Dawes Rolls Dawes Rolls - Wikipedia giving the classification powers over to those the European/\u201dwhites\u201d did not consider \u201cNegro/black/colored/slave\u201d. This is why you all who look like Mongoloids believe you are the original inhabitants of this land, but surely you are no different than the European pilgrim (if we\u2019re comparing Eurasian immigrants to the \u201cAfrican\u201d aboriginee).

            "answer_text": "No, the ignorance that the Moorish science temple of America propagates is ridiculous. By preying on the African American feeling of cultural ambiguity. They feed young black youths in the prison systems especially, they create what so many blacks in America want. A history that isn't associated completely with just slavery ships from Africa and associated countries of origan. They literally just fabricate an idiotic idea that all blacks were just already here and had always been here. A good place for them too look that just completely refutes there assertion is 23andme's DNA study of 160,000 Americans showed that On average, the scientists found, people who identified as African-American had genes that were 73.2 percent African. European genes accounted for 24 percent of their DNA, while .8 percent came from Native Americans. Now these numbers obviously don't speak for the genetic profile of everyone in America because testing a number of that size is bound to produce multiple variations. But the fact that the random testing of people who considered themselves African American people from all over America produced those results speaks for itself. The point is, instead of teaching black America's to be proud of who they are the MSTA just decided we'll make our own. From an idiotic idea that only stated with Timothy Drew in 1913. And trust me the ignorance is so much more profound inside the prison systems of Michigan where they use the so called \u201c religion\u201d to brainwash vulnerable black youths and to have sex with young whites entering the system. It's essentially no more then a Gang in Michigan prisons. ",

Clovis mongol elders DO NOT CLAIM the Giant PLATFORM PYRAMID mound in Cahokia, IL\u2026.

            "answer_text": "As a non-native and non-black, maybe I\u2019m not qualified to comment on this topic. But on the other hand, I have no pony in this race so maybe can be most objective. One of the answers here used pictures to show how much American natives look like Africans. I thought that it showed the opposite, except for artists impressions that were not based on actual observations. So I figure I\u2019ll take it one step further and show a more complete picture of the diversity within all the groups vying for the honour of being the first Americans. First the Americans: Sitting Bull, USA, Gitskan family, BC, Kichwa girl, Ecuador, Cree children, Saskatchewan and Eskimo mother, Alaska.      Now for the Africans. Bantu and Masai girls, and a San Khoi man. Note that the San people are generally considered the closest living people to the first humans. By their appearance you can see how all other races could have evolved :    And the Asians; a Siberian, Chinese man and girl, and an Ifugao from the Philippines:     Finally, the Europeans; a Pole, some Italian men and some hot Scots:    So consider these faces and decide which people are most closely related to the Americans. I would say the Asians, with the Siberians identical to Inuit (Eskimos), and the native Filipinos most closely resembling the Indians. In some cases, such as sitting Bull, with the prominent nose, they even resemble Europeans more than Africans. Skin color is irrelevant, as both dark and light skin are found in all races. The San definitely aren\u2019t black, despite being African. DNA evidence shows them to be the most closely related to the purported ancestors of all people today, including black Africans. The people that left Africa and created all living races today likely looked a lot like them; not black, but also not white or yellow. I hope this can be seen as an impartial view of the story of American ancestry. ",

They carefully guard who is a member of the tribe as government benefits come with that designation. Sometimes politics are involved. Some American Indians have some black ancestors. Some American Indians were enslaved by whites in the old days. American Indians also kept slaves, causing admixture. The famous Quanah Parker\u2019s Mother was a white slave girl who survived her childhood captivity, becoming a wife to a chief. The famous Parker family of Texas consists of these descendants as well as whites.  Here is a photo of one of the last great warriors, Quanah Parker ~~~~~. Many have white ancestors, and as stated, a few have black ancestors. .     Here are some photos of Indian ladies. The one directly above is colorized and dates to the 19th century.

            "answer_text": "No, they are not, although blacks throughout the Americas are often descended from and are raised by Native Americans. Anyone who tells you that Native Americans were originally white or black are trying to spread racial propaganda to suit their needs. The fact is, Native Americans were originally proto-East Asians from Siberia that migrated here through a now sunken land bridge thousands of years ago. Any white or black heritage in a modern day Native American is through past race mixing after Europeans started colonizing, NOT because \u201cthe original Native Americans were white/black\u201d. ",

There were dark skinned natives who were put in slavery. Many of those tribes held allegiance to the Moroccan Empire, but that ended after George Washington \u201cchopped down the cherry tree\u201d. They were called Moors and Indians ,then he suggested they call all of them negro. The majority of those in slavery were in fact native Americans who were not in \u201cAmity\u201d with the new government. The wars and rebellions were the cause the term being forced on those people as a whole. Shipping 300,000 to 500,000 Africans during the entire 400+ year period was only a small portion of the \u201cblack\u201d population, there was a hard attempt to mix them in with the other slaves in specific areas.

            "answer_text": "Evidence of the ethnicity of the earliest inhabitants of North America is changing rapidly as new evidence that can be DNA tested is found. Migrations followed each other for thousands of years, the latest, perhaps as late as 12000 years ago across the plains of Beringia after the ice melted enough to allow the largest game animals to lead the way, but many came before along the coastline. To my understanding, none of these people came directly from Africa, but many had darker skin tones than others, if that is the nature of your question. The descendants of America\u2019s original indigenous people are quite diverse, not a single ethnicity. However, there have been enough paleo-anthropological discoveries recently that even the idea of Mother Africa as the original home of all mankind, has been questioned. Most of the people of direct African heritage whose families have been here for more than 100 years, are descendants of those who were brought here on slave ships from Africa and the Carribbean. ",

Seems like legit science to me. You know what this reminds me of? Another extremely scientific study which found that the Negro race, originating in Africa, migrated through the Iberian peninsula, crossed the English Channel, and settled in Ireland, removing themselves from the gene pool and thus rendering themselves genetically inferior. Skeptical? Just wait until you see the extensive and decisive evidence supporting the claim that Irish people are actually Negroes:  Pretty much the same kind of argument. Back then they used it to allege that Irish people are inferior because they're black. Now it's used to make some bizarre claim that black people are the \"true native Americans\". This is not history. Don't do it. ",

Afrocentrism is a decease, just as bad as aglism was at its time. the second started with the idea that the only true decendes of the Jews where the Anglo Saxon people. Therefore, the were the \u201conly\u201d and truly God\u2019s people. Afrocentrism, is nothing more than the same idiotic ideas applied to African people. To them Jesus was black, there was black people in America, the true Jews people of the Bible was black and a lot of other nonsense claims. That were created (or copied from the anglism) to make blacks feel better about themselves. ",

I mean there is so much evidence, can\u2019t you just google? I don\u2019t understand why is this even being discussed. Probably not much changed over last 2,000 years over in North America.

Then they bowed down to these enterprising traders and pleaded with them to let them work at growing cotton or sugar. Their only request being that they should be fed occasionally and whipped if they didn\u2019t make their owners rich. They were so grateful that they even fought wars for their owners and were allowed to create music - they were even recognised by allowing them to share public transport etc. One of these days I might even find out how Indian people managed to be living in the America\u2019s, so far from their homelands in the great Sub Continent. All a bit of mystery at present. ",

            "answer_text": "According to genetic studies, the Native Americans descend from a mix of peoples from Eurasia of 20,000 years ago. Some of them were closely related to today\u2019s East Asians, some were related to today\u2019s Siberians, and some were related to today\u2019s Europeans. There probably were also some Pacific Islanders who reached the Americas by boat; many Pacific Islanders (e.g. Samoa) have features that look somewhat African \u2014 as do some of the people from around New Guinea \u2014 but genetic studies say that these people are more closely related to the Chinese than to Africans. Since Eurasians are thought to have wandered out of Africa 50,000 years ago, it is possible that some South Sea islanders retained certain African facial features despite a more general diverging over the tens of thousands of years of separation.

The logical conclusion is since humans first came out of Africa and biologicaly had darker skin it would make sense that Africans would be the first in America and they probably set up settlements or was nomadic. Common misconception is blacks in America started with the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade however little is knowed about the thousands of Europeans and other ethnic groups that were also enslaved or participated in the slave trade. Most European literature has upheld the \u201call blacks came from Africa and slaves\u201d and this was a successful divide and conquer strategy that still exist today. If we subtract our emotions and immaturity it's logical that the first humans came from Africa. We are tropical beings even in the coldest temperature we have to create a tropical environment for survival. ",

If you consider blackness to mean, having descended from An African person, then No Native Americans would not consider themselves black. If you consider merely the colour of a person\u2019s skin as being the only racial identifier then, it would be no again, if you mean culturally , I guess that would be up to the individual, to define who they are culturally BUT by and large I\u2019d think the Native American culture is alive and well and very clearly identifiable, with each tribe in possession of their own mode of dress, totems, history and territory, so no they are not black in any way, I can think of.

            "answer_text": "There is actually a better candidate for the ancesters of the olmecs than subsaharahan africans. Several years ago in a cave in brazil some ancient human remsins were discovered. They dated about 13,000 years old. What was odd was that their features did not resemble any present native populations. They were negroid. But they were not african negroid but aboriginese negroid, like those of Australia and New Guinea. This means somewhere in the deep past a group of aborigines with a navigational culture curcumnavigated the southern hemisphere and ended up in what is now south america. There is genetic proof of this. The natives of Tierra del Fuego at the tip of south america are the only new world indiginous people who remain with any significant amount of aboriginal dna. In light of this tribes like the olmecs and likely any carribian negroids are much easier to understand as late surviving populations of completely or largely aboriginal descent. ",
