            "answer_text": "Get professional coverage on your script.. They are not the cheapest thing in the world based on who you get it, but you will usually pay by expereince. Those can often point you in the direction and give you some advice... Generally (and some harsh truth here) most studios and big name prodution companies do not take unsolicated scripts. This is also one of the biggest rules broken daily..It takes a connection to someone within to give your script the needed refferal. This can be a personal connection favor, Agent, Manager, but you had better bet they need to LOVE your script before passing it up themselves.  Agents and Managers take on people to respesent who are genuine writers, not so much to facilitate a single sale. So if you want this route, start on your next script and get  coverage. You will need a good portfolio of 4ish.  Keep in mind that \"sales\" of scripts happen but they are not the assumed norm that many newcomers assume happens. Options are most common,I venture to say that a screenwriter had some luck casted upon him if the script is sold. Like acting, it s skill and a bit of getting lucky.  But there is always the self-produced route/ allowing some hungray (but serious) aspiring filmmakers use your script. You will most likely not get any money upfront but you all can work out a deffered payment thing (where you get a percentage if and when their film makes any return revenue). ",

            "answer_text": "Based on how you phrased the question, it appears you have not written the screenplay - so any answers - in such a case - seem to be academic.  The majority of aspiring screenwriters never complete a script - in that case - there's nothing to sell. If my assumption is correct - stop using valuable time on Quora and start writing.  When you have finished your screenplay - you can revisit and ask the same question and perhaps add some specifics - like the number of pages, the genre, a one line headline - and this might help get answers with even more in-depth advice.  For now, answers allready provided are good.  You can add networking with junior executives at studios and production companies so that you make friends while writing and then tap into that network and ask individuals to read and comment  ",
