            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. How about designing an analog noise cancellation unit? Try to use OP-AMPs and not off the shelf TBAXXXX audio-amps. You can use RC passive filters to design your frequency response. Make sure you brush-up your Laplace and Fourier transforms.I\u2019ve always been a interested in power supply designs. You can use TTL logics to implement over voltage/over current protection circuits (don\u2019t use MCUs). If you\u2019re feeling a little more inspired, you can include WiFi based power monitoring systems using ESP-8266/ESP-32Microcontroller based TRIAC firing angle control for AC power regulation. The beauty of MCU based design is, that you can use BLE or WiFi clients to remotely control the circuit.There are a lot more like this! ",
