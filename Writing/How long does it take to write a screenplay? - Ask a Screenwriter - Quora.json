            "answer_text": "Hello, It depends. I've written stuff under a week, some in 24 hours it was wrapped, others it took me months and months. I'm currently on my 4th draft, it's been 3 months of working on it, I still haven't dived in it but as soon as I'll start typing it'll probably be done under a week. It depends on you, have you done your research? Finished your treatment? Is it a personal project? Are you working under a deadline? The first question I guess I should've asked even: is it a short or a feature film? Anyways, good writing to you! Don't pressure yourself unless you're working under deadlines. ",

My average was nine months or so. Again, this was only to create a draft that, to me, was fit to send to agents and producers. tweaks and polishes and rewrites could go on indefinitely once someone is expressing interest. ",
