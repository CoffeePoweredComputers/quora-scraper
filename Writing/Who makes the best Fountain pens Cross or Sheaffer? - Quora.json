            "answer_text": "This genre of fountain pen question is really quite subjective in many ways, since each FP user has, as Jack Reacher once stated, a set of personally developed metrics by which both FP marques and individual pens are measured. For my use and taste, while both marques do produce quality pens, Sheaffer is my preferred pen maker, overall. Couple of reasons: Sheaffer has a better range of pens\u2014especially with inlaid nibs and conical nibs\u2014across both contemporary and vintage models.Sheaffer has a better overall range of price-points with quality pens at each price point.Over the years, Sheaffer has had the more technically advanced pens\u2014Snorkel and Touchdown models, for instance.Thus, I\u2019ll pick a Sheaffer over a Cross at most times. This being said, two of my all-time favorite FPs are Cross models.. The Cross Matrix with the FP moduleThe Cross Verve with the Namiki sourced conical nib.Again, I will reiterate\u2014these are highly personal decisions and will vary widely among FP users. ",
