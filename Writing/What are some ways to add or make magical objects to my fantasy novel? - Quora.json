            "answer_text": "Making magical objects is one thing that every author of fantasy deals with at one point or another. People often wonder at some of the special powers and strengths of some items and say, \u201cHow did the author come up with that?\u201d One thing I will caution you about, don\u2019t make a lot of magical items. If a reader notices a lot of magic items then those items are no longer rare or unique. That will take away the specialness of the object. Instead, have them rare or very guarded, thus keeping the awe factor. When creating magic items, always think in two ways, what is the benefit of the item and what is the drawback. Every magical item should have a positive and negative. Think of the one ring, that powerful item all coveted. It gave the user the power of invisibility and bent their will. After using the item for a while, the owner becomes enamored of it. They need to have the item near them at all times and will lose their sanity because of it. Think of the Cloak of Levitation that belongs to Doctor Strange. Not only is the cloak a powerful magical item, it also has its own ideas of what the wearer needs. In the movie, Strange wants to grab a weapon but the cloak pulls him away to another item. This is a positive and negative attribute. The cloak cannot tell the wearer why, it can only direct them. This is the downfall and it impedes the positive attributes. Magical items need to be rare. Don\u2019t let them be scattered about like seeds or everyone will have them. Instead, spread them out for random findings. Like everything, it becomes less expensive when there are more of them. Imagine the tavern: \u201cI found a beautiful magic sword that sings when a lovely woman walks past!\u201d \u201cMine nudges me when a hot woman finds me attractive.\u201d Nice to have, but really, what will then do in a fight? Remember, special means limited, so keep that in mind when scattering your magical items about. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd like to address your summary first: \"I have some ideas, but don't know how to make magical objects . . . #Idonthaveadeepknowledgeofmythology\u201d Olympians aren't born with world class athletic ability, birds aren't born with the ability to fly, and while fish might be born able to swim, authors aren't born able to write. If you don't have that ability, you work for it. Simple as that. JK Rowling studied the arts in college, and had a love for English. Tolkien was a professor, for pete\u2019s sake. They accumulated their knowledge over time, though there's no reason they couldn\u2019t have accumulated it faster. And while they may have been full-fledged adults, they were new at writing as well. It took JK Rowling around 3 years To finish the first Harry Potter. For a 90k word book to be written in 1095 days, she would've written about 80 words a day. (I'm aware that it would be more due to editing and revision, but its possible to produce a work in fractions of the time.) So in response to your summary: learn. Not just from Quora either. Read Fantasy. Read mythology (it's basically fantasy that's free, after all. Why NOT devour it?), study Language. And more importantly, just start writing. One needn't learn certain things to write, but must write to learn certain things. As you write, your writing will improve so that when the ideas come, you can present them properly\u2014because clever ideas and creations are only a fraction of the work. Now, to answer your actual question: \"What are some ways to add or make fantasy objects for my novel?\u201d Use creativity. I say that only half facetiously: creativity is taking ordinary concepts and using them in extraordinary ways. Your story and characters will exist in a world of your own making\u2014so make the story, characters, and world and magical objects familiar, but twist that familiarity into something new. Doors that aren't doors. Homes that aren't homes. Objects that do one thing, despite looking like another. Combine two old things into one new. They may not be perfect at the time\u2014but as you practice, your magical objects will become more nuanced and deep. Just like anything else you practice on. Goodness knows I'm still embarrassed at certain ideas and concepts I create. But it occurs less than it used to. And any bad ideas are only good ideas that haven't yet been completely worked through. So I set them aside, grateful for what they might become and how they were at least stepstools to success in the moment. Bad ideas will occur less for you, good ideas will come, and you will improve\u2014 the sooner you get started and get in front of your own doubts. No amount of advice or suggestion can write or create for you. No amount of perfect steps will build those creative muscles\u2014only exercise can. So go write, and experiment. Your magical devices will come to you, but more importantly, so will the more vital skills of writing and creation. ",
