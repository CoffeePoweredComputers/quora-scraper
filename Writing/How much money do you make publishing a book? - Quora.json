            "answer_text": " So, you want to make a living as an author. It\u2019s an alluring idea, the notion that you could spin straw into gold by turning dreams into stories and stories into assets that pay out on repeat, and for the rest of your life. No publisher telling you what you can or cannot write, or what is and isn\u2019t good enough. Without any barrier between you and the reader, the market can decide if your stories are worth buying. But it\u2019s hard\u2014especially now. I started self-publishing eight years ago. It was easier back then, and by an order of magnitude. The market wasn\u2019t saturated; the lines between professional and amateur product (especially on the surface) were more blatantly obvious, Kindle Select didn\u2019t exist, and marketers weren\u2019t all over the industry shilling cheap tactics that piss in the collective pool and make it harder for everyone. There are plenty of other reasons, but those are the big ones. Most writers can\u2019t make a decent living writing only the things that they want to. But I can, and so can you. I\u2019ve been at this for a while now, and have seen the industry from many angles. Not only have I written more than 150 books in that time with my partners Johnny B. Truant and David W. Wright, but the three of us also started the first big self-publishing podcast (The Self-Publishing Podcast) back in 2012, when the Kindle was still in diapers. We also wrote Write. Publish. Repeat., which quickly became \u2014 and has remained \u2014 the industry standard. We know what we\u2019re talking about, and we also know there are straightforward steps that will get you exactly where you want to go. I\u2019m asked all the time, What would you do if you were just starting today? It\u2019s a great question. This is my answer: Step 1: Decide if self-publishing is right for you. Being an indie author isn\u2019t for everyone. For some, it might be the biggest mistake they could possibly make. Every writer is different, and you should never follow someone else\u2019s path without knowing where that person is planning to go. Heaven for them might be Hell for you. Ask yourself the following questions: How much control do I want over the content, editing, and cover design of my book? How well do I understand basic marketing and funnel design? How willing am I to learn? How fast am I able to go? Is writing a hobby or a business for me? For Sterling & Stone, it doesn\u2019t make sense to go Traditional. We\u2019ve tried. Our four traditionally published books are like the redheaded stepchildren of our studio. We can\u2019t control the content, the Calls to Action (CTAs) in the books, or a single element of our marketing. Our traditionally published books have infuriating typos that we\u2019ve begged our publisher to correct. We\u2019ve been told that this is too \u201chigh touch.\u201d Yet books we publish ourselves can have typos corrected in hours. Most of the strategies we use to sell our own books don\u2019t work for traditional titles \u2014 and even if they did, why would we try them? Why spend good money on traffic to a 15% royalty where we control none of the variables when we could send that same traffic to a book that\u2019s earning us 70%, where we can also measure, track, and improve our results? Besides, I want my fingers in the clay from beginning to finish. I love the entrepreneurial part as much as the artistry of what we do. So does everyone in our studio. So independent publishing makes sense for us. But for other authors \u2014 authors who want to write, write, write, going from one book to the next without worrying about any of the publishing minutiae \u2014 a traditional deal might make a lot more sense. You have to choose the path that\u2019s right for you. Step 2: Decide what \u201cmaking a living\u201d actually means to you. The economics of self-publishing have flipped the traditional model. I\u2019m not suggesting that you quit your job today and make writing your full-time profession, but I can\u2019t count the number of authors I know who already have. Some are making more than they were before \u2014 a few substantially. All of them are happier. And isn\u2019t that what this is all about? The money can be great if you treat your writing like a business. You don\u2019t have to be a New York Times bestseller. You don\u2019t even have to be in brick-and-mortar bookstores. Thousands of authors are making a comfortable living walking the indie path. Fortunately, that\u2019s not about luck. It\u2019s simple math: Let\u2019s say you charge $2.99 for your book. (That\u2019s the low end. You\u2019ll probably charge more, but let\u2019s play conservative.) At 70% royalty, you make $2.10 per book. If all you sold was five books per day, you\u2019d earn $10.50, which is $315 per month. Not bad for a sideline income. You only had to write the book once. What if you sold 10 books a day? That\u2019s $630. What about 100 books? You\u2019d make $75,600 per year. \u201cBut wait,\u201d you cry. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can sell 100 books a day!\u201d I bet you can. Sixty-thousand words is a decent length for a book. Just 460 words a day will give you two full-length books a year, and you still get weekends off! Let\u2019s say you sold 10 copies a day of each book, and you added two new books a year to your catalog. It wouldn\u2019t be long before you could be up to that 100 books a day and replacing your regular income. And guess what? As an indie author, you aren\u2019t limited to two books a year. You can release as many as you can write. We know a lot of full-time authors who were born in less than two years. You don\u2019t need to get lucky to make a full-time career as an indie. You don\u2019t need a home run. You need to sell 100 books a day. And the best way to hit 100 books a day without tearing your hair out? Step 3: Research the market and know your genre. So few writers do this, indie or otherwise, but those who do, and do it intelligently, are killing it. Most indie authors will never even make a minimum wage return for the time they spend writing. But some are able to make six figures or more and make it look easy. They\u2019re writing books that people want to read. That\u2019s deceptively simple. You\u2019re probably thinking, Well, of COURSE they write books people want to read. But for these authors that isn\u2019t an accident, it\u2019s research. They know exactly how their books will resonate with their audiences because they took the time to find out. \u201cWriting to market\u201d isn\u2019t a bad thing. It just means you\u2019re writing great books that people want to read. Successful books should always be about the reader, not about you. But then there are the writers who get it wrong on the other side. The sellouts, trying to cash in on a hot trend with little affection for or knowledge of the genre. Even when you\u2019re writing for a specific market, you have to love what you write, or it won\u2019t be sustainable. And besides, readers can smell an outsider. If you don\u2019t belong, they\u2019ll let you know \u2013 with poor reviews, anemic sales, and no buy through to your other titles. The best way to make great money as a fiction author is to find the intersection between what readers want to read and what you love to write. Chances are, that\u2019s some of the stuff that you like to read, too. If not, start reading now. You must read your market. Don\u2019t skip this step. More than anything, take the time to ask yourself what you should be writing. We have something in our company that we call \u201cGenre Therapy.\u201d It was born by accident when one of our authors who had been writing romance forever discovered that romance was not her right genre. Every one of us has gone through this process, and it has led to significant insights, one hundred percent of the time. The process involves asking ourselves a lot of questions about why we are attracted to a particular type of story. Many writers try to create what they love to consume, and that is often a mistake. Explore genre and find a home. Take the time you need to explore, without getting stuck. Because eventually, you do have to write. Step 4: Write (and professionally edit) the BEST novel you can. Yes, you can hack the algorithms at any given time. But this will always be a short-term solution to a problem you are continuing to make for yourself. It\u2019s like trying to build a business on black hat SEO tactics, hoping that Google won\u2019t change the rules \u2013 when they always do. Why would you want to constantly keep searching for water when you could take the time to build a well, then never look again? Hacking Amazon \u2014 playing into their algorithms \u2014 can get you sales, but it\u2019s a difficult way to earn diehard fans. Again with the SEO analogy: a gamed search result might get you some eyeballs, but it hardly helps you build a tribe. So instead of looking for hacks, write books that resonate with your ideal reader. Write the book she wants to tell her friends about. Make her want to buy everything else you\u2019ve ever written. THAT is how you build a sustainable career where you\u2019re making more every month. Think long term. Every book is an asset. When you build a strong catalog of quality work, you\u2019re getting in early, buying high-value stock at a low price. There is no half-life to a well-told story. My grandchildren will be making money from work I finished last year. But if I took shortcuts, and worried about buyers rather than readers, I\u2019d have a portfolio of penny stocks, and I\u2019d deserve nothing more. Step 5: Repeat. Repeat. Nope. That\u2019s not a typo. This is one of the biggest lessons we\u2019ve learned over the last few years, and one that\u2019s helping to exponentially grow our business. I wouldn\u2019t publish my first book until I had a few more already done. It\u2019s extremely tempting to immediately monetize your first book. It makes sense. You\u2019ve invested a lot of time. You\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into this endeavor, and you\u2019ve finally finished. Now you want the confetti. But the truth is, you\u2019re not as special as you think you are. There are countless authors better than you. Not because there\u2019s anything wrong with you, they\u2019ve just been working harder and longer. If you don\u2019t have another book, or someplace to send that reader when she\u2019s just finished with your story, she will almost surely forget about you and move on to another author. No offense. You don\u2019t want a reader to fall in love with you then have no way to lead her to the next thing to read. Indie authors have been multiplying for years. The market\u2019s never been more crowded, and readers have short memories. Prepared authors will go further, faster. If any of us at Sterling & Stone was starting right now, we wouldn\u2019t publish a thing until our first three books (in the SAME series) were all finished. Why three books in the same series? Because that gives us an ideal funnel: Book One: FREE. This gives our series maximum attention. We can send traffic to a book with zero friction. When you\u2019re just starting out this can throw a tornado behind your tumbleweeds. Book Two: FREE and PAID. Publish your second book for full price, but also offer it as an incentive to get readers who liked your book onto your list. Book Three: PAID Most authors are in such a hurry to monetize their first book that they can\u2019t see how much they\u2019re losing. Be the tortoise, and let the hare think he\u2019s won (that guy is such an asshole). Never trip over dollars to gather a few pennies. Create and wait whenever you can. Step 6: Build an email list. We all know about the value of an email list for businesses or a non-fiction platform. But for fiction? Build a list before publishing the book? Yeah, sort of. You\u2019re not really building the list so much as preparing to build it. But that\u2019s not the sort of thing you want to be behind on. Before your funnel is launched, prepare for your traffic. This is non-negotiable. Even if you\u2019re selling thousands of books a day through digital retailers, that isn\u2019t good enough if you\u2019re never bringing your readers home. Buyers aren\u2019t enough\u2014you want fans. And it\u2019s much easier to turn buyers into fans when you can communicate with them on your terms. Your website needs to do a lot less than you\u2019re probably thinking, or than most authors realize. Don\u2019t waste a ton of time, or thousands of dollars. Until you have a fanbase, you don\u2019t even need a blog (and I\u2019d argue that, even then, a fiction author never needs a blog). Here\u2019s what your website needs: A simple landing page with a single job: to present a potential reader with your offer.Your offer. A short story, your free Book 2, your grandmother\u2019s recipe for gumbo in exchange for an email. Just make sure it screams value. Put as much effort into your cover and description as you would anything you\u2019d expect them to buy.A welcome sequence. Don\u2019t invite your reader into your house and then ignore her. Send a welcome email and a simple autoresponder that welcomes this new reader into your world.Step 7: PUBLISH. You\u2019ve got your first three books ready to go. You\u2019ve got your funnel built. You are ready to start the engine. But there are three things you need to invest in before you hit the Publish button, things that will pay you back exponentially. If you skip these, you\u2019ll be wrapping shackles around your books\u2019 ankles, tying them into a chain gang, and telling them to run. Invest as much as you can in your cover. Don\u2019t be cheap. Not here. Your book\u2019s cover is its number one conversion element. Spending $5 on a cover at fiverr instead of several hundred from a designer might be the most expensive mistake you can make.Write a kick-ass description. Or, better yet, pay a copywriter to do it for you. Either way, take off your author hat. This isn\u2019t a book report, it's a movie trailer. Drop tantalizing highlights so the right reader is ready to click BUY without even thinking. (ProTip: read the descriptions for the top ten or twenty books in your genre, see what they all have in common, and do that. They\u2019re working for a reason.)Include super-compelling CTAs at the beginning and end of each book. Your CTAs should include the one, single, next step that you want your reader to take. For example, in the funnel detailed above, your first book should offer the second book, and your CTA should basically say, \u201cOpt-in to my super amazing newsletter to get Book 2 \u2014 a $4.99 value \u2014 ABSOLUTELY FREE!\u201d Make sure you include the most compelling excerpt you can. This doesn\u2019t have to be (and probably shouldn\u2019t be) a full chapter. Think about a movie clip. Be intriguing.NOTE: It\u2019s important to set the stage that your book is \u201cnormally 4.99,\u201d or whatever. You don\u2019t want to train your readers to expect free books all the time. Also, please don\u2019t ever use the words \u201csuper amazing newsletter.\u201d Step 8: Do it again. This is the fun part. Your books are finally live. Real people who aren\u2019t your mom are reading and reviewing what you wrote. You\u2019re making money as a self-published author. Now keep going. Many authors make the mistake of seeing publishing their book as a finish line. You\u2019ll fly past them, if you see it as the starting gate for whatever\u2019s coming next instead. You want to continue writing for your ideal reader, so don\u2019t jump the rails here. Your reader enjoyed your book for a reason. If you just wrote epic fantasy, don\u2019t all of a sudden change to military sci-fi. Romance readers expect a romance, not a cozy mystery. You can expand later. But while initially growing your author platform and bonding with your audience, you need to stay consistent and teach them what to expect. This was a hard lesson for us to learn. I LOVE to genre hop, especially when writing with my partner, Johnny. We\u2019ve written fantasy, sci-fi (with a few different tones), horror, comedy, romance, literary, and stuff I still don\u2019t know how to classify. We want to be known as storytellers, and telling the same sorts of stories over and over won\u2019t serve the things we\u2019re trying to build long term. But this is a very expensive decision, and we don\u2019t advise anyone else to do it unless you really know why you\u2019re doing it. We would be making many times what we are now if we had simply followed this basic advice. So yeah. Keep writing. Step 9: Iterate. For me, this is even more fun than \u201cdoing it again.\u201d At Sterling & Stone, we\u2019re always seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t, shedding old processes to make room for new ones. We iterate a lot. It\u2019s core to what we do. Here are 10 areas to focus your iteration, in what I feel is a reasonable order. Constantly promote without constant promotion. Now that you\u2019re putting new work into the world, you should be gaining readers with every new release. But you want as much of your marketing to be done on autopilot as possible. Make sure that you have smart funnels set up so that readers can constantly find you and read through your catalog without you having to tweet your book 387 times. No one wants that. The better you understand how Amazon and other retailers work, the better job you can do with autopilot promotion. That gives you more time to\u2026Keep learning. Things are constantly changing. Not only do you need to keep up with those changes, but you also need to understand them. We never stop learning, doing, experimenting, or pushing things as far as we can so that we better understand our potential. Only after publishing fiction for four years did we finally understand that sending 100 qualified buyers (with compatible shopping histories) to a book on Amazon could yield more benefit than sending 1,000 random readers. This becomes ever more important as you grow your catalog, because \u2026Your catalog is your portfolio. Manage it well. Don\u2019t make the mistake of focusing on your new content at the expense of your older titles. This was also a hard lesson for us to learn, and one we\u2019ve invested heavily in correcting. You can do it right from the beginning. But be warned, this will require a bit of \u2026List hygiene and management. You need to identify your ideal reader, without being afraid to say adios to anyone who isn\u2019t. List building isn\u2019t an arms race. It\u2019s better to have 1,000 of the right readers than 10,000 random email addresses of people who don\u2019t even read. Take the time to clean your list. And tag them. Know WHO is buying which books, so that you can offer them the titles that they\u2019ll love most. Survey them, find out what they want more of, then offer that. If there\u2019s a new genre you want to try, find out which of your readers are most likely to follow you to that new genre before you invest months in writing there. Move from something like MailChimp or Aweber (where most authors are) to something more sophisticated like Active Campaign. With tagging in place, you can work on building \u2026Street teams. One author in our Mastermind hits six-figures with EVERY release and publishes every other month. She knows exactly how to get her readers working for her so that the buzz on every book builds into something substantial. She does more with a smallish list all by herself than most publishers do with a huge team for their biggest authors. With tagging and Street Teams in place, that\u2019s a perfect time to start thinking about \u2026Paid traffic. Right now the best ROI in this business comes from a company called BookBub. If you can land an ad, your book will get a metric ton of downloads. With a smart funnel in place, professional covers that catch the first-time buyer\u2019s eyes, a well-written description that compels them to click, and a well-crafted story that naturally leads readers from your promoted book into the next and the one after that, money will rain. Facebook ads are also great, but they take a lot of work to figure out. Amazon has their own in-house advertising platform. Over time, the specific types of paid traffic that work best will shift and change, but there will always be well-converting ways to advertise your funnel-starter book directly to the person most likely to love it and then read through your catalog. And remember, even break-even sales earn you readers, and if you\u2019re good at what you do (this all can be learned) then you can do it for life, and grow with every new release. But to do that, you\u2019re going to have to \u2026Outsource. Chances are you\u2019ve already done this. Your most important asset is time, and no one can ever make the things that you do. So hire people to buy you more of those minutes. You probably shouldn\u2019t be working on your website, designing your own covers or promo images, doing your bookkeeping, figuring out Facebook advertising, or anything else that is subtracting from the momentum that matters most. If your work is a pleasure, then every day is amazing. You can make that happen by trusting people to help you grow your business and yourself. You want to use the majority of your time to build new worlds, add titles to your catalog, or \u2026Find new ways to connect with your ideal reader. Now it might be time to blog. Or start a podcast. Or adapt one of your books into a screenplay. Maybe you\u2019re a musician (I\u2019m jealous) and want to \u201cscore\u201d your book. You have an audience. Show them how much you appreciate them by giving them new things to love. Every crowd is different, and yours will love you for some very specific reasons. Find out what those reasons are, then bond with your readers on their terms in a way that makes you happy and is relatively easy to execute. I encourage you to really \u2026Challenge yourself. If you stay comfortable too long, your art and ideas will die. Part of our business model at Sterling & Stone is to \u201cdo things that have never been done.\u201d So many artists waste their time searching for great ideas instead of taking the time to make their ideas great. We wanted to flip this around \u2013 to prove that ideas are everywhere, and that waiting for the perfect one decapitates your potential. You can always learn by doing. You\u2019re only cheating yourself if you don\u2019t work to push your art and commerce. Only then will you\u2026Be open to where this journey will take you. This is my favorite, because oh the surprises. My first love is film. I\u2019ve always dreamed of making movies, but never in a million years did I ever imagine that I would. At least not until recently. Now that has become our reality. Sterling & Stone will make movies one day. We have several lines in the water already, and 2019 is looking shiny and bright. The last eight years of self-publishing have been nothing like I expected, but I wouldn\u2019t have wanted them any other way.Be open to where things might lead you, and more than anything \u2026 Step 10: Appreciate All of it Appreciate and learn from all the valuable mistakes you make along the way. Those are the gold, so please don\u2019t leave them in the mine. We don\u2019t just make mistakes \u2013 we fuck up big, and then we talk about it. It\u2019s one of the reasons people like our podcast so much. We\u2019re not afraid to walk around with egg on our faces, because sometimes it\u2019s better to tell the story before we have the chance to scrub ourselves. Appreciate your readers and fans. Without them you wouldn\u2019t have the things that you have. We love our readers and are constantly thinking of new ways to please them, and enhance their experience. Appreciate the people who help you to get where you are. I\u2019m little without Cindy, my best friend and wife. She bought me a MacBook for my 30th birthday and told me to write. She\u2019s championed every idea and all my mistakes. Without Dave and Johnny, I\u2019m a guy with too many ideas and not enough brain. The storytellers at Sterling & Stone make me exponentially better than I could ever be otherwise. Gratitude shouldn\u2019t remain silent. Take the time to say \u201cthank you\u201d to the people who make your life possible. When you appreciate the good things, it will always feel like there\u2019s plenty. Keep telling stories and keep getting better\u2014because the only way you\u2019ll get better is by doing it. A lot. Cindy tried getting me to write for a dozen years before I managed to get a single word down. It took far too long to realize that storytelling isn\u2019t about education, it\u2019s about stories. If I did it, so can you. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, you can become rich when enough people buy your published book. You can also get rich by winning the lottery. The problem is that for each of them you have only a marginal chance of actually achieving it. Writing a book Before you can think of getting rich from a written book, first you have to actually write the book, which is not a simply feat by itself. Every year thousands of aspiring writers attempt it and only a fraction of them manage to complete a book. So if this is your way of getting rich, why don\u2019t you first try to write one? The chance of finishing a book are quite low if you\u2019re not invested and determined. Not to mention it will probably take you a year or even a few years working at it every single day. Writing a decent book Upon finishing your book you\u2019ve written a first draft. That by itself is a feat, but that doesn\u2019t make it a good book. You\u2019ll have to revise it a bunch of times to correct the flaws, to improve your prose, to make the story flow better, to make sure things are consistent throughout the book and then people have to read it. Eventually you\u2019ll need readers to tell you what you\u2019re doing right and what you\u2019re doing wrong, because you can only see things as you see them in your own mind. You don\u2019t know what other people think of it. They might find it brilliant, but they may also find it boring or uninteresting. Based on their feedback you can return to your manuscript and change things accordingly (that is, if not everyone says it\u2019s a crappy thing and toss it into the open fire), which may allow you to end up with a decent book. Publishing Next to the difficulty of writing a book and fixing its flaws, you\u2019re able to get it published. Traditional publishing will prove an obstacle as they have standards, which means that they expect a particular level of quality and intrigue from your story. Not to mention they want a good book, not a decent one. They also kind of expect you to write more books in a reasonable time-span, so you\u2019re not a one-hit wonder (if you even turn out to be one; lots of people don\u2019t even get proper sale figures to make a profit). When you\u2019re doing self-publishing, you\u2019ll have to think about having your typos corrected, what kind of cover you want, a good synopsis for the back of the cover or on the website where it\u2019s available and all kinds of stuff that have nothing to do with writing a book but with publishing. That may be a challenge by itself. Most people who do self-publishing fail to attract any readers. Marketing And the last part is that a book needs to be marketed. If you don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019ve published a book, nobody\u2019s going to buy it either. You have to tell them and make them understand that this book is something they are interested in reading. If you\u2019re doing self-publishing, you have to actually spend money to advertise. If you\u2019re doing traditional publishing, you have to hope they will do some advertising, but that usually means you still have to do a fair share on your own to make people aware of it. Of course, if you\u2019re a celebrity with a few million followers you can safely assume that a fair bit of those will buy your book, regardless of whether it\u2019s a good book. But I assume you\u2019re not a celebrity, so that means you\u2019re not going to be able to take that shortcut. You may garner a following, but that means you have to show them your writing first and hook them through that to keep coming back for more. In general that takes a few years before you have a reasonable amount of people that are willing to buy something from you. Though it still won\u2019t pay your bills if you end up with a mere 300 copies sold out of a following of 3000 people. Bottom line So yes, if you read all the above and consider it feasible, you\u2019re looking at at least a few years before you get to be published. And then people still need to find your books and actually enjoy it so much that they\u2019ll tell other people to buy it as well. If you can get a movie made out of it, even better. But consider this: if it takes you a year to get published and you get $2000 out of a first book that took you two years to write. How long do you think you\u2019ll have to write books to get rich? It may take decades as your first book is going to build a reputation, which is what most successful authors have to put in to get that far. And even then it\u2019s only a fair handful that managed to get to that point that they actually get rich. You may safely assume that in the past two decades, there haven\u2019t been more than a dozen or two authors who get rich through sales. I hope that answered your question somewhat. ",
