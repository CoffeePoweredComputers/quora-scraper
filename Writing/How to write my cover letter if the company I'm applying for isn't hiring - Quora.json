            "answer_text": "If they are not hiring you are wasting your time.  At best you will get a reject by email, at worst you will hear nothing as many companies do not bother to acknowledge or respond to speculative applications. Your cover letter and resume will either be deleted (if it is an email application), or just filed on an e-recruitment system.  Some companies have places they keep speculative applications, but few, if any of them look through them when they have a new job to advertise. I would recommend that you watch their websites, LinkedIn and sites they are known to advertise and then write an effective cover letter targeted to the job when they do advertise.  ",
