            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a tip about writing a book about a romantic loved one; don\u2019t write a book about it. Why? Because it\u2019s creepy. It\u2019s creepy when someone makes a book about you as their gesture of love, and can easily lead to your emotions being rejected by them if they dislike your idea of writing a book about them. Writing a book about a romantic loved one (assuming that it\u2019s romantic) is not necessarily a good idea. If you\u2019re writing a journal about them and keep it to yourself, that\u2019s completely fine; but writing an entire book on someone you love and share it with others can penetrate the privacy of the person you\u2019re writing about. If you still insist writing this book, at least give that person another name in your book, and don\u2019t write to much specifically, as your readers might figure out it\u2019s them you\u2019re writing about. Writing is commonly a form of communication and of receiving information. I don\u2019t believe you would want to expose info your love interest doesn\u2019t want to expose. I have never managed to publish myself in my high school\u2019s annual newspaper. One attempt failed specifically because I wrote too much personal information in my proposed article, and due to my immaturity and inexperience I was yet to understand the importance of being prudent when writing about people\u2019s lives, and exposing this information to public eyes. I will share this video from Sorrow TV as a demonstration. It\u2019s about a guy that wrote 221 volumes of a piece called \u201cOur Love Forever\u201d, a piece that focuses on his co-worker, recording every little detail of her. If that\u2019s not creepy, then I am unsure as to what else could be creepy and disturbing. Thanks to Charyl Traux for requesting my answer. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your relationship with that person; whether it's your parents, your spouse, your kids, your siblings, your friends or an ex. You can start the book by writing about the relation - what it means to the world, why it is important, how it was meaningful in your life, just to put a context and explain the relationship between you and the person. Then you can name the person and provide more details and continue with the history of the relationship, anecdotes and other interesting stuff. Hope it helps! P.S. I also soon aspire to finish a book on my life history and the fair share of moments that I had, so sharing the idea from there. ",
