            "answer_text": "Handwritten script won\u2019t do. There is no point in writing your story down on paper and then typing it on your laptop. Even traditional publishers don\u2019t take physical manuscripts anymore but ask you to send your works as a pdf/docx document over email. I think MS Word is the most powerful tool a writer can use. Editing and formatting is really easy and you can easily share it on other devices, which all support .docx format. ",
