Here\u2019s an example:\u201cI love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty.\u201d With that one comma. the sentence says that my parents are Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty. The Oxford comma clears the mystery:\u201cI love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty.\u201d Another example:\u201cAmanda found herself in the Winnebago with her ex-boyfriend, an herbalist and a pet detective.\u201d Is her boyfriend an herbalist and pet detective? Or is it:\u201cAmanda found herself in the Winnebago with her ex-boyfriend, an herbalist, and a pet detective.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It is not optional if your publisher or employer requires it. And it is really necessary NOT to use it if your publisher prohibits it. I\u2019ve written several books for commercial publishers. Their house style requires the Oxford comma. Why on earth would I not follow their policies? On the other hand, my husband writes a newspaper column every week. Journalists don\u2019t use the Oxford comma. Why on earth would I insert it into his work? When you\u2019re writing strictly for yourself, it\u2019s your choice. I like the Oxford comma, and I use it in letters and emails. If you don\u2019t like it, feel free not to use it \u2014 as long as you\u2019re writing independently and not on behalf of a company or organization that requires it. ",
