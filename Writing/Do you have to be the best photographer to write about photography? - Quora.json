            "answer_text": "Do you have to be the best photographer to write about photography? No, but you do have to be knowledgable, and to gain that knowledge you need experience. The more and more varied experience the better. I am not an exceptional photographer. I like to think I\u2019m pretty good, sometimes very good at some aspects of the craft, but best? Not a chance. But I do have a lot of varied experience that really helps, and my roots go back to the mid-1960s where I started in film, shooting and processing all my own black and white for many years. Experience is cumulative; knowledge gained by experience is cumulative. The more you do the more you know. My usual station is the far corner of the little-known Quora Photography Department (third floor, turn right, end of the hall), where I stay hunkered behind my desk answering mostly factual questions on photography and related topics. I don\u2019t often wander afield. Photography is my passion and I like to think that I know enough about it to intelligently pass some of that knowledge to you. I think it helps to write well. I use big words a lot but I write the way I talk, and I talk the way I think. I have fun here, and when it stops being fun I will stop. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to write about the art of photography you don't have to be a photographer at all. The history, the cultural significance, the social impact, the evolution. Nobody's ever going to wonder whether your shots are any good. Just like you don't need to be a painter in order to know about painting. On the other hand there are those that can recreate the style and technique of masters so faithfully that it's almost impossible to tell the fake from the original. Can they tell you much about the art of painting? Probably not. And then there's the craft of photography, and the science of it. It is essential to have first-hand knowledge when writing about technical stuff. A lot of the advice I see here and elsewhere on the internet seems to be written by those who know some theory but never actually got to try it out in practice. They read about the holy trinity of lenses, or about how you shouldn't even try to shoot a bird with a lens shorter than 600mm, or a portrait with a lens that's wide. They read it, take it for a given, and repeat that gospel to others. I'd like to believe they lack the experience, because the alternative is they never tried to go beyond the generic, cookie-cutter commonsensical advise. But at least this is done by photographers. There's much worse. There's no more soulless photography writing than the PCMag type gear reviews. No quicker way to kill your enthusiasm than reading a review of a phone camera written by a computer geek. Does anyone actually care what processor the camera uses? If I wanted specs, I'd just look at a nice table of them. This is where it's quite clear it should be photographers writing about photography. Taking test shots does not a photographer make. The technical side of photography can be just as creative as its output. You just have to be a little impractical and playful with it. Focus stack 250 images to show the eye of an ant, scrape off the layer of microfilters off the sensor with a chisel made out of a toothbrush, use a black and white camera to take a colour photo. And write about that instead of why you need a second card slot or a histogram in the viewfinder. You don't need to be an amazing photographer, but be a creative one. ",

            "answer_text": "No, obviously. Otherwise all of the photography writing would be by just one person. Different people bring different perspectives to a subject. oftentimes, people of different skill-levels can also bring interesting perspectives too. Photography is a big subject, there\u2019s lots to talk about. Physics and the science of light, technology and the state of the industry, art and expression, and that\u2019s before you start breaking off into all the different photography genres such as street, wildlife, travel, portraiture, etc. Then there are different writing objectives. Some people strive to teach, to help others understand technique or to explain things. Some want to share their journey, to entertain and to make people think about their own experiences. Some just like to show their photography and to put it in some kind of context. None of these things require that you be the best at any of those elements. If you\u2019re intention is to teach, then you should have a superior understanding of the subject, but you don\u2019t have to be the best, and you might not even need to be a photographer at all. If you are going to entertain, then your photography can be pretty bad and you can still achieve your goal. For myself, I\u2019ve been photographing for about a quarter century on everything from 8x10 rail systems in a product photography studio, to digital full frame, analogue medium format and everything in between. I enjoy writing about my experiences, and I hope that I have a better than average amount of knowledge to pass on. I may or may not be a good photographer (you can judge for yourselves[1]), but I\u2019m definitely not the best at anything. Footnotes[1] Iain Compton\u2019s albums | Flickr",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily but it helps. It also depends on what you want to talk about. If you want to talk about old cameras or super old photos then sure you can. Does it help to have a little bit of a background in photography? Of course. It\u2019s the same as sports announcers. Some NFL announcers have a huge background in football and were amazing players while others never played professionally but they have a deep knowledge about the game. It\u2019s the same with anything you want to write about. I would recommend that you at least know how to compose images and take photos because how are you going to judge other peoples photos if you have no knowledge about composition or lighting? This is not to discourage you from writing about photography because it\u2019s an amazing art and I believe more people should get into it. There are plenty of entry-level photographers that have huge followings on social media because they promote other photographers work. It\u2019s called a feature page. They also run very successful blogs and podcasts and make good money even though they aren\u2019t the \u201cbest\u201d photographer. I\u2019d say if you really want to write about photography then go for it! Let me know if you have any other questions! Wasn\u2019t sure if I answered that completely. ",

            "answer_text": "What is more important is to be a good writer. Take it from someone who has written five internationally published books on subjects I had no real experience in, but had a passing interest in. Some research, whether reading or by speaking to skilled practitioners, goes a long way. It also depends on the level of the audience you are aiming at writing for. The publisher I worked with kept asking me to write more books because I would always deliver the content on time, and it needed almost no correcting for grammar, spelling or facts. There are plenty of very talented people out there who are great at photography, or whatever, but who cannot construct a coherent sentence, never mind a whole paragraph. There are also plenty of so-called professional writers in the same boat whose reputations are saved by judicious sub-editors. The old saying goes, \u201cThose who can do, do. Those who can\u2019t do, teach\u201d. But teaching is a skill in itself. I was actually invited to give a lecture at a US college (I live in the UK) following the success of my first book. I turned it down with the reason that I\u2019m a writer not a talker - and a touch of the imposter syndrome. Sadly, there are lots of people on YouTube who have great presentation skills and have become \u201cYouTube famous\u201d, and through that become \u201cexperts\u201d and yet they make fundamental mistakes when talking about photography, whether it is terminology, techniques or concepts. I have been taking photos for 50 years (I started young), and I\u2019m now considering writing a book about photography, partly because the current global situation means I have the time to do it, and I actually have the experience to back up what I want to say about the niche I would write about, and a genuine enthusiasm for the subject. Also print-on-demand means I can be in control of the publication, without any added expenses. If you want to write about photography, do it. Find your niche. Make your own blog, or find somewhere that you can submit articles to. You\u2019ll soon find out if you are any good at it and whether you want to continue. Just be aware that it is a very saturated market because nowadays everyone seems to be a photographer and can post whatever they want online. ",

By that I mean if you have little experience, you can write about your learning process and how you improved your skills. If you not a great photographer but know how to use a piece of equipment well, you can write about that.

Of course there are some good photographers doing this but if they were really really good they would be shooting to get paid not talking about it. With photography everyone can learn the technicalities, and composition rules etc and the ideas behind a good photograph but that doesn't give you the instinct, skill or the \u2018eye\u2019 or opportunities to be a great photographer.

Clearly a good photographer is not the best on everything but still can talk about photography. The perception of the people who is the best photographer is relative. People like something that moves them, not necessarily to be the best pictures but it would be enough to say that is the best photographer. As a photographer, I aspire to be the best, to catch the best light, the best subject, I know what I want so I can talk about what I see in my camera and what I want to see and capture, So, I talk about photography.
