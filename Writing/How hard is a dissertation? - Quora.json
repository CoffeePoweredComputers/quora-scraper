            "answer_text": "A dissertation will probably be the hardest thing you\u2019ve done in your life to that point. It requires that you demonstrate that you have the skills to do research that adds to the total body of knowledge in your field, so it is not sufficient to repeat a prior study. So, you have to know the field, including what makes research in your field good or not, have an original idea, figure out how to research it and convince a committee that you are likely to succeed. That is your proposal defense. Once you\u2019ve got their okay, you have to create the research mechanism (e.g., design a survey, create a protocol) and validate it, conduct the data collection itself, which normally requires some kind of resources (varying widely, of course, depending on your topic) which you have to find and get, and likely some permissions (e.g., to collect the data or samples). You then have to plan an analysis that will address the questions (often framed as hypotheses) and then do the analyses. Then you have to write it up following usually rather strict standards (which will vary by the field). Rinse and repeat \u2014 you may need additional data collection, likely need additional analyses, and you will certainly rewrite most of it more than once. Then you have to convince your advisor that it is ready to be reviewed by the committee and for you to appear before them to defend it orally. So, hard\u2026and a lot of work. And, you have to do it without much help because it has to be your original contribution to the domain. ",
