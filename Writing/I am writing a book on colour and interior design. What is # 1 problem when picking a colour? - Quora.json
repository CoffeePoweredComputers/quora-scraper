            "answer_text": "I have spent years creating color palettes. I think one of the biggest issues or concerns was to make sure that the end product, in this case paint, matched the sample. Subtle variations that you may not think will make a difference can have a big impact on the entire color palette. The other issue is the way most people approach color is to pick 5\u20136 colors and then compare or check how they look in the space. That part is OK. This is where it can get complicated. If none of the colors work exactly as you had hoped. Most people including some professionals would then pick new colors until they find a grouping that works. Here's the issue as l see it. Starting with 5\u20136 colors you may end up with 20+ colors to choose from. It can be overwhelming. My approach is different and I believe more efficient as well. I believe the original 5\u20136 colors can be adjusted (adding tint) to reach the color that ultimately you are after. Picking through multiple paint colors can be maddening. Find someone who understands color theory and/or has the ability to adjust the paint and you will be far ahead of the pack. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming your \u201cproblem\u201d is with the color of the room your designing. From experience, light and it\u2019s sources are potential problems (or opportunities if you prefer a more optimistic approach to design). Be sure to test the color chosen for walls, floors and ceilings in different light settings. How many windows or artificial light sources will there be in the room and will they effect the color quality or mood of the room being designed? After all, color is simply how we perceive reflected light and the tone it sets. Understand first, the purpose of the room. Then, narrow your color choices down by preference or the psychology of how color affects mood. For instance, you\u2019re less likely to choose a bright, bold color such as orange, which invokes energy and action, for a bedroom that is intended for calm and rest. Of course there are exceptions but understanding the general rules of color psychology and light are the underlying problems many face when choosing color. ",
