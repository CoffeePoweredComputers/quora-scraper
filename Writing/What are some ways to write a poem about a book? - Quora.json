            "answer_text": "I\u2019d suggest that it depends a lot on the book. For example, if the book is The Fault in our Stars, you could consider some Shakespearean sonnets\u2014it would be an homage to the source of the title, which comes from Shakespeare, but also is a common form of poem for the themes of love and loss. If instead the book is I, Robot, you might consider some extremely technical poetry styles, writing in an unerring iambic pentameter with perfect abab cdcd efef rhyme schemes, to mimic how a robot might approach writing poetry.* Or, take non-fiction, let\u2019s say Gibbon\u2019s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. For that, you might consider writing an epic-length poem that mixes a few styles. For example, you could start with a few stanzas in iambic pentameter, reflecting the nonchalance and opulence of the Romans at the outset, then shift to a more desperate and driving style like a dactylic dimeter (such as is used to outstanding effect by Tennyson in his poem \u201cCharge of the Light Brigade\u201d), reflecting the onset of the \u201cbarbarians\u201d who eventually sack Rome. These are just some ideas to generate thought. :-D *: When I say \u201cunerring,\u201d I mean that there are no exceptions; every line should be always in an unwavering, perfect iamb with five feet, no exceptions. When I say \u201cperfect\u201d rhymes, I mean all the rhymes are exact rhymes (bold/cold, bean/green) and not near- or imperfect ones (such as can/stand). ",

A short snippet of something you have been inspired by\u2026. or also too many classic poets would take characters from other authors stories and add a prelude or afterword type story in poetic form or even just their opinion of the story.
