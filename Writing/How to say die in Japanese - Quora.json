            "answer_text": "Welllll \u6b7b\u306c (shinu) is the original form of the verb, but it really doesn't mean anything without any context. But then you could always say \u6b7b\u306c\u308f (shinuwa) which means whoever (me, you, he, she, it, they) is going to die. \u6b7b\u306d (shine) on the other hand, is the imperative of the verb, so you're ordering the other party to die. Of course, there are endless other variants on the theme :D ",
