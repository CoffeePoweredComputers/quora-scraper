            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on what I\u2019m writing about. If I am describing my personal experience or my point of view, I would certainly write in first person, because it authenticates the story. If I am describing a situation for someone, as though we could share the experience, or if I\u2019m using a metaphor or analogy to illustrate a point, I might use third person. I find it engages and enrolls people in the experience, so they can give feedback. My preferences are that people can relate to an experience. The kind of writing I do is not usually just telling a story, but more teaching or training as I am a coach. If I am describing a situation for someone as though they could experience it for themselves, I might use third person. Commonly, I use both, as I involve the person, but also relate my own experience to help them know that I understand what they\u2019re talking about. ",

Because when I\u2019m writing fiction, my characters are separate from me, and have their own thoughts, feelings and responses. When I am writing non-fiction, unless otherwise attributed, my opinions are my own, and that should be clear to the reader. ",
