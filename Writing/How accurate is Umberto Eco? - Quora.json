            "answer_text": "Umberto is not accurate. Neither is his intention. He plays with the mind of the reader, bringing into equation \u201cspecial\u201d events and gluing them together with the appearance of the truth, by using quasi-ignorant or biased or screwed-up characters. Hence the conclusions are always false. What is important is to know the twisted human mind, in search of the extraordinary where there is only ordinary. ",
