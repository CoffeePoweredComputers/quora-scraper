            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always tried to give my best in friendship or relationship, but none reciprocated even half of what I did for them. It is something that\u2019s hurting me today. It feels as if all my wounds have become fresh once again. People can\u2019t get away with all the shit they threw on me with a mere \u2018sorry\u2019. Years of suffering can\u2019t be washed away with a mere \u2018sorry\u2019. You can\u2019t break me and then tell me to be happy.  Actually, I\u2019m done with giving people innumerable chances. I gave someone three chances, only to get cheated later. I gave one of my friend infinte chances only to not get chosen in the end. I wonder why the damn people beg for another chance when they don\u2019t even have a pinch of respect for that another chance or for the foundation of relationship that we are sharing. I wonder why people shower with mushy talks and false promises when in reality they don\u2019t even mean it. The more chances I give, more I get disappointed. The more I get disappointed, more I get skeptical of connecting to new people. Yes, I\u2019m skeptical. But it\u2019s the only way to save myself from furthur damage and infidelity. I\u2019ve survived bad phase of my life all alone with no one\u2019s help or support and I\u2019m proud of it. At least, I\u2019m content that I have never wronged anyone both in friendship or relationship so far. Not even to those who once broke me completely. But I am sorry. I\u2019m done being played and manipulated. I don\u2019t care who you are, or the years of friendship we have shared but I\u2019m done with giving another chance! ",

            "answer_text": "I fell in love with someone, and we got our happy ending. Emphasis on the \"ending.\" But also on \"happy.\" I met my boyfriend just a few months before high school ended. We were two shy kids in the same economics class. We slowly fell in love. He asked me to senior prom, his first and last school dance (he's an introvert). He was my first boyfriend, and I was his first girlfriend. It was very special. Unfortunately, we are heading off to different colleges this fall (after just 4 months of us dating). On top of that, just weeks after summer break began, I went on vacation to Asia for more than a month. So while we were together for 3 months, we virtually have been physically together for only 2 months. I know 2\u20133 months seems very trivial, but it wasn't. We made many beautiful memories and were falling more and more in love. It was extra special since this was the first relationship for both of us, so we were learning many new things and experiencing love for the first time, together. Anyway, we briefly talked about our relationship plans for college, and we came to a light agreement that we'd stay together. We did not know what that meant until I went off to Asia and we got a taste of what long distance relationship would feel like. It was hard. Very hard. I was so used to seeing him every single day at school. Once summer break began, we saw each other every other day. So being apart from him for more than a month was, to say the least, extremely difficult. I missed him a lot and couldn't wait to see him again. I started worrying about how much harder it would be in college. And honestly, his lack of showing affection through texting and facetiming had made me quite upset at times. Sometimes I felt like he lacked emotion and care for me, or for anything really. That was hard for me to accept, as I'm a very emotional and affectionate person. I wondered if it was because he didn't like me as much as I liked him or he just wasn't as invested in our relationship as I was. Little did I know that he had depression. I found out a while after I got back from my vacation. When we were reunited, we hugged like there was no tomorrow. We were both absolutely ecstatic to be together again. We had a great time that day. I even spent the night at his house. And then, things started to downfall. He wasn't texting me as much, which I just sort of brushed off since he's not a big texter so we usually didn't text much. But my concern grew bigger when he wasn't asking me to hang out again when it's been days (and in my mind, we should be hanging out a lot since I finally got back home!). I asked him if he could FaceTime one night; he said he was going to the gym but that he could try to afterwards. Nothing. No call, no text, no nothing. I figured that he might have forgotten about it and just went to bed since he usually comes home from the gym pretty late. But I was still very concerned since he usually always calls/texts me back. He wasn't the type to forget things like this\u2026 was he just ignoring me? Well, we had made plans a while ago to go to a movie-in-the-park kind of thing that was coming up soon. After waiting to hear from him (and get an explanation for him not calling me that night), I finally called him to ask if he still wanted to go to the movie. I didn't talk about anything else. He said \"yeah,\" but he seemed a bit disconnected. I said that I felt like he didn't want to hang out with me, and he asked \"how come?\" I just said \"I don't know\u2026 am I wrong?\" All he said was \"yeah.\" I just let it go and said I'll see him tomorrow then. When he picked me up, we said hey. But he didn't smile at me like he did every time he saw me. Something was clearly off. We didn't even talk for the majority of the ride. He wouldn't talk much or smile at me when I tried to start a conversation. I felt so disconnected. When we got to the movie, I confronted him. I asked him if something's wrong. He said no. I told him that I felt like he didn't have feelings for me anymore. He said \"oh.\" That's it. I asked if he had anything else to say. \"No,\" he said. I gave up. He was not the guy I knew and fell in love with. He had changed into a completely different, cold person. Throughout the entire movie, I was frantically trying to think of possible reasons for his behavior. I couldn't find anything. The last time I saw him, just a week ago, we were so in love and happy. What could have gone wrong? He dropped me off at home that night. We didn't talk much during this car ride either. I cried silently while facing my window because I reminisced on how we used to be and on my memories of when he was so sweet and kind and loving to me. When we got to my house, I told him to park the car. I was determined to get an answer. He knew I was serious. I asked, \"you don't like me anymore, do you?\" He seemed a bit startled, like he didn't know what to say. He just shrugged. I repeated my question. A tear dropped down my face. When he saw it, it was like he snapped out of it and suddenly became really concerned by the fact that I was crying. He put his arm over me and asked if I was okay. I just kept crying, he was rubbing his hand on my neck to comfort me. I repeated my question once again. He still didn't say anything. I asked him, \"can I ask why?\" He looked really uncomfortable, as if he was slightly panicking because he didn't know how to act in this situation. I asked, \"was I being too clingy?\" He didn't respond. I asked if it was because of what would be the most probable reason: college. And yes, that was the right answer. He said, \"yeah, I don't think college is going to work..\" He said it very solemnly. When he said those words, it hit me very painfully. But I remained composed; after all, it's expected. I called him out on how he treated me that day. He apologized and said he didn't want me to feel bad. He was being genuine, I saw it in his eyes. I said that even though I knew that college long distance wouldn't work for us, that I still love him a lot. I told him that I would like to spend the rest of the time we have, together. And that's when he broke the news to me. Boy did I not expect to hear this from him. He said, \"There's actually something I have to tell you. Only my family knows.\" I gulped. \"While you were away, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.\" When he said that, my heart dropped. All of a sudden, everything made sense. How he seemed so emotionally numb and absent-minded all the time. Then I felt like a villain. Flashbacks stormed my head of the few times I got very upset at him because of super trivial things. And how I assumed that he didn't care for me and that he'd never faced adversity in his life like I did. I swear, I thought he had a perfect life. I thought he was happy. I immediately hugged him. I couldn't say anything to him other than that I was so sorry. He said, \"it's ok, it's ok. It's not your fault.\" He's been getting therapy and taking medication. \"I'm focusing on that right now..\" he said. Which I knew basically meant that he didn't have the leisure to date someone right now. I understood, and I respected that. After all, how could he love me and try to make me happy when he doesn't even love himself or isn't happy himself? I'm sure he had a hard time juggling with that. Because a relationship is a two-way street. Both people should be happy and should be able to make the other happy too. I just kept crying, and he asked if I wanted to hug. I immediately said yes. As we broke apart, he kissed me on my cheek. It reminded me that we're breaking up, yes, but we're breaking up with love. And that made me very happy. I kissed him back. I saw his face as I left the car and closed the door; he looked very dark and\u2026 sad. It was my first time seeing him look so sad like that. That's the story of my first love. It's been a couple of weeks since I last saw him. Life has been tough for me. I am heartbroken, and I even feel miserable at times. I miss him very much. But hey, if we're meant to be, then we'll be meant to be. I guess I'll just sit back and let life take its course. Meanwhile, I wish the absolute best for him. I still love, cherish, and care about him so much. He will always remain special in my heart. I will always love him. ",

            "answer_text": "This is an entry in my journal Lately in HOPE Squad. We've been talking about \"Why Me?\" Why do I have trials and why do I have these specific trials.So I'm going to answer that question. Why Me?Why did (and probably still do) I struggle with depressionWhy can't I explain my emotions to my familyWhy do I procrastinate? Because of my faith, I am told that the Lord God gives us trials to test us. That this whole life is one big final exam. But I want to throw that out for a moment. Like the Kelly Clarkson song, I believe that trials are given to us to make us stronger, to make us more resilient to the world. I honestly don't know why I struggled with depression other than God wanted me to experience it. I can say with most certainty that I am a naturally closed off person. I find venting my anger on technology and with close friends to be more effective than talking to my parents about things. It's just the way I am. As to why I procrastinate. I recently listened to a TED Talk by a guy named Tim Urban. He said that in the mind of a non-procrastinator, they have a rational decision maker controlling their brain.A procrastinator's mind has the same rational decision maker just with a first mate along for the ride.Its name is the Instant Gratification Monkey. Now the Instant Gratification Monkey is quiet for most of the time, but when you really decide to be productive... Ooh your new favorite YouTuber released a new video today. Or ooh that news article looks intriguing let's read it. The monkey takes control of the wheel and suddenly 3 hours have passed and you haven't gotten a single thing done. It's not until you're nearing a deadline that the Panic Monster gets the monkey off the wheel and guides you to where you need to be. I have been trying hard not to let my inner demons and that monkey control my life but sometimes it's just so hard to. That's my \"Why Me?\" story ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do. I spent most of my life in daydreams that led nowhere in order to escape an extreme case of bullying during much of my childhood. I ended up making a bucket list out of it and have attempted to cross off the list I made when I was thirteen. I was looking back at the list today and broke into sobs. I failed myself. This was my list, it's very short\u2026 Be married by eighteen and have two babies, or girls. I'm thirty and never been even in a relationship that lasted more then six months.Publish a book and get famous. Technically if I erase the last part, I can check it off. I did publish a book that I love. It's dark, depressive, scary, and traumatic\u2026just like me. I hear good things from those who read it but I never been good at marketing and I have no idea how to promote it more. I learned it takes generally seven novels to get enough money to be able to work part time so that is my new goal.Dont be a virgin when I'm thirty. I accomplished this oneBe a slut for a day-dont ask. Apparently, little me wanted to sleep around. Maybe she thought by sleeping around I wont end up alone. Well, jokes on her, I'm still alone.Don't be raped. A teacher pointed me out in class in the fourth grade saying I'll most likely be raped. It scared me back then definitely since sex only ends in three scenarios: STD, rape/murder, or pregnancy. I know think the teacher never experienced a good lay and was bitter about only having disappointing sex and took it off on a fourth grade class.Have lots of friends. When you go from zero friends, dreaming about being popular is amazing.Dont commit suicide.Get rich\u2026I laugh about this one. It'll never happen.Get big boobs\u2026damn child me\u2026That's it. That is all a sixth grade child wanted out of life. I was shocked to see how dark this list was. I have accomplished probably four out of the nine. The only thing I'm proud of is that I published a novel I wanted to write. The rest\u2026I wished at times I did die. I wished I did get ran over by that tractor when I was four. However, I made it to adulthood, and I am happy about that. I still dont expect to live to old age. I still think I'm going to end up murdered like the teacher told me in the fourth grade. I was almost kidnapped more then once and had a couple of stalkers so I guess it could be PTSD talking but it is a feeling I remember having since childhood, that\u2019ll I will be killed. I look at the list and I can see my very blonde self sitting on the monkey bars and staring over the fence of my school and overlooking what used to just be a field. I remember my best friend sitting next to me, chatting about movies and starting a band together. I remember my other friend still alive. I remember my classmate with her ten toes (she would lose eight in a lawnmower accident which was really not a accident. Her dad purposely ran over her toes). I remember the two mean brothers who lived on my street and whose father committed suicide after being found out to be a pedophile, I remember my bullies getting ready to climb up the bars to throw me off. I can remember being young and naive and too hopeful that I trusted too easily. I remember the nice teacher assistant who spent time trying to motivate me to try in both school and life. I remember crying when I woke up every morning and realized I survived the night and that meant I had to go to school only to be emotionally abused by nearly the whole population at school. I remember my own teacher calling my parents to pick me up to give me a day break of the abuse. I remember my mom and dad begging me to let them move me to another school and I declining every time because I didnt Want to let them win. I didnt want my bullies to know they beat me down. I remember when I stopped feeling accepted in society and that it took four years for me to give up on people. It has taken me twelve plus years to trust people and even now, the first time they lie, our relationship will never be the same, again. I remember thinking my adulthood would be better then my childhood. I still stupidly think it'll get better. I'll give it another five years and then I'll give up. I don't care about being rich or famous, I just want to know I made a difference, even to just one person. ",

            "answer_text": "Well firstly i wrote this answer being anonymous now i am writing it with my account! I wrote it previously to question https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-emotional-picture-youve-ever-seen/answers/122214111?ch=3&share=b2b91624&srid=ugrzf  Who is she? What happened to her!! U all might be thinking! Actually she's a seven year old girl who was found in a public park in delhi before she was raped and murdererd brutally and her face was completely destroyed! Ashamed of humanity? According to reports // before her postmorte Less than 12 hours after she went missing from her house, the body of a seven-year-old girl was found inside a park in outer Delhi\u2019s Nihal Vihar Sunday morning, police said. While her limbs were tied together and two ropes were found dangling from her neck when her relatives found her, police suspect she died of an injury to her head caused by some \u201cblunt object\u201d. Seju P Kuruvilla, deputy commissioner of police (outer Delhi), said even though the girl\u2019s clothes were found to be intact, the police are waiting for the autopsy report to ascertain whether she was sexually assaulted. Maintaining that a murder case under IPC section 302 has been registered at Nihal Vihar, the officer maintained that the probe was still its preliminary stage and there was no clue about either the killer or the motive behind the murder. This is the fourth incident in the last 20 days wherein bodies of girls or women have been found in the national Capital. On January 27, a six-year-old girl\u2019s body was found stuffed in a sack and dumped near her home in Samaypur Badli. On January 19, the body of an unidentified minor girl, with her throat slit, was found in a sack in central Delhi\u2019s Daryaganj. Two days later, dismembered body parts of an unidentified woman was found in an agricultural field in outer Delhi\u2019s Alipur. So far, all four crimes have remained unsolved. Elaborating further on Sunday\u2019s crime, police said the girl who was murdered used to live with her parents and younger sister in Nihal Vihar and her father works at a factory. \u201cThe two girls were born to the family after lots of prayers. The younger one was born deaf and mute. The girl who was killed was a support to her parents,\u201d the girl\u2019s aunt said.  Reminiscing about the fateful 24 hours, the girl\u2019s mother said that her two daughters left for the local market around 8pm on Saturday. \u201cMy younger daughter who is five years old wanted momos and was crying a lot. So I asked my elder one to accompany her,\u201d said the girl\u2019s mother. But suddenly, the elder girl went missing from the momo stall so the younger one returned home crying, the mother said, adding, \u201cWe immediately began searching for her but in vain. Around 10pm, we approached the local police.\u201d Alleging that the police were not responsive, the girl\u2019s aunt said, \u201cHad the police searched for her actively, she would not have been killed.\u201d But the DCP said a kidnapping case was registered at Nihal Vihar police station on Saturday night. \u201cWe searched all night but couldn\u2019t trace her,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, the girl\u2019s family again set out to look for her. \u201cWe visited the Nihal Vihar park. We found her body around 6.30am at a garbage-littered spot in the park,\u201d said the girl\u2019s aunt. \u201cHer hands and legs were folded and tied together,\u201d said the aunt. After reading above Where this world is heading. I feel disgraceful calling myself one of those species who killed that innocent 7 year old soul! Is sex everything today ? No matter how u do it? Are girls in our country so un safe? Or that 7 year olf was wearing a mini skirt and seducing men? I feel shame Save girl! Save humankind  ",

            "answer_text": "About my Evil Mother. She doesn't have basic manners and discipline. Her suspecting attitude was apathetic and filled my childhood, adolescence with insecurity and hopeless. I was a helpless victim all my childhood constantly under abuse. My adolescence was worse. She started having an affair. And she wanted to get that guy married to me, so her affair would continue without glitches. My mom and her lover. Both would torture me. Their cruelty was beyond hell. To shift the focus from their affair, she diverted my dad's focus on me with complaints and allegations. She alleged that I have a boyfriend and I was characterless, so she could use the same reason to get me married soon to her lover. When I was in class 12. One day, My maths teacher took my help to write a letter to get her gas connection change of address since she shifted to new house. I tore two sheets out of my books to write a letter. I wrote two letters. One for practice and one final. Unfortunately, the practice letter was retained in my book. When I returned home, as usual. My bag and books were checked. They found the letter. The gas connection was on my teacher's husband's name. So, the letter was addressed with his name 'Venkatesh'. This was enough. My mom pinned stories around. She alleged that, It was the letter I wrote to help my lover when he shifted the house. My helpless cries fell on deaf ears. Though my teacher herself called to clarify that, my Evil mother didn't listen to it. Because she was so adamant to pin false stories and allegations on me. Poor naive me, was the victim to her evil nature and I failed class 12. I was traumatized. God's grace or my luck. I was saved from this torture by my grandmother and maternal uncle. They rescued me. They took me to their house and I stayed there for 2 years. Gave exams again after 2 years, I passed with 65%. It seemed like an achievement. Being college topper in class 11, struggling to get 65% became an achievement. Can't help. Because the trauma and abuse made me so weak, that I lacked confidence. It's okay.. at least I got an opportunity to go to college again. She forcefully took me back, though I was reluctant to leave my granny's place. I believed I will be treated well now at least. But didn't. Amidst trouble I studied, took part time teaching job to fund my studies because my parents didn't pay for my education. Almighty bestowed me with enough strength and will. I completed MBA, worked in a good organization, now I am happily married to a good person. ",

            "answer_text": "My dad once told me before \u201cmarry someone who love you not the one you love\u201d Actually, i don\u2019t know what does love mean and how do i know if i\u2019m in love though i\u2019m 25 years old, not a young girl anymore not pertty either. So i decided to let love a side and marry someone suitable anyway.. and here it comes the problem  Someone very suitable, at least in my family\u2019eyes, asked to marry me . My family became very happy with the engagement and they started preparing everything for the upcoming wedding.. At first i refused the idea saying i\u2019m not ready for a relationship and so on, but later i gave in with their insistance. After the engagement i behaved normaly like i do every day, i tried to adapt and not to forget about my fiance , then he began complaining about how i neglect him and i don\u2019t look happy when he contacts me or comes to see me and so on .. I tried to make excuses saying that i wasn\u2019t used to being in a relationship and i wasn\u2019t used to having to look after someone else .. After that he complained again saying that if i wanted this engagement to continue, i had to change and let him feel that i really care about him , which wasn\u2019t true on my side. I told him \u201c i\u2019m not ready for a relationship\u201d and broke the engagement . I told my family \u201c i feel nothing for him\u201d and of course they didn\u2019t like my answer as the engagement didn\u2019t last long enough for me to feel anything . Now, they tell me that even we ,me and my ex-fiance, broke up 4 months ago he still wants to get back to me and try again , of course i refused. It\u2019s not a matter of getting back to him or not sometime i just feel worried that i might end up all alone by myself so i should get back to him if there\u2019s a chance. But then i say \u201cno i\u2019m absolutly fine alone i don\u2019t need anyone\u201d Am i wrong ? I don\u2019t know all i know that i feel comfortable now Sorry for my boring story.. ",

My husband\u2019s Family did not want us to get married so we opted for a court marriage. After this they accepted our marriage.My MIL didn\u2019t accept me from heart. She is very religious but her behaviour with me is not good, she taunts me everyday. I'm pregnant too. My mother was divorced when I was 2 years old. My grandma and grandpa raised us(my siblings and me) as they were British citizens while my mom stayed at home in Pakistan with us. MIL always said that people are used to saying bad things about my mother that she is characterless in front of her guests. Today she did it again. I just got shattered. I belong to a very respectable family. No one thinks about my mother like that. My mother lives her life like a tigress. Everyone respects her. When she said that, I was shocked and didn't say anything to her. Just came to my room and started crying. My mom doesn't deserve that. I told this to my husband and said I don't wanna live there. He said everyone has separate room here. If you felt bad, go and tell her. I can't believe someone who is very religious, near to God, how she can hurt God\u2019s creature. If I say something bad to her, what's the difference between me and her. I just wanted a shoulder to cry on. Just to tell my feelings. My husband is very good, loving. But I don't want to hurt him and I know he can't do anything, he'll just console me. Please pray for me and my child. Please pray that God gives me enough strength to protect me and my family. ",

In the year 2010, my son had got admission in Aiims New Delhi.Like any other parent I was very happy. But all this was short lived.the freedom lent at Aiims, New Delhi turned my child into a drug addict. This drug and alcohol culture at Aiims is rampant. Classes I can't tell what they teach but as far as I have heard from current batches it is bad to worse. My son's friend who joined mamc is a budding surgeon now whereas my son is seeking psychiatric help. Trust me, I am not the only parent facing this. Plz share this post so that more and more people become wary not to send their child to this institute and be very cautious. From a depressed papa. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I want to. Do you know what emotional trauma children go through the most? Watching mother's cry. Yes that's what is heart wrenching even when you are 6 or 16years. For obvious reasons, the latter age helps you understand that situation better for worse or better that's another question. No child will ever be able to forget who or what made their mother's cry. And I really mean it. I have seen my mother cry for days and nights For whole damn 2 years. Which made me question the word, Family. Being a child, I am not allowed to question them even after growing up. I still remember the helplessness I felt. I still remember having heard no apology for the trauma they made me and my mother go through. You know what, this 22 year old still remembers. I learnt one thing, if you have issues please talk and solve. Donot take it to the extreme end where a mother cannot even hold back her tears infront of her children. I literally beg all people out here, both mothers and people living with them. I understand there will be certain days when there will be glitches in the family. There will be times when moms will be at fault. All I ask of you is understand that a child cannot ever forget the tears of their mother. Be it because of their mother's fault or someone else's. I have been in that situation. I cannot forgo a single person even after 6 years. Everytime I see those people, I find myself standing by the days when their words had hurt my mother. I won't say don't, I just say this is what changes a child. It changed me. ",

I mean, I've been in depression for months, been suicidal, have urges to cut myself suicidal and kill myself to end the suffering. But founding just a little ray of light, I'm walking on, carefully holding each piece of me, and then this person comes and speaks that and shatters my once-collected self again. And I believe that does happen with most of us suffering from this. Guys, I have just one request to you all: do whatever you wish to do, but please don't say such a sentence to a depressed person. Personally, I felt like life was moving so quickly and I was missing out on everything and I wasn't able to catch up, and there's no point in living anymore. You never know what can hurt a person's heart. You're completely oblivious. Depression might be a \u201cphase\u201d, but telling person to just \u201cstop being lousy and get yourself together\u201d is just like telling a cancer patient to remove the cancer on the spot. Makes no sense, right? ",

You constantly ask yourself questions like: \"I'll be enough\" \"Why am I having this?\" \"Why am I not sure?\" And, probably, he forgot the most important things, he also kept away from the new things, simply because you think you're always going to fail, the thoughts started from i was teenager and at the beginning not My faults. It was just what others said and the things I received, until it stayed in my mind. It is very sad to think that we always evaluate the perception of oneself by comparing ourselves with others, and we believe that we did.. what we did? ... the comparisons are not healthy, unfortunately we always do it unconsciously. I completely changed my physical appearance in recent years, now I am a different person ... but even though sometimes those thoughts come back, it does not feel good to have ups and downs about self-love. No matter how much weight you lose, no matter how many things you do, it does not matter at all, but first I love myself, that will simply be useless. Being afraid and insecure is not fine, it is good to cry, it is good to feel pain, that makes us human. But I just want to leave those thoughts and start being completely happy. .. you can not live your life stagnant, it's not fair! I know it's not easy, but ake your time and have small changes daily. And block those thoughts from your mind. I HAVE FAITH ON YOU. RESPECT AND LOVE YOURSELF FIRST TO LOVE OTHERS. \"Treat others as you would like them to treat you.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Nearly 45 years ago, a beautiful girl as my age goaded me into appearing in the Civil Services Exam. She had been herself preparing for the exam already for quite sometime. As I had an instant crush on the girl I was all too happy to go with her wish. Now on, our long sessions of preparation for the exam. began in right earnest. I, on my part, had a double mission or motive you can well understand - to pass the exam. and (consequently) realise my crush. One day while studying together our \u2018Indian History\u2019 subject at the lawns of some scenic place, as we stumbled upon a particular race, she began taking undue interest in the topic asking me questions like : Are these people really very valiant? Her facial expressions sought an affirmative answer. But I was stubborn, \u2018No, they hadn\u2019t ever won a single battle against the Mughals while my race had won many,\u2019 I declared excitedly. Though she looked a little morose at my reply, I failed to realise that she did not relish my reply. And so it went- while my race was valiant, the one she referred to wasn\u2019t. As I had taken up the preparation at a very belated stage, hardly three months before the exam., I had no time to prepare for my optional subjects. Under the circumstances I chose to appear in the compulsory subjects only to gain experience and then go wholehog the next year. To my joy, my marks in the compulsory subjects were impressive : Essay-112/150, English- 100 plus/150, GK-100 plus/150. The essay I wrote was - The economic and political impact of oil bomb. However, my crush who failed had other grand designs. In fact she had been in another such association all along with a boy of the so-called valiant race that I had belittled unintentionally and who had made into the allied services of the Central Services Exam.,a year or two earlier availing himself of the reservation quota. This is how my race went down fighting and the battle was won by the non-valiant without a fight. Today, I am an established grammarian to reckon with. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid I might kill myself in the future. There are multiple reasons why I think that will happen. I think as soon as something tragic hits our family, which i\u2019ve been feeling for a while to happen, I will fall into a greater depression than I\u2019m currently in and just kick the bucket. Let me tell you why i feel like this will happen. I don\u2019t think anyone knows i have a Quora account, so I really hope people that know me don\u2019t find this out. It would just bring unnecessary attention. Reason 1: I have major anxiety problems that make my life a misery. I\u2019m not a psychologist, so I can\u2019t say for sure whether i have depression, generalized anxiety or something else. I\u2019m afraid of going outside. Even a few steps. The tought that tomorrow I will have to go outside and be there for more than a while makes me sick in the stomach. My muscles get really tense, especially my leg and neck muscles. I can\u2019t breathe properly. I\u2019m afraid everyone watches me, since I\u2019m reallllly skinny and my cheap worn off clothes don\u2019t fit me well ever. Whenever i have to go to some new place I\u2019ve never been with people I\u2019ve never met I have major panic attacks. I feel like throwing up. I get pale. My stomach hurts. My hands get cold. My legs stiffen. This anxiety problem has gotten so bad in time. I am afraid to look for a job. I\u2019m afraid volunteer, I\u2019m afraid of anything new. When I\u2019m with people I know, however, I calm myself down a little bit. I don\u2019t feel 100% miserable which allows me to eat a little before a panic attack hits again. Another thing happens though. I have 0 energy. I can\u2019t hold on conversations too long. I get really quiet. I just stay, staring into nothing and thinking. People noticed that too. They think I\u2019m ignoring them because I\u2019m too cool. Reason 2: I don\u2019t fit in anywhere. Literally nowhere. Never have i felt like i fitted in. School, highschool, college. Nowhere. I don\u2019t fit in anywhere. When I\u2019m at some bar (which rarely happens) I feel like I\u2019m an intruder. When i eat out somewhere, I feel like I don\u2019t belong there.  Reason 3: I have few to no friends (which is connected to the previous reason). While I, as a person, prefer not having friends, I have just a few, 4 max, out of which only one lives in the same town, the others being scattered in the whole country. I don\u2019t know what to say. My relationship with my friends has always been different from what your typical friendship looks like. We don\u2019t go out. We don\u2019t spend time together. We don\u2019t talk like normal people about normal problems. It\u2019s a cold relationship. I just wanna go out with people I share similar interests with, and have fun, spend time together, forget about how stressful life is. I\u2019m not looking for a girlfriend. I don\u2019t care about that much. I\u2019ve already accepted I\u2019ll probably never find someone to match me well anyway due to this crippling anxiety. Reason 4: I don\u2019t have dreams. I don\u2019t look into the future. I don\u2019t have a dream job. I don\u2019t have hobbies. I don\u2019t look forward to tomorrow. I don\u2019t wanna visit some cool place in some cool country. I don\u2019t wanna \u201cwatch the sunset off of the cliff of Himalaya\u201d or whatever. I barely have any energy to function let alone go to some place. I only have myself and the university. When I\u2019m not at uni, I\u2019m home alone. When I\u2019m home alone i get stressed out because i don\u2019t volunteer or get into any extra uni thing. My CV will suck. I will end up having a damned job. That\u2019s just how things are in Bucharest. Everyone can get into uni. Anyone can finish it. It doesn\u2019t matter to the manager all that much if you have a uni degree. He cares about extra. I am too anxious for extra. In the last 6 years i haven\u2019t had a break. Yes, I did stay an awful amount of time at home. Is it a break? No. It isn\u2019t. When you have nothing else to do but stay at home and wait for time to pass it\u2019s not a break. It\u2019s a prison. Reason 5: My family is sick. They never go to the hospital. I know they are sick. Headaches, back pains, body pains, memory loss, short attention span. My grandmas definitely are very sick both physically and mentally. When they will die, which i know it won\u2019t be very long from now, sadly as it is, my parents will live a few years of peace finally. Never did they have peace ever in their lives. When they will be gone\u2026idk. It will break me. Reason 6: You know how people think of getting mature fast, having a family, getting a dream job, getting a dream house and car growing up. I\u2019m repeating myself, but i\u2019ve never had those. Not even as a kid. I never wanted to grow up. When kids were going out to date and see each other I was still trying to be oblivious of anything and watch cartoons. Till i was 14 I not only looked extremely young but also acted extremely young. Then the high school kicked me self-esteem all over the place. I didn\u2019t want to have to do stuff just for the sake of fitting in with the people. I didn\u2019t want to start drinking, smoking party and fuck. While you could argue that, yes, you can fit in without having to do all these stuff let me explain. I\u2019ve said i got major anxiety. It\u2019s not new. I\u2019ve had it my whole life. So, who did i have to spend my time with mostly. School colleagues. Who were they. People i didn\u2019t choose myself to fit my ideas of friends. Of course, in order to not stand out I\u2019d have to try at least to appeal to the loud masses (i.e. cool kids oblivious of anyone that like being loud and scream for no reason). However, I didn\u2019t really start trying to fit in until very late hence I\u2019ve always had a notorious status of the \u201cquiet shy little kid\u201d. It\u2019s a dark place to be in the friendless quiet shy little kid spot. Reason 7: I don\u2019t know. My mind isn\u2019t well organised right now. I might have repeated myself very often. I can\u2019t think of other reasons. I feel like crap daily. I\u2019m not looking for help here. Please don\u2019t write nice comments to support me or convince me oh life can be bad but you gotta toughen up and stay straight. I\u2019ve already given multiple people these pieces of advice trying to convince myself of them. Please, don\u2019t write these kinds of comments. I don\u2019t need you to upvote either. This answer is not for views or upvotes or anything really. I\u2019ve already intentionally crafted a few \u201ceasy viewers bringing answers\u201d. You can check my profile. They are the most viewed answers. I wanted to see for myself that sex and pretty girls in the thumbnail brings views, and oh boy did they bring some. I write this for myself. Trying to fill some empty space idk. This is a long ass answer man. Anyway, If i stop using Quora for over a few years it either means i got bored and forgot about it somehow for a few years or..you know. Since not many will read this anyway, since I didn\u2019t place any typical \u201csex, hot girl, i\u2019m a single mom and have been doing this and that with this and that person, lemme write anonymously for the sake of privacy\u201d (not to be disrespectful but these answers are everywhere and they are all the same), for those who DO read it, I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t try to comfort me or give me pieces of advice however good they might be. I\u2019ve never asked for help and will. That\u2019s just how I am. It\u2019s sad and close-minded but that\u2019s just how I\u2019m used to it. My mood swings from wanting to throw myself in from of the subway to being extremely cheerful and obnoxious all the time. I don\u2019t even know who i am anymore. If you don\u2019t hear from me for a loooong time that means I either forgot about Quora for a long time or\u2026yeah\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "My parents showed his matrimonial profile to me and asked for my approval. Since, I am already scared about arranged marriage, I started to search him in Facebook. I found him and started to have conversation. I started like, We will talk for some days, if our frequency matches then we will proceed orelse we drop. He agreed. We met, he came along with his well wisher (his dance teacher) and teacher's family. They gave a good confidence about that guy. He also seemed to be a good guy. I disclosed everything about me and cleared my doubts. I told him that I had undergone a minor surgery which won't cause any complications in future. I even told him that we can go to hospital to prove myself. He said that he won't need that and was happy for me. He gave a short note about him. The last line impressed me. Because, I m the person who like to live the life with full enthusiasm.  After that we had a official meet(bride seeing event) at my home. Both families were satisfied. My family asked for next event which is their family and relatives have to visit my home , followed that we have to visit their home with relatives. They denied to come. My parents got scared and did a background check. They rejected that guy due to some reasons. Since we felt that we are a having a good sync with each other. I convinced my parents that I won't get a guy like him. I, he and his well wisher made a plan to convince both sides. We had a met and executed everything( To initiate conversation between two families since it's stopped officially). Everything gone in a positive way. In between his well wisher supported me a lot. She said that he is mine. His nature is he won't use mobile much. I am the girl who expect a good conversation to understand each other. I didn't care about but I adjusted because, he is a good guy. Once the conversation went like. I : Everything going in a right direction. Are you really interested in me? Because I didn't receive any frequent conversation from you. He: See Sindhu we have more time to speak in future. Don't get scared about everything. We can gradually move into life. You are fixed to my heart. I can't think about any other girl. I m impressed by you. I have fallen for you. If we decide something we shouldn't turn back. I : I felt completed. He used to share all things with his well wisher. I didn't care about it. Once we had a meet. We went for a dinner. He had cut the dance class. Because of that she(well wisher) became really angry and told me that you can't do like this. I asked sorry since I had good respect on her. He shares each and everything with her. So, We couldn't meet after that. He gave lot of Hope and lot of confidence to me. I started to love him. He too expressed it. He have a tight schedule from yoga, office and dance class( his passion). I am happy that he have a very active lifestyle. I accepted it. I didn't complain that you didn't spend much time with me. He spoke about future. Our both parents fixed and booked mahals for engagement and marriage. One day he pinged me to ask about how much gold we are giving from my side. I told him to ask his parents. He told that his parents are disappointed. I told like your parents should have discussed about it before. He said that his mother is crying since it's a prestige issue infront of relatives. ( His parents said we don't expect anything you can do whatever you could do). I became disappointed with him and after lot of conversation he asked me sorry and I got convinced. The very next day he asked me to tell about the surgery to his parents. ( He and well wisher stopped me to tell about it before) . I asked him are you mad?. This is not a right time to tell and it's not a big problem at all even to hide. I even said to stop this marriage by telling I am characterless girl to his parents instead of telling that surgery thing, because anyways it's going to stop. He denied. I told, there were many opportunities I asked for your approval to tell this thing to your parents. But, you have stopped me and my parents. Now, all the right time gone , if my parents say means they will get a bad name and this marriage will get stopped. His well wisher joined with him and forced me to tell it to his parents. I convinced my parents and opened that news to his parents. His well wisher asked my medical reports to get medical opinion. They didn't even get any opinion and stopped my marriage. Above all , he called me and told, Sindhu, My mom is crying , I can't marry you, you have great character you will get a better match. If you love someone in future , tell me I will help for your marriage. You should have talked with other matrimonial profiles not only me. I stopped him and said I m not that much cheap. I was so confident , I stood by him when my parents said no to him. But he didn't. My heart is saying that he won't deserve me . But , I still couldn't come out of mental trauma because of all his words of hope. I asked him that don't u feel that you have cheated a girl mentally? Why did you give hope if you can't withstand it? He blocked me everywhere. His well wisher disappeared. ",

So, I just want to say that I was thoroughly bullied by my classmates when I was in class 7 & 8!!!:/ One of the most worst experiences of my life!!!!:/ I was been taunted for every little thing whether it's about my appearance, dress, my habits , some use to hit me sometimes etc etc. I didn't have any friends at that time !!!!:/ I used to feel humiliated sometimes, I was a huge introvert then, spoke very limited words in a day. In my early teens, that time was tough and I was depressed , my parents understood my situation and told me to stay strong!!!:( I was afraid to talk to any person , the effect was very huge and was a undercomfident to interact with people!!! But now I have overcame this and still sometimes hesitate to talk to people and have a paranoid of what people think of me when I interact with them !!!! But now, I am very happy and can confidently face people and become friends!!!!:) Be happy!!!:) ",

            "answer_text": "I want to mention an incident and say sorry to the person who did always did good things to me but all i did for him was negligible. I was in the first year of my college and was enjoying the phase to the fullest. I was in a relation with a guy from my school. Then i met a guy from another course and soon we became really good friends. He was a person who used to be there for me even when my bf was not there. I can tell you this because once while walking to the nearest metro from the college we encountered a bunch of cheapsters who started molesting me in the broad day light. There were very few people on the way and they too didn\u2019t notice the event. We both we silently rushing to the metro suddenly one about 20 year old tall guy came and grabbed my wrist. I was shocked and terrified. My friend stood up for me and fought against those people. He got severely beaten by them. He was covered with blood. But he ensured that they cant even touch me. This is just one of the many favors he did to me. Things passed on and we were in the last year of our college. Suddenly he started behaving rudely to me. As if he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me. I tried to bring that up may times but again his behavior didn\u2019t change. Time passed on, long night chats turned to a few messages and it too disappeared after a while. Last time we talked was the last day of our college. I insisted him to tell me what changed his behavior towards me . the n he told me that he used to like me since 1st year and was jealous of my being in a relation with my bf. It was kind of shocking for me. I didn\u2019t know how to respond. I never wanted to loose such an amazing friend but i can\u2019t even be in a relationship with him. Even today i dont know how should i fix this thing. Please if someone had been in such a situation plz help me out. ",

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is one of the biggest step you can make, or one of the biggest mistakes you can make. This girl named \u201cMia\u201d (not her real name), she is popular. Smart yet a bit lazy, quite a gamer and she enjoys retro music as much as I do! It all started one day when I was listening to Queen, \u201cHey oh my god you know the song I want to break free by Queen? Holy shit!\u201d Since then I became a friend of hers and listen/sing/dance to retro music with her a lot. We usually talked about Marvel and go on about the hottest male actors we know or the cutest girls in school (I\u2019m bisexual studying in an all girls school). Everything was fine, nothing was out of the ordinary until\u2026 \u201cLove of my life, don\u2019t leave me\u201d She sang while she stared deeply at my eyes, wha-what? Why was my heart beating fast, my cheeks feel a bit weird oh what the fuck why am I blushing? Fuck, took me a few days to realize that; I had feelings for her.. I tried my best to convince myself that it was simple infatuation but as the feelings lasted for about 2 months I knew it wasn\u2019t infatuation. It wasn\u2019t any \u201cLove at first sight\u201d shit, overtime I started realizing the small things about her. She loved drawing and at times when she disagrees with her popular friends she just keeps quiet as to not start a fight. She grew more and more intensely cute at my eyes each day. The thing is, my best friend had feelings for her. Does it seem unfair? I remember teasing my best friend last 2017 for liking Mia but hey who would have guessed I would also develop feelings for her one day? I want to be with her but I don\u2019t stand a chance, it\u2019s already a miracle that we\u2019re friend regardless of our \u201cschool clique social status\u201d, (But I am commended by a lot of people to be really beautiful and have such great tastes in fashion.) I am a social butterfly and have a lot of friends whom are popular! But my clique are labeled as the \u201cBisexual Fashion Icons\u201d clique (not in an offensive way)! So we are quite different and I have such a low chance of pursuing a relationship with her. Plus I think she likes this other girl who is her best friend, not sure but I think. I don\u2019t have the balls to confess to her because rejection is really harsh on me. But I like to focus on our \u201ccute moments\u201d together! One time we wore casual clothing (we have uniforms to be worn everyday in school) because of our annual Christmas party in school and I looked stunning! I really liked the way I presented myself that day, I had natural make up on with an aesthetic hair do and a choker with a chick outfit. The moment I entered the classroom all my clsssmates complimented me and although I was showered with compliments like \u201cYou look so cute\u201d \u201cGorgeous as always\u201d Mia\u2019s compliment of course meant the most to me, \u201cHey you look like this one cartoon character I like! You\u2019re so beautiful today omg\u201d I kept that in my hair for the whole day. So fast forward party ended and I realized I didn\u2019t have a picture of myself (good to make my profile picture in instagram and Facebook) I was with my best friend and begging her to take a photo of me when Mia stepped in and said that she would do it. So of course my best friend knowing I liked her left me with Mia and yes Mia took incredible shots of me. Oh and aside from me and Mia having small talks during that day there was this one part where we had to line up to get the food in our mini buffet and my friends were behind me then suddenly Mia decided to \u201cscare/shock\u201d me by just randomly popping up behind me, in which she succeeded. She had a good laugh at her small prank on me and this is the part where I was internally dying, I was wearing a crop top of shoulder and Mia placed her hands on my waist and rested her chin on my shoulders. Mia: (whispers to my ear softly) Caught you off guard didn\u2019t I? *soft chuckle* Me: Ha ye-yeah a bit Mia: Wanna sit with me after you get your food? Me: Sure! Mia left and my friends eye widened as they looked at me and began talking about how she couple potentially like me (which is a zero chance). That is all I have to say! I will give you updates on what happens on my \u201cLove life\u201d and shit. ",

            "answer_text": " Recently, I started listening to some of the current songs and started having weird feelings about a singer, Dua Lipa. After developing these thoughts, I become more sad when I listen to her songs. Why? I am not so certain either. Probably the thought that I have a crush on a famous singer who has no idea I even exist makes me want her even more. A person who I'll probably never meet. All of a sudden, I start to question myself wether I make the best out of my reality. A reality in which I can enjoy life and be together with people who I can actually see a future with. You know what's worse? The fact that I have to unfollow her and totally block her out of my mind. Because when I see a video of her going for tours after tours, gorgeous photos of herself with fans, my heart literally sinks knowing that nothing will probably ever happen. Here she is doing what she loves, not giving a f**k. Probably enjoying herself (maybe not) going to a different country every 3 days. Here I am, obsessing over someone like her. I honestly used to think people who can actually have feelings for celebs were physchos, now realising that I'm probably one too. This may seem stupid to a lot of you. But I feel better after writing this down on Quota. ",

I don't know.. May be i am getting influenced by people around me..,the surrounding,the environment. It's just depressing. I just feel like going somewhere and hide. I don't understand how people could make it anything. Always wonder will I be able to achieve something in life? I always wanted my life to be of some purpose. I am really confused:-\\ ",

            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: Might contain inappropriate and offensive content to some people. I\u2019m like a secret writer, generally crime fiction. It\u2019s been like 6 years since I\u2019m working on this particular story about a anti-hero. So in every story, I add a narrator part like an intro. Here is one of the narrator part of one of the sub-section titled \u201cFALLEN\u201d of the story, which is after the first phase after the rigorous and violent attacks on a city. Narrator: \u201cThousands of corpses lying, blood-wet outside and inside, the pillars have cracked and thrashing the ground as they fall. The sculptures are half burnt and rest melting, blood runs through the blasted doors, through the sewers, recoloring the sculpture once praised as wonderful, there is nobody to praise, none to mourn and grieve. Once again, the darkness has beaten the light, but the people have understood one thing now, that there are no heroes, just people. The people who see the darkness as a serious problem, who believe that there must be an inspiration in their heart that tells that the darkness has no source, but light must have. The fight is just beginning, thousands will fall, let them. There must be sacrifices, so that people who has grew tired of all these lies will understand when it comes to take their homes and families away. To let them feel, what\u2019s it like to lose someone you truly love, with all your heart. Now there is no one to avenge but you. How does it feel, when there is no response from anyone when something precious is lost, and nothing can replenish it ever. Other people see the capital as a place, but the one who live here. Imagine of Alfea, what they think of Alfea? They see it as their homeland, not all but the ones who were born here, they call it their family. The old who still confuse their ignorance as patriotism, so what can they do but burn to death, there must be unfortunate incidents to revitalize the potential in patriotism of young people. The old must be put to their graves. Alfea have to rise if it is necessary to prove that patriotism is for the country and so are the souls.\u201d There is a war to come, we must be ready before it begins, when it begins, there should be no one to refuse to call it a war, to rest inside their houses for rest. Hail for the martyrs! PS: It took me really long time to prepare this piece, so kindly don\u2019t copy or reproduce the above without my consent. Thank you for reading, Have a nice day! ",

Being the good girl I am, I decided to tell this to my mom so I wouldn\u2019t have to lie. I thought she would give me support or a hand but I was clearly wrong , she was outraged. She was spitting out words that hurts my sensitive self. So I\u2019m basically a shame. I should be ashamed of myself for deciding a decision by myself. She said that I should think about how my other relatives would think. A very disgusting act. She went on and on, both her and my dad didn\u2019t work their ass for this. At that point I regret telling her, I should\u2019ve lied. I should\u2019ve lied like what other people do. Then I cried the whole night. ",

And yet, late at night as I lay down to sleep, I fantasize, our moments together on repeat How is it possible to think about someone every day who broke your heart into a zillion pieces It has been 2 years since we broke up, but why do I believe there is an apology overdue. For you to take me to highest level of happiness, intimacy with your white lies and then banging me right on the floor I remember the feeling of being cheated on, I remember how it feels like somebody has taken out your soul from your body People say when you can tell your story without shedding a tear, it shows that you have moved on And yet here I am writing my story with a heavy heart and tears in my eyes Do I hate you ? Have I forgiven you? What do I want from you? Why do I feel like your demons are still haunting me? There gotta be a solution to this, there gotta be an end to this. Please release me from your demons. Please let me go emotionally. Sincerely An ex who loved you from the core of her heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I did not expect that I have to write this answer one day. Today I lost my BEST friend. Yes! We were together for the last 10 years, and suddenly he left us out of nowhere and just left us alone. I am still crying while writing this answer. I understood that \u201cDeath can come anytime anywhere\u201d. While writing this answer, just thousands of memories flashing in front of my eyes. Those school mastis, those roaming around, those games we used to play, how we used to abuse each other etc. Everything is flashing in mind. He suffered a very bad road accident day before yesterday. I exactly remember it was 12 pm, I was in my hostel room, when, a friend of mine called to say that he is admitted in ICU. I did not have a clue of that till that time. I thought she was just doing some prank with me by telling this. I first did not believe this. But just for confirming, I called his number, with the mindset that I will just beat the shit out of him to do this type of bad pranks. But after a while, a different person picked up the call(his hostel friend) and told the truth. The day before yesterday, in morning 8 a.m., some of his friends planned for a short bike trip. I and some of my friends told him not go on a bike like this, as he was nearly 2000 km away from home, but he did not listen and the thing we all feared, that happened. His bike met with an accident with 4 wheelers and he smashed on the cemented road with bike on top of him. Fortunately, the friend sitting behind him did not even have a scratch. His bike was at a speed of 100km/hr and he did not have any helmet. That's what is the mistake he did. He was rushed to CMC, Vellore, where doctors put him in ICU. He had abdominal internal bleeding, till that time. His parents were informed and one of my friends help them get to the airport fast. His parents reached there by 10 p.m. at night. That day, the abdominal bleeding operation was done and he was quite stable. But later we got to know, that he also had intestinal damage along with spinal cord and pancreas damage. We all friends, out families, his parents broke down. Still doctors told that he may recover and we can place the artificial intestine. We still had hope. We were constantly praying for him. But today morning, neurosurgeon gave the shocking news that, his brain was becoming dead slowly. He was put on ventilator as he stopped breathing. Now 2 hours before, doctors declared brain death. He is still in ventilator, but by means of artificial breathing, artificial heart pump, basically, everything by mechanical means and not natural and doctors told he has 0% chance of recovery. I just can\u2019t take it more. For me, he was my life, not just my best friend. He was my brother. He wanted to be a robotics engineer and we used to share everything. But his dream can\u2019t be fulfilled anymore. He left us. We could not do anything. He was the only child of his parents. But I promise that from today, I will take care of his parents because they are my parents too. Just 2 days ago, we had talked, and now when I call on his number, no one picks up. The last WhatsApp message I sent him 2 days back, will remain unseen forever now. Idiot, you left me like this. So many trips remained unfulfilled, thought to dance like hell on your wedding and you did this. This is the photo with that idiot.(Yellow)  Really love you bro. And guys please please wear a helmet while riding bike and please keep the speed slow. Had he wore a helmet today, maybe he would be with us now. For college students, please avoid bikes. It does not look cool riding at high speed. And parents please do not allow your children to ride bikes at underage. Thank you for reading. Edit : Thank you everyone, but its really tough to get over it. I am really proud of him and his family, that they decided to donate his eyes and other organs so that another person can live. Also his parents have decided that, they will give his body for medical research purposes. I just can\u2019t imagine this. Such great people on this earth. Why does God, do such with such good people. :( Edit: Though my brother is not with me now, but still I am proud, he saved the lives of 6 people. Really proud of him and a huge respect for his parents.  ",

Since it was a peak time the bus was fully loaded. The innocent guy was standing beside a lady. When the bus took right turn, he missed his balance and fell on the lady beside him. So, his forearm touched her breast. She became furious and slapped him in the crowded bus. She shouted, \u201cYou bloody pervert, I will teach you a lesson so that you should never repeat this again. You should be afraid even to touch your wife's breast henceforth.\u201d People gathered and slapped him. The bus driver took the bus to the police station. She filed a complaint against him. The news became sensational and telecasted on all national news channel. TV channels held the debate and discussion on this. TV channels showed the innocent guy's pic 24/7. Every news channel showing the same news. The innocent guy lost his job!He lost his respect!People looked at him in a different way after that incident.His parents faced lots of tantrums from their neighbours.The innocent boy couldn't even step outside of the house, because everyone was cursing him.He decided to kidnap that girl who made false allegations on him. He planned and executed well to kidnap her! He kidnapped her successfully! The outskirts of the town! The lady who made false allegations on him was screaming to leave her. The innocent boy was holding a knife. No one could hear her screams, because it's outskirts of the town. He confessed, \u201cYou made a wrong move lady, you f**ked my life. My marriage got cancelled. I fell on you accidentally that day, but you made a big scene. I lost my job, lost respect.\u201d She screamed again, \u201cI'm sorry, please don't kill me.\u201d He replied, \u201c Don't worry I won't kill you. I lost respect by the society. So, I would kill myself\u201d The innocent boy slit his throat by the knife which he was holding. The innocent boy lost his life, because of the false allegations on him!  Women empowerment? Some women are misusing it!It's ruining many life's around. Not all boys are perverts! I do agree some bloody molesters are there around us. Be careful while judging a person. Girls, ladies and women please don't misuse the power on innocent souls! Don't ruin life of an innocent person! You are not only ruining his life, but his entire families! Think before judging a person! I have seen ladies making a false rape allegation on a person from whom she took loan.I have seen ladies making a false dowry allegations on in laws.Women's are called as \u201cKshamayadaritri\u201d Kshmayeshu Dharitri : Having patience like Earth. Don't misuse the power of women empowerment!  (Your little appreciation and honest feedback make me write even more. A person who feels appreciated will always do more than expected.) Thanks for reading, Yours, Rakshith Akira \u270d ",

            "answer_text": "I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. One of my friends is being kicked out of her house because her dad is a gigantic piece of shit. In the past 6 months he has been arrested at least twice for DUI, one of those times involving the possession of an unregistered firearm in the second degree (I hope its the second degree). Also, she mentioned that he might be on cocaine. He is physically and verbally abusive to her, and I'm trying everything in my power to get her out of there. I offhandedly suggested that she move in with me, and she took that idea and ran with it. The alternative is for her to live on the streets--in winter. A woman, sleeping on the streets, at night, in winter, is about the scariest combination I've heard since 12 year olds, microphones, and fortnite. So I've talked with my dad about her moving in, and he's not opposed to the idea. They are suppose to meet this afternoon to talk about the idea, and I've been having this nagging feeling that one of them is going to say something wrong and it's all going to fall apart. This anxiety doesn't stem from nothing (though it often does). My friend has multiple personality disorder (not sure if that's the actual name, but you get the point), and there are a couple sides to her that I've seen, that I don't want my dad to see. The \u201cI don't Give a fuck\" side, the \u201cI need a blunt\" side, and the \u201cI need a beer\" side (You know\u2026the more I think about it, the more I'd prefer the hotmicing 12 year old). Now before you get your dick in a knot, im kidding, I would much rather have my platonic sister living with me than listen to a hotmicing 12 year old--on fortnite. The one problem I have personally, is that I show different sides of myself to different people. I am not sure how I am going to balance the side my dad sees, with the side my friend sees. I'm normally really exuberant around my friend, and I'm rather dull around my dad. It's definitely going to be a balancing act. My apologies if this doesn't make sense. It was kind of rushed. I might try and clean it up later. ",

            "answer_text": "I was gential mutilated (Infibulation) by my parents when I was 9 years old. For those who don't know the Infibulation\u2026 its a pharaonic mutilation, which is done through cutting the girl\u2019s external genitalia. I live in Sudan. I was 9. One day morning, my sister and I were taken to a woman who used to do this surgery. I remember the room, it was meesy and untidy.There was no privacy, lot\u2019s of women were in the room looking, and some kids (who I don't remember where the hell did they come from!), were on the windows sneaking the glances and laughing, while I was crying. On the small table, there were cotton, water, razors and other stuff. I was terrified, loudly screaming and flinging. Two or three women held me so I can't move. I was begging. The womon took the razor and killed me. At house People were celebrating, food and songs. I had to stay in the bed for several weeks. Visitors came to congratulate and give me money and gifts! the suffer didn't stop here. It was extremely hard to move, or sit for several weeks. Bathroom was always a catastrophe, the pain was untolerable lots of scream, blood, and tears. Many years after, I questioned my mother. Why did she do it? As I was taught at school how devirly it is. She answered \u201cto make you clean. It's our tradition, my mother did it. I did it, and you should do it to your future daughter, as well\u201d. By the time I realized that my mom doesn't like to speak about it at all, I don't know was it because of the guilt or for she was avoiding her bad memories from her childhood. I mean, to make me clean of what!? They never tell the reason, and I doubt if they know the reason in the first place! People where I belong have fear of thinking, they rather choose to follow, for its easier. Finally, and thank for education, I got answers. old practices related to purity, for maintaining us virgin, to not bring the shame to our families. \u201cyou have no clitor..difficult to get lust.. you stay virgin!. And when you get married, your feeling doesn't matter, you are almost like a sex doll\u201d I wish no more girls will go through what I went through. although the law prevents it now, but it's still happening secretly. I have a freind who comes from an educated family, and didn't have to go through it. She asked once \u201c what is it feel?\u201d I answered \u201c I don't feel\u201d. Sorry for my bad English and poor narrating. I needed a vent. EDIT: Thank you so much for your kind words, and support, it really means a lot. Just to make things clear\u2026 Some people in the comments considered me to be a Muslim, and started attacking Islam although, I didn't mention my religious background!. I am not defending any religion here, it's just that Sudan is a divers country, these practices aren't done by Muslims only, Coptic Christian and some animist groups are known with it, as well. People keep doing things and traditions, then attribute it to religionsYes, there are some organizations in Sudan fighting to stop it. It's less now than in the past .I don't feel any grudge toward my parents, they are victims of illiteracy. Whom I can't find excuses for are those educated girls and women who are still proud of it as if it was a privilege! and would do it to their daughters just because of the society.",

It just frustrates me that from my childhood up to know, I have come to face the harsh reality that I don\u2019t have any hobbies that makes me an uninteresting person and an individual. Because who even wants to be with someone who doesn\u2019t have any interest in anything right? It\u2019s kind of sad that I didn\u2019t really have an amount of friends since I don\u2019t play any sport even basketball. I only watch it in TV, it excites me yet frustrating because I don\u2019t understand a thing. I can\u2019t even play an instrument yet I\u2019m interested in playing violin. I want to do any manly hobbies like fixing a car, doing house repairs, fixing a leaky faucet, in short i want to be independent and responsible to my family and to the community. I want to contribute largely. From a week before up to now, I am starting to let myself learn basketball and many others. i\u2019ve been searching lots of hobbies i can try with. Because if majority can do it, why can\u2019t I, right? I want to be back on track. I want to change. I want to be interesting and popular too. Thanks for hearing my story! Hope i can receive feedbacks or comments. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a 15 year old CBSE student in India. Like every student who scored above 90% in their boards or was considered among the \u201cgood kids\u201d, I decided to pursue engineering. Now don't get me wrong, nobody forced me into this decision, sure, my parents might have been a little disappointed if I didn't, but I wasn't forced, it was my own choice. So, till 10th grade, I was the top student. I got marks without working too hard for them, was a gem in teachers\u2019 eyes, used to take part in all functions and read books, drew, danced and painted as hobbies. I had a huge group of friends despite being considered a nerd and I was truly happy, life was perfection. I thought I could do anything if I set my mind to it, so I took up what most people considered difficult, engineering. And boy, was I wrong. I entered class 11th with a sense of optimism, I believed I would be able to handle the pressure everyone warned me about. I also joined FIITJEE to prepare for competetive exams, specifically IIT-JEE (which, now, I have no hopes of cracking). Most of my friends had been taken away by the commerce and arts streams. No worries, I'd make new friends. I went to my first FIITJEE class and came back intimidated. I had trouble understanding what we were taught, it took me sometime to digest all the new information, I was used to the CBSE method, the method I was so perfect at. No worries, I'll adjust. Maybe I'm a bit slow at understandind advanced stuff, I'll learn how to do it quickly. Gradually I lost my optimism and started believing I couldn't to do anything. I drowned everyday in the endless amount of practice sheets and assignments we recieved in every class. It took me at least 15 minutes to do one question while others came back the next day with all their work complete, and one or two doubts. We were really encouraged to ask doubts. I thought, what's the point of asking 1 doubt in 50, I would still not know 49. Also, growing up, I had been an introvert and a self learner. I just couldn't digest the fact, that even after being taught, I couldn't do something, when I used to learn and do everything by myself. My school exams arrive. I had been so lost in all that coaching stuff, I forgot I had to do well at school too. Maybe it was the intense pressure, or maybe it was my inability to handle slight pressure, I didn't perform as well. My confidence hit rock bottom. What would I do in IIT if I can't do well in a simple school test. Meanwhile things were going really unwell at FIITJEE. I saw myself as the least intelligent one of the class, felt hesitant to ask a doubt, had no friends there, rather, people looked kind of down upon me. One day I plucked up the courage to ask a doubt, but it was ruthlessly ignored to solve the doubt of a more vocal, reputed and intelligent student. My first FIITJEE exam is in a week and I am the definition of demotivated. This is the reshuffling test, which will decide if I will be in the first, second or bottom batch, meaning, it will decide if I will get the best, average or worst teachers. I have made a timetable to study throughout the week, but I just feel it doesn't make a difference. I still don't know anything. My mom is really supportive and wants and believes I can do well. I just don't know how to tell her I'm not as perfect as I thought as was. I think I'm the one who has more trouble accepting the fact that I am not perfect. She keeps asking me how she can help me feel good about myself, feel determined. I am really grateful to her for that, I am, but I don't know what to tell her. I am just a dumb young girl who got glory when she was a kid and grew up and realized she wasn't a perfect little Mary Sue anymore, and now has self esteem issues. I still want to do engineering. If I keep aside the fact that maths torments me and chemistry just doesn't get through to my dumb brain, I feel actually interested in physics, which I have trouble understanding too. I want to learn more about space and relativity. But to get to the stage where we have to learn that, I have to learn what we are being taught right now, and I just can't. I sit down to study, I pick up the pen, I look at the question and drive away the intense feeling of hopelessness that I'll never be able to do it on my own. I try and try and try and keep trying different methods for half hour and then get tired and search the question on the internet. Turns out I was doing it right, but I just didn't progress further because I thought it was wrong. I take up another question. Repeat. I study a lot, more than those toppers, but I still achieve less in all that time. It takes me sometime (a lot of time) to digest new information and while we are just being stuffed with new information everyday and everyone is learning, even with no time for self study, this new information just goes to my brain\u2019s information sector where it waits to be digested. That sector feels like about to burst now. I'm scared that I'll perform bad. Not on this test, but in every test I will give. I feel like I should have taken some other stream, but my interest was here. My mom deserves better than this hot mess of insecurity she got. My parents invest their money to get me educated so I can get a good job, live a good life, and I throw all of that away. I feel like a failure. Everything makes me break down into tears. I'm tired of not being able to do anything. I'm tired of wading through all this advanced stuff when other students just have to take a look at it and they learn it. I see myself when I see them, this was me a few months back. How did I get in this state? I am tired of feeling inferior and jealous. Drawing, reading and painting are a thing of the past. I never thought I was one to give uo my hobbies for studying but here I am. I feel like I have lost a more significant and lively part of myself. I just feel dull inside. Hopeless. ",

            "answer_text": "I've been thinking a lot about writing this out and if you're reading this, it means I decided to just go for it. I met my now ex-boyfriend 3 years ago. He was new to college, we shared one of the classes. I had a crush on him and believe it or not, I actually told him, to which he said: \u201cyou don't even know me\". So, I decided to get to know him. We started off by speaking in our lesson then I added him on social media and finally after a good few months, we exchanged numbers. Now all these 3 years he cared for me deeply, helped me with everything. I did too, missed my own lessons to help him with his work, waited for him every day outside the college to walk with him even though I lived an hour away and he lived 20 minutes away. I used to get so late, get stuck in traffic but still, it was a small thing for me. Then after a year or something, he asked me out, happiest day. We did everything a couple would do, from sex to shopping to talking about families. But at the end of 2018, just after Christmas, he said to me that he doesn't feel like love is there (out of nowhere) I didn't expect that. So I asked him what made him say that. And I do agree that we're so different and he wanted someone who would share the same ambitions as him and because we were so opposite, it was a problem for him (it was never a problem for me). So I felt hurt, of course, all the memories of us being together and our future came in my brain and I seriously didn't know what to type. So I just said that's okay, I explained how I felt hurt and of course who wouldn't. After 3 years you're telling me you don't love me, I was hurt still am. He said he tried to love me but couldn't. He said he still cares for me deeply because I was always there for him. He wants to be just friends like friends and have sex as well. So basically in simple words friends with benefits. I don't know how I feel about that yet because I do miss him and lot and he cares about me so so much which makes it even harder for me to just cut the communication. Last night, he said to me that I argue a lot these days and it's turning him into a bad/angry person. I don't know how I feel about that. I don't know, I'm so lost. I wish I had never said hello to him in the first place and all this would have never happened but then I would have no-one who actually cared about me. I feel like I always want someone in my life to tell me that they care about me and love me and atm I feel like I've only got him. That's why it's hard to just leave him. I don't know urgh why is this life so messed up. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay. I finally got the chance to write because I don\u2019t have my own device. I have to borrow from my cousin. I just want to share about things I have been holding inside since I feel like I can put them here. Since nobody knows I have Quora, I can safely say that my enemies will think of me doing this. So anyway, on to the story. People nowadays are so glued to their phone that they don\u2019t seem to notice what is going on around them. Selfies, Facebook, chatting and Youtube are few of the things they are so busy about. They spend hours and hours on the phone which I know most of you knows, is common to see these days. Your classmates when there is no teacher? They browse Facebook. That cashier guy waiting for his customers? Phone. Your friends when they get together? They play mobile games such as Candy Crush or Mobile Legends. Everyone is keen on being updated on having phones that I worry they will break their neck due to phone usage. This answer of mine is not some kind of advocacy against using mobile phones. No. I am not against it. Sure, I don\u2019t have my own since I lost it and people might say I am jealous, but my concern is different. It\u2019s about how people act and interact these days. When I was a prepubescent boy, my parents would often pressure me to make friends. I was fine with the idea since I am a bit of a loner and I am the only person in class who didn\u2019t belong to any clique. I tried joining social circles but they all rejected me because I am simply different. They say I am a weirdo. That may be true but I am just asking for attention. That there is a boy that just wants friends. But no. I was an outcast until college. Anyway, my experience with people taught me that they will not be friends with you for who you are but what you have. Those cliques in school demanded I do/give/have something first before being part of them. If I wasn\u2019t given the gift called common sense, I would have said yes immediately. Sure I complied and was \u201caccepted\u201d but I later on found out that I was just a toy to them. So I became a loner. Years later, I am now a teenager who prefers the company of movied, books, and video games. I was rather fascinated with stories that take you anywhere rather than chasing people who doesn\u2019t even see you. Yeah, I didn\u2019t know how to make friends. If they would shot me out, I would not try again. If I tell them what is wrong with them\u2026well I will tell that later. At this time, smartphones are now trending so almost everyone has one. I saw this an opportunity to make friends. I would chat a classmate and then talk to him/her. My plan failed however since they seen zone me 99% of the time. I was devastated. So I let my parents know that I won\u2019t make friends with people who won\u2019t let me in their lives. They weren\u2019t happy. And I didn\u2019t have a good relationship with them. They are good parents. They always want the best for me but how they deliver their laws\u2026.I didn\u2019t agree. So I still tried making friends. This time, I tried to overcome my fear of socializing. I talk to people first because I get ignored most of the time. That doesn\u2019t mean I wait for people to approach me. Usually if they do, it means they want something. I don\u2019t believe in friendship based only on giving. These time though, peeps are now glued to their phones, browsing nonsense stuff. Whenever I try to talk to them, I get ignored or I get called papansin which is in my language means attention seeker. I was annoyed. Do you know these people who made me feel like a trash? They act all sanctimonious online. They post in Facebook all that stuff about Jesus and how they follow him. They post stuff saying \u201cI am depressed\u201d and they\u2019d get attention. Alot. Sometimes, they even post selfies then put a caption that it isn\u2019t even related like\u2026.a selfie with filters then captioned: I may be ugly but God thinks I am perfect. Then that bitch would get comments saying she is an angel. Oh, I also forgot that those people act mean in real life. They love criticizing others and pointing fingers but they are arseholes themselves. Now that I am in college, I got tired of chasing a dream that I can never have. With the first heartbreak, the hardest sacrifice, and my parents just being recent, I decided to just focus on my future. Yeah, I have alot of stories. I experienced and seen alot. I have a different perspective with my generation. I guess you could say that I will not hesitate to choose what is right. But still, a question bothers me. Where did I go wrong? -EDwin Gregorio salazAR ",

            "answer_text": "My best friend and I have been friends ever since we were 5. We are currently 17. We've been through ups and downs together and she's basically a sister to me even though we are very different individuals. She's the popular one, the thin, slim and pretty one;most of the guys she talks to somehow ends up falling for her. I'm short, kinda chubby, introverted,shy, and weird. There's been times where we had backstabbed each other and times where we would sacrifice a lot for each other. She had hurt me multiple times and I used to be pretty quick to sulk about it but at this point I'm quite used to it. She was the reason my first ever relationship failed. She's the reason I often feel insecure about my self. Throughout my life, out of the 7 guys I've had feelings for, only 2 reciprocated my feelings. Both relationships didn't end well. Because of her. My second relationship had me feeling like I was the third wheel because of the fact that she was closer to my ex than I was. They would hang out together with another close friend of theirs and they even made a band, though they didn't mention it to me. They just started posting about their band on social media and I just look at their pics and vids feeling left out. So, I ended the relationship. That was 3 years ago. Late last year, there was a new kid in school. It only took me a few days to start getting curious about him, but being the shy person I am, I never made a move. Early this year, I fell for him even more after getting to know about him and his interests. How? Through my best friend. (I had told her about my feelings for the new kid and she knows how much I really like him.) Turns out, she had been talking to him and he would share some of his personal issues with her. At first, I didn\u2019t really mind because they're just friends (according to my best friend). So I just continued liking him like a fool. A few weeks after that, my best friend told me that he confided in her about the fact that he is infatuated with another girl in class. I was, of course, sad about it but the girl had a boyfriend so I still had hopes. I started talking to him online bit by bit. But we never had a conversation for more than 10 minutes. As time passes, his attraction towards the girl didn't waver. He continued liking her and telling my best friend about his feelings and struggles. I was starting to feel worse. But I kept on telling myself everything is going to be okay. Then, somehow, last week, things took a turn and I started to notice that he has started to pay a lot of attention towards my best friend and she continues to talk to him everyday. I would sometimes catch her chatting with him on her phone even outside of school. I realized what was happening. The guy I was head over heels in love with was falling for my best friend. What's more heartbreaking is my best friend is probably attracted to him too. She recently said to me, there's a new guy in her life, not so new but fairly new, who she had started talking to and she felt like he was going to confess to her about his feelings. She said that she kinda likes him too. She legit said that to my face, thinking I'm not aware of the relationship going on between them. I didn\u2019t want to ask who the guy is because I wouldn't know how to reply anyway. It was obvious anyway. Today, they went out for the first time. My best friend posted a vid of him and her hanging out. Now I'm aware that I may seem like a jealous and pathetic person but this isn't the first time something like this happened. She had liked the same guy I liked 4 times throughout our friendship even when I had expressed my feelings about them, and all of those guys ended up liking her. I'm just tired and really heartbroken about this. I go to school everyday having to face them flirting with each other and getting closer as each day passes. It really hurts. And the worst part is that I don't have anyone to talk to about it. I\u2019m not the type to easily cry but these days thats all I do, alone in my room. I'm sorry for the long rant, I just really need to let this out cuz like I said I don't have anyone to talk to it about. ",

            "answer_text": "When I was young I worked as a lifeguard in the summers, and had taught most of my nieces and nephews to swim. A few years later my younger brother drowned during a whitewater rafting trip on the Snake River, and it took three days before they recovered the body. I had to explain to his three year old daughter that I couldn't find her daddy, while she held full faith that I could swim well enough to go get him and bring him home. The hardest part was that she kept bringing it up over and over, because she just couldn't wrap her toddler mind around losing him. Over and over she kept begging me to just try. She's an adult now and doesn't remember those three awful days. I won't ever forget them. ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently living in Kolkata. I am 19 years old and I live in a hostel. Two years from today I entered this institution( India\u2019s highly acclaimed). I got into the first merit list. I didn\u2019t wanna purse commerce further, something stirred inside me and made it clear. I told my parents. They asked me \u201cSo, then what do you want to do? \u201c I wasn\u2019t prepared with an answer and the admission was the next day. \u201c If you are baffled about one thing doesn't implicate that you\u2019re clear about the other.\u201d In the very first semester, I was seated next to the most brilliant minds in my class. Our college has a strict seating arrangement. They were all pursuing CA. I was not lured into it. But the kind of pressure and seduction it created on the outsides outweighed my instincts. Having a handsome academic isn\u2019t affirmative always. \u201cThe salted expectations saturate on our spirits like weights and then break them.\u201d In a gradual weightless sort of feeling, I appeared for Level 1 (CPT) ( I studied decently though, the pressure of a \u201cfail-kar-gaya\u201d embarrassment. Unfortunately, I cleared. They were already in their 2nd level. I had had to rush to catch on. Something I couldn\u2019t understand. My father poured in a sea of money into the coaching business for Level-2 (IPCC). He is not that rich of a man who wouldn\u2019t feel a thing at the end of the month plunging thousands of rupees once at a time( It sure was hard on their budgets). We call it Investment. I slogged into the frantically burdening lifestyle of a typical CA student juggling a regular engaging college, handling sullen ambitious expectations and at the same time armoring myself against twitched sharp comments of \u2018slow-movement\u2019. It seemed like a war with no enemy to fight against, no territory to conquer. Just battle. Gradually, the entire environment around started judging me, despising me, rattling my esteem like rag dolls. I registered into the comfort of an unknown darkness. Depression, they name it. That scrotum-tightening, cheerless, mouthful-mouthless feeling. Taking calls, meeting friends, visiting home and things like that just deleted out my to-do lists serendipitously. I got arrested in the company of self-indulgence and withdrew from the lively silently. It sounds too dramatic when I write like this, but the truth is truth you can\u2019t mess with that. I have grown accustomed to this silent style of living, aloofing from conversations, hiding in my own vacuous spaces within the structure. To think, try n understand but never voice. I read sometimes and exsist in my depressingly protective shell in a sort of sanctimonious style. I feel sorry about that. It isn\u2019t that I have been disturbed about my positional melancholy. I am concerned about the repercussions, this tide would ripple in my parent\u2019s lives. Their stringently indisposed futures glued to mine like magnets. I am worried. ",

            "answer_text": "Most Indians Make Bad Parents!!! Not all the parents deserve the same amount of respect. The Pathetic mentality of Indian parents make them the worst in the world. Most Indian parents have the worst mentality. Some of them are open-minded but their inner ORTHODOX character will come up someday. If you are a Woman, 25 years or older and live with your parents in their home, at least 50% of you, have parents, who want you gone. Indian parents have the tendency to never support their children if they are doing something other than what they want them to do in their life. Above that they will demotivate their children by comparing their lives to their neighbour\u2019s or relative\u2019s children. Most of the Indian Couples do not have the maturity and financial condition to raise children. THEY JUST REMOVE BABY ONLY TO SHOW OTHERS IN THE SOCIETY THAT THEY WEREN\u2019T IMPOTENT, AND CAN HAVE KIDS. A recently conducted nationwide survey has highlighted that 77.5% parents resort to hitting children, with 28% admitting that they do this on a regular basis.    Effects Of Domestic Abuse On Children: Poor social skillsAggression, Acting out, Disruptive behaviour.Low self esteem, lack of confidenceIntroversion / withdrawal, clingy / over dependent, feeling helpless, feeling insecure, feeling fearful, feeling sad, feeling guilty, blaming self and others, feeling anxious and nervous.Difficulty trusting others and forming appropriate relationships Even the best parents may have yelled at their children or used angry words in times of stress. That\u2019s not necessarily abusive.

Life is not about having fun ,but it's all about making others to cheer up and everyone wants to serve the nation but how many of you are thinking about the poor , the needy \u2026?? When we serve the poor and make them to learn and providing them the basic needs and all these leads towards great purpose in everyone's life . We see many small children working , begging on the roads and when your in a position to serve them why can't you do it \u2026? We can be happy only by serving the others and the needy . Serve the needy it's the great responsibility of everyone in their life . Now look at some pictures which touches the heart of everyone .  This little child smile could change the world but still life is most terrifying for this kid because though we all are there but still we are not uplifting their life . Another picture's which makes you literally feel sorrow .    Instead of books in their hands but still their hands were replaced by working tools. This picture really touches everyone :    There are many kids who needs to be provided with the basic needs and to be cared . Every minute their life is getting into the struggle . \u201cLife is all about helping the needy and serving them .truly everyone can make their happiness by helping \u201d I feel everyone to feel responsibility towards this great purpose . \u201cHumanity comes within ourself inorder to make an impact in this society and to uplift the life of other's and this truly makes everyone happy when they serve the needy\u201d There are many great persons who struggled to uplift the life of other's in serving the needy and that great lady was called as mother teresa and few more who struggled to uplift the poor and the needy . Their remarkable work has put them in the history till today . Everyone has to see their smile in others and when they think that other's are their own family then then would be no one who suffer to be loved or cared .

            "answer_text": "Sometimes there are people that you really love and would do anything for them. But, those people just don\u2019t understand how much you love them. You could even die for them but, they wouldn\u2019t care one bit. You try your best to make them laugh if not laugh then just smile and when they do smile you start smiling too. You wait and wait for them to say something but, they just don\u2019t understand They don\u2019t care. You love them everyone else can see that but, they will not understand you And when you realize that those people don\u2019t deserve your love you try to forget them but, every little thing reminds you of them. Everyone tells you to forget them but, it hurts to forget such people who have played a major role in who you are. No matter how hard you try to forget you just can\u2019t forget them. They live in your heart but, they don\u2019t even think about you. Because of them, you can\u2019t love anyone else and they just don\u2019t care. They have time to do other things but don\u2019t have time to talk to you. Just saying one word ,they can put a smile on your face. And you start imagining that they like you but, this just can\u2019t be possible because people are so stupid that they just don\u2019t realize who loves them and who doesn\u2019t. And we are stupid to love the people who will not love us back. It is really hard to get angry at such people. You can get as angry as you want but, in the end, it's just not possible. You start blaming yourself even though it's their fault, not yours. You think about them every hour, every minute, every second ,every milli second ,every micro second,every nano second\u2026but they don\u2019t care even the littlest bit. You think about the times that you spent together. You start shedding tears on someone who doesn\u2019t deserve those tears to be shed on them. After a certain point, you start caring about them more than you cared about anyone else. And every time that you see them and they are actually nice ..making you start falling for them again. But you don\u2019t realize that you were on top of a big mountain and there is no one down there who can save you from falling and hitting the ground really hard. You accept them as they are and you start changing yourself. You change yourself to the point where you forget who you truly were. You can\u2019t recognize this new self because you are completely changed and a different person than you were before. You pray that they could become your\u2019s but, some things in life don\u2019t come so easily. They are heartless and don\u2019t give a care whether you love them or not. You are afraid that what if you say something that could make them sad or angry. You don\u2019t want them to get hurt but, they don\u2019t realize this. Life is filled with people like that some people might say stop wasting your time on such people but, you are the only ones that realize that if you forget them then you will forget a part of you...

            "answer_text": "I really fucked up my life pretty badly. I mean, I\u2019m stumped here and I always figure everything out. I have no idea where to go from here. The problem is that some awful, horrendous shit happened when I was a kid. And I was young and wasn\u2019t sure at all how the world worked yet so I guess maybe I just wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it. Apparently it made sense to me that the solution was to start flipping the fuck out about nothing to my mom. Violently towards myself and others. I was only two though so isn\u2019t that understandable? The problem is I never learned another way to tell anyone. And it just kept happening. The awful shit. I couldn\u2019t verbalize it to anyone though. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I was afraid of being hurt? I don\u2019t remember ever being afraid. I remember being angry though. And fighting. I definitely didn\u2019t make it easy. That\u2019s a consolation still. But anyways, fast forward to being a teenager. When I became my own abuser really. It\u2019s funny how if you fuck someone up bad enough for long enough, they eventually start doing it for you. Humans are strange creatures. I was being violent towards myself and others. I was getting really, really fucking high. Almost killing myself constantly but the worst part is that\u2019s what I was looking for. Getting as close to death as possible without going over. Get a taste of that high and nothing will compare. That\u2019s fucked up isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s true nonetheless. I stopped going to school. I used to be in high honors. But I\u2019m so narcissistic about my intelligence it\u2019s not even funny so I had to be too smart for school right? Yeah, if I was as smart as I pretend I am I\u2019d be a neurosurgeon by now. I could\u2019ve. But smart people use their intelligence to create. Ignorant people simply consume. All I do is consume. What a waste. Everyone always used to say to you \u201cbut you\u2019re so smart\u201d. Yeah. I just enjoy being destructive more. So then they had to start calling the police on me all the time. Cuz I was just a little fucking monster. I never got arrested though. I have no idea why. If I was a guy I would\u2019ve been arrested so many times. They used to force me into the hospital though. Men go to prison to be punished. Women go to hospitals to get fixed. I mean really, who has more rights here? That\u2019s besides the point though. I was scaring everyone. They put me in a hospital for violent people at one point and I didn\u2019t even realize it. I had zero self awareness. No, actually. I had negative self awareness. Because not only could I not see how what I was doing affected other people, I had an entirely different view of myself. That\u2019s how people like me are able to hurt so many people all the time. I literally had no idea I was doing any of it. Or really, that it mattered at all. I didn\u2019t care how anything was affecting anyone maybe? I\u2019m trying to work on caring about how other people feel now though. It\u2019s pretty hard, not gunna lie. But something happened when I got off methadone. I still hate that stuff more than anything. The withdrawals fucked me up so bad I basically went insane and spent all this time in my head, like some wall broke or something. I don\u2019t know. And I just read everything about psychology I could to understand what the hell was wrong with me. The doctors had no idea. I wouldn\u2019t be honest. But I finally remembered why I was doing all this shit to myself and others. I remembered it was because I never told anyone what happened to me most of my life. So I told someone. Told the wrong person. The wrong fucking person. It\u2019s alright though. People do the best they can right? I try to remember that now. But then the next person I told was the right person. I suppose the first part was just practice. Figure out what parts people want you to leave out, what\u2019s too far to say I guess. And for once they actually helped me. But then I realized in group one day and I said it out loud. I\u2019m having an issue accepting the fact that if I just said something years ago I might be that neurosurgeon today. Why the fuck wouldn\u2019t I just say something? Makes me feel like it\u2019s my fault I\u2019m where I\u2019m at right now. Maybe someone did some bad shit to me but yourself is all you have and I didn\u2019t do anything to help myself. I should\u2019ve handled my own shit. I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m trying to say here. I guess I\u2019m just sad my life\u2019s a waste. I\u2019m still young but I don\u2019t know how to make up for it all now. Like where the hell do I go from here? No one can tell me. And I\u2019m out of ideas. Now that I realized I have no idea how to correctly judge reality, how do I make a plan? How do I know when I\u2019m wrong or when everybody else is? I suppose for now I\u2019m just watching the wheels go round and round. We\u2019ll see what happens. ",

I am 39 and had few failed relationships because to my bad, during all my relationships i went through bad financial phases so all my ex\u2019s decided to move on with rich and settled guys. I guess they were right because every girl has a right to secure her future so, i never stopped nor blamed them. Today, i have almost everything but a relationship. so, my advice for you all is Relationship also means staying together in lean patch Encourage each other in your career and Share your dreams with each other and help each other to make them come true. Long distance relationship shall have proper video calling to discuss all such things and to take tips and clues from each other. Keep smiling Keep shining 9717879813  ",

            "answer_text": "A common question which most of the guys ask me and to people with good physique. (FAQs) Guy1: Bhai mujhe bhi tumhaari tarha achcha dikhna hai. Please tips do.Guy2: Bhai mujhe ladkiyaan bhow nehi deti. Mujhe bhi ladkiyaan pataani hai tumhaari tarha.Guy3: Yeh chutiya gaar mey injection daal daal k body banaya hoga. Girl1: This guy must be a beast in bed. He must have got a good cock.Girl2: This guys seems a playboy to me. I know these kind of guys well.Girl3: No guy makes six packs just to date one girl. A common suggestion to all of these folks is that don\u2019t chase the temporary goals like sex, opposite gender or good looks and don\u2019t judge people like us so easily. Trust me it takes hell lot of an effort to maintain a fitness lifestyle after doing a full time decently paying and very demanding IT job. It is difficult. Life is difficult and what it is meant to be. If any of us has chosen these temporary goals specially gals, money, sex, good looks etc. we wouldn\u2019t have been where we are any ways. The pics that we all share of ours, it takes years and years of hard work, dedication and a hell lot of a compromises to reach here as this is not the only thing we do. We have to go out and earn our bread at the same time. Like you folks we also go through very ugly break ups, evil bosses, depression, health hazards etc. But we don\u2019t give up. We work for >12 hours a day, some of us earn a seven figure salary from it, do our own cooking and hit the gym at the same time. We are sleep deprived, we are over worked, but we have a passion that don\u2019t let us take rest. WE ARE MORE THAN OUR MUSCLES !!! We are not Bodybuilders, we are just Fitness freaks.We may be villain in someone else\u2019s story. But we are a hero in our own story. Finally your choices in life will take you from left to the right one.  ",

All the while (for more than a decade) in Singapore, I have worked only for small sized Indian companies which did not offer growth prospects. I have picked what came to me. Despite having MBA and Singapore education, my career is not as good as it should have been. Very often, I think about this.

            "answer_text": "I want to write why it is needed to be man to be a man enough? . I don't have a desire to fit into the broken definition of masculinity. Dishonoring your life partner.  Beating her up for no reason but to show that am a man and i can beat you. Girls are weak that's why you should keep mum and get beaten up by me with no offence.  Making her realise that by saying 3 times talaq and you won't be my wife anymore. My point is not that men should stop being men but all we need is balance and equality. Why do still have a society where being a soft boy is always bullied for no genuine reason at all.  According to them men should be tough, hard and strong enough to suppress women. Frankly speaking \" My father did not teach me to hunt, to fight,to say cussing words about anyone in the society.\" and for all this am eternally grateful to him!  Instead all about this he taught me being a man is about sacrifice- You need to sleep less to facilitate your kids with soft beds. You need to sacrifice your bread to give them a slice of pizza. Why to showoff your masculinity every now and then?  The boys who don't smoke, don't ride bikes faster,cannot hit sixes in cricket why they are always bullied and criticized for their masculinity?  I know while growing up we tend to challenge each other.  We have got to be the toughest, the strongest and the bravest man that we can be.  But the question is why?  To all the men out there... here's a challenge because men are bound to love challenges and they love challenges.  I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself. Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Can we define what those mean and use them to explore our hearts? Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? To reach out another man when you need help. * Are you strong enough to be sensitive to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy even if it's make you look weak? Are you confident enough to respect the women in your life and to see her with equality? To hear their ideas and solutions? To all the man out there... Is it necessary to discuss over girls' figure and pornography to be a man enough? Is it needed to look at every girl with wrong intentions to be a man enough? If this is what defines masculinity then i don't want to instill this masculinity in me! Why don't you stand up when guys discuss about 'locker room talk'  Why don't you stand up when your frnds discuss about girls' harrassment incidents. We have to stand up for all this because one day we should not have a worse world where women have to risk everything and to come forward to say words \"Metoo\". Are you a man enough to be a man enough?  As i concluded- in this society, a man is not a part of problem but we are the problem. \u200cI know it's a long journey to bring our thoughts from our mind to our hearts but it will the most beautiful thing we could ever think of. \u200cTo all the parents out there, instead of teaching your kids to be brave boys and pretty girls can you just teach them how to be a good human? Thanks for reading! ",

I am currently homeless with a wife, and two little dogs. I have EBT and I get 352 a month for food which isn't enough to last for all of us, because food stamps doesn't cover dog food. I sleep outside on the streets, because a lot of shelters have individuals that have stolen my stuff, or try to rape my wife. Shelters also do not accept dogs. I am currently living in Santa Monica and I go to the Peoples Concern fromally known as OPCC. I look for and apply for jobs everyday, and I don't look homeless when I do. I have a case worker in Chatsworth that really needs to just be swapped out by me to another, because they have not done enough for me. I recently just took Chrysalis classes and got certificate of completion, however I have only been able to get gigs in the five years I have been homeless. Everyday I wake up and don't get enough sleep, because we been unsafe on the streets, I have had so many phones, tents, sleeping bags, backpacks, food items, and cash stolen from me at gun and knife point. I been beaten up for my stuff before, and punched in the face for just being homeless and walking with my wife. Whenever I need a bus ride I either ask for a free ride nicely, or try to not get caught. I also steal a chicken or other food when I have to, because people will ignore my sign that says I am \u201cHungry anything is a blessing. Please and thank you.\u201d or I get told to get a job as I try to open the door for them. I have tried to wash windows at gas stations for change, however I get told to go away, and I never make enough money to buy food or drinks. I don't smoke, drink, or do drugs and neither does my wife. I network with people I meet and tell them I just moved and I am looking for a job. ",

As I have disabled my comment section and inbox, I had attached a link to Sayat.me and Sarahah in my bio for some honest reviews. After writing this answer, I got hell lot of messages. Except a few, everyone expressed how will they rape me. WHY? Because they believe I tried to defame India through that answer but I didn't defame India per se. I only shared my personal experience. I didn't write any abnormal incident but only those which a girl experiences almost everyday. But I got so much hate.  (Image courtesy : Screenshot from Sayat.me) A glimpse of what type of messages I received. Sorry, I don't have the courage to translate it into English but he has cursed me a lot. He has used a very very cheap language. I am not an active writer but definitely an active reader. I saw many questions asked by foreigners related to teen pregnancy and all. I won't say this is common there but this isn't rare also. They share their problems. They share their views. Do they think what people of other countries will think? No. They don't care. But in India, doesn't matter how much serious is the issue Log kya kahenge (what will people say) is the one and only criteria to decide whether that problem will be discussed/solved or not. But I also want to say Thank You to all those who supported me. All those shares, comments\u2026..thank you very much. I erupted like a volcano when I saw those messages where people used cheap language just to show their anger. I don't think I wrote something for which I deserve rape. Please don't use this word for a girl. This is very painful to hear. *Pens down* ",

A senior faculty member of that institute has crush on me(I suppose). In initial days, he looked at me with a smiling face and I even felt that his eyes had some miracle in them. He made me feel so special, so worthy that I began feeling that he should have been mine (btw, he is married) . I could even remember his eyes, his way of looking at me while asking a question to class, his glance at me if I accidentaly looked at some other guy, his melodious voice which I wanted to hear all through my life, his everything. Results were as expected. I failed after 2 years and am not in the institute currently. I remember meeting him for last time. I was in a crowd of more than five thousand people, and he identified me among them in a second of glance. His eyes tried to speak the same untold secreat as were some months back (I was on a voluntary leave from institution due to some tragic incident at my house for some months). Some details about him: *Very very very intelligent *His age is above 30 but for me he is most handsome man ( he is actually very handsome) *Best teacher of this world *Married Some details about me: *Initially I considered myself to be very studious and focused(but now I know the reality) *Good looking *Am at the age of below 20 You know what my actual pain is? I have loved this man from the deepest core of heart. Once I saw him with his wife, I waited for him to atleast look at me once while standing next to her, but he didn\u2019t. Never knew where was his miraculous smile that day? I understand that his heart would have torn apart between two. I have always been an introvert, a focused person before his entry and I went to his institution for a specific purpose. He made my life heaven. Just look into his eyes and I would have got all the happiness in my life. One more twist here, after failing I have been on such a vulnerable situation of life. I have to pass that exam for which I have been preparing there. Exam is after 2 months. I am here busy writing an answer for quora on him. I have no one whom I can tell this (not even quora, that\u2019s why I am writing anonymously). Cause no one in this world could understand the purity of love between us. It begins and ends in eyes. Does anyone has a method to give me any kind of motivation in this sort of situation? But before writing an answer, make sure that do not use any bad words against him, he has been my soul for 2 years and I can never see or hear anything bad related to him. His heart is pure. ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays Having a normal life is not a normal thing. let see how \u2026. It is good to see how life proceed. You come on the earth with the help of other. You start this beautiful journey, whenever you cried there are your parents to console you. whenever you need anything there are your parents to fulfill your demand. Some spend their childhood with every demand fulfilled some might have many of them or some might be only which is necessary. You grow up and you're loved once try to provide you a best possible education which they can afford, some of might have worked hard while others haven\u2019t but this is the normal, not everybody has some things right. But somehow you grow up more, started earning by every possible way and you get married (arranged, love or love after arranged ). Now you have a partner also with whom you can talk share your happiness or many things. After some time you become 3 from two new responsibilities knocked at your door and you get busy in fulfilling that. You try to give your child happiness in a best possible way. Time flew and you start getting old, life seems to slow down a bit. It revolves around your son/ daughter and other loves once and after completing this beautiful journey you died. Beautiful isn\u2019t it. But have you ever thought if that boy who died before even coming to this world? Or the child who born with some abnormality. Or you have ever thought about those parents who don\u2019t have enough facility to have a good or at least a satisfied life. Who have to work hard in order to meet their daily demand. Whenever you are going to school, have you ever paid attention towards that child who was begging or carrying a big plastic bag to pick some rage or that chotu working in tea stall to help his family he might be the eldest among all children in the family. While you are getting ready for office that boy who is getting late for his interview because he has the whole family to feed. In your own marriage, all the food which has been thrown is being eaten by the poor. When you were pressuring your child to go to school there will be children who don\u2019t have any other option to go to work. By why I am writing this, I want you to give a thought that you need to be happy in the life when you are cursing your life for whatever it is somebody might be wishing for life for at least like you. Everybody deserves a happy life and not everybody is having a life like you so start praising it. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay. So, I read alot of stuff in Quora. And what I read regularly is, either few girls are gold diggers or few boys want nothing but sex. And, the answers end up by relating their story to either the nirbhaya case or the \u2018Jasleen Kaur\u2019 case. Plus I've read such answers in which the writer very clearly states the word \u201cFEW\u201d i.e only few of the girls/boys are like that or may be they met with such kinda people only. They don't mention the word \u201cALL\u201d at all. Right? But the thing is everybody loves to read the comments. No matter what the question or answer it is, people are attracted towards the comments section. Even I'm. We read the answer and go towards the comments section. And I don't know why, I don't know who, but people comment very negatively. Like, All girls are gold diggers.All girls date multiple guys at a time.All girls care only about the looks.All girls take undue advantage of feminism.And, well, the list goes on.OR Like, All guys are playboys.All guys use girls for sex.All guys care only about the sexual features of a girl.All guys stare the fuck out of us.And again, the list is endless.So coming to the question, I want to write my heart out here, regarding this. Just because you came across such kind of people, doesn't mean everyone is like that. And, sorry, if I'm wrong, but I see nowadays alot of women bashing, you know going anti-feminist. May be I being a girl makes me see such comments/posts. But it's not that. The main point is don't ever judge a book by its cover. Yes, may be, you came across 100 people, whom you judged by their looks, and you turned out to be exact, that doesn't mean everyone else is like that. For instance, I too came across 5-6 guys who were awesome at the start, and later became creepy. But it doesn't mean I stopped talking to other guys plus it doesn't mean I started judging them by my past experiences at all. Hence, for all girls, boys are good. Very good. I don't want to write down everything which they are not. I can just tell that they are good. Same goes for all the guys. Girls are good. Too. ",

            "answer_text": "Yep! But, heads up for the trigger alert! It was just four days before my seventeenth birthday. I\u2019m a really suicidal person. The week was a really depressing one, everyday, as usual, I had a fight with my parents. I\u2019m torn already. I felt tired of all the shouts and all the sad and bad feelings we exchanged. My parents and I didn\u2019t have what you call an ideal relationship. They are not my friends, they had said. They are just my parents, the people who will straighten me out in life. I was very depressed after one particular fight and my sister had gone home late so I was blamed for being a careless sister, for not being beside my sister. How can a busy senior student (who is also a busy club president and has, for the first time in her secondary years, has achieved a failing grade in Pre- Calc) be able to handle a fifteen year old with mood swings? How? It was terrifying. I searched up how to tie a noose or a Hangman\u2019s Rope and practiced on all the long cloth ties in my room. I had plenty of those, mostly for tying the curtain, now for my neck. I didn\u2019t make a letter. I had my diary. I had everything I felt there. And, I liked the mystery. I wanted people to suffer, I honestly did. I wanted people to care. I wanted to spark something. I was tired. I was tired of everything. I was tired of holding in feelings for over five years now. I was tired. I just want to disappear from this world. I tied the noose in front of the bunk bed my sister and I shared (she slept in the top bunk so if I hung myself, yep, she would see my head hanging and I hated that thought) and stepped on my wooden chair, looking at the circle the noose made. I was afraid. I was gambling a lot for this. Can I do this? I hanged my head and let go of the chair, my feet separating from the wooden chair and meeting the air, the nothingness. I struggled for a while but remembered people. I remembered unfinished goals, homework and dates. I easily grabbed to the bunk bed and slightly struggled with removing the noose I had around my neck but once I got rid of it I wanted to lie down and breathe in and out. It was a superb experience. An experience only the bunk bed and the ancient chair of mine knows. I grabbed a can of beer from the fridge and gulped it down alone. I was intoxicated, depressed, alive, and now seventeen. ",

He's just the opposite of me.....yin and yang \u2764\ufe0f I have read and heard that what you is seeking you.....I just really hope that this is true.....if so....then I believe he's mine and he will be mine forever. I love you. Be mine forever. ",

It seems to happen to me all the time. I don\u2019t know why? Do I give off a creepy vibe when I am minding my own business? Also, there is not certain time of day that it happens. It could either be walking home from work around 6:45pm or walking to the grocery store at 1pm in the morning, or lastly walking to get tea bright and early on Sunday morning. Never once in my life have I followed someone or stalked someone. It is ridiculous that it keeps happening. The person who thinks that I am following them usually takes an alternate route. To avoid the non existent threat that is behind them, being me, headed home or where ever I am going. It just really pisses me off that it happens all the time, guilty before proven innocent, when all the time I am innocent. It really makes me feel like I am doing something wrong, when I am not doing anything at all. Well that is what I wanted to get off my chest. ",

Does it ever happen with you that you found someone who is really nice, cares about you the most, and treats you like the centre of their universe and you find yourself wondering what have I done to deserve this? Or why me? Or is it gonna last forever? If you have, then let me tell you, you\u2019re not the only one. Sometimes we don\u2019t find ourselves worthy enough. We feel insecure and the saying \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d scares us. We are the millennials for whom if a relationship lasts longer than 6 months, we start freaking out. But then, between pretending to \u201cnot care about feelings\u201d and \u201cfairy tales are for the kids\u201d, we realise deep down we all are looking for somebody who trusts us, loves us for all the craziness they have to put up with for being with us, hold are hand through the roller coaster ride called \u201clife\u201d. But when we do find somebody who fits into our definition of a perfect partner, we get scared. What if we blow it like everything else? What if it doesn\u2019t last forever? Let me tell you, forget forever. If you\u2019re loving your present, forget the future. Every next day is future. And you know you\u2019re gonna wake up next to them the next day, then what future you\u2019re worried about? When you feel how did you get so lucky, and how did you find this masterpiece in this fake world, you should know - you have caused no harm to anyone, you\u2019ve been true in your relationship and you love this person so much that you are constantly thinking about being a better person for them, and that\u2019s why you deserve to be lucky. There\u2019s a dialogue from King Fu Panda. It says \u201c There are no coincidences.\u201d You got lucky because this person was looking for honesty and a fairy tale for their own self. Just try to be a better person every day and the world will be yours. We\u2019re so scared these days if everything is falling into place. But if you\u2019ve been through a lot, then probably you know how much you\u2019ve waited for this feeling and don\u2019t let this fear take over your bliss. Everyone finds their peace one day. ",

Well, I was in England for two weeks for English course, you know. I was afraid of everything before but it was totally cool and I loved it and I want to travel back in time and then stop it and live there for ever with these new friend I met there and especially with one and only person, who, I suppose, fell in love. I am afraid now, that I won't see him again. I am afraid of forgetting his smile, his name, the feelings I got there. But I want to forget. It would be better, I wouldn't be sad and everything. I hope we'll see again next year, but I don't know if he's going there next year. I know nothing. He live somewhere and I think he has me as a friend. Do you know this feeling, being in friendzone, afraid of everything, sad but also happy? I am happy I met him, but I am sad I 'lost\u2019 him. I hope I'll be better after writing this. Thank you again for this question. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Just Want to share something about my Journey\u2026still a drop-out. I was just 14 years old when I lost my dad and mom in a car accident; only my twin sister and I survived. We both were taken to our grandparents' home. It was so tragic that whenever I think about it, it my soul feels burdened with grief. We both live with our grandparents; they are Just like our mom and dad!!;) They spend their money for us to study. They teach us the real lessons in life, like \u201cDon\u2019t think much about the past, it's not your fault or His (God); Its just the Karma that works!!\u201d It took me 4\u20135 Months to recover from all these mental situations. Life was like a dilemma, \u201c I have to live it or just go in rest\u201d was really fed up. I started maintaining a diary and wrote each and every instance of my life and moods of mine, in simple lazy papers, but I know that paper can\u2019t reply. However, I still do the same. And I don\u2019t share with my twin sister. She is just 5 minutes older than me. We both like sketching, dancing in the rain, having fun with pets and much more. Just doing these hobbies could somehow divert my mind from past, but again, there came a time when I wanted peace and silence, and considered was suicide. Without telling anyone, I was totally depressed and just wanted to share my pain with someone. I wrote many things in my dairy but how could that simply diary could stop me from these thoughts? I was sad and anxious about myself the day when JEE mains result was going to be announced; my heart beat really fast and my hands were shaking to see the result. I was totally broken, and just closing my eyes right now and thinking about it, I was almost in a coma state. I hadn\u2019t eat anything that day and my grandparents were worried about me but I told them that I\u2019d eaten food already and was fine. It took courage to tell them a lie, and it wasn\u2019t easy; I had used my grandparents' money for educating me from a famous coaching institute for 11th and 12th and they just wanted me to get clear the exam, but I hadn\u2019t even cleared Mains. So, from that day, I took a promise, that I would somehow control my feelings, and would do my best, so I dropped a year. ",

            "answer_text": "Ours was a love marriage. At least there was love from my side. He was a short tempered person always and had said some really mean things to me during courtship which I don't know why I tolerated. But one fine day, he was okay with marriage. He spoke to his parents and I spoke to mine. Things were mutually agreed upon. Right before engagement, I found he was trying to get closer to another girl. I saw the FB message and I confronted. He apologized and said he would never repeat the same. The girl, btw, had said no to his advances. After marriage, we stayed separately due to job requirements for almost 2 years. He didn't really show much interest in seeing me often. But there were good days as well. I just ignored a lot of things which gradually had started taking a toll on me. After about 2 years, we got to stay together. There were some really good days. Due to his work, he has to stay in Tier-2 cities which I meant if I wanted to pursue my career, I had to travel. I made arrangements to strike a balance between his career and mine. All these arrangements are tough given I had less emotional support. He didn't bother me with anything but wasn't interested in anything either. Then one day, he met with an accident, I took care of him as much as I could. After he recuperated, his behavior got colder towards me and one fine day, I found he was having an affair with someone who worked in the same organization (the girl was married, had a kid, and was in a diff city). It was a shocker for me because I didn't expect him to cross the line ever. He had blatantly lied about how I didn't support him. The girl has no less. She was kind of exploiting him to get her work done as her husband was abroad. Now, after I discovered everything, he cried profusely, and agreed to go for marriage counselling. My counsellor feels an year later, he is a changed person; he hadn't so far realized that I could walk away from his life and this realization had helped him become a better person. He actually tries to spend time with me now and makes all efforts to be nice to me. But my trust is completely shaken. I am in this marriage because I don't see anything great I would do even if I come out of it. I am too tired to rethink about having a new life/relationship, etc. I have zero financial dependence on him so I'm technically fine. But yeah, I am shaken to the core. I have confronted the girl. She basically didn't want any trouble so she backed off. Due to the nature of my husband's job, I can't complain about this girl to her husband. Also, I am too tired of the mess already and if I believe my husband, he has nothing to do with girl anymore. Why I am saying all this, I want to know do people change? Can a person become faithful and loving with a realization that their partner would leave them? ",

            "answer_text": "Well fuck it. Here I go again, maybe I am hoping of achieving catharsis or redemption by writing this answer. My existence is meaningless. There is nothing that I know of that justifies the pain and suffering that I am experiencing and do not know if there ever will be anything that can justify it. Amusement and entertainment are good, but at the end of the day. I am still left feeling lonely and sad. The only reason why I have not killed myself is because doing so would be just as pointless, as continuing my absurd existence. That and the fact that people would not look upon it the right way. It would be pathetic. A guy who killed himself because he could not get his shit together. I do not have any close relationship with my father, mother or any family member. I was always caring towards my siblings but both of them are cold hearted. My father is condescending and arrogant thus I do not feel comfortable talking to him. My mother has hurt me because when I used to have anger issues she always told me not to feel what I was feeling. Non of my parents ever gave me any advice on how to make friends. The worst part is not a horrible thought, that comes later. People are only a means to an end for me. I have never had an interest in a person as for who they are. It is always about the topic at hand and if they could prove entertaining, amusing or interesting. I love someone who does not love me and I sometimes wonder if I really love her. I do not even know her that well. To me she is just a representation of what I want. Affection. As is my curse, I do care about people who I get attached to on an emotional level, and I have gotten hurt by everyone in my family. This is something that I think of as my punishment being an actor and pretending to be human. Because that is what I am left with, to present to respond in an appropriate manner and to make that response seem genuine. It does come with the paranoia of being discovered. I no longer have that paranoia, since I no longer wear a mask. There is no point. My theory of mind is impaired. This means that while I know that I do not have the same lived experiences, thoughts and feelings as other people. I often forget this and act as if other people have my lived experiences, thoughts and feelings. This naturally causes some problems in communication and I stop acting so once I become aware of it. Here is another thing for you. I made the mistake of reading transcript of Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris diaries. The people who committed the Columbine massacre. It shook me to the core. I know that the nazis committed horrible atrocities. Yet this is just an entirely different level of disturbing. It scary, the realization that someone can reach such a state of mind. https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/harris_journal_1.3.pdf \u201cSomeone\u2019s bound to say \u201cwhat were they thinking?\u201d when we go NBK or when we were planning it, so this is what I am thinking. \u201cI have a goal to destroy as much as possible so I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will forcemyself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH [Former Human,mob in Doom] or FS [Former Sergeant] or demons, so it\u2019s either me or them. I have to turn off my feelings.\u201d Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped my rampage because I wanted to kill you.\u201d The terrible thought is the realization that when people are an means to an end. That my treatment of other depends on what the end is. If my end is good, then I treat them well, or not all to bad. If my end is destruction and chaos then you know where that leads me. What is worse is the though that Nazis are human, the school shooters were human. I as a human have the same capacity, meaning that I am capable (not willing, but capable) due to my same philical streaght and similar or above cognitive ability of committing the same acts. It is not a pleasant thought. I do no longer know what is wrong and what is right, my morality is completely fucked as I do not even know if I am evil. Because I do not have a definition of evil. I know that I am no monster. Because a monster is someone who has no rules or principles that the person adheres to be that person believes in the rules or principles. I have rules, rules that are there to safeguard me from becoming a horrible person. I try my best and strive to only have mutual relationships with people, as that will make them being a means to an end less immoral. Edit: I hope that none of you reading this get the impression that I considering doing a school shooting. Doing so would be a violation of one my fundamental principles. The right to life and self-preservation. ",

A guy at office just played with my life as he just wanted me, he created differnce between me and my fianc\u00e9 through his cheap acts. He did such a thing with me that i would not ever trust or make a friend. I learned definition of backstabbing. All these things led to a distastrous relationship. Trust vanished as I lied about my job at first. The situation I\u2019m in right now doesn\u2019t allow me to be at peace at any moment . Moreover my fianc\u00e9 lives in America which makes everything even more difficult. It\u2019s been almost 9 months that I am in such situation.

I may today laugh out loud on the couples for all the efforts they would have put to make their other half feel special but not very long back I too was one of them. The idea of romance has fascinated me since I can recall. I am the guy who would shed tears when he sees the actor finally get her love in the climax. Yes that cliched romance. It just sweeps me away with it. Everytime. And yet, when I look back to my days of relationship I realise I missed out on a lot of moments I could have brought all that romance to life. It was all in my head but I never did it. Whatever might have the reason been at that moment. Why?, I wonder now. Love is a massively time consuming thing. It took me a long while to fall in love. Don't ask me if it was true or not if it didn't last forever. Whatever it was it was what I believed love would feel like. It was something I had invested myself in completely. Atleast enough to make me believe it was a one time thing. And yet I let it all slip without actually having done a lot I had always wanted to. A stealthily hug from the back. A holding hands silent walk. A big wet forehead kiss. A long eyes into eyes stare. A whisper of 'I love you' in her ears. A song written just for her smile. A hand written beautiful letter. A count of her heartbeats. A quick peck on her cheeks. A won't let you go tight hold. A mid-night 'I can't live without you' confession. A 'I will be your pillow' night. A mad couple dance in the rains. A 'I miss you' text on a busy day. A kneel down proposal with a giant rose. I can't finish with my cliched list. And, they all remained just a list. Lifeless damn words which could have been lifetime memories. I would be lying if I say I didn't feel all the pressure during the days I had to make her feel special but all these years ahead when I am miles away from it I wish I rather had someone to do all that for. No; it's not all about a girl in my life. It\u2019s not about a lonely Valentine's day. It's not about a broken relationship. It's about me. It's about something that made me feel alive. It's about how I had it all but never saw it. Imagine a kid who has dropped an ice-cream he just bought with all his saved pocket money. How miserable would that feel. All that you have always yearned for lies right there in your feet and you keep wondering how could you drop it. But then, maybe it was all for my good. More memories would have been more pain. More words would have been more broken promises. More kisses would have been more tears. More songs would have been more sobs. And more love would have been more distance from being in love sometime again. ",

He was the boy who you thought was unbelievably cool in first grade. He was the boy whod talk all the time and youd complain about to your mom when you got home from 2nd grade. He was the boy who's brother was in your reading class. He was the boy you admired for being so confident. He was the boy you were in love with in third grade. He was the boy who was friends with everyone. He was the boy who teachers were constantly mad at but couldn't help laughing. He was the boy who was always smiling. He was the boy who you only ever spoke to once. He was the boy who was popular and athletic. He was the boy who was almost always with his brother. He was the boy who was constantly in detention. He was just another boy you couldn't care less about. Apparently when you know someone for almost nine years you can't simply not care. All of the meaningless memories of this person seem to be all over your childhood. Did he even know your name? Probably not, but you knew his. Did you ever even interact? Not really. But if you think back you can't help think about some stupid time in elementary school when he'd make you laugh in class. Its stupid. Why am I crying over someone i basically didnt even know? Maybe because you've struggled with this too. You can imagine the thoughts going through his head as he did it. You can't believe he did. You have an image of the boy you had to be partnered with on the school bus to a field trip lying dead on the floor. You can't get the thought out of your head of his family when they found out. He can't be gone. It just doesn't make sense. But he is. There's another gaping hole in the community you've known since you were a kid. You want to say itll all be OK but you know it won't. His friends will never be able to get over it. His family will never fully admit that it wasn't their fault. You will never forget waking up to your phone blowing up, reading the dreaded email. The words \"it is with regret that we inform you\" will never not make your stomach churn. You will never get over the way your heart stopped beating when you read his name next to the words committed suicide. The numbness you felt as you went about your day with the words stuck in the back of your head. You read the email over and over hoping that you read it wrong. The confusion you felt as you held back tears. Why was this affecting you so much? To be honest. You don't know. But you do know that its okay to grieve someone you know, even if not personally. So you text his friend and tell him how sorry you are. You bite your lip and force a smile when your parents find out and ask if you knew him. You write a story about him. It turns into a reflection, in a way. A reflection of his life. And your life. The way you're all connected even though it may not feel like it. And as you write the last sentence, you realize. Hes gone. And nothing will change that fact. But we might just be ok ",

            "answer_text": "I was tempted to answer this ever since I joined (Not long ago) I ran away from home coz of the constant nagging of my mother and also the coz of the divorce between my parents. I still feel sorry not being able to take my Sister with me (She was in school and I had completed by Engineering by then 2004) I mover to Pune as I had a friend who was here, she was able to support me to an extend. Not easy to survive on 2000 bucks right. So here I am in Pune all by myself. I was put up in a hostel which was in the most happening place (FC Road), I paid 500 and rest I promised to pay by end of month (which I was not even sure of) I was scared at times watching people pass me and all happy faces (of course I was comparing them all with me!!) I was scared if I die, who will claim my body and who will take it to my native place or cremate it! Funny.. But I used to think about it. I used to have dinner or lunch alternate days (limited money) and have plenty of water (never lost weight though) had one pair of dress that I used to wash and go for interviews. Finally past 10 days I got a job in Magarpatta \u2013 Food Coupons! Kept me surviving through. Money and enough to keep me going and 0 contact with my family. Fast-forward \u2013 made friends and I fell in love. He was nice but I guess falling in love gave me a new feeling together, it was magical.. I felt I was complete. 2005 it was. We were serious (Bloody) we moved in and we had a live in for 3 years and in total 5 years of courtship. So we decided its time we get serious with our future. We both attempted for MBA and he failed :P Still I let him do the MBA and I supported and once he completes the plan was for me to do the MBA\u2026 (By the way! When I cracked it I asked my Parents for support.. and they Denied) So he did his MBA and it was time for Job hunt for him. One of his friends Say MsB had some issues and she was thrown out of her PG, he asked me if I would be okay and I was like great! Bring her in, I will be happy. We celebrated her birthday and I gifted her a nice dress.. (You guessed it right.. I am getting there) \u2026 So one day he comes home and we make out and we were great!! He gets up and gets dressed He \u2013 \u201cI am not sure\u201d Me- \u201cAbout What?\u201d He \u2013 \u201c Whether I love you or Her more\u201d Me \u2013 Shocked!! Numb!! \u201cHER???Who Her??\u201d He \u2013\u201c Ms. B\u201d Me \u2013 \u201cWHAT???!!!!!!\u201d He \u2013 \u201cI am sorry, but we have been together for sometime\u201d (Remember all of us stay at the same place for almost 4-5 month and I go for work) Me- Gained my sense back \u201cIf you think that you feel for her after 5 years of our relationship, Please be with her. She probably seems to have loved you more those 5 years of care, concern and Love that I had for you got shaken\u201d He \u2013 \u201cI guess so\u201d Me \u2013 \u201cCall her please and you two have exactly 5 minutes, once she reaches to empty my apartment, I don\u2019t want any trace of you guys at my place\u201d She comes and takes everything and leaves. He too goes with her. I calculated every penny and every damn thing he had for me and made him pay. I am not sure if I was right or wrong. He used me mentally and Physically and Probably I wanted to hurt him Financially so yeah. I had no shame doing that then, neither thinking about it now. That was 2008 My Dad approaches me, Old and Sick. He moves in to Pune with me and I support him. He took a voluntary retirement and spend all the money on his relatives and the only best part he gets my Sister with him. A relief for me and she completed her collage here in Pune. So my Dad stays for almost 6 years and then He convinced me to Move back to my home-town. Which I accept, Left my job and my sister was put in a hostel. We moved, The moment we landed, My Dad changes completely!!!!! He tried getting abusive and what not!! I left him and moved back to Pune (he died lonely in an old age home, I still feel guilty) So back in Pune life was getting too good!! Good Job, Promotion, Bought a house and company of my Sister!!! August 2018\u2026 I got attached to a colleague of mine. Love was in the air and we frequently fought over things. I proposed (indirectly) and He accepted. He was sure that he will marry to a girl his mother decides but will try for us\u2026 His dad passed away and at that time he needed me like hell. 24/7 he used to message and stay in touch. Literally!!! Like 24/7. 4 month down the line, he says his mother has finalized a girl and we cant be together anymore. I cried, I begged and I killed my Self-respect. I wanted this to work so much!! I loved him. His eyes had the power to See my soul and make me feel wanted. 2 months and he kept pushing me away. I used to drag myself to the work place and The moment I see him I used to loose my senses, I kept crying every-now-and-then. Finally one day I collapsed. The stress took a toll on me hospitalized for a week. He never came to visit me excuse - Was thinking to comedown on Saturday. He wanted to save his job and he was trying to keep me calm all this while. But for me its painful to see him daily and I wanna move on. Asked him to quit, though I am guilty.. I have grown in this company and doesn\u2019t wanna go (Or should I?) I know for sure that he will have a hard time.. But I ain\u2019t sure of anything. I love him.. still cries, Talks to him occasionally and TODAY I realized he doesn\u2019t love me anymore. It was about his convenience and probably some good time. He was so casual and so detached. Talking about his would-be. I asked him if he was happy and he said No.. and he asked me finally you getting what you wanted!! and I was like no!! I know something inside me broke again.. I just couldn\u2019t stop but cry and I just couldnt stop!! (I know I need to get a Grip) For me now life has stopped exactly after 10 years!! I am back to square one picking up the pieces of my broken heart and building me back again! Kind of getting tired with this and trust me if not for my sister, I don\u2019t know what I would have done to myself. I have decided not to fall in love again\u2026 IT Bloody Hurts!! It F***ing Does\u2026 But Yea I have read stories, Painful than mine.. I joined the group to keep myself distracted. Just that I have lived this and know the pain. God bless you all. ",

            "answer_text": "Indian male, 30 yrs old and an emotional fool and trust people blindly. As usual story starts with as a friend and end with as ex \ud83d\ude2f 2011 to 2015 - Friend 2015 to 2016- Good, bad and close friend 2016 March to 2018 July- Fiancee 2018 July to till date- Ex and someone's wife Let me call myself A and other two male friends as B and C. We were friends from school, departed in bachelor's and met agian by joining same organisation on same day in the mid of year 2011 We met our batch mates who are female and call them X and Y, became friends as days passed, we completed our training of 1 month and we three boys posted to Pune which is far from our hometown and girls posted to Bangalore. We three boys along with other batchmates and friends took home for rent and we were 6 guys in 1BHK, it was fun, enjoyed our life within our little salary. I got transfer to Bangalore in Jan 2013 and followed by friend B, we switched our jobs to different companies as it was difficult to survive in Bangalore with small amount of salary. By all these days we were in touch with X and Y who are batchmates/friends and we used to meet them occassionally in Bangalore. In the year end 2014 our one more friend C took transfer to Bangalore joined us and in Jan 2015 I gifted myself a bike on my birthday We three friends started our bike rides, exploring new places, doing adventure activities, parties etc etc \u2026most of the time X and Y used to be with us and B used to plan for all these activities. Ours became a group with lot of fights and full of emotion. In the end of 2015 a person let me call Z who was friend and roommate of X and Y joined our group. 1st Jan 2016 we six visited my home town and came back to Bangalore, X started to talk to me more than earlier days and started to care about me, earlier she was not close to me, she used to get scare of me as I was short tempered and I was not close enough to her and used to deny her opinions Day by day she was becoming close to me, started to share her feelings of personal, official, the day how it went on etc...just I used to listen to her, as I was not talkative much, I never called her unless it is very important matter or an emergency, I had little attitude towards girls and even I m shy in nature. Always used to be hi, bye friend to girls. One day we both went for shopping and visited nearby temple and had a lot of talks that was never ending, just we are simply talking, day passed like a minute, we wanted to talk little more but it was already late, end of the day I dropped her room. After reaching my room, msg from her X: reached safely? Me: yes X: day was nice with you, thank you\ud83d\ude0a Me: thanks to u too, earlier we both had been to shopping, lunch etc but we never talked this much. X: Today I found different person in u, not the one who was angry boy.. Me: ohhhh ok.. gn X: Gn Gradually we became very close to each other as she was calling me atleast thrice a day. At her home parents were searching for a guy to get married to her but she is not interested, don't want to get married to a stranger also she wants to be free for 2 more yrs She started liking me and was giving me hint that she is liking me and used to flirt a lot, I never been flirted with any girl in my life. Topic started with marriage\u2026\u2026 One fine day in the beginning of March 2016 she conveyed her msg regarding her marriage with me if I like her. I told her liking is not a big deal and getting married is big deal and decision you have to rethink. I explained some consequences we will face like your parents may not agree as Our hometowns are far from each other, I m from middle class family and don't have property much anyway u have visited my home and seen the situations, financially not settled, I am an average guy by looks even our characters won't match to each other bcz we have lot of opposite interest and we had fights too u are aware of these. If we commit and end without marriage will ruine our friendship. If I get attached to someone I can't leave or forget that person, dreamt of a normal peaceful life in future, If you are looking for luxury life, it's better to take me out of your mind right now. Her answer was as we are same caste my parents will agree, looking for a guy who will be in Bangalore, same has been informed to my parents earlier by me too look for a guy who is working in Bangalore as want to settle in Bangalore. I m not born with golden spoon, I too grown in poor family, still I remember our family used to stay in small house we used to drink malt. Nobody is settled in the early stages of life, looks and all not required to lead good life, beauty will go away after few years, I know to whomever I get married I need to change myself a lot, I know I act like a kid, I will change for you\u2026 My question What made you to like me ? Her answer: u are very good from heart, understanding person, u will never cheat me as u won't run or follow girls as other boys do, u r a simple man, down to earth, even our age gap is perfect, I was 27 she was 25. We started to discuss on the above topics elaborately and adding to some more topics like past life of both, she had a boyfriend from her college but she broke up her relationship in the end 2014, I knew about it but was not aware of actual reason as I was not close to her earlier, even I was not interested to dig someone's personal matter, she explained the reason behind break up, her parents somehow came to know about her relationship they are not at all ok with this as he was not of same caste. My mom cried a lot took promise to leave the contact of him and told it was ok if he is from same caste, it is almost more than year, now we are just friends and rarely talk. She said Trust me I will be loyal to you if you accept me\u2026.if I cry, you used wipe my tears, I will be happy with you\u2026give me chance in your life.. As in general everyone will in fall in love and do these type of mistakes and I was not bothered about her past life, I was thinking of my future life, explained the same consequences which we discussed earlier like financial, distance and future etc She convinced me by giving positive hopes all will be fine, don't think too much about future.. it will go on, explained lot of things about happiness in life ..etc etc Almost 15 days discussed these things through phone calls, chats, in between we met once but along with other friends so we didn't discuss anything, she used to awake till 1 in the night to discuss these eventhough she has office in the morning, I was working in the night shift. She said I revealed my decision to Mr B who is a good friend of her and even mine and he had appreciated as good choice\u2026 She started impressing me, convincing me, showing anger towards me as I was in confusion, in the mid of March I told her let's talk face to face\u2026 we thought of meeting outside, later called me to her room as insisted by her room mate Ms Y, I went to her room on Saturday morning, Ms Y even friend for me and used to call her as sister, getting ready to go outside. She went to out for shopping or to meet someone, she told will be back in the evening. We both started to discuss same matter, in between she served tea, biscuits etc by 12 in the noon we both agreed and committed to marriage. She was lying on her bed which was in the corner of her room, I was sitting opposite corner of her bed, she called me and taunted me someone was saying if I accept you I will kiss u, reminded of my my words which I discussed in the last night, I went near to her she touched me, actually I was shivering, she hugged me, I kissed her gently\u2026. She closed her eyes with a blushing smile on her face. That was my first kiss to a girl.. we hugged each other and lying on bed just hugging\u2026holding hands\u2026 my mind was distracting so I told her let's go outside.. she denied.. till 4 in the evening we just hugging and talking.. I was feeling hungry and informed her, she served food we had little as we were planning to go outside. She has to get ready to go outside, she locked me in her room went to get ready. She got ready and opened door I was smiling even she was blushing\u2026 she kissed me and we went outside to have snacks\u2026 till 7 in the evening we were outside. I dropped her and went to my room. I discussed about this to my friend Mr C who was roommate too. we had beer and was happy to hear but was little upset not informed about this earlier. We planned for a trip next day that is Sunday..we went for trip along with other friends we three boys ABC and three girls XYZ ..and returned. I started liking a girl to whom I didn't like in our group..with whom I used to argue, with whom I was not happy\u2026 I used to say this to her and used to laugh and she too used too laugh.. I switched my job to day shift just after 15 days of our commitment, as I was tired of night shift job, both were happy and talking and used to meet during weekends as same as earlier when we were friends but now with the full of feelings in our heart, earlier she used to stay in our room and sleeping with 1 foot distance but now sleeping without gap and in the same bed, same blanket with me. Her elder sister got married in April, after that I insisted to discuss with her parents, she has a plan of going through broker, where we have to create lot of lie stories and do drama, I was not okay with that bcz in future if we caught with that we will be in most embarassing moment. I clearly said no lies, one day she talked to her parents, they denied. I told her let's drop it, she got angry and said you are not interested in me that's why you are saying like this, initially no parents will accept their children decision, we have to convince them, she started crying, omg somehow managed to stop her crying and she was happy for which I took effort to make her happy and told you are my life partner. Said I love you .From the day I became strong and started to treat her like my fiancee, as days passed feelings started to grow like anything, started to trust each other a lot. Had fights, patchups, trips, movies, weekend stays etc continued\u2026intentionally she used to get quarrel with me on Tuesday evening bcz I used to go to her room on Wednesday after office to calm down her and she was happy with that, she used to prepare dinner and I would be there with her till 10 in the night. We both were happy and for me distance of hometown and looked like silly reasons. I again insisted to discuss with her parents, one day she had been to her hometown and discussed with her father but he is not ok with and said that when she was full of sorrow and boarding the bus to Bangalore her father said if you want to get married to that guy. I will check if possible next week will come and meet, she informed me the same to me and I was happy hearing this, after on week they didn't come and i asked her and she said they are suffering from back pain. We continued meeting, trips staying together, sometimes only both of us used to be there in room, situations are out of our control. Both of our bonding grown like anything. She insisted me to talk to my parents. I discussed with my parents I knew it about my parents they will not deny as same caste but my elder brother was searching for a girl to get married. I informed about mine, mom said lets finish his marriage first then will discuss. I informed the same to her and she was cool with that. She was earning half of my salary and she got a new job with good package, soon after she received her compensation annexure she forwarded me to check, shocked to see the package it was 4 times increase with her current salary, double of my salary, I was happy with that and felt little insecure with our relationship, money may ruine our relationship. I discussed the same with her and she said don't worry I will not change for money, even after marrying you I will help my parents financially, I felt happy with her words. My brother got married in December 2016 and she attended along with our friends B C Y Z, we both closely took photos and people and relatives in the marriage observed that our behaviour was close to each other, when we all friends went on stage during reception posing for photos she was beside me, friends from home town started to blow whistle by seeing us as couple, she was blushing for that, finished marriage and returned to Bangalore, again continued our relationship voyage, went to resort and celebrated new year 2107, she used to be with me in my room during long weekends sometimes by taking work from home, celebrated my birthday in Jan and celebrated her birthday in feb, completed our 1 year of commitment in March and in April we had a big fight for a silly reason during watching a movie in theatre, I tried to calm down her but she didn't, both didn't talk each other for more than 1 week. It was April end, we had been to friend's home to attend a function. My friend was aware we are not talking, at night we slept in one room, she was lying on one corner, I slept beside her left keeping half feet distance with separate blanket and my friend was little away from us. After 5 minutes of sleeping there was no gap between both of us and were in single blanket, she hugged me and kissed on me lips for more than 2 minutes, we ended our fight, slept nicely. In the morning friend woke up and saw and taunted us by saying yesterday night both were in separate blanket now in single blanket\u2026.we laughed at each other, he went outside from the room, she asked me to lock the door from inside, I did and we had funny conversation and we were funny too. I asked her u used avoid lipkiss now u lip locked me for than 2 minutes, how ? her reply was I don't want to lose you\u2026.and hugged me. Finished the function and returned to Bangalore, few days passed, she asked me to discuss with my parents as already my elder brother got married. Simply got angry and said u will cheat on me after using me\u2026 i said no way, I will not cheat you and made her feel little cool by cool words. I went and discussed in my home they took her number and talked to her and took her father's number, she was so happy and exaggerated for that, msg with lot of kiss symbols, heart symbols came to my phone from her. My parents called her parents and discussed our matter but they denied as distance was matter to them. We all were upset by their reply. After few days again my parents called and discussed, they denied. I was upset and asked her next decision as her parents didn't agree, even she was upset and asked for time she will convince her parents and continued with my relationship, it continued\u2026she used to be with me for during weekdays taking work from home..still remember during independence day week she was with me, I can't forget those memories\u2026 going for trips, bike ride, hiring self drive car and going on long drive continued, In between I used ask her about marriage, she used to ask for time continued with my relationship, every one was asking about our marriage who were aware about our commitment. Completed almost one and half year of commitment, one of our friend suggested to get registered marriage, she denied. Few days passed I told her I will not cheat you, I will take care of you, my parents are ready to do marriage if you are okay eith. You have only two options either me or your parents, as they didn't agree at all with us. She said there is a third option, convincing my parents and getting married with their blessings\u2026.for that we need time\u2026 I believed and respected her words, also reminded her words before commitment what she used to say for convincing me\u2026 words were if you want to marry me then I will leave everything and everyone for you. In between my mom called her and discussed about marriage, she asked for sometime\u2026 Again months passed, we are discussing about marriage and dreaming of living together for life long.. etc..even planned for which area we should live considering distance between our offices.. continued till November.. we have completed 1 year 8 months\u2026 One day after returning from home town she said my parents took promise that I will not talk to you or meet you, still I m talking to you, I got shocked from that, She joined gym and even insisted me to join gym, I joined, we had less time to call and talk, after returning from office need to go to gym, after gym fresh up, have dinner and sleep as we are tired\u2026it continued\u2026 some of the days no phone call at all.. thought of meeting in weekend.. she is busy.. calls and chats used to be long.. started to become short\u2026 3 weekends not met by giving silly excuses, no video calls, if I call her no reply. If call is picked answer will be busy call you later\u2026 it continued.. almost for a month. In between she has met a guy, profile sent by her parents, this came to know by her roommate. When I asked her about this answer was due to parents pressure met him not to accept him, I asked her what's going on your mind as already annoyed by your behaviour, not meeting, not talking properly etc and even u have met a guy without informing me\u2026 where is the loyalty? You used to update me about everything. Did not pick the call day before meeting him, called to your all three numbers. You are calling me a day after meeting him. In the name of marriage things are getting dragged. She cried and asked me to believe her and need some time for her to convince, I said I will talk to your father, She said situations in home are not going good. I will inform when you can talk, calm down for sometime. I said ok\u2026 It was end Dec 2017 I was planning for new year celebration with her along with other friends and asked, she has plan to go home town. I felt bad and went to my hometown. Jan 2018 \u2026continued the same action, no meetings, no long phone calls, sometimes avoiding calls, no video calls, but wished on my birthday with lot of kiss emojis, however not met me on my birthday even it was in weekend giving some excuse\u2026completely annoyed. Feb 2018 Felt like she is intentionally sinking our relationship in the ocean and explained all the things what I am feeling about her behaviour and told straight forward to her, if she is not interested to marry me, pls tell me, for that she said need time and to believe on her. Arranged a small trip on her birthday, now she was ready to meet on her birthday\u2026 celebrated her birthday alongwith friends. After few days valentine's day I sent msg I love you her reply was just a smily emoji. went to her place to give surprise, she had just a smile on her face, took her to dinner in nearby restaurant, her mood was not good, I asked and she said she has not slept properly. Finished our dinner within 1 hour and came back, I gave a dairy milk wishing her. She smiled and said me to leave the place. March 2018 she was selected for a business trip to London and she got busy in preparing for that, I was happy for her london trip and I felt she is ignoring me bcz few things about her travel came to know by third person not by her, bcz rarely she used to call me and if I call her answer used to be busy. I understood she is busy and felt little bad about the situation. In the mid of March we completed our marriage commitment of 2 yrs, I called and wished on that day, I could feel she was happy and also felt she is avoiding me. On one Sunday she called me to meet in a mall as she is going for shopping, next week she is flying and will not be able to meet for a month and said \u2026things between us not going well, once we get married everything will be good, she will convince her parents once she comes back from London. I was happy to hear those words and went to meet her. Did shopping from morning to evening happily, we both were happy and had one lunch shared by us in one plate. I asked her shall I talk to her parents when they will come to airport to say bye to her. She said no .. they will be in a happy mood to send me, if you talk about about us they may get disappointed, once I return from London we will talk. I said ok, Shopping finished, it was evening I offered her for drop, she denied and went by metro. In between small talks about prearing and packing etc I didn't go to airport as instructed by her, parents were there to drop her. I got a message from her about 4 in the morning, I m in airport , waiting for boarding pass, see you soon. My reply: Happy journey enjoy to the fullest, whenever you get free, u can call me. After 2 days video call from her I was happy, we had good talk almost 10 minutes, she wanted go out, got a call from her colleagues. She said bye .. Again we had small and good communication after few days\u2026 April 2018 ending she returned from London and i called her to meet on next day as we both had holiday on May 1st, but she denied by giving reason of she has to unpack her luggage an etc.. I felt bad\u2026 I called her at night around 10 pm she was returning from dinner with friends to whom she met 2 or 3 months back. I yelled at her \u2026 I can't tolerate your behaviour towards me, you are asking for time almost 6 months and I feel u are avoiding me and still u r continuing with same. When I asked u in the morning to meet you gave silly excuses and now u had been to dinner with others, you don't have time to me\u2026you are not giving any importance to me..Iost all my patience. Blocked her in WhatsApp\u2026 I was feeling like crying\u2026 she called me back I didn't pick\u2026.kept my mobile aside making it silent. What's the hell happening with me \u2026 thinking\u2026 thinking\u2026 Next day msgs popped up in FB messenger.. have u blocked me in WhatsApp? Whole night I have not slept.. pls understand\u2026sorry I called her and said pls don't avoid me \u2026I considered you as my life partner .. always u used to say I am yours.. but lot of things changed in you. You know, I will not leave you..i feel u will leave me.. if you want me to in your life.. pls talk to your parents before this month end.. She said ok Again after 3 days it was weekend, requested her to meet for lunch she said ok, later gave some reasons\u2026 continued this giving one or the other reason for next days too May 2018 end\u2026 she messaged me that she is going to hometown for a surgery.. I asked about journey details and wished her happy journey. After 2 days i asked about surgery and how she is now..she replied with the answers.. I was about to chat little more.. but she gave some reason and said bye. After discharged from hospital she informed by messaging i am ok now.. she returned to Bangalore in the early June .. We had little conversation in between.. I asked have you talked to your parents\u2026 Answer was No.. I was full of sorrow. ..June completed Early days of July. my friends B and C planned for bike ride. I called her but her answer was no as she has office on Saturday. We three boys went for a ride.. both friends were aware of my situation, so Mr B slowly started to talk about my relationship.. slowly he was trying to convince me to leave her..and revealed that she has already once met a guy in Bangalore profile was sent by her parents. Mr B was a good friend of her and she used to share with him. Mr C also said these behaviours indicate she is not interested in you any more. I got angry and eyes were full of tears. We returned to Bangalore.. i was riding bike, so many things are going in my mind, after reaching I called her and said I want to meet you.. guys are saying like this.. I don't believe their words,.. Between you and me\u2026 they are third person\u2026 I don't believe third person.. when I was accepting you I didn't ask anyone\u2026.pls meet me\u2026 her answer was no\u2026 she is tired from office, she can't meet\u2026tomorrow she will meet\u2026.now she will go to room and call as she was traveling in cab. After reaching room she called me to calm down Next morning went to her area and i asked to meet, never came down from the building to meet me\u2026 and she called me and started to explain she cant marry me as she is Manglik\u2026she should marry Manglik guy only. Just 10 days back came to know about this\u2026 there is no solution for this. I knew it she was lieing\u2026 Started to convince her by reminding our good days, her words, promises\u2026 took my friend to convince her she was not ready\u2026 I begged her\u2026 in between she travelled to her hometown.. I cried.. and begged her..she replied I will ask my parents..next day her answer was they are not agreeing. Now her heart is not the one I loved, person who asked a chance in my life is not giving chance to me in her life\u2026. simply dragged for more than 8 months in the name of marriage and trust\u2026. We did so many arguments, she said she is not interested to marry anyone\u2026 informed the same to parents to not look for a guy\u2026pls even you don't beg me\u2026. Now so many reasons took birth to break up, Distance, status, and she said she was not happy with me, I can't buy her costly clothes, no understanding between us.etc etc Tried convincing a lot.. never came back\u2026 she was talking well during Dec 2018 I was hoping she will come back..one day she went to home town taking leave for Christmas holiday..got married. Almost after 3 months I came to know about her marriage.. when I was in her hope..she called me said she got married.. asking for sorry as cheated me. Also said everyday she is feeling guilty about this and she started to cry\u2026 I was knowing..she is doing drama just using word guilty and just to calm down me..and get sympathy..she was knowing i m in depression and suggested me to consult a psychiatrist. Later came to know about her that she has not asked or convinced her parents\u2026 since the day my parents asked them.. Just dragged for 1 year, played with the friendship, feeling, emotions in the name of trust.. It's been 1 year of her marriage, she is celebrating her marriage anniversary, I am an emotional fool writing this in Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I want to spill my heart out completely for the first time today for a recurring and often unaddressed issue to be brought to light. I briefly considered going anonymous for this (due to the sheer and absurd amount of negativity this will face) but, hell, I did nothing wrong to hide my identity. Here's my story. I'm a male and I was/am harassed on a daily basis by females. Yep. You read that correctly. Females.  Warning: Brace yourself for fairly vulgar/explicit content and a rollercoaster ride of emotions and drama of sorts. Now, before I begin to narrate the following, let it be known that I\u2019m not a scrawny, mentally or physically weak, man-child, who is easily stepped upon and has no voice of his own. I'm a 6 ft tall, 185 lb male who lifts and is, by no definition, afraid to give you a piece of his mind (and if necessity calls for it or need arises, a piece of his fist). I am also, fortunately or more unfortunately, in the eyes of society, placed among somewhat attractive males (not being cocky or tooting my own horn, just stating facts for the story to be more relatable/comprehensible). Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s plunge right into it.  When you first hear the word harassment, I could bet my life, the first thing that crosses your mind is an image of a woman being teased, cajoled or intimidated by the male gender. And while I am not, by any means, saying that women are not the majority of victims abusive cases (verbal and physical), male harassment should very realistically be considered and given attention too, as well. Just because men are considered the \u201cstronger sex\" doesn't mean we don't face this issue. We do. And it can be severely extreme. Thus, my sympathies lie with ALL victims of ANY sort of abuse, whether it be mental or physical, male or female, old or young, heterosexual or homosexual, fair skinned or dark skinned, etc. Why am I so passionate about this issue? I\u2019ve been through it. I know how sickening it is. How destroying it can potentially be. Ever since I hit puberty, I've had more than my fair share of attention via girls and women. And I won't lie, in the beginning it felt amazing, being popular, the center of attention. But over time innocent glances and subtle flirting took a turn for something much more sinister. The thing is, I've never been one, to dote and drool over sexy looks and hot girls. It sounds cliche as hell but I always preferred a great personality, sound mind and chemistry/compatibility over mere physical features. And so quite unfortunately for me, I am rarely attracted to someone because I look for certain qualities which are perhaps on the more rare spectrum to possess. And that, my friends, is what irks a handful of girls out of their twisted minds. That is the bane of my very existence. The mere fact that I am NOT a superficial person. Specially to hide away from stalkers and obssessive psychos, I have refused to be active on ANY social media platform (apart from one private account to stay in touch with a few close friends) I'm only active on Quora because I enjoy writing. And now, much to my dislike and chagrin, even Quora has become a way for some particularly nasty females (and lol a few men) to annoy the fuc*kng hell out of me. I've been forcefully kissed against my will, multiple times. Groped. Felt up. Flirted with obsessively when I was clearly not interested. Let me show you a few examples. (This girl sent me seductive texts prior to this conversation so after warning her, I blocked her. She made another fake account and messaged me the following.)   Yes, I was rude, because I had priorly, very politely, very clearly refused her advances and she didn't get the clue. I must mention, I am sorely tempted to reveal her and the rest of the girl\u2019s identities and expose them for who they really are but unfortunately the little bit of decency left inside of me and the way I was brought up refrains me from doing so. Yet. (Also, Quora\u2019s fuc*ed up BNBR rule, to not expose even your harassers at the risk of being banned) She then goes on to message my girlfriend the following.    As if this weren't bad enough she goes on to sending my girlfriend texts from \u201cME\u201d. Yes, it was all fake. And thank God my girl was clever enough to catch on from the style of writing. (For those asking how she got my girlfriend\u2019s account. At some point of time, I hadn't realized my followers were public)  This nutjob also publicly has touched me inappropriately.  Lets move on to the next EXTREME case from our very own Quora. This girl was suicidal and I tried my hardest to keep her from \u201ckilling herself\u201d. The only way she would agree to live was through manipulating me into \u201cloving her\u201d despite me telling her countless of times that I am committed and in a relationship. Turns out she was a fake.   She was also a stalker. She had gone so far as to find the address of my workplace and say that she will wait for me there.  And then finally when she realized that I was NEVER going to be interested in her she badmouthed me and posted false lies on her account.     Interestingly when I threatened to expose her lies and harassment, she blocked me.  These two are fairly recent cases. There are many, many more strange girls I have encountered sadly. So, please do understand that men also get harrassed and something should be done about it. In my household I was taught hitting a woman is cowardly and unjust. And I have never raised a hand against one but when they are all over me against my will, what can I do? Being the \u201cweaker sex\" gives them an upper hand. I was taught to protect and respect a woman's dignity and honor. But when a woman disrespects my dignity, what should I do? This issue has truly and completely frustrated me. I am afraid it will affect my relationship even though my girl is understanding, but how long can one girl handle this much? I can't really discuss this issue with my friends either. Guys will tell me on a daily basis how \u201clucky\u201d I am, or to \u201csuck it up\" and I'm ungrateful etc. Lmao, well it's certainly not fun after awhile or when it has the power to potentially destroy your love life.  Edit: Here\u2019s a few answers to concerns some may have, as I won\u2019t be responding to every single comment on this post. To those asking why I responded in the first place; I don't respond until absolutely necessary. Please don't unnecessarily assume that I \u201cenjoy\" the attention. The first one as you may have read, was a classmate and what started out as her trying to initiate a normal decent conversation solely as a classmate, escalated into this shit. As for blocking. Note I said I did block her. Twice. She constantly continued to make fake, new accounts to text me. What you read was a part of the conversation of me warning her that action would be taken against her via university officials and the police if she contacted me yet again with another fake profile. Secondly, how did a random classmate get my number, some may ask? She didn't. If you'll notice, that is instagram she\u2019s messaging on. You can search up anyone on instagram with just their name. Why do I have Instagram? Its the only platform I use to communicate with my close friends. It\u2019s a private account, but you can still receive messages from non followers. Regarding the other girl on Quora. Well, she didn't start off with harassment with the very first text. She was decent and polite. And SUICIDAL. She reached, with what I thought, was an earnest plea for help and I engaged with her and tried my hardest to make her see life in a better light. Again this innocent conversation escalated into all the shit you read above. AND she admitted to not being suicidal in the first place. I can't report the Quoran to the police because she lives in INDIA and I live in the USA. I CAN report her to the cyber police if she strikes again. I was, in all honesty, unaware of that one detail. As for those raging on why I said hitting back. When a guy inappropriately touches a woman despite being told and warned not to multiple times and she can't get out of his grip with just a warning, what does she do? She defends herself. She strikes back to release herself. That's what i meant. Please understand the context. As for the \u201cweaker sex\u201d comment Note, that weaker sex is in quotations, indicating that I don\u2019t wish to say that females are truly weak, rather I\u2019m pointing out a concept engrained in the mind of society. That being said, to those saying I should strike back physically in such situations. I will refrain from striking unless it\u2019s absolutely, completely necessary. And if it comes down to having NO OTHER CHOICE, then hell yes, I will strike to defend myself. And last but not least, my uttmost favorite negative comments were regarding me being an egoistical, attention seeker. *Grins viciously* I won\u2019t deny the egoistic part. Aye, I am that and much more. But, on a serious note. This was written to bring attention to a prevailing issue. If it makes me look like an attention seeking, asshole, I\u2019ll take that gladly. Cheers!  Edit 2: I am from here forward disabling the comments of this particular post due to recieving more than its fair share of absolute negativity, and sheer spite. I will further add, nothing has been deleted, be it the negative, hateful comments or the positive, supportive ones. For the understanding ones, I thank each and everyone of you. For the spiteful trolls, may you have a successful, eventful career in trolling elsewhere! Cheers ;) ",

Her dad treated both daughters like angels. Siri loved her dad more than her mom . But the only thing she didn't like about him is his smoking habit . Siri's mother also told her to urge her father to give up that habit . Siri wasn't brave enough to say that to her dad . Years passed by , one day they said that her dad is no more . She was left with no clue as she was too young to digest what has actually happened. Later when her relatives were discussing she over heard that her dad had a heart attack and that's because of his smoking habit . She cried her heart out thinking that if she had told her dad to stop that , he would have been with her atleast for some more days. But now that tears are of no use. The person had already gone . Even after many years she still feels guilty that she didn't asked her dad to quit smoking. She still misses her dad and loves him . I request all the humans , please quit such bad habits it may give pleasure to you . But when you die of them it leaves a zillion times sorrow to your loved ones and that can't be wiped.  Thanks for reading !! ",

            "answer_text": "To the woman who's been tolerating me since 18 years, I was, am and will always be an impatient kid. Even to imagine your level of patience to bear with a hyper active kid is difficult. Right from spraying shaving cream all over myself to doing miserably at academics, I've always been a mess. Had it been some one else, I'd be homeless by now. I remember going on late night drives with you on that old red scooter of ours. I remember you putting a creative angle to every project of mine (Still grateful for that best file thing!). I remember you waking me up (and ruining your sleep) at odd hours in the morning because it's best to study early than late. I also remember being an idiot at most times, most situations and you still bailing me out of some serious trouble. As much as I'd want to apologize for every wrong card that I picked up, I'd never be able to thank you enough for making sure that I win inspite.  (Umm, yes, Liberal Studies was your idea, okay?). I've seen supermoms, but to pack breakfast on time and to be there at home for lunch, is a next level thing. Unlike most, you not only taught Adi to be equally involved in the household work because it ain't a gender thing, you barely burdened me with any of those. (I agree!) And no, I don't have the coolest mom in the world because she is sarcastic. It's because she doesn't mind my sarcasm. Most people might blame you for raising a \"blunt\" daughter. But mum, you made me capable enough to shut anybody up who dare says rubbish to me. You taught your kids to speak up when the need be, whether people like it or not. You transformed me from that little dumb girl who used to cry over guys to that badass girl who'd never let anyone (ANYONE) talk nonsense to her and walk away with it. I sometimes used to feel left out when most girls around me used to rant about how old school, narrow-minded, uncaring, non-empathetic their moms were as I simply couldn't relate. I mean, my mom hates it when I wear that typical pair of jeans, for she wore nothing but skirts and shorts during her entire college life. (Yes!) Being there with a hug after I cried, listening to my detailed analysis of EVERY minute observation that I made, discussing about those psychological theories are the things which I have (and will) ALWAYS appreciate. The thing is, I do notice each and every effort that you put in for us. The way you talk to Adi about sports, playing peek-a-boo with Desire even after a long day, cooking my favourites just because I make faces even at the sound of \"Khichdi\" and what not. The problem is, the chilled relation that we share keeps me from being mushy for you at odd moments. I make sure that I value all my loved ones, but what made me guilty lately is the fact that I seldom tell you how much I love you, how much important are you to me. I thank you for EVERYTHING that you do for me, every sacrifice that you make for me.Yes, the confident being that I am now who can walk in a room filled with people, with a messy bun over track pants and still act like she owns the goddamn place is all because of you. It's you who inspires me to be brave, powerful, head-strong, ambitious and creative. Qualities of a lioness, maybe? People, come on, I'm a Gemini born out of two Leos, isn't that great enough?! Mamma, you are beautiful inside out. Even if I forget to remind you, always keep in mind that you're an amazing mom(The best they have!). -The girl that'll make you proud, soon. ",

            "answer_text": "In this big big world where folks are putting there 100 cents in, I would like to catch your attention by putting my 2 cents in. English has been my favourite subject since then to now. When I was 8, I was a type of student who used \u2018is\u2019 with \u2018I\u2019 despite being read in a convent school. When I grew up and entered my teen age, I was sent to Kota for further studies. I started my coaching classes there in 9th and was a mediocre. The story starts from where I enrolled myself in a Drama & Speech Competition conducted by Trinity college, London through my institute. We had this lady teacher, Let\u2019s call her R and several other students who was better than me in every aspect. It was such a big deal for me to compete with them. Before entering the class on the first workshop day, I was so confident that things would go well as R was taking those workshops and we shared a good bond but unexpected is a word in the dictionary to prove all the assumptions wrong. For your information, that exam is divided into 3 different parts i.e Poem, Prose and Mime where you have to present these 3 things in front of the examiner. As two days of workshops went off, I realized my competitors are better than me and I couldn\u2019t even converse properly. To my surprise, R also thought the same and shouted on me one day, \u201c Satakshi, You have an Indian accent that is not going to help you in front of the foreigner examiner.\u201d She also changed my poetry and gave it to another student as she thought I did not have enough expressions on my face to recite the powerful rhyme. I learnt Kathak for good 2 years so my mime was a Classical one that too added to more dislikes. In all the preparation days, I was a child who was shattered, perplexed and under-confident. Moreover, I was not given much attention by any of the trainers. T Then came this exam day, I was the first to go inside the exam room. That\u2019s when I knew this one thing- \u2018 The courage of these 14 minutes can shatter all these people who are under estimating the infinite potential and limitless passions you hold with.\u2019 I went in, presented everything and came out. They asked me how was it, I said that examiner did\u2019nt ask me anything about my mime. That surprised them more. I, including them believed that I am going to fail that exam. But miracles do happen when we least expect them to, same happened with me. 15 days after, We recieved the results and R gave me a call and said \u2018Proud of you, Satakshi.\u2019 I still remember those words and the expression of her face that she gave me the next day. I knew I wasn\u2019t up to the mark but who else is. I knew there are people better than me but never gave up. I knew I was under estimated but Estimation is for digits, not passions. I knew 12 days of workshops was never enough to learn that much but I did not stop trying. I knew the risk I was taking with my mime could lead to failure but I was ready to fail at an epic scale. That\u2019s all what success asks for. Here is the proof -:  ",

            "answer_text": "my dad was diagnosed with cancer in 2017, i was 14.At first doctors said he would inevitably die, then a glimmer of hope came when a second opinion from a doctor said he could survive. We clung onto that hope. He started chemo and the effects were so devastating, he lost so much weight (he had previously gone to the gym every night), he couldn\u2019t do anything he wanted too (swimming, cycling etc), he couldn\u2019t drive, he didn\u2019t know what day or time it was so Me and my mam would constantly get calls because he thought we should be home from work or school but it was the middle of the day and his mood would always be changing. He started getting more and more ill and would be in hospital for a week or so then be out and be ok then be rushed back to hospital. Me and my mam would try and go to the hospital as much as we could. This went on for about a year, my amazing strong incredible dad ended up being a man I barely recognised who couldn\u2019t, talk or eat and was in a coma like state on my mams bed. I remember the last words I said to him and how he tried to squeeze my hand to show me he could hear me and loved me. Grief didn\u2019t hit me straight away, I didn\u2019t cry at the funeral, it all didn\u2019t \u2018hit\u2019 me until a month or so afterwards. My mental health started to get worse, I cried every night and self harmed for a while. I eventually got into CAHMS and was diagnosed with anxiety, I did all the therapy work but it hasn\u2019t really helped. I\u2019ve been in CAHMS now for nearly a year now and I have only just been diagnosed with depression also. I wake up ever night at 2 am or 4 am and only get back to sleep after a few hours or I\u2019m awake for the rest of the night. I\u2019m just so exhausted with life. The only thing keeping me here is my boyfriend. I\u2019m now 15 in year 10 trying to do my GCSEs and pass and make my dad proud, i honestly don\u2019t know if I can make it through the next year. My dad would be the person that would help me with revision and GCSEs and without him I\u2019m lost. I\u2019m sorry for the long answer I just needed to say this. ",

I can\u2019t sleep, I forget stuff so easily, I have a short attention span, sometimes I just cry without knowing why. I feel worthless and broken. I ask myself \u201cwhy do I even exist? I'm so worthless here.\u201d My parents neglect my pain whenever I\u2019m upset and just tell me \u201cYour a teen it happens to everyone\u201d I came from a happy kid, loved by everyone and funny and cool. Now Instead of socializing, I go onto the internet to watch videos on how to feel happy. Whenever I cry in class ( yes I still am in school.), I pass it off as me joking to not get attention drawn to me. My grades are rapidly dropping, I don\u2019t have a phone now. Do you know what it's like when you're at a family reunion and everyone's on their phone except you? It's saddening. I also came out as gay to my parents. They told me it was a phase and that I don\u2019t even know what it means. Oh yes, I think I do. They didn\u2019t even give me the talk for crying out loud. They did with my sister though! Speaking of her, she gets all the attention, money and time for everything. She\u2019ll go out to spend money ALL THE TIME. It's not even her money. It's my parents. The funny thing is, whenever I ask for something once in a blue moon, they say, \u201cOh I\u2019m busy right now, I can't!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have any money right now!\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019ll do that later.\u201d It's so frustrating when they say that. Like, \u201cHey I have an idea! SPEND TIME AND MONEY EQUALLY ON YOUR OWN D*MN CHILDREN.\u201d They don\u2019t even let me make points like that in conversations. They call it rude and disrespectful. I\u2019m so tired of living. I just want a boyfriend or a girlfriend to love and be loved back. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm tired of my bleeding problem. You must be wondering what's so wrong about that. Normal girls bleed in mensuration for around 3\u20134days or maximum 9. I bleed for around 40-45days. Yeah I have 5 free days in between, so lucky na and then again this whole cycle starts. I'm 19 and I'm facing this problem from past 5 years. My first mensuration cycle started when I was in 8th standard. I didn't took the things seriously because my mother was least bothered about me. At beginning it was around 20 days and while enquiring from my friends or relatives I discovered that it was not a normal condition. My mother took it lightly and ignored the matter. Things grew worse and the number of days started increasing. Pain was as usual but somewhere I got used to it. My family financial condition is quite unstable and this was a case that should be handled by a gynecologist which of course requires a lot of money so we kept on postponing for the treatment. Last year we consulted few doctors and decided to finally start the treatment with one of them. She owns a private clinic and she was chosen because she was the family doctor of my sister-in-law. While the rest of my near ones advice me to for a government hospital keeping in mind the financial problem, but this idea was completely rejected as it was my real elder brother who was giving the expense of the treatment and of course he listened to his wife. For around 1 months she gave me some medicines and syrups to consume. There was a bit change as my dates were shortened to 30-32 days. And after treating me for around 2\u20133 months more she asked me to get an ultrasound done. And it was found that my endometriom lining is quiet thick. While a normal size is of 6\u20137mm, mine was 16mm. She told my mother that it's a case which is found among 1 in 1000 girls. But she assured us that she's going to treat me and I will be perfectly fine. The treatment went on, I continued consuming whichever medicines she gave, paid her quite well in return. I literally shed blood clots it's hard to manage. There was no improvement seen. But yes she kept consoling us that everything would be fine. Last month it was going be a complete year with the treatment. Everyone was expecting improvement and decrease in the size of my endometriom lining. Everyone hopes were on peak. She asked for us for again a ultrasound and we did so... Yeah I got my reward for being patient, for consuming those medicines, for that irritation and that cramp ,for all our money.. When the reports were out I was not expecting anything much but a little decrease in the size of lining. When I saw the reports I found out the size has changed,.... Now it was 17mm... Yeah congratulations to me, it didn't decrease rather it increased. And the doctor was least concerned and \u2026I tried to ask her that what went wrong and she said the treatment shall must go on. I've left the treatment and currently I'm busy with my further studies, one really needs a spear time for any kind of treatment. That day when I saw my reports I wasn't angry, sad or anything like that. I took an auto to return my house. It was drizzling outside and I looked at my reports and again looked outside and I said to myself , This small sheet of paper has no right to snatch that smile from my face. And I enjoyed the weather and said to God I know you are watching me and everything has a reason behind it so does this. Trust me I won't be giving up so easily. I returned home broke out the news to everyone and there was a deep silence and regret on their faces. And I said to them it's OK and tried to console everyone. Now we're not consulting anyone, planned to continue with a government hospital. But I'm busy these days with college admissions and other works. My mom is working and so as my brother and my father is partially bedridden. We live in a room of two. It's my 5th day today yesterday I slept at 3 am and woke up at 6:30am and till now I'm sitting. The flow is so heavy that if I lie down everything is going to be a huge mess. I literally use old clothes because the sanitary napkins aren't able to soak my flow, not even for an hour and secondly it saves money as well. I had a fight with my mother, I really don't get rest even for a day or two. now I'm used to those cramps and those irritation to my moms quarrel, my father complaining about me. Now my periods are a little shorter around 15\u201320 days, no not because of that doctor treatment, I guess because now there's no enough blood to shed in my body. My family didn't heard me when I tried to persuade them that this doctor is really going to make a lot of money . They don't hear me now, from what all I'm going through, least bothered is all I can say or might be they have their own tensions. My close friends know about this but hardly anyone bothers. I try to keep myself happy as much as I can, seriously I don't need anyone to be a reason of my happiness. Sometimes these consoling lines work but I'm aware that I'm lying to my ownself. I've been writing on quora and have given over 100 answers I want to write more, hey I'm not famous though. But each single upvotes matter a lot. Honestly speaking I'm tired, I want to cry, cry like hell I wish I could have a room of my own or a place where I could shed my tears out. I can't stay sad for a long time or might be it's just an attempt to hide that pain inside. Hey the answer is going to end and thanks for keep reading. Thanks for spending your time with me. I'm okay don't be worry about me. I'm there to take care of myself and quora is also there to listen to me. I don't know what it's going to be but yes I believe everything is going to be fine. I'm all good here, and feeling relaxed after writing this down. Thanks for stopping by. I have read each one of your comments.thank you everyone for your support. I just can't express how grateful I'm feeling write now. Thanks to each one of you for reading this, upvoting this, moreover for your prayers and comments their. I never ever thought people here on quora could be so pure hearted , without even knowing the person you people are so generous enough to help me out. Thanks to each of you, I literally don't have words how to express my gratitude to each one of you. Trust me while writing this down I'm crying as I consider myself one of the luckiest person as today I've so many good souls who are praying for me. I don't know why I'm doing so ,not because you could help me financially but yes I want to reveal myself. Before writing this down I felt that this something for which I should be ashamed of. But after listening to all of you I guess this is not something for which I should be blamed for. I have got this courage from all of you. I'm not afraid anymore. Thanks for making me stronger than before. Thanks for that every little word you wrote for me in the comments section.thanks for making that smile on my face even wider. :-):-):-)I really don't know what future holds for me, but I do believe it's the best feeling acknowledging so many people to support me. And yes I've found out few doctors and I just need one request from all of you just do keep me in your prayers .I'm extremely grateful to God to have so many wellwishers for me here. Edits: I really didn't reveal myself so as to get any kind of attention, no it's not the case at all. Trust me after thinking about a long time this decision has been taken. It really required a lot of courage. I just wanted to thank each one of you in the comments section ,not to gain followers or to get financial help, it has been arranged all by myself. But still I want each one of you just to keep me in your prayers. And I'm thankful to each one of you again. I really don't have enough words to express myself. Thanks for being there with me. I'm grateful to each one of you. :-):-) Edit2: the treatment is still going on and I hope it succeed just keep me in your prayers. Financially I will be able to manage but thanks for being there emotionally. ",

            "answer_text": "I am a college graduate and an introverted person. When it comes to expressing love to crush, introverts face a whole lot of difficulty. So let me introduce my best friend X(for privacy purpose) who turned into my crush now, and who is just opposite to me. X is an extrovert and always remains cool and happy unlike me who is serious most of the time. We know each other from last 7 years. Actually, we used to study in same school, same class and same section till our class 10th because after 10th she opted for biology and I was a maths student so our sections got separated. We never talked to each other for almost 2 years in spite of being in the same section. But when we came to 9th class I went to a new tuition class of physics and guess what she was already going there for almost 2 months. So that day was my starting journey in getting closer with her. X looks similar to this actress.  X is a very chatty girl and always used to chat in between of our tuition class to me and her another friend. As an introverted person, I just always hear what she says and always shows interest in her talks. Months passed by and our friendship became stronger than before but one day I came to know that she left the tuition. I don't know for what reason till now but I was unhappy as she was the only reason I went to tuition daily. So now our conversation was just limited in school only. I was on Facebook at that time but X was an innocent girl and she had never heard of it at that time. In school, she used to be always busy in her own group which contained only girls and I belonged to some other group which had both mixtures. X was a girl who usually doesn\u2019t talk to many boys, so many boys from our school never thought of making her a gf. But I was the one who was a bit closer to her than others so I tried to talk to her most of the time when we were free. My friends always used to tease me that I was loving her and had a serious crush on her but I always told them she was just a friend because I don\u2019t want them to ruin our friendship too. But deep down my heart knows how much I loved her but for an introverted person like me, it\u2019s not easy to open up our feelings to anyone. Our FA(Formative Assessments) were near and everyone was busy studying or teaching their friends in the class. So I found this as an opportunity to get more closer to her and I approached her if she had any problem in any subject so she said she was facing some issues in Physics so I didn\u2019t think about once and I started teaching her. Though I and she both were an average student and Physics was not much liked subject to me but still I tried to teach her in order to get more closer to her. She was a girl with no feelings of love to any boys. However handsome guy proposes her she\u2019ll definitely say no to him. She was such a pure-hearted, innocent and natural girl that made me fall more for her but I never revealed this to her. Soon in 11th class she dropped our school and went to another school which was just next to us. We were now totally separated physically and mentally and there was no mode of communication between us. I was just dejected and can\u2019t even tell to anyone and felt sorry for myself for not telling my feelings to her. But somehow I managed to continue with my life and tried to forget her. After we completed school there was no talk between us for 2\u20133 years and also I quit Facebook after getting admission in my college. She wasn\u2019t the reason for this but I wanted to focus on my studies more. After 1 year or so I finally activated my FB account because I was missing my school friends badly. So then I came to know that she too joined Facebook so at once I sent her the friend request and she accepted within the same day. Soon I initiated the chat between us and I convinced her to exchange our WhatsApp number and now we were back to our chatty conversation in Whatsapp. By then I was just a friend to her but for me she was everything but I wasn\u2019t brave enough to confront the outcome of my proposal so I rather kept it as a secret to myself only. After getting into college she got more beautiful and taller. She\u2019s actually a little taller than me but I don\u2019t mind the differences in our heights. So as a girl it is not easy to live, this I came to know when she used to tell me how many boys have already proposed her and how some boys have gone out of their limit to propose her which made her feel insecure. I felt too bad for her and wished if I was with her then she would never have to face these problems. By talking almost daily to her I was able to make myself trustworthy to her. A girl will always share her odds or goods to only those people who she believes can be trusted upon and I was that man to her. She used to share every aspect of her life to me as if I was her soulmate which made me feel more jubilant. I imagined we both sitting at a roof at midnight and she\u2019s lying in my arms telling all her talks and I am just quietly listening to her and continuously maintaining eye contact with her and her eyes were so beautiful like the water in the ocean. But my introverted nature always kept me away from this dream to become a reality. Most of the times I used to flirt with her that how much I liked and loved her just from the school and she just replied with a smiley. So I never bothered to force her to have interest on me as I can clearly say she doesn't have any interest on me (from her replies) and I respect her feelings and can never dare to pressurize her. In school, I was physically attracted to her as at that time I wasn\u2019t matured enough but now when I talk to her I feel a sense of warmth in my soul and I can definitely say I am in deep love with her. I know I can tell her by now my feelings but I fear to lose our friendship which bothers me a lot and she could even think that I was flirting with her. I am open to marrying her but right now I\u2019m studying and I have many more degrees to complete and find a suitable job for me. As we\u2019re from a small city and as a pahadi most of our parents agree to give their daughters to armymen and as an engineer, I am out of this race. If all goes well and if I find a job and she remains unmarried till then, I\u2019ll definitely ask her to marry me. I can never get a girl like her who is so joyous, cool, genial and I promise her she gets the best care and love from me. She\u2019s so special to me that if I don\u2019t talk to her I feel very alone. I don\u2019t have many girls in my WhatsApp and I never talk to any other girl unnecessarily. I talk to others either for my work or theirs but to this girl, I can talk every little thing that I want to say and I hope she remains with me my whole life. I could have also gone anonymous but I want to let know of my identity and story of my crush on my best friend. Thanks for reading! ",

Dear maa, I am coming back soon, very soon. This time not on my feet, but on the shoulders of my army brothers. Because the moment you would be reading this letter, will be the moment when I would have already sacrificed my breath for the loam of Motherland. You never wanted me to Join Indian army and why should one after loosing her husband in the battlefield. You always kept me out of everything which would attract me towards this indulgence. But what can I do, my DNA is of my father who ever wished to go for nation.  I still remember, when I was 6, he returned home as a martyr, wrapped in tricolor with stars of responsibility on his shoulder and the sign of satiety on his anterior. You screamed that moment, you cried that moment, the government, the society, the officials, saluted you for a while and forgot you the next moment but you remained Rock steady. Maa, You have to witness the tricolor one more time, you have to scream one more time, you have to cry one more time, they will salute you and forget you again,but you have to be rock one more time. As a son, I'm a deep failure. I never done a Verdict to single drop of tear that rolled down your eyes. The sleepless nights, the empty stomach, the refusal to buy new clothes and lot more , you have suffered a lot for me, and now when it is the time to return back a fraction of what you offered; I am leaving you again in seclusion where you have to agonize even worst. The society, the mass and even the media will not recognize you as I have chosen to shoot for nation in the battleground rather than shooting in playground of any Olympic. Being a martyr, I won't be able to find even a single corner in any newspaper filled with political scams and extra marital affairs of Bollywood celebs. Despite this irony, in the battle of priority between mother and motherland, between love, family and patriotism; for hundred times I have chosen the country; and for the next hundred times I will choose the same.Because it was your sayings that someone has to waive motherly enchant to let other taste the leisure. I never got a single chance to reveal how much I love you; but even if I got that, I won't be able to tell it because the volume of words are too tiny to express the puddle of love I bought for you. You were and will be my mother till eternity and even the supreme can't deny the fact. If the Almighty offered me take rebirth, I will choose to be your son again to recieve that hug from you again, to taste your food again, to encapsulate you in my arms and to cry again. But for now I'm leaving. Once more and probably the last time I am Offering you this bitter pill. GOODBYE Yours and Only Yours Parth ",

You were some weird classmate of mine who I happened to bump into and get into a brief conflict with, after which we hugged because neither of us meant it. Little did I know how much I\u2019d come to actually mean those words. 9th grade continued. The days became shorter. Our meetings became longer. I\u2019d find you at the library and sit down at the same table as you. You asked my number and we\u2019d stay talking long into the night. After school we\u2019d walk down to the shopping district and loiter around like the inconsiderate, pubescent virgins we are. Then one day, without even saying it, we became friends. Out of the blue, we crossed the invisible line that separates the acquaintance from the comrade. Then something else happened. I can\u2019t quite place when I began having these feelings about you, they just sprung up one day in my heart, and as much as I tried to suppress them, they spread throughout my entire body, inhibiting my thoughts, controlling my actions\u2026I couldn\u2019t help it. I liked you. I was falling for you. I don\u2019t know what it was about you that made me fall. Maybe it was your eyes. Maybe it was your voice. Maybe it was your way with kids. Maybe it was your recklessness. Perhaps it was your effortless charm. But whatever it was\u2026 It made me fall pretty damn hard. And now, a month into our sophomore year, just when I thought I was getting over these emotions, you manage to steal my heart yet again. I love you, Warren Vales. And this time, I mean it. I just wish you\u2019d actually know that. ",

How was our little Elise? I was here today in deadly trenches of Potomac army having a rough day with my fellow soldiers. You know Victoria life is always a hell of battle every day every second we fight a hell to survive and protect our loved ones physically, emotionally, mentally. this warzone is I\u2019m in now ain't nothing more bigger than what you are facing in house alone in my absence don\u2019t be angry on me if I don\u2019t return home for this Christmas cause you know a soldier\u2019s life. The days we fought in together in 66th regiment in Crimean wars and that\u2019s pretty how I met you it was this war I brought us together. I wish our life would have been more simple and normal. I always wanted you by my side. But god had made a different plan for each. I wish I were never in the army but if it would not have been for me this could be for some other guy and his family from here world seems more wicked honey as I came to know fate drives people and we just refill some others place in world. At the end all that blood and sweat of our soldiers is taken for granted and we are thrown a bone to celebrate. Victoria believe me I have seen men here great patriots dying and lying their life for countries but their stories lie vain and remain as unsung songs. I have seen a man here he was called iron heart it was given for his contributions to army brave guy and a brilliant strategist last time I saw him he faced 200 men alone with his gun which was a new prototype hand cannon called Gatling gun invented just previous year. God! what a move the man got. it was like his other hand in combat he was unstoppable we won the day but un-fortunately he sustained lot of injuries In battle and died a hero. What moved me most is we found a photograph in his shoe it was his wife and two daughters photo was blurry and there were marks of tear drops on it and when I flipped it on the back there was written \u201cI will reach you today Joanna\u201d and it was dated the same day he died the man knew that day he was gonna die that day he prepared for it he wanted reach his deceased family by killing the army responsible for it. What a victorious end he had. We mourned for him and more happy as he avenged his family gloriously. Such are our stories in war. I\u2019ll tell our stories to our little Elise when I return from war and if I didn\u2019t please don\u2019t be angry Honey just take good care of my little miss tell her to see me in stars. Tell her I\u2019ll be with her and looking at her always. She is really lucky that she had a bravest mother on earth. we just have two options now be a hero and lose everything for countries sake or be veteran and return home to our families both are noble ways but painful is one. I hope I\u2019ll see you in next letter Honey. Pray for us I love you till my last breath YOUR R.M.S ",

            "answer_text": "A little Long answer but please do read For my jee preparation I went to kota because I really wanted to be on my own, and my two friends also joined me(assume X and Y),we lived in same hostel went to same coaching.We all were well known to each other as we lived in the same colony for 2 years . So coming back to kota,we made a lot friends in hostel,everything was going very smoothly I was performing good in monthly exams so was X but Y didn't perfomed so well and gradually his rank deteriorated .Me and X's room were adjacent and we also shared the balcony (he also was my closest friend) while Y's room was on other floor.Suddenly in class 12th Y started getting pretty amazing and so did his batch improved even better than our whole group.We all thought that he cheated . On the other hand X started getting poor marks.Near the end ( October)I broke my ankle badly so my parents took me back home.And when I returned to kota in January it was all chaos- practicals,pre boards, mock jee mains paper in coaching everything on my head and I just couldn't handle.But this wasn't the end of my trouble .While our practical examination I came to know that both my friends(X and Y) were sc and st respectively, as mentioned on the roll no. list and I just couldn't believe.Forward to jee mains result day I scored 137 (expected 200+) and X scored 84, ten more marks than general cutoff Y didnt clear his cutoff only.I just couldn't concentrate on my advanced preparation due to my bad performance in mains and that my closest friend was sc who always falsified that he was general candidate. I knew that I won't be able to get a good rank in jee advanced and that only happened.I got 87 marks three less to be in the second merit list.I was really upset because everyone in my family thought I'll crack jee with flying colours. And in all this I came to know that X has got iitr metallurgy, I was shocked.He didn't deserved to be an iitian.All time during the last months of jee prep I could only see him playing mini miltia or reading novel.On the other hand I was getting vit ece some not so good nits and bits Hyderabad mechanical.But I decided to take a drop against everyone saying me not to,because I know i didn't do my best and also due to my untalented friend X who became an iitian.Now he keeps showing off on fb and I curse myself for not studying at the right time.I don't have anything against reserved category people but the creamy layer shouldn't get as both of our dads are government class 1 officers , paid the same rent of our hostel.And the sad part is he still thinks that I think he is a general candidate. How to feel better as I am always frustated about this.( sorry for mistakes if present) ",

I have great friends that make me laugh but it just temporary because the second I stop laughing I just remember when I nearly killed myself and how I wish it worked.

I don\u2019t want to do anything moving is something I have to fight myself to do. I don\u2019t get why i have to do something just to get a grade that means nothing. I don\u2019t see why I have to live when people have told me the world is bullshit and pointless. WHY WOULD I WANT TO LIVE HERE! I DON\u2019T BUT YOU WON\u2019T LET ME FUCKING LEAVE. I KNOW I\u2019M GOING TO DIE ALONG WITH EVERYONE I LOVE. SO WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT. I wont kill myself today or tomorrow or this week or this month or even this year but I will leave early and on my own terms.

Due it i had to default my suppliers payment which caused a lot of grief and over a period of 3 years i repaid them . Due to my age could not get jobs anywhere and if anyone offered the salary was not enough to pay my bills. Finally left the country currently working as a tradesman in Australia making minimum wage. Trying to stay afloat pay for my family expenses and mine. Its pay cheque to pay cheque. In all this my spouse blamed me for all the mess and stop communications totally, only calls or speaks if there is issue with money or childrens issue. She has stopped being physical with me for last 6 years. Tried speaking to her various times. But no avail, i am sexual frustrated, mentally a mess. No emotional support cannot discuss this with any one. I go to gym and get in good shape physically. Never thought of giving up, but some day get into depression is it all worth it. i dont know what to do. I am lost ",

Family wants to join me in payment seat.but I don't want a payment seat.i hate to join in payment seat and be a burden on them. My family has been very supportive (every family indeed:)and has done so much to me till date since I was a child. Dad has also been very sweet and supportive and concerned and he still is. (Of course every parent is:))but these days..I don't know.i mean I am not ok.dad became angry when I didn't get seat in 1st counselling.ofcourse the anger was only out of concern I can understand.buttt when I saw the official key and then the result,the result showed 10 Marks less than my marks.i couldn't understand why.if I ever got my original marks,i would have got seat by now.i don't know why it happened like that.i feel so unlucky right now.there we're numerous times when I cried just in last few days. No proper food wen I cried,no proper sleep,getting tired of crying,my eyes used to swell and pain.kept on thinking about my past 3 precious yrs and wat shouldn't have happened but happened.wat happened? I'll tell u.. Anxiety.depression.inferiority complex.confusion.reduction in iq.zero self confidence. Everything was fine till 10th.friends,studies,school,sports,home.perfect everything was.becoming a doctor was my dream sincee... I was a kid. Infact it's my passion too.i love biology a lot soo.yeah and so got into a gud junior clg.took bipc.i thought everything's gonna be 5ne now. Infact I was happy because it felt like getting closer to my dream.but thts were it all started.1st 2 wks of clg,I was sad bcz of end of school days.frns kept on coming to mind but eventually I got better.nxt came inferiority complex.i have to tell u my clg girls most of them were pretty.i have spots and pimples.they were spotless nd radiant.[i was 16 den. So feeling lyk dis mi8 be common and I guess:p but it was of high intensity fr me.]nxt came dpression anxiety,everything 1 by 1.i didn't knw what was happening wid me.i was such an extrovert in skool.but here,I couldn't talk wid any1 even if I wanted to.i dint knw hw days passed. No change in me.ultimately it affected my studies a lot in the initial days of my clg itself.i couldn't remember what I read the previous day,I couldn't understand even simple topics.wen I started reading,my mind used to be\u2026 just..blank.i became such dumb.i was a sharp student in skool.infact I couldn't figure out what was the problem wid me.i used to hide frm evry1.relatives,frns,even my best ones for no reason.i didn't know y.had evry thing to chill.but couldn't.evryday i used to fear to go to clg.evry mrng i used to wake up with a heavy heart.every hour,i was anxious nd tensed abt wats gonna happen nxt. It was lyk..a blanket covering my face totally to fight for breathing.i used to cry even wen mam jst talked to me normally.skool frns wer enjoying evry day at tht tym,and me..i was sitting in my room,alone,trying to figure out wat happened with me.Evry class used to make me only tensed.after all these 3yrs nw I knw it.had I known it before,..the story would have been different. Anyways,+2 also came.same scenes evryday. No change. My regular routine of crying most of the times started here.i would even fear to talk or sit beside those girls who were intelligent nd sharp in studies.i would say this was my peak stage of all the above bold letters.evrymrng,underline evry.i used to wake up wid heavy,paining,burning,eyes.indicating lack of sound sleep.and I dint knw this also before.but still I didn't lose trust in me.still I somehow tried to study by wrote,by mind mapping,and other stuff.i scored Gud in boards but couldn't score to my potential. It still bothers me. Gave neet.got panick attacks in the exam hall.couldnt crack it.dropped a yr.same scenes of bold letters but this tym intensity reduced.but still those sleep prblms.couldnt crack neet again.felt low. shattered.broken.dint knw what to do in future.dropped again.not those bold letters any more.(i don't hw they went off.y dey cameee y did dey gooo..I still don't knw.)satisfied wid my performance dis tym:)but due 2 high cutoffs dis yr..seat result kept waiting.evryday tension.couldnt show my face to my dad. At 1 Point I lost confidence in me and felt I can't study mbbs bcz I dnt hav that potential. But deep inside there is still a ray of hope in me.hope is what that keeps us alive:) My mind has been very unstable these days.within seconds just lyk that it's changing thoughts.sumtyms I feel high.sumtyms low\u2026I dnt knw.mayb things will come to place wen i join my dream course:) All that I want to say is,1]never lose hope.2]never doubt ur worth.3]trust urself.4]never ever underestimate others.who knows if an ant can climb a wall.never judge any1 by their looks.they r much beyond the way they luk.5]never be overconfident.have confidence in u.not less.not more.its very important.

It takes u forward.6]always trust the above 1.he ll help u through thick and thin.and most importantly, very very important,7]get urself CHECKED in case of ANYkind of mental illness.dnt be ignorant and unaware like I was. If at all u r not being the one you are,get urself checked.even if it's a small change in u.they can happen anytime unknowingly to any1 of any age. (my bold letter frns have ruined my 3 precious and important yrs of my lyf.c hw NYC frns I've got;)family has been very supportive so those dint bcme sooo chronic.though I dint share anything wid dem abt my condition)8]always do hard+smart work and trust it.

            "answer_text": "Yes I wanna share a story of my life which I can't share even with my best friend because I don't have any. It all started when I was in 12th standard till then I have met so many people some of them were my best friends too but not for very long time\u2026. So when I got promoted to 12th standard I didn't have any best friend that time of course I did have some close friend but I can't say them my bestie.... So coming to the point, It was the date of 8 may and the timing was about 7:30 pm I had stopped using facebook and I usually opened it sometime but that day I thought of seeing friends request ( I'm a die hard fan of astronomy and physics since my childhood) I saw a girl's request before accepting her request I started checking her profile I had come to know that she is also interested in astronomy.. Of course that was one of the best feeling I had... After I accepted her friend request she sent me \u201c hi \u201d first and then asked \u201c are u interested in astronomy too \u201d I said yes... There come the turning point.... We started talking to each other for 3\u20134 hours on that day she asked for my contact number I was surprised because I used to talk less to girls and seeing a girl asking for my contact number was a strange feeling for me I gave her my number\u2026 Next day she called me and I had a really awkward conversation with her because I'm a shy type of guy with girls\u2026 after sometime she made fun of me and started calling me \u201cMr. Shy\u201d I didn't understand what should I say I said that's a nice name.... As the time passed we became close friends (we were only LDR friends and we met only once) and later we became best friends I often thought it's really very lucky to have a bestie with same craziness as urs we used to talk a lot I mean we used to talk sometime 16 hours I didn't know what type of person I became from shy to a totally Frank guy with her.... She told me about her life and career and we planned to study together and do so many things in future but time changed everything, I started feeling love for her... I mean not only friends but lover one... I decided to tell her about my feelings and it was a new year's night and the timing was 12:05 am I told her everything from my heart she already knew that I have feelings for her but to my surprise I was not the first person even she told me first that she loved me but later we decided to be only friends until we won't complete our studies As the time passed there came a turning point in our friendship..... A strange guy came in her life I didn't think that because of him I would lose something in my life I started feeling jealous because of him whenever I text her ( That guy was in her college) he also came online and started talking to her later he called me and told me everything about him because I asked him everything indirectly.... I was damn sure that because of that guy distance between me and my bestie would increase\u2026. Later he started sending me screen shot of his conversation with her to make me jealous and I knew that my bestie was friendly with most of the people but still I started feeling jealous because of the things I saw in those conversations I decided to ask her about this but she took my question emotionally and started saying me that I don't trust her I broken her trust later I showed her proof that he was actually a very bad guy for her so she would have to break their friendship. She agreed with me\u2026 Later as her summer vacation began she started doing internship in her university I had no problem with her decision but later I realised that she started avoiding me before she text me first later until I won't text her she didn't say even hi I asked her \u201cwhat happened to you yaar \u201d ? She said, \u201cnothing I'm busy due to my work I will talk to you later \u201d that's fine I accept That after some days I found that she is online talking to other friends but not to me I asked her reason so she said me \u201cjust go away from my life I don't wanna talk to you now \u201d I knew that there might be have any problem that's why she was saying like this I asked her reason but she didn't say anything.... I was very hurt due to this... After 1 week she texted me and called me because I was so much hurt by her behavior (also I was frustrated because I had to find college for my bachelor's) but I didn't reply her and after sometime I sent her hi but instead of understanding my situation she got angry on me and said me \u201c you are arrogant and egoistic type, you are angry that's why you are not replying and now I don't wanna talk to you ever forget me and our friendship \u201d I didn't understand what to say now I told her everything about my situation but still after some hours she blocked me :-( :'( I lost one of the most beautiful person in my life without actually knowing why she was behaving so rudely with me \u2026. I have decided to move on but still I can't forget that she was my bestie once :'( :-( ",

            "answer_text": "Could I have been different from who I am in now? No, today I ll face me. If I could go back in past, Would I be a different person than What I have been all this while. Had I worked harder and done anything to score better marks in 12th. I see it now, but not that clear but I can see. Would I had done anything for better grades? I knew, how important college is going to be. Next 5 years I ll be spending in there and that will eventually impact what i become as a person. I remember myself making plans to study hard and later cursing myself for not completing my almost unrealistic targets and ultimately falling into depression, willing to suicide multiple times a day. Then another escape I found from the fear of death and to lower sense of self-worth that I was feeling disgusting and suffocating in. To plan to run away. I was fully prepared to run with an another almost unrealistic plan but with time interval of long term and so I can have my optimistic fictual plan in some dark corner of my mind in the deception of uncertainies of future. and here I sit now, completely different from what i could have imagined two years ago. I never would have guessed or imagined myself, in this condition, writing this, If I were asked two years ago. You never know, how conditions that surround time will change you. Still, you need to plan, If someone ask me right now. Where do You see yourself after next 5 years? I feel pain of fear in the bottom of my chest. We, I think are too fragile for not be broken. Coming from college, all the way thinking about drinking the potion to dive into last sleep. The proper alignment of sentences for suicide note which I eventually abondoned to write. Right place to suicide and the news it ll create if it be a public place. Getting irritated by the stupid question those dick heads asked while I was trying to understand pinacole- pinacolone rearrangement, makes me question myself Could I have been at a better place and that is where it all starts. Was it same in school too? Yes, I have memories of yogi trying to play that role while I was trying to maintain my calm. Bringing more persons to your life which you've been lately trying won't improve you on your carrer path. It is a separate endeavour, only you can pull yourself forward on though youll definitely need help. At moments, I say to myself, \"Just cut yourself to last sleep, *Suicide* or put your ass on fire to study hard. You had begin a few times. You start feeling good about yourself and again slowly slide into depression of unworking still body. ",

            "answer_text": "I fell in love with someone who has DID\u2026 I fell in love with his fingers the first time we met and from there we got to know each other more. After 5 years of being friends and us knowing we liked each other but afraid to get into a relationship, we took this chance to be together. Only thing is, this relationship was destroyed because he no longer has control of his body and the person that is out may recognize me but doesn't feel anything for me. The hardest part? I don't know. It's either because I have BPD it's hard or because I'm helpless that we currently reside in two different countries. It took us so far to get here yet we have to be apart again and this time, he doesn't even care about me. So what do I do? I alter all my memories to devalue him and to numb all my emotions. Until I lose it. But unlike before, I can never devalue him but only blamed everything on me and the reason why he ended up this way was all because of me. I want him back yet I have to live without him. I dream about him every night yet my memories are slowly fading. My emotions change every second that, I could feel like years have passed but in reality, not even a day has passed. But you know what? I have to fight. I have to keep fighting and survive because I can't kill myself. At least not now. So what should I do? He asked for the rest of my life and abandoned me because another personality came out. When will he ever come back? No idea. Maybe after I end my life will he come back. Maybe\u2026 maybe I should just end my misery as soon as I can because at the end of the day, everyone just abandons you. I have myself. So maybe if I rip this memory of mine apart and forget all of this, will I finally be free from this toxic BPD cycle? Then again, I'd prob feel motivated in the next moment so who knows\u2026 In the end, he lied. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm contradictory. I am undeniably a very shy and anxious person. I love to stay at home, and watch rain, or sit back in a chair and just think. I absolutely love doing these things, but I don't. I don't because my entire character also craves the social presences of others constantly. This contradiction forces me, and socially anxious and shy introvert, to become some sort of confidence-beaming machine. If I am not talking to someone, then it hurts. I have a feeling of utter loneliness and desolation. I feel helpless and sad, and suddenly, vey scared to talk to anyone. Because of this, I get stuck in a loop of craving somebody's company, but being to anxious to seek them out, which then causes me to feel even worse. This cycle continues until the next school day, where I have a long ponder on the way to school, and then inevitably start a conversation with someone when I get there. Most people than know me would describe me as confident. Those same people will also be surprised upon reading the previous paragraph. It is true. I am a massive introvert. And I don't think many people do actually appreciate the things I've seen, and think I'm just some hyper guy who comes to school with a smile on his face everyday, and therefore is always happy, and therefore does not need attention, as he is content. But, he is not happy. He is living a fa\u00e7ade and your are stopping him from breaking the illusion.  I have wrote this all down because I'm feeling lonely, and it's Friday. I have to wait until Monday until I'll be content. This whole thing is just a reach out for somebody to message me. But it won't work. Even if someone does message me, I'll know deep down that these are just people who want to improve their own self image by 'helping' others. Deep down, I know this person does not care for me. So please, don't reach out, don't come to me on Monday and go 'Caleb, are you okay?' or, infact, say anything in relation to this paragraph. I don't want your help. I don't want you to look at me any differently because you realise who I am. I Don't Want People To See Me Differently. And truly, the fear that people will see me differently, Treat me differently- it scares me. It really does. I do not dare open up to anybody in fear of this. So what I'm gonna do is I'm probably not gonna show anyone this. This confession will never see the light of another students iris. - Caleb I wrote this a few hours ago. I've decided posting it here is probably better then keeping it in my phone. Please don't worry about me. I'm just fine. ",

Well, it was the best thing that ever happened to me in years. Giving myself a chance to explore and connect to myself as a woman and being. You are a thorough gentleman. Your eyes had warmth and your touch fleetingly gentle, leaving me to respond at my own pace. I didn\u2019t expect I would feel so comfortable. I guess it was the way you are, not pushy, only focused on me and my flow, without making me feel stripped or as an object of lust. You had a warm voice and spoke of many things under the sky, sharing and asking, easily bonding for me to open up.I liked the fact you were willing to meet even if there was no sex involved. That you were concerned with my wants than your needs. You didn\u2019t unnecessarily flatter me, but offered genuine compliments. You were also playful and yet mindful as the conversation flowed and soon my consent followed. Yes, we did it. And again you are the best lover I ever had. I wish more men out there knew how to lead a woman, how to treat a woman, how to be gentle in moves\u2026. Knowing a woman\u2019s mind is the only way. And I encourage every woman in my situation to take a chance\u2026 Thank you James. \ud83d\ude18 There were little more but I am not sharing that here,But this made my day. ",

We are fragile. We don\u2019t invite blame, shame, ridicule. We fear to be fragile openly, we don\u2019t want to be hurt by insensitive people. Fear of all kinds can be won over but most of the people often have no idea they have fears. Brain retraining deals very successfully with fears: fear of speaking, fear of not being liked, fear of failure, fear of losing your friends, fear of hurting someone etc etc etc. The list is very long.

My mother was a hospice patient but up until the last week of her life she was so much herself and I really thought I had more time. I miss her so much and the drudgery of trying to fake it is almost more than I can stand. I wonder if everyone feels the huge hole in the universe. I want the world to know what an amazing person she was, so strong, funny, brilliant and good. My husband died 4 years and 1 day before my mother and I felt lonely and confused, died suddenly with no notice at all. I thought because my mom was on hospice and 89 I would be able to understand when she passed away, but no I feel my greatest childhood fear has come true. ",

            "answer_text": "5 Year old GIRL Dancing for a penny.!! With a large honking sound, Train arrived at platform number 5 of Chennai Chetpet station. As usual the crowd was full in the platform and everyone was trying to board the train so they can occupy the seats inside. I was watching them sitting nearby in a stone bench. I usaully board at the last,so i can stand near the door and enjoy the scene with the headphones On. Train started to move parallely when i boarded at the last. Made myself comfortable and was enjoying the view, the trees were green and i can sense the humidity of the air in my face due to last night rain. The travelling time was 40 mins from Chetpet to Velacherry station(chennai). Everything was going fine.Until then 15 mins from the departure, i heard a strange matured voice singing at the corner of the berth.I ignored it at first but it kept on increasing. Removed my headphones and saw a matured women singing and asking money from the passengers. It was a common thing to spot in any indian railway station, but the next thing which i saw almost filled tears in my eyes. A little girl around 5 years was holding her mother's pallu and following wherever her mom went. My eyes were tottaly on that little feet of her. It was following the same steps of her mother's. As soon as they both came to the berth where i was standing. The crowd made a circle automatically With the mom and little girl standing at the center. The little girl was wearing a filthy top which matched with her almost torned frock.The mom took a ring from her dirty one-sided bag and handed over to her daughter. The ring was not more then a span of 30cm in dia. And to my shock the little girl performed tricks by inserting her whole body inside it and Parallely her mom was singing song. I was like \u201cwhat the hell!! Why is she doing it with a 5 year old girl?? Did she not have anynother option then doing this kinda things?? Please stop doing this\". My mind was constantly murmuring this words. After the drama, the girl with a plate in hand asked money from from all the viewers standing nearby. She came near me,shaking her plate with coins. She was so little that her height was equal to my knees. (Similar to this) Google image:  I kneeled down to match her height., Me: Nee Romba azhaga iruka..Un peru sollu apo dan kasu kudupen!! (U look like an angel,tell me your name first then only i will give you what you want.) She: Bohut bhook lagi h! Paisey dedo kuch. I figured out that she is from northern state, so i switched my language so i don't feel like dumb in front of all the passengers looking. Me: Paisey toh dunga, pehle naam bath do aapka.(Please tell your name first, i will give you whatever you want after that). She: Kajal (in a husky voice). Me: Achacha Kajal, mere pass paisey nahi hain par khaney k leye bohut chocolate or biscuits h!! Chaiye aapko?. ( oh!! Kajal, great. I don't have money right now all i have is lots and lots of chocolate and biscuits.Want? She: (With a large smile) chocolate sachi mein?? ( wow!! Chocolates!? Really??) Me: Haan,bohut h, Lelo.( Yes!! Take this all) Handed over a bunch of chocolates and good day biscuits from my backpack. She was happy, and accepted my offer without declining it.Her mother from behind saw it a gave a brisk smile. They moved to other berth continuing their work. And i was recalling all the incidents happened. The eyes of the little girl was constantly crossing my mind. My mind was like, \u201c Please god, why are you doing this to a small girl like her. Why did she need to beg?? What did she do, Please provide her a good education.\u201d I don't have any friends in real, so quora is only platform where i can share this that why Iam writing this down here I Hope everything to that little fella happens good. Hereafter. -Asveen Paulzon ",

I lost everything n all he said was sorry ..which i am used to hearing from 1 year ..he said this several times but did not meant it for once ..his mom isn't doing well from more than 1 year n this is what he was doing to me but now when I warned him of informing his parents ..he is hiding behind his mother's bad health ..n who will believe me ,his parents?..parents of such fraud guy will give me justice?..no never ..n so I decided to give up on my fight n just be thankful that I got rid and escaped from this monster bcz hadn't I know this now , things would have got worst.. Not just me many girls and women suffering such situation prefer backing off rather than fighting where there is no justice ..being a victim i did know the ultimate losser is gonna be me ..ppl will talk , spoil my name and judge me not him\u2026n my society talks about equality?..the loss is beyond everything.

            "answer_text": "I just wanted to say that I am still here. I am almost 34 years old and I am living with severe depression and anxiety, fighting since I was 12. Actually that\u2019s wrong, I need to go back further to the beginning. I was three weeks late, and both my mother and I almost died to bring me into the world. She said I always did things in my own time, and that has not changed much. Mom said she prayed for me to be \u201cunique and different\u201d. Some days I wish she\u2019d asked for a \u201cfinancially successful\u201d child instead. I loved my family but with my anxiety and depression, I became a recluse. Fear prompted me to hide the things I loved to do the most. I couldn\u2019t take the questions about my artwork, my interests, my anything. Combined with a parenting style that included berating me for things I could not change, it was a recipe for disaster. I went from loving to learn to skipping school. My high school teachers asked me if I was \u201cmiserable\u201d or if I \u201chad any friends\u201d. I did, thankfully, but thinking back now, I can see where these questions came from. I was a very quiet young lady, quite different from most of my peers. If not for alternative school and Adderall (which later I found out that I was misdiagnosed), I would have not graduated on time. College was even worse. I WAS miserable, avoiding classes and feeding my agoraphobia. I was lying to my parents about my grades until I eventually flunked out. I tried a couple of other colleges, repeating this cycle. I had become quite good at masking my pain. I also developed a healthy fear of higher education. So I sought employment, and was even able to support myself for a time. It didn\u2019t last. The longest I held down a job was one year. Unfortunately that is my current record, and that was back in 2006. I was smart and people savvy, so finding a new job wasn\u2019t very hard. I\u2019m sure if I included every single job I have worked no one would trust me to watch a pet rock. I made job hopping a profession in itself, a Jill of All Trades. However, I was a master of none and I was unhappy. Not too long after, I was 27 and reunited with an old crush from high school and we decided to get married. Or maybe I should say I wanted marriage and he just went along with it. That should have been the first red flag, but I chose to ignore it. After that things seemed to be perfect, funny enough. I had a good paying job, enough to buy a car and handle most of the bills. Things seemed to be looking up. Suddenly after seven months of working at this job, I got very sick. I could hardly eat and my stomach hurt almost constantly. I kept going to the doctors, getting told the test results were \u201cnormal\u201d. I tried to different diets, cutting out certain food. I even quit smoking marijuana, thinking it might be the culprit. Nothing worked, and I eventually resigned, doubled over in pain. This made my husband resent me greatly. I did my best to hide the pain, to smile for him. I think he was depressed too. I feel very alone and unloved, and I resented him for that. I would have to beg him to spend time with me, demanding attention at time. It got old fast. well, maybe not fast, three years went by during this time. Fast forward to 2013, I was done. I had a strong wish for death. It was no longer a \u201ccry for attention\u201d. It was a plan. I set the date as the end of the year. I simply refused to live another day in pain like I was. I wasn\u2019t scared or sad. If not for an old friend reaching out to save me, I most certainly would be dead right now. Some people say suicide is the \u201ccoward\u2019s way out\u201d. I vehemently disagree. I had fought so hard so for long before I reached that conclusion. I had this hole inside me that nothing could fill. I felt like I was stumbling in darkness, lost and without purpose. But I didn\u2019t want to die. I wanted to live, really LIVE, something I had not done in a very long time. So I lived with my parent\u2019s for a while. I drank my father\u2019s hard liquor every night before bed, a whiskey flavored band-aid. I still couldn\u2019t eat solid foods and my mother discovered it was due to anxiety and stress. Insomnia was a common occurrence. I didn\u2019t feel like a human being in any respect. That and I was so darn ANGRY. I was angry at everyone and everything. I had no trust for anyone. I thought everyone was out to get me. A lot of counselling finally convinced me otherwise. In 2017 I finally found the right doctor and started taking Prozac. It took awhile to take effect, but when it did I felt so much better. I was still scared things would fall apart, terrified of a bad day, a bad moment. My only consistency was chaos and I was tired of happiness slipping through my fingers. Now in 2018, about a month ago I was hit with a strong depressive episode, apparently because my body has gotten used to the dosage of Prozac. I no longer have a death-wish, but I also lack ambition and goals. I am just floating through life, still unable to hold down a job. Bills are piling up, and sometimes I\u2019m not able to afford food or medication. My hobbies include lying in bed, facing the wall. The funny thing is, it\u2019s not as painful as it used to be. I\u2019m learning to forgive myself. I know now that sometimes I get sick like this. I am trying to work on my tendency to avoid things. I am broken, I am scarred. But I am still here. ",

            "answer_text": "This is partially an open letter to someone who has died almost ten years ago, an accident and mental illnesses I have suffered through, and how I\u2019m still trying to get through life every day pretending I am a normal person. This is the question I despise the most: \u201cHow are you today?\u201d If I am in a good mood, I respond with a simple \u201cFine.\u201d If someone asks me \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d and I\u2019m going through one of my moods, I reply sarcastically and I tell them \u201cThe sky. The sky is always up.\u201d They think I\u2019m being funny and walk away. I roll my eyes. If you aren\u2019t prepared for a genuine answer, please don\u2019t ask someone how they are feeling, because they might just snap one day. I was 18 years old in 2010, the year of my high school graduation. Going back a few years on the first day of ninth grade, I met a friend named Joseph. Joseph was the purest boy anyone could ever meet. He was shy, often the kid in the background that no one paid attention to, but you would never meet anyone nicer than him. He was too good for this world, and, right before graduation, God (or whatever force is out there); took him out of this world. I was supposed to go to prom with Joseph. We were all going to go as a group of friends, rent a limo, and do all those normal prom things that teenagers entering adulthood normally do on prom night. After Joseph\u2019s death I no longer felt like going to prom, and I returned my stupid frilly pink ball gown and traded it for a slim black number instead that I wore to his funeral. To this day I refuse to go to another funeral. When you are a teenager and you see someone your own age in an open faced coffin, I can guarantee that you will not see the world with the same innocence again, and the view of a white faced child who was barely a man will traumatize you somewhat. A few months after graduation I got myself into a very serious car accident. My truck flipped over 5 times (I counted as I was flipping) and the car crashed on top of me. I was knocked out for 20 minutes and trapped underneath the car the entire time. No one stopped to pull me out until I woke up and started screaming. There was a very strong chance that the truck could have exploded after the crash at any time. The authorities were right on the scene and did nothing until I woke up. They most likely proclaimed me dead on the scene so that they wouldn\u2019t have to investigate for themselves, because it was too hard of a job to pull me out and since it was almost 5:00 they wanted to go home for dinner. When I was finally pulled out after screaming for an extra minute or 2 I was treated as a nuisance. As the accident was occurring I felt an odd feeling as though I was floating. When I finally landed on the ground and crashed, I came out without any broken bones. Strangely, I was also not in any pain at all. It felt as though the accident never happened. For years after that I constantly told myself that things would have been easier if I died. I felt that Joseph would have done so much more with his life if he was the one who was able to live instead of me. For nearly ten years I hated myself just for being alive, bt now as I become a little older I start to feel guilty for thinking that way. Years afterward I suffered through a period of alcoholism, and ever since I was a kid I\u2019ve had difficulties with self - harm and those problems only intensified after Joseph\u2019s death and my car accident. In another Quora post I\u2019ve wrote about my one year anniversary of overcoming my self - harm issues, and now I\u2019ve been over 2 years clean! Things are slowly getting better for me, and I\u2019ve also haven\u2019t had a drop of alcohol for about a year and a half. Believe it or not what\u2019s actually helped me feel bursts of happiness some days is my job. I am a Massage Therapist and I truly like to believe what I do helps people, even if it\u2019s very minorly. Massage Therapy has many benefits. It can temporarily (sometimes permanently) reduce other people\u2019s symptoms of pain or even help them psychologically with depression, anxiety, or other mental illnesses. This is why I truly love my job and I think the longer I stick with it the happier I could become overtime. I thank everyone for reading this and I hope if you are going through tough times that you will find peace reading stories of other people who have been there. If anything, there is comfort in knowing that you are not alone - and you never truly will be. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written my last answer on 29th January 2018, a day before I left home to join the first job of my life. 2 weeks from that day, having settled at a different city at a different state, far away from my home and people, I\u2019ve grown into a much different person within this short span of time. I\u2019m no longer that carefree guy who would prefer to sleep snoozing the morning alarm. Rather I jump out of bed with the first alarm at 5.55 am, perform 20-30 push-ups, and then rush into the bathroom. Brushing teeth, completing nature\u2019s call, washing daily clothes and bathing, I come out by 6.30 am in order to make the bathroom free for three of my roomies cum friends cum colleagues. Getting dressed in formals, I take breakfast and then pack my lunch box. Booking a cab as soon as my roomies get ready, we reach office before even the stipulated time. Spending nine and half hours at an IT sector is damn hectic. With one lunch break and two tea breaks in between, we\u2019re literally flooded with assessments, milestones, step-plus, mini-projects and 96 other fancy names as generated by the company. It gets past 7 pm when I reach PG from office. Completing some office work and doing other stuffs such as laundry and washing daily utensils, I\u2019ve to rush for dinner by 9.30 pm, else I won\u2019t get food for the night. Then I talk to mom over phone, write some stuff, do online counselling as per requirements, and finally go to bed setting up the morning alarm. This life is far different from the life that I\u2019ve lived so far! On one hand I\u2019ve to perform household stuff, while on the other, I\u2019ve to maintain an active corporate life. I\u2019m taking care of my expenses as well as health all alone. My life is quite hectic today, but I\u2019m got used to it. I\u2019ve turned entirely self-dependent, and a more responsible guy who never forgets to make time for family even in the midst of this busy schedule. I\u2019ve a long way to go still, and I\u2019m thankful to each and every day that has shaped me in order to smoothly lead this life I\u2019ve been living today. Life is not about lying on your bed and dreaming your achievements, It\u2019s about working your ass off in order to make those dreams your ultimate reality.

            "answer_text": "I am 19 year old indian girl, doing Bsc in pune university. Both my parents are uneducated. My father sells fruits whilst my mom manage mess agency for college going students and this is how our home runs. Actually, I am from one of the backward categories (SC) and it\u2019s very common in our family culture to send off girls, marrying just after, she crosses her 18. Before a few days ago, my father stated a marriage proposal in front of me and was willing me to accept the groom, he has chosen for me; who is 27 year old and does farming, studied up to 10th grade only. I refused for marriage straight, reason being an early age and made want-to-study-further a prime reason to refuse my marriage. However, they didn\u2019t listen to a single word of mine, blackmailed me, forced me, even cried in front of me to accept him as they had given their words to the groom\u2019s family so, refusing could defame their respect. (How selfish they are, they only care about there reputation. And what about my freedom, choice and life?) They finally made me accept him forcibly, and let the groom\u2019s family know about approval from bride\u2019s family. 2 Jan, 2019 (just yesterday) my marriage was about to happen, but I ran off leaving my home before the groom\u2019s family reached our place. Today\u2019s date: 3 Jan, 2019 My current status: Homeless, Right now, I am just roaming around the street of pune, in such a cold weather. I have my ATM debt card with me, one water bottle, last night I didn\u2019t even sleep, having only 4k in my bank account. I don\u2019t know how much will those 4k go up to! I can\u2019t even go to my relatives as there is a high possiblity that they will inform my parents about my whereabouts. My friends are selfish; they just don\u2019t care about me, so asking them for help would be nothing but waste of time. Now I am trying to save as much money as I can, and eating just vada pav to save maximum of money. I am writing this answer from street itself, having tea on footpath. Now I don\u2019t have any place to stay in, so I think I will have to sleep tonight on street only. I can book a hotel or find a room but that will charge me a lot. I have to save this 4k till I find any Job. Now I have got only two options, committing suicide or just going back home to my family and getting married to that guy. Edit: Update - Current Time : 6:50 AM Date: 4 Jan, 2019. Current status : Friends, I went to a temple last night, slept right over there, the night went well but coldness and mosquitoes troubled a bit. Now I am planning to go to eat something, as i am really hungry. Edit 2nd : Thanks Vandana Mishra (\u0935\u0902\u0926\u0928\u093e \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e) and Devangana Mandal Ma\u2019am for such a kind response, I will message anyone of you by the evening. And also, thanks to other people who suggested me the various ways to sort out this dilemma. Time: 11:30 AM; Date : 4 Jan, 2019. Status: Right now, I am way good but caught Cold and Tonsil with a bit of fever because of sleeping out. 3rd Edit :- Time- 10:15 PM date - 4 jan, 2019. Went to hospital as my health got worsened than before, doctor prescribed me a few medicines; which wasted good amount of money. Status: Booked a cheap hotel, drained with money, might be I shall go back home, but my parents just consider me a burden on family and want to get rid of me as soon as they can, so just don\u2019t feel like goin\u2019 back. Exhausted and sick, I slept the whole day here itself in this hotel so I couldn\u2019t contact anyone. Edit 4th:- Time- 1:40 PM; Date- 5 Jan, 2019. Today morning, I dropped a text to The Incredible sir after going through some of his answers, helping nature and past contribution of helping a widow and finally met him in one of the public parks. He being friend of Vandana Mishra (\u0935\u0902\u0926\u0928\u093e \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e) ma\u2019am discussed with her about my issue. A very very much Thanks to this two generous people who helped me. Current status: Right now, I am in the flat of sumit kumar sir, pune and he promised to help find me a Job. Edit 5: Most comments are seeking the answer to where I charged up my mobile phone. When my mobile\u2019s battery went down, I\u2019d go and get my mobile Charged by local mobile repairing shops. The mobile would usually take about 2 hours to get charged when on airplane mode. Meanwhile, I would just sit at the park, thinking a way out. ___ ",

And in my thinking in my case maybe 100 % of people on my Facebook would not care. Only another story to read. And then with copy and paste. When would the story really end. Only to travel on Computers In my case living alone. If i get a problem i try and work it out. To cross it of the list. And than forget about it. Until the next one comes up and do the same again. One day i hope to be problem free And lead a happy life with a smile ",

Ok for those who are unaware..She is none other than the lady who bagged the most appealing award in her field- Indian Television Award for best Anchor, Shweta Singh. It's a matter of great wonder what do I've against or for her. Jumping staight to the point\u2026 During Nirbhaya's Rape case, she went for inspection at 1 am in the night to gather an update about the case. She travelled to the spot in her car. She took off the car to approach towards the site. Meanwhile she encountered a gang of men passing lewd comments on her. Guy1: Ma'am, please help me. Shweta: What's the issue?? Guy1: Please come with me, no girl is ready to do with me.I assure to surprise you. Shweta: What? Where? Guy2: Arre bhabhi bistar garm karne. Translation: Nevermind. This is enough to pinpoint the situation in our society. What sort of abashment this reflects on the society? Where are the so called morals, manners etc? Aren't those guys humans, don't they have sisters? One thing is for sure, if I come across such guys I will break their f**king faces. Merely writing this down won't calm down my heartburn.

She: (laughing like a hyna) Me: -_- Ok, ok.. How many you got? She: Zero\u2026!! Me: What..!! Are you kidding me..!! She: -_- I am serious..! M not beautiful and my presence doesn't matters to anyone, I am just a simple girl who just want to fulfill her parent's dream. Me: (murmuring) that's why I love you. She: You said something. \u2026?? Me: No no no\u2026 Nothing. And who the hell told you that you are not beautiful and your presence doesn't matters to anyone..!! You know what..! There is someone who thinks that you are the most beautiful girl, and your presence, that only matters to him AND\u2026\u2026\u2026 She: And..? Me: The main thing that matters to him is your smile\u2026.!! And he is in love with you since you were in your high school .. She: I think I know about this guy.. and that guy is in front of me right now. Am I right..!! Me: ( Blank ) She: Are you serious ..? Me: No no\u2026!! I was just telling you. And it\u2019s your headache to guess about the right one. And don't worry am not going to propose you..!! She: Smart boy..!! XD Me: (Smiling, to hide that pain) She: I just want to be away from these mess ups. And I want you to be too. Me: Obviously dumbo..!! And I promise that you will never face any problem because of me, regarding these mess ups..!! She: That\u2019s why I trust you and I am this much close to you since I met you\u2026!! High school right.! Me: Yeah..!! That day I could have told her about my feelings that I was hiding since the day I met her. (High school) But, sometimes you have to be silent because at that time, the person is more important than your feelings. I know if I would have been told her about my feelings that day, then today I will not be able to even see her. Yes, I still meet her, always hiding my feelings and waiting for the right moment. (Her smile, her craziness and her childish behaviour are enough to make me fall in love everytime when I see her.) (Most of the time I cry that I can't even tell her what I feel for her..) \u2192 worst moment ever. \u201cIt's better to hide your feelings for someone, rather than loosing that person forever ..\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I want to do . I want to spill out my emotions on what do I miss the most in my life THE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE The world is a vibrating string comprising a plethora of universes , each vibrating with a different frequency. Each universe bifurcated at different moments in the past , thus being so similar to each other yet so contrasting . Sitting in the corner of my room in my universe I was oblivious to the alternate reality which was an alternative in my universe but a truth somewhere else .\"\" The year brought me glee , moments of pride , honour and respect . It made me taste the savour of achievement and success and made my fly right to the zenith of the resplendent , cheerful and hopeful sky with absolute autonomy . Then all of a sudden the sky changed its hue , the dark clouds paved their way through and I was seized of my flight , and was exposed to a different place with a challenging evironment , with different challenges and with a new way of life to conform to . The new life was adventurous , precarious and full of zeal . It demanded a totally different art of living and brought out to me the ugly truth of people , it potrayed a new level of struggle infront of me , revealed the harsh world behind me and made me realise the beauty and lucidity of my past . My mind craved for the past and its contents and dragged me to go back but ultimately failed . Fed up from the present and begging for past , one day it finally found PEACE . It finally was content . All of a sudden the tranquility and the glee was back again . It was when it had unwittingly found out that ALTERNATE UNIVERSE where the present was the same past i had lived one year back . Hence from then , every night it traversed through the vacuum , through the void to his ALTERNATE UNIVERSE to relive his dear past once again . I questioned it what tranquility it found in that distant universe everyday. It replied with serenity , \" In my ALTERNATE UNIVERSE I relive my resurrected past . \u201cThere I study in my dearest class X C again . I see my dear clime again , the same bunch of 8-9 people who were different from others , who were just like me , who were my true companions . I sit on the same chair again ,I have my special friends behind my desk again , I lean out on the same wall , peep through the same window , watch the same football match , watch the same dusty ground , watch the same students loitering there. I see the scribbled wall near me again , filled with zayn and taylor's initials and with abusive words and see my friends pen on it more again . I attend the history classes again and feel sleepy with the rest of the class again , We decorate the freedom fighters in the history period and play tic tac toe once again . \u201c To that ALTERNATE UNIVERSE my mind travels everyday , to find happiness and contentment . Living here but longing to that universe every single moment , It narrates its stupendeous journey everyday with pride as it says , \" I see the same canteen , have the same savoury stuffs everyday , I peep into the weird one's tiffin and ask for my share from the tasty tiffin wala everyday . We boycott the school functions and listen to the class teacher's lectures again. We wish the teacher in the same lazy tone and wait for the teacher's weird reactions . We wittness the same argument between the strict teacher and his target student and giggle slowly once again. We flatter each other so as to reveal our secrets and oblige each other never to it tell anyone ever . We have our tiffin before recess and pounce on the same strangers in the canteen again.\u201d To this heavenly UNIVERSE my mind wanders night and day , though miles away but worth going everyday . It continues saying , \" I go to the same X C where I and my special friends suffered mental pressure together , where we begged for games periods together and put the topper ahead in front of the strict teacher together . We talk about popular songs and murmur them the entire day . We have the same free periods and we play dumsharas as we used to play we shout together at the top of our voice until the teacher beside the class shows her strict eyes as she used to show then . We attend those long , never ending assemblies once again and die to run away from there again , we talk in the same sign language and have that same stock phrases as we did then. We hoot on the entry of the special girl and witness our buddy blushing as he used to do then. We spend 15 minutes extra after every games period again and listen to the lecture of the strict teacher again We prepare together for those tests again and pray to pass somehow again . We make those silly projects again and beg for pictures and stuffs from each other again .\u201d \"Yes I relive my past everyday again . In that ALTERNATE UNIVERSE where my past is still a present , to that universe i long to go everyday . I dont care for what you say as I have the soothing comfort of my ALTERNATE UNIVERSE everyday . Why shouldnt I spend those priceless moments again ? Why shouldnt I prefer the balmy breeze of my past over the thunderstorms of my present ? Why shouldnt I go to that place everyday where I get to live my true life ? \" It defends itself everyday . Today nothing has changed except that I have to travel some light years instead of some few metres to go the place which I love . To the class where i wrote my future , to the corridor where i walked smugly , to the staircases which i trod on , to the teachers whom i loved unconditionally , to my dearest friends whom i lived my life with . Dedicated to all my dear friends and my teachers with whom i spent the most memorable and happy moments of my life . This poem ,written by me, close to my heart , blended with a little theories of my interest is I think enough to tell what do I miss the most in my life . :) ",

In a world full of hypocrites,I have people who are so bluntly honest an truly themselves around me.I have told the person I truly love that I madly in love with you without the fear of the after math.I can breath,I see and hear people are on life time oxygen ventillation-living life on machines.I have a family,who accept the good or bad side of me regardless.I have a roof over my head,I can sleep carelessly in the rain.I have friends like family,who are there for me through thick or thin.I have travelled,not just read or seen places in pictures but witnessed the beauty of mother earth.I can support someone financially,for which I will forever be grateful for because this is something very few are blessed to do at such a young age.I am not physically fit,something that can and has changed lives of many.I have the ability to make people I love feel like the king,even at the lowest of all days. All of this was not to make you feel bad about yourself or boozing about myself but only me speaking my heart out here.I am forever going to be so grateful to all that I have and all those that read this should feel the same way for all the things they can do,be grateful and thankful and let people you love know you love them because you never know when you'll lose something or someone. Lots of love, R.S ",

You start looking for yourself and try to understand what you're feeling, or thinking. Too many questions are coming to your mind about everything. Who am \u0130? What do \u0130 like? What is this feeling? Why am \u0130 not like this? Or like that? You also start to compare yourself to the others. She's blond and has pretty blue eyes. You're the exact opposite. You wear Vans. They wears Converse. They're doing make-up. You're not allowed to. Your nose is too big and you have pimples everywhere on your face. They look gorgeous. You don't. You feel lonely while looking your friends with their boyfriends, girlfriends, and the guy you like but who likes somebody else. You're not even allowed to hug a boy. Your parents and siblings are not helpful. Sometimes, you feel like they don't care about you even thought you love them and trying to get the same affection that you give them is completely unebelievable. They think that you don't need any motherly hugs or kisses beceause you're not a kid anymore. You do. Your mom never thanks you when you're helping her to clean the entire house so your unmotived and do it in a messy way. Your mother argues with you everytime because of that. \u0130t happens with your dad when he yells at your brother you love, for no reason and you protect him. You don't want him to feel what you're feeling. He'll have to deal with it too, but not now. Too early. You try to be a good big sister and exemple to your youngers siblings. But your self esteem lowers everytime you fail and get yelled on. Anxiety takes a whole new level in school because of tests. Your future is on your hands, yet you don't know what to do with it. High school is approching but before, last year of middle school. A lot of stressful exams are coming this year. And you didn't even decide what will you become. You. But not only. At the same time, you realize that the world isn't a happy and innocent place as you were thinking when you were younger. People are dying for some reason in some country. Others are suffering for some other reason. And you, the kind and empathic girl, the smiling and sweet one, is losing hope on humanity. You feel helpless. You want to help these poor kids who are getting killed in Syria. The ones dying of hunger in Africa. Women's rights are not even respected in some countries. Global warming is getting worse every day. Some people are getting asasinated because they love. You want to fight againts all of this. But no one is taking you serious beceause your age. You're a teen, remember? You talk a lot, think a lot and scream reality to the world to actually say nothing interesting. \u0130t'll pass. But you know what the worst is? You're selfish. You dramatize everything you see. You're pessimist. Like \u0130'm doing right now. ",

You speak as though you don't like yourself, however you expect your husband to like you. Others who have answered, they speak in desperation, and lack in self respect. There are door mats, and there are door knobs. Be the door knob. Have the courage to step over that threshold and Conquer what Waits Beyond. I know it's easier said than done. Been there done that. But it is a shit or get off the pot scenario. we can repeat learned behavior and wallow in self-pity because it's become a form of comfort zone or we can say what the fuck and give it a whirl. good luck to us all and repeat positivity and follow the feeling of joy.

            "answer_text": "I guess I\u2019d like to start saying I am not really a person to share my feelings. I have a dark secret about my father. The fact that he is an extreme racist, a mad sexist, manipulative, and an abusive father. Growing up I was always was intimidated by him and I still am. You know I get it. I get that he grew up in a different environment, and that he is very traditional; not to mention but also very old school. But it breaks my heart that he can\u2019t see a human being for who they are without judging them but the color of their skin and not acknowledge that at the end of the day, we are human beings. I also want to share the fact that he doesn\u2019t want to believe in interacial relationships. That he thinks it is wrong and won\u2019t allow me or my siblings to date or marry outside out race. My sister married outside our race and he refused to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. He refused to meet his parents until my sister truly begged to. But it was terrible. I saw her journey falling in love with her husband, and when my dad finally found out, everyday when she came to visit and stop by to say hello, my father instead of asking \u201chow are you?\u201d or \u201cdid you eat\u201d or anything nice to say, the first thing he would say is \u201cdid you break up with him yet?\u201d. All of my siblings grew to like my sisters husband and we didn\u2019t have an issue with him at all. He was a wonderful and kind person. My siblings and I are not like our father. But still seeing how my father can\u2019t acknowledge my sisters choice, scared me. I didn\u2019t want to date anyone. I didn\u2019t want to even date in my own race because I was so intimidated. Yet recently, I got into a relationship with a man outside my race. Mixed. And unfortunately I am hiding it from my relationship with my father. Just two days ago, I was going to work, and my dad stopped me to lecture me. He said i\u2019d better not be dating anyone outside my race or he\u2019d kick me out the house. I grew extremely afraid and upset. To the point where I became so emotionally exhausted and I feel like I lost feelings for the man I love. But I didn\u2019t. Just the other day my boyfriend told me he wanted to meet my siblings. I grew excited because I\u2019d love for him to meet my family. But I thought of my dad. I had to tell my boyfriend that my dad doesn\u2019t approve of interacial relationships, that he is racist and will refuse to understand. I know it sounds terrible for me to say that. But I am being honest. And I believe that it is right. Even my father knows he is racist and a sexist, he jokes about it with his friends and even tried to brainwash my siblings and I with his sick ways and beliefs growing up. So yeah, I told my boyfriend. He didn\u2019t seem upset and he told me he understood. But I could tell he seemed a bit upset. I told him that it had nothing to do with him and that he is perfect. But I am sad, just knowing that my father won\u2019t accept the man I love. It makes me want to cry. I love and value my family, but my happiness and my feelings matter too. And even though our relationship is still \u2018new\u2019 and though I am a young adult. I still take things seriously and I know what I want. I don\u2019t judge people first by their skin color like my father and believe who they are by stereotypes. I\u2019m gonna be honest. I am afraid what\u2019s going to happen and if my dad finds out. I am afraid of the outcome and if it is even worth it in the end. And believe me, I have chatted with my father about his beliefs, but even if you were to give him countless amounts of money, or whatever. He wouldn\u2019t believe it because of he doesn\u2019t care.

Having so many things to cheers and many things to regret.. one can't bring back the joy, the cuteness which one had in their childhood. The most precious moment of our life. Later on when we grow up, have lots of dreams. Some becomes the truth and some left like an illusion. The biggest question is that, no one is satisfied with their life? Only 1% of world's population have achieved the ultimate stratification. I too had lots of dreams. But now it became a had\u2026 i always try to get cop up with all these miseries but i am unable to do so. Every thing is not in my hand. I can keep try to achieve something but it is not sure always that I will.. ",

My dad is suffering from parkinson, I can\u2019t see it when his hands shivers. He is my inspiration to do great things in life. I was a notorious kid in my secondary school. One day I scored great checks in my exam. That day I could see them cheerful. I found the motivation behind my life. Bringing them satisfaction through remarkable achievement would turn into my definitive target. My brother is 18 years elder than me, he loves me a lot. I want to do great things, I want to become more focused in my life.  Thanks parents for giving me great values and making a good person. Thanks :) ",

They are getting weaker day by day and there is NOTHING that I can do. I hate feeling powerless, not being able to help the people I love. So I have been numb and quiet. I used to be able to fake a smile and pretend to be happy but its too hard now. But at other times when I watch or read something even slightly sad or painful, I am over come with deep emotions. I cry easily when I see other peoples pain. If someone is there I can't cry, and that hurts a lot. I feel heavy on the inside, like I can't even properly breath at times. I have no hopes or dreams anymore, I just want to be done with life without any pain and suffering- which is impossible. I hope time will heal me becuase I am getting tired. ",

And it's not like the most obvious thing, water, is affecting you... water is fine. You can float, and you can swim. But you just can't seem to breathe. It's the simplest things that you can't seem to do, like your laundry, or eating. You know how to, but you don't have the mental motivation to. Your stomach is growling, but you cannot get up from bed. You didn't shower all day, but moving your body off the bed is like moving a mountain right then. SO you just breathe, and cut yourself some slack... you're a match, a lighted match that's burning out exponentially, dying inside by the second. You cannot find your fire anymore. Where is the need anyway? Where are the 'yay's and laughs? No joy; you cannot remember tasting it. It's been a while since you last smiled and meant it.. since you were embraced and felt it... since you made your goddamn bed. Or ironed your clothes. The irony is, it all started in your head, but it's reached your thighs, as you've lost and gained weight over the past months. Just like food last week, you can't seem to hold down your interests, jumping from writing to drawing to knitting... you cannot find peace. It\u2019s 2a.m., and you were fine, but suddenly the darkness reaches out, to once again engulf you. It wants to take over, overtake your lane and shift you into mundane. You gear up, prepare now and wait, because it's reached a point where you feel to just let it, let it end you... because being alive is like you're dead anyway. I mean, at least when you go, you'll ease their burden. But.. then you remember, that funerals are expensive. So you tell yourself, 'I'll hold on, just gotta make it through one more day\u2026' \u2026which is what you've told yourself every day before. ",

And i wouldn\u2019t say that i feel like i\u2019m in the wrong body, but sometimes i feel like i\u2019m more of a girl. Like a different part of my brain lights up and i\u2019m more girly. It\u2019s hard to explain. I always remember feeling this way, since i can remember. And a lot of the things i do make sense and some of my behavior. Like its this feminine part of me manifesting itself. Normally i just date girls and i behave like your normal straight guy. But I went oversees to Australia for a semester last year for University, since i was away from home i felt more free, and this other part of me just organically came out. I just dated guys for this semester, and this other feminine part of me came out. I was more feminine in the way i dressed, acted, spoke and in what i did. I mostly just hung out with women and other gay men, its just with who i fit in better. This really helped me understand myself. And my conclusion was, that i\u2019m certainly also attracted to men, and that this wasn\u2019t just a phase. And i don\u2019t think i\u2019m transgender, i don\u2019t feel in the wrong body. I do feel like a man, but i also feel like a girl sometimes, or at least very feminine. I don\u2019t know if theirs something wrong with me, i don\u2019t think there is. I think as a species we don\u2019t understand our brains enough, but this is just how i feel. And i have always felt this way. Since i came home after that University semester in Australia, i\u2019m back to just being straight again. Ive decided that its just easier this way. ",

That doesn\u2019t mean that I have no friends. I have so many friends. Even I talked with some of them almost daily. But I can\u2019t share my secrets or non-sense talks with them. They are even good friends of mine but you know they are not that close to me. I think the reason behind not sharing my secrets with these people is my afraid of loosing them. As, till now with whomever I shared my darkest secrets of my life, they eventually left me at some point of time. Not just one or two, there were four of them. And they were really closed to me. I always fantasize about me and my best friend sitting at the edge of the beautiful landscape and discussing about our life. I always tried to stay away from these thoughts but at the end of the day it strikes. I\u2019m not writing this answer to gain your sympathies, I\u2019m just writing for my sake. As yesterday was \u201cFriendship Day\u201d and I missed them a lot. Each one of them and even everyone. By the way HAPPY FRIENDSHIP DAY.

As they are neighbors they were really friendly to me, from then I've used to go to their house now and then.One fine day I went to their house as usual. I called my friend from outside no response seen after the second call his mother came and said \"come in he's having lumch\u201d, I went and sat on the bed and she offered me some tea .I always get something to eat in their house. later I went to the kitchen to place back the glass by the time I came back but the entrance the door is closed and his mother is in the middle of removing her saree. And a lot went in my mind. while I was looking at her she undressed slowly and came near me .But by that time I got hard looking at a naked lady in real life for the first time she saw that and she grabbed my thing. I said, \"Whatever we are doing is wrong I think it is better not to do\".But she started saying that she is not satisfied from her husband. She kept on saying all the stuff just to make sure I agree. But deep in my mind, I want to play the game she said. I'm confused what should I do. Then as anyone would do I agreed. She removed her clothes except for her underwear, and she removed my clothes, we kissed. I kept my hand in her underwear did some stuff. then she removed it. She sucked me for more than 10 mins. That's the best feeling I had until then I licked her wet pussy. I ate it like hell.I started fucking her. then we tried all the positions we can. The missionary was the best. after around half an hour of sex and fun, I said to her I'm going to cum and she said, \"do it in, don't pull out. So that I can feel how does it feel like having cum inside, It has been a while\". and after sex, we slept for half an hour and I dressed up and before leaving her house she gave me 1000 rupees. And at that age 1000 is a really huge amount for me so I couldn't say no to it.After it happened I went to meet ram a week later while I met him his mom looked at me naughtily at me, I too smiled back. I went to the kitchen to get water, over there she was cutting vegetables. while I was getting water bottle she just kissed me on the cheek and held my bum and I smiled and later I left and the next time I went to their house she gave me a piece of paper written with a phone number and timing on it. Saying \"call me\", on it.I called her through a coin box and we chatted for a while. I used to go for a specific coin box far from my home daily. one day she gave me an old phone their family wasn't using and through that, we used to chat. limited messages are up to 100 those days per sim card. she used to send me the timings when their husband and son go out. I used to wait for those messages and we used to have fun and every time it's a new experience. We used to have fun at least twice in a month, I would have sex with her. And she used to pay me every time. She used to say the stories of her life. I knew it was all unethical but I can't control myself. She used to help me grooming wise she used to tell me all the tips to get girls she even helped in a couple of relations I have back then. later after around 6 months, she said about her friend and that she knew about our relationship and she is also not satisfied with her husband and she would pay me every time I went to her. I don't know what to say so asked her to arrange a meeting and then I'll decide.She arranged a meeting in the local restaurant and I liked her and it agreed to that and the cycle started at that point and it grew soo much today, I work for couple of women including Ram\u2019s mother and counting, genuinely I like being a gigolo people believe me and share their darkest secrets with me and they pay me. I've seen many weird things. and if everything happens again I would do the same things I've done.And the things I've done and nobody knows about these not even my closest friend knows.allSometimes I feel I\u2019m missing my age girls.And sometimes I feel like I don't need to be in a relationship to find the love I get love from the ladies I meet.

I had been an incredible foodie when I was youthful however not any longer as my life has voyage long from there. now in my thirties I have a great deal to stress instead of nourishment, today I have chosen to set aside my clamouring life and travel back to those occasions when I was youthful and reckless. I simply recollect in those occasions when I would leave school toward the evening to some additional classes I used to eat a baked good compose nibble loaded up with meat as a rule sheep once in a while chicken presently it's very nearly a long time since I had it. I chosen to walk the whole neighbourhood today to discover the titbit and taste it again as the shop which used to make it, is no longer at the place. It's a major test as I don't significantly recollect the name of the nibble as just the taste waits in my tongue. I have walked through around twenty shops in the territory however they all have comparative bites like a puff or a samosa which isn't close to the essence of that bite, I thought of persuading my tongue through these yet at the same time, I had a would like to locate the original snack. I halted by a shack to have some tea as I was minimal worn out as I was tasting the tea I had a little discussion with the retailer and he said that he doesn't recall the name yet he said a comparative sort of a bite is accessible in the primary market region which is around five kilometres away, he recommended to have his samosa rather its an exercise in futility making a trip up to there, however I didn't get persuaded with his recommendation. Since today is the main day I had for all that I chose to go the distance to attempt it out. I took a rickshaw for hundred bucks to achieve the principle advertise and walked three to four paths and found the shop. My eyes began dribbling after the look at the snack and I settled down on a seat before the counter. The retailer waved at me and I disclosed to him I require one of these pointing at the nibble he answered its chicken roll, I gestured alright give me one, I just got splashed in tears after I got in my grasp it looked simply like what I had a very long time back its only just wistfulness. In the wake of having the first bite every one of my sentiments just took off as it just appears to be identical and didn't have an aftertaste like yet at the same time my strong desire has been fulfilled as you can't get back all that you lost before, just memories remain.

            "answer_text": "I took my dog to the vet yesterday for a regular checkup and because she had an ear infection. She gets ear infections a lot. That\u2019s a \u201cthing\u201d with floppy-eared dogs. The only appointment they had was right after school, so my children and I had to rush home to get our dog, and rush to the vet. If you\u2019ve ever tried to rush anywhere with children right after school, you know it can be stressful. The exam went well and, after an 8-hour workday and 45 minutes in the vet\u2019s office, I was eager to get home and relax. By \u201crelax,\u201d I mean \u201cspend an hour alone, while my kids watch TV and my dog plays by herself in the backyard.\u201d There was a 10-minute delay between the end of the exam and them having the bill ready for me to pay. While I sat there, in the waiting room, with my two younger children and my dog, an elderly man came in with his German shepherd. His very old German shepherd. It was clearly in pain as it walked. Through the front window, I saw it walking slowly on the concrete sidewalk and, once it came through the door, it couldn\u2019t get much traction on the hardwood floor of the waiting room. The dog\u2019s back legs slid out from under it. It struggled to lift its back side and walk a little more, but it was yelping in pain. Finally, tearfully, the man picked it up. The dog was pretty big, and the man was pretty old, and it looked like he was struggling to carry his dog. He sat down in the first seat he could find, still holding his dog. I was tempted to offer to help or strike up a conversation with the man. There are normal things dog owners talk about when they encounter each other: what kind of dog is that, how old is it, etc\u2026 But something stopped me from talking to the man. He didn\u2019t have to sit there long. The vet came out immediately (usually they don\u2019t come out at all\u2026 a tech calls you back to the exam room), said something quietly to the man, and then led the man and his dog, still cradled in his arms, back to the very same exam room where my dog had been just minutes before. Along the way, both receptionists told the man that they were sorry. That\u2019s when my suspicions were confirmed. This elderly man was bringing in his elderly dog to be euthanized. There I was, with my overly-energetic two-year-old dog, my equally-energetic young children, full of stress and eager to get home, where my dog and children would leave me alone while I relaxed for a while. As I watched this man carry his friend for the last time, I thought to myself: \u201cOne day, I\u2019m going to miss all of this\u2026 the young, energetic dog, the school-aged kids who never seem to stop talking, the running errands after a hard day at work\u2026 all of it. Perhaps I should stop stressing over it, and instead enjoy it while it lasts. I was also glad I did not talk to the guy. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t interrupt his last moments with his friend. When I finally got home yesterday, instead of parking my kids in front of the TV and letting my dog out in the yard, I asked my kids if they\u2019d like to play with our dog with me in the yard. They did, and we had a lot of fun. ",

            "answer_text": "I am 19 year old girl , persuing chartered accountancy course.. I used to be a happy and cheerful person irrespective of how my life is,but last year was challenging, depressing, life changing in short worst year of my life. I lost my father, almost 3 months ago, after a week from my birthday. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was struggling between the life and death for almost 9 months. During 9 months, his health had become worse and took a setback. Before that happens, he was in a good physical and mental condition. But during that time, there was a drastic change in his health.He had coughs with blood, weight loss(almost 25 kgs),loss of appetite, high fever(everyday, during 9 months), tumors developed inside brain and chest and memory loss. He had been admitted in ICU for 3 times. It's very painful and heartbreaking for all of us to see a healthy man in such a horrifying condition. We all tried our level best, to save him. My mother and chacha took him to many hospitals for the treatment, but unfortunately there is no improvement in his health. Before 2 months before his death, his treatment was started in one of the best hospitals of Ahemdabad. In initial days of treatment, there was a improvement in his health within a week and so,our hope had restored that may be he would be well again. After seeing his improvement, doctor discharged him. For a month, everything was ok, but before 10 days before his death,again his health had taken a setback. So immediately, we took him to Ahemdabad and he was admitted in ICU. I wanted to go to Ahemdabad, but unfortunately I had exams. I don't want to gave my examination and wanted to be with my father,but everyone insisted me to focus on exams. Honestly speaking, I was not ready to gave exams and as a result I was not able to focus on my studies. And I had a worst examination in my life. So, after my exams get over, there was again a improvement in his health. Four days after my examination there was my birthday. Every year, I eagerly used to wait for my birthday, but this time I was not excited for a bit. Then, my birthday came,but I don't want to celebrate it. I was missing him very badly. Somehow, my other family members and friends make my birthday a special one(a big thank you! to them). On that day, I make a video call to my mum and papa. Surprisingly, he remembered my birthday and wished me. Then after 3 days from my birthday, his health had improved, and doctor even told my mum that if next day, he was ok, then he could be discharged. But, next day he did not woke up. My mom, chacha doctors and nurses everyone tried, but he was not responding. Although, he was breathing, but his heartbeat had become rapid and bp was extremely low. Doctors told to my mum and chacha that next few hours would be very critical for him. My mom panicked and started crying. But we all, don't want to give up. We all were ready to fight with God for his health. We all prayed for him. But, before a day before his death, his condition was unbearable for him, he was shifted from ICU to ventilator. But alas, next day during 11:30 p.m he couldn't fight anymore. He left\u2026\u2026\u2026. And I get to know about my father demise after 12 hours. I had gone for some work that day till 12 p.m. But as soon as I reached home, my Chachi immediately took me inside to my room and told \u201c your father is no more.\u201d As the moment I heard it, I started crying badly. I was feeling shocked, devastated and could'nt believe that he wasn't there anymore. He became a mere memory. Somehow, I stopped crying for my Mother and waiting for her to come. I was worried about my Mother. After 6\u20137 hours, she came with my father's dead body. I was not able to see my Mother's condition. As soon as she came, she was looking very tired, her eyes were swollen because of tears. Me and my brother hug her hard, she started sobbing badly, and told us \u201cbeta! wo ab Kabhi vapis nahi aaenge\u201d. Somehow I control my tears in front of my mother. But after 1\u20132 hours when his body was going for cremation, and when I saw him for the last time, I was not able to control my sobbing. I sob very badly and thought \u201cnow! I will never be able to meet or see him\u201d. After his body had gone for cremation, somehow, I gather the courage and gone to see my mother in her room. I sat near her and consoled her. She was crying alot. Bunch of relatives, present in the room were taking care of her. Then, we gave her some food and some sleeping pills, so she could get some sleep. So, next few days were the most difficult days of my life. Some days I was not able to sleep, sometimes I sleep but, woke up at odd hours.Gulping down food had become a difficult task for me. Sometimes I cried for him(even now also)badly, and thinking, \u201cWhy God, why? Why he died? Please I want him back?\u201d So presently (it's 3 months after his death) somehow we all are moved on, but still we are shocked ,sad and somehow struggling to live without him. As we all know how daughter's are an apple of an eye of their father. Such bond is very unique and special. Same thing is in my case, I love my father alot. He was not only my father but my king, hero, supporter and a teacher. He unconditionally loved me. He used to care and pampers me alot. He was not only a great father, but a great human being also. I don't know how I will live without him. My life will always be incomplete without him. P.s:- thanks for having patience and for reading such a long story. Kindly, ignore my grammatical mistakes!!

I didn\u2019t find one thus far but this question can be answered the way l like and express the way I am fond of. Please forgive me if I use too many \u2018I\u2019s without which the narration may get bored. I am a middle aged male got married blessed with supporting wife and an offspring who is into teens. I am born to my parents but brought up by my grandmother who was into teaching. She had 6 young daughters when she lost her husband at the age of 28. She was forced to pursue her education and with the help of relatives and her determination, completed her teacher\u2019s training post the death of her husband and got a teacher job. Thus with sheer hard work coupled with obedience of daughters managed things wonderfully well. Not only her daughters but the grandchildren and so on settled very well into their respective lives by way of studies, jobs, wealth and what not. She is no more now. All our families owe everything to her and we just remind her whenever we are into some kind of trouble. She has been the role model for us even bigger than Mother Teresa or an Anne Besant. My mother who was terrific at studies was compelled to discontinue them as she got married very early. Once a jamindar\u2019s family her in-laws went land less soon due to drought and lack of irrigation facilities and were forced to move out of their village and reached the town in search of some employment. My father could not bow down to bosses as he was always in jamindar mode and gone back to the village and was doing small time works for himself. Hence, she started pursuing her education again and completed her Hindi pundit training to get some job. At the same time she used to sell milk in the morning for 2 hours 5 to 7 AM. I used to co-operate her occasionally in this job. Respects to above two women of my life who with their sweat, determination, guts and hard work, laid the foundation for several generations; more than a dozen to be precise. Well I am not describing the achievements of my family members but the stories of all those women who stand up in times of crisis when their male counterparts gave up easily. I have not yet poured my heart out. It is just an attempt! Salutes\u2026 ",

In that answer a mother was describing how her son was living miserably in India because of his job, where he was having a bad work-life balance. Now, her son is well settled in AUSTRALIA and living a happier life. That madam was having issues with college students, with education system of India, with juniors working in her son's office, with government and with many more things. => I would like to share my views with everybody who feel India is a shit country, which has tons of problems and USA/UK/AUS is the dream place to settle down. => I believe, The expectation that lady shared about how India should have to be in terms of education, work-culture, lifestyle, this and that, Those are the responsibilities of people like her son, You and I. Its our responsibility to make all those things possible here in india. => People like that lady, are complaining a lot and sharing it with everybody on social media, that India is not a good country. India has this issue. India needs improvement in that area. USA is better at this and UK is way ahead than us at that. My question is, What contribution we as Indians are making to make this country a better place? Because, To make those countries better than us, I feel someone from those lands must had made some efforts too. => People like that lady\u2019s son are getting nourished from this country, and than abandoning it with lots of complaints, Settling down in other countries and than bragging about how frustrated they were in India, and now how much their life has improved after going abroad. => Its like praising your wife for her beauty, and disliking your own mother because she is not good looking anymore, mother who has lost her charm and beauty, because she gave BIRTH to you and cared for you for years. => Its like, In morning You are selling tobacco, and than at evening the same You, is showing pity towards cancer patients. Dont be such hypocrites. => Its not the Prime Minister of India or a political party\u2019s job to make 125 crore lives better OR change something in every corner of this country. Its well educated and enthusiastic youngsters\u2019 and their well-formed minds, that's what this country needs. Either stop complaining, or start contributing. Crying does not help, trying does. ",

            "answer_text": "I read this question everyday but never had enough strength to write my heart out. I am the eldest one among my siblings. I had to act like \u2018elder sister\u2019 from when i was 2 years old. I had to hold myself back and let my siblings have what they want. I started my school from Prep Class which is actually KG2 or nursery 2 in most countries. I used to get 1pkr daily for personal use. It was quite a big amount at that time for 3 years old kid. At home time, on my way home i used to buy helium balloon for my siblings from that pocket money. From the age of 3 years i started living for others. When i grew up, i was shy, modest, cute and a nice girl. I was bullied at my school. A boy of 10th grade at that time used to eat my lunch and he scared me to death that if i tell my parents he'll hit me. I told my parents about it just 3 years ago. All my life i kept my problems away from my family because i love them and i don't wanna see them worried. So i trusted my friends with my problems. Made new friends. I got close to them. All of my best friends at different stages of life were really best. But the friendship never lasted for life. My parents have suffered alot and still they are suffering alot in order to give us higher education. My heart is crying writing it. Maybe I'm not good at writing every little detail. I didn't became a doctor. Instead I did ny Bachelors in IT. My sister is doing well but i don't see chances of her becoming doctor either. She is striving hard. My brothers just do not bother taking our parent\u2019s struggles seriously. They do care but they don't study as much as they should. My parents are getting older and weaker and the hope is the only thing we are sticking to. I make extra time, extra effort to help my siblings with studies because i can't i just can't see my parents in pain. I just don't want to see my siblings suffering. I am worried about my parents. If i had to change one thing in this world, just one thing. I would make education free for everyone for ever. Education must be free, it must not cost so that a family can live together, so that they can live happily, so that everybody can have equal chances of becoming something. ",

Holi, the festival of colors, the festival where people spread happiness and joys in other person's life but I so badly want the calendar to skip this day. I have a million memories of my mother attached to this festival. On this festival, we used to witness a different side of my mother, the mischievous side, the side that was not visible on normal days. She used to be more excited than us, more crazier than us on this day. Our shopping used to start a day before, as she used to say, \"holi mai karna hi kya hota hai?\" I remember her oiling my hair a night before. I remember making \u2018gujjiaas\u2019 with her and how she used to make my favorite dishes. Making \u2018Chole Bhature\u2019 used to be like a ritual on this day. I remember her calling everyone to our house on this festival, and the moment they used to come, she used to stuff their mouth with sweets and Gujjiaas. I remember her pranks, she used to mix surf-excel in the water and then used to ask us to fill balloons with them. She never missed her targets when it came to hitting my cousins with balloons. She used to become a kid again. I loved that kid in her. I miss that kid. I miss this festival. This day used to bring a hell lot of happiness in our lives and now this same day brings a hell lot of pain in our lives. I don\u2019t celebrate this festival now. My heartaches remembering this day. I crave for Gujjiaas and chole bhature, made by her on this day. I crave for her touch.  Holi is not same without her. Life is not same without her.  Happy Holi Maa! Love!-Unnati ",

            "answer_text": "It started in Nov 2015. After roaming together he proposed me for marriage and I accepted. He is from Rajasthan and I from UP. Intially everything was going good. I was knowing about his past also that he had almost 5 relationship in which he told that he was clear from the starting that the have no future. We were in the same office. We are in Bangalore. After 4 months or something he started taking me for granted. He never cared about me. I use to spend my whole salary on him. But i never realized it at that time. Thengot a job offer in another city and he had to go. Before that I saw in his mail that he gets a mail from a girl and when I asked him he told that it's his cousin. I believed it because surname was same. When he loved to different city I use to go there every alternate weekend. Things were going smooth when one day again I saw the mail from that girl sent to him on his bday. It was a romantic mail. I had a huge fight with him. I asked him then he told me that she is a family friend and she likes me but I don't like her. So I asked him to tell her that u have a gf for which he denied and excused like she LL tell this at his home. After some days things became normal. In the meanwhile he told me that he spoke to his mom about us and she denied. Then suddenly his sister came to stay with him for some course. So he use to travel to Bangalore to meet me. But always use to give preference to his friends and always use to treat me like his atm only. Then he switched back to Bangalore. After coming to Bangalore he gave me a reason that his sister's engagement broken because of which his mom had a stroke and now doctor has asked not to give any tension to her and now he can't talk with his mom( which I doubt). And he blocked me every where. I cried like hell. Then after 2 months again he came back saying he is unable to focus on anything. We started talking again but he told me that he cannot marry me. Then again he blocked me. This happened like 2 times. Then I blocked him every where. Now again he contacted me saying that he is getting married and he is not happy with this marriage. He is doing it for the sake of his mom. He has no feeling for that girl and he wants me at least as his friend as he cant live without me. But this time also he took me for granted. Bdw she is the same girl we had a fight over. ",

            "answer_text": "Dil ka haal Behaal by a science student.  Disclaimer:\u2014 Through this answer of mine i had tried to explain the depressed phase an individual undergoes by using some terms from Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Hope you all would enjoy reading. \u2026. Sometime it feels like i am the chapter - special theory of relativity of HCV and my own thoughts and past memories are behaving like rheumatoid arthritis (autoimmune disorder). Life is now getting a bit tangled like d sign conventions of Thermo-D in Physics and Chem. The new bad incidents of my life had superimposed so perfectly on the previous sufferings of mine that it had lead to the constructive interference. I tried to radiate those -ve thoughts through these social media platforms but it seems that i am residing in an isolated system. I had tried my level best to reach the gold foil (be +ve) in the Rutherford's exp (social media handles) but it seems like the Lead plates aren't working efficiently to eliminate the alpha rays (-vities). Life is never constant u know why because the equation of s wrt t isn't restricted to square of t. But it's alright acc isn't d limit who knows one day we will get to reach the pop... I tried to explain my situation to some people, but because i am not present in the K-shell i was ignored and instead of an adrenaline rush i recieved an anaphylactic shock each time. And that's the reason diapause has now become necessary as i need to connect the cell in a reverse manner to get it recharged.  Lastly i would end it by saying\u2026. Emojis doesn't define the true face of anyone. Just like the ketone whom everyone thinks can't be oxidised, undergoes oxidation when it comes to Popaff's rule. I tried to become a nucleus from free nucleons but lost all my Binding Energy. . . Note:\u2014 This is just a writing of mine, it isn't related to me, so chill\u2026\ud83e\udd1f\ud83d\ude0a. Sometimes we go in search of solitude but end up being lonely and depressed. Depression is a disease it needs to be cared and treated. Thank you. Div_Ana. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been crying for almost 20 minutes over a plastic ruby I got from the dollar store. The ruby isn\u2019t even broken\u2014 It just fell off. Let me explain. Last Halloween, I wore a dress for my costume. It was a beautiful, short purple dress with a little plastic ruby on the front that my friend and I made from scratch. That was my first time publicly presenting myself as a woman, ever. I went to college in that dress. I felt comfortable in that dress. After Halloween, it went into storage. I only recently dug it back out, and decided it could use a wash. I put it in the laundry for my dad to clean (and before people go calling me lazy\u2026 I do chores around the house, plenty. Laundry is just not one of them). 20 minutes ago, I went into the laundry room and saw the little plastic ruby sitting on top of the dryer, and my heart sank. I knew the stitching must have come undone somehow. I opened up the dryer and sure enough, my dress was in there. It\u2019s clean now, and mostly in good shape\u2026 but a lot of the stitching needs to be redone, including the little ruby. It\u2019s not unfixable, or even difficult to fix\u2026 but seeing that dress, the one I have so much sentimental attachment to, \u201cbroken\u201d\u2026 it hurt. And so, I\u2019m crying over a stupid plastic gem. ",

It\u2019s not necessary you have to speak up with people, you can share a status or post a blog about how you actually feel. It helps. or else you can maintain a diary to write your heart out. When you speak up, there is always a fear who hold onto your back from sharing your thoughts. But the thing is, you still can share your thoughts hiding your identity or by using a second language or being a third person in your writing. ",

Though some of you are understand about it but still there are some people who always gives this look as if he committed a sin . For those people who gives this look understand one thing my brother that he is not normal like us he is different from us and he is not a devil / monster / alien .

I had hidden my birthday notification from fb as well as snapchat. With no expectation from anyone I slept at my regular time and got no 12AM call(its an over rated stuff). With a peaceful mind I went to Gurdwara at dawn. Came back and got blessings from my parents. Had my breakfast and sat for studies. I had saved few money for my birthday treat. I took my parents to Pirates of Grill and had a gala time there. We ended our stuff by 4PM and yet I was to be wished by my friends which I didn't expected . At the last hour of the day I'm writing this answer with no wishes from the dead flowers whom I was watering. To be very honest I'm very happy. Many quorans here write about spending time with family. Today I saw that well. Friends are nothing just random people with a few similar choices of yours. There's no one over your family. Love them, spend time with them and thank the almighty for having them to your life. As a guy who turned 20 today I got to learn a big lesson to remember for my life. Caring or spending time on your self isn't being selfish. Cheers!!:) ",

I wasted half of my day thinking about how life has changed me and how it will change me in the days to come. I am already worried about my life which is yet to be lived and then I see my Amma. She is 52 with a lot going on inside her head. Yet, she is managing it all so well. I wonder how! Women are so mutli-talented and independent by nature. They are sensitive, yet strong. Some women ,on the contrary , prove to be wrong but I would say the circumstances have made them so. Nowadays women are equally good to men in whatever field it be. The work timings and salary is the same. But is this giving men and women a license to be whatever and however they want to be? We live in a decaying age. There is no mutual respect for each other. When we look at our parents we see a lot of understanding and love which binds them together. There is respect, love, sacrifice, and a lot more which keeps them going. Being a law student, I am more exposed to the real world starting from the very basic unit such as a family. I was at the office with my Advocate when there came a client, a man and a woman in their 30s. She started talking about her issues and so did he and they wanted a divorce on mutual consent. They had a 7 year old child out of their wedlock. The reasons for their want of divorce were baseless. All they lacked in their relationship was understanding. Understanding about each other's work, understanding about each other's value of time and their not-ready-to-sacrifice attitude. Both of them are working in a Multi National Company(MNC) and are earning more than enough for their living and they are not ready to sacrifice their happiness out of the money they make. And soon after they left I asked the Advocate about it, and he said \" This is just one case and nowadays its quite common\". He showed me rack of case files on mutual consent of which most could be sorted if they are ready to calm down and settle their egos. Sadly, none of the them care an inch about what their child would be going through. The mental agony of losing a father or a mother, their care, their affection, their pampering. What would life be like to him/her as he/she grows up? What is happening to society? What is happening to women who should be down-to-earth, patient and responsible and men who are supposed to be the care taker of a family ? Young generation is becoming a scapegoat for others. I don't hope for the best but if we all know for a fact that a good family life can be the best achievement one can ever make, maybe it can definitely bring a positive change. ",

Lockdown: The End of the Pandemic or The End Respected Sir, First, I would like to appreciate the dynamic and never-ending efforts that are being made by your government during this unforeseen pandemic. Your vigilant and corrective actions on time saved the lives of many. I wish my father could have been one of them too. I am Vaishnavi Shringi, a B.Tech final year student from VNIT Nagpur, Maharashtra. My mother Mrs.Seema Sharma is a government servant at Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, Rajasthan. My father Late Sh. Chetan Shringi was an executive engineer at CSCTPPS, Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd., Chhabra, Rajasthan. I have a younger sister studying in class 10. We were a happy family of four before an extremely heart-wrenching incident struck us. My father was fulfilling his emergency services at CSCTPPS, Chhabra when he experienced severe pain in the chest and the forearm,succumbing to which he went back to his room(7.04.2020). Later in the evening, he visited the nearby dispensary that is a part of the plant premises. The doctor assumed it to be a mere case of gastritis/acidity and did not diagnose thoroughly. My father took the medication as prescribed by him but couldn't experience any relief. He was experiencing excessive pain in the chest and was unable to eat or drink anything. He was continuously vomiting and was unable to even walk for his dinner or lunch at the hostel. Owing to this kind of condition, his colleagues could not wait anymore and went to the Chief Engineer to ask for permission to refer him to Kota where he might get appropriate treatment which was absent in their plant premises. The Chief Engineer very conveniently used lockdown as an excuse and totally ignored the seriousness of the situation. My father had given 28 years of dedicated service to this organisation and this is what he earns in return? But the struggle doesn't end here sir. My father visited the dispensary doctor again, emphasizing his diabetes and BP issues and also urged him to refer him to Kota to get treated. But the doctor denied his request repeatedly. Even the Chief Engineer started suggesting to get some injections and also opt for saline treatment which was totally unwarranted. Finally, when my father started experiencing shortness of breath, his colleagues went to the Chief Engineer to pressurize him to not overlook the situation and send him back home. But the inhumanity didn't end here sir. The permission was approved at 8:30pm in the night and my father was sent alone with a compounder to Kota in an ambulance with no emergency equipment. We felt that the situation might improve finally, but the lockdown had a lot more to show us.(11.04.2020) I still remember clearly; it was 12:40 in the middle of the night, my mother and I reached Kota Heart Hospital to get my father treated by the safest hands of the highly qualified doctors there. But what I saw was my father, whom I have never seen sitting on a chair even after a heavy day at work, sitting in the wheelchair. His expression was similar to that of a warrior, one who had fought the war with all his might but now stands hopeless and frail. The guards at the hospital denied his admission inside the hospital for even an ECG. Sitting in that wheelchair my father still did not lose heart and asked the guards to show at least some humanity at this hour of emergency and let him in. But the guard refused and made us wait till 1:30 am outside the hospital, with my dad in the wheelchair right in the middle of the road. After our family doctor requested one of his colleagues personally, my father was taken in for an ECG after which he was diagnosed to have suffered a heart attack 2-3 days before. He was immediately admitted to the ICU ward and various tests were done by the staff. The so-called Corona Warriors did not show up, Sir, and the excuse they used is that they were in quarantine. How convenient, right? The next morning (12.04.2020)my mother and I reached the hospital for the follow-ups. We were told to arrange one unit of blood to compensate for the low haemoglobin. To do so, we went to the nearest blood bank where we waited for two hours for the blood bank staff to prepare the sample. The staff was called in one-by-one to prepare the sample as they were on leave, which led to the delay. Owing to the lockdown and insufficient staff, even after 12-14 hours of admission, we failed to get the reports that were urgently required to decide the next phase of treatment for my father No specialist doctors were available in the hospital. We were literally begging and approaching many doctors personally to attend to my father. After many requests, a kidney specialist showed up, who, after seeing the late submitted reports, was in a fix regarding how to proceed. It was a highly critical situation and within seconds my father's blood pressure started dropping. The situation was critical and the attendant present there told us to insert a balloon in his heart. He was not a specialist but he was the only help we had at that moment. Even then, the blood pressure did not shoot up. He followed with a pacemaker insertion as well, but it was already too late by then. Our heart attack warrior, my dear father, after fighting with extreme pain and discomfort for 4-5 days, left us, Sir. We want to know; did he add to your Corona count, Sir? Did he at least make it till there? Or did his demise go unnoticed? He was not a Corona patient, Sir, and still, we lost him. With medical staff staying absent despite being able to help out, Are we really killing the Pandemic? Or is it's repercussions killing us? I do not write this letter to ask for any compensation or receive applause for my late father's strength and will power, Sir. I write to ask you a simple question... What was our mistake? Our non-Covid patients need care and treatment. Are we letting them down? There are many patients in the need of regular dialysis, emergency and life-saving surgeries, cancer treatments, heart and lung ailments requiring constant follow-ups. Somewhere in the chaos, we seem to have overlooked these patients. These patients will add to our non-Covid mortality. Patients are dying of non-coronavirus related ailments because of delay in treatment, owing to the lockdown. India's health infrastructure is overburdened and overwhelmed thanks to the pandemic of Coronavirus. However, we must not forget that there are patients getting ill because of other diseases and suffering various ailments. Hence, the government must ensure that there are sufficient doctors to treat other cases too and non-Covid-19 patients aren't ignored. This is not only case, Over the last 3\u20134 weeks, I have heard several instances of patients and relatives seeking medical attention very late for even emergencies. Since all the clinics and many smaller hospitals are closed. A high number of patients with cardiac, neuro, stroke, gastro, diabetic and orthopedic emergencies presenting late with all complications leading to delayed intervention and recovery. The current times will teach us a lot. However, we need to learn fast from our mistakes, and also from others' mistakes so that we don\u2019t repeat them. I'll pray this should not repeat what happened with Vaishnavi's father. This is systems failure which needs to be heard.  She tweeted the same with proper hastags, tagged authorities. Please take a moment and retweet so that this issue get noticed. [1] Vaishnavi Shringi Twitter I hope justice is served. Footnotes[1] Twitter",

            "answer_text": "Well, I've been in quora for a long time but never been active much because of my studies and other reasons. Today i am going to share something about my life which changed me and my life both significantly. I've always been a shy kind of guy and kind of silent but smiling always. Like most of the others i didn't habe a pleasant school life. I got bullied and yeah for like 11 years it continued somewhat. Physical abuse is something i could stand for but about verbal use(well yeah i used to be a shy guy and never got much words on my tongue when i was angry). So you guys can somewhat imgine how my school life changed me more of an introvert person. After 12th i got into a college in my hometown. This was a life turning point and stage for me. Oh yeah i forgot to mention i used to be chubby so before getting into college i determined myself in getting fitter. The result was unbelievable. After some months the once introvert guy became extrovert and got a bit popular among boys and girl both(not for bad reasons XP) because of my plain and simple attitude ad friendly and helping nature. I got into 2 relationships also (not from college- one i got from facebook other was in real life). But unfortunately both of those relationships didn't stand for long. From one i got betrayed and for other one well i will admit my mistake. Because of some reasons which was nothing actually (but that time i got scared of them specifically studies). Our relationship got devastated that way and till this day i accept that my suffering is the result of that sin of mine. Long story isn't it! Well the main part is coming!! In the years 2017 i met a girl online again. We both were friendw at first but got closer day by day. After some months i proposed her and after sometime she accepted it too. Well everything was fine at first. At least from my side i was very happy and was being aware of the fact if she is happy with me. But after some months i got to know she is getting depressed day by day and changing. She started shouting at me sometimes even cussing me and saying cursing stuffs. I accepted all of them i was so much desperate to show her that i love her. I was ready to do anything for her. But then got to know that she was first in relationship and she got annoyed because of my caring attitude and talking in a sweet way. That's the reason she started changing herself in an opposite person than me. Slowly she stopped talking to me. I tried everything from my side to make her talk to me. Nothing worked actually. XD, she was the reason for whom once i wrote so many songs, sang them on guitar and drew her pic and gifted her. But yeah, she never valued nothing of mine. Not me not my words. Well what i treasured once turned into one of my nightmares. One year passed by still this way but things were getting worse. She almost stopped talking to me. Meanwhile she never stoppee being friends with others or spending time with them but when i used to ask her how she was or what she eas doing. Always the answer would come in such a manner that i would get almost depressed that may be i had asked something dreadful. She used to blackmail me about breaking up with me XD. Well she used to do that also. Like, one night she said she was breaking up with me and after one day she would return. Hmm, well one thing i would say she never betrayed me nor her love for me was a lie. Later after our final break up in October 2018 i got to know that she never knew how to be in a relationship and because of other friends leaving her or sometimes because if her parents she used to misbehave with me all time. Well i was a guy full with smile and happiness who craved some love got just hatred, betrayal, curses what not. Well yeah last year i became so much depressed that i became suicidal and umm i attempted too. Anyways now i am somehow living my life. Trying to order everything i can do. From other's perspectives it may seem nothing when for me it was more than a nightmare. I couldn't write many things properly and i have lost my own self through that period. Now i am trying to regain it but i need help still but yeah i am afraid to trust again. Thanks for reading this. ",

But of course, that\u2019s not the hard part. I\u2019m always angry, and I always keep it hidden. My anger always feels like another person. In the time it takes to snap my fingers, he can appear and run riot. And the funny part? More and more often I want to cut him loose. I want to let him out. Let him destroy everything he sees, break every bone of every person he can, smash everything in site. I want to let him destroy everything. Why? Because maybe, just maybe, if I let him out, he\u2019ll stay away for once. But instead I feel like a caged animal.  In the end though, I guess my big thing, after all the hate and anger I always feel, I feel nothing but regret and sorrow. I lost 15 relatives in the last ten years. Every single one, all I wish for is more time. More time to rejoice with them, to celebrate with them, to learn from them. I know I will see them again on the other side, but I also don\u2019t want to face that day. I truly am terrified of that day. I am scared to move forward, and im being forced to. I don\u2019t want to advance forward, and I need to. Every time I see my friends talking with their extended family, I get irritated, because there is not much that I wouldn\u2019t give to be able to do that again. Damn do I ever miss my grandparents. My home away from home. I miss that old piano. I miss the old paintings on the walls. I miss playing cards with them. Heck, I even miss my grand parents cooking, even if it usually was either burnt or hardly cooked. I miss it all so damn much. Sorry, had to take a moment there. To anyone reading this, all I can say is thank you for this. I know I likely won\u2019t be able to respond to any kind words, but right now, i\u2019m just glad to be heard. ",

I am recently married and found out that my husband is having an affair. To be more accurate, continuing an 8 year affair he had been having with his married co-worker. I found out about the relationship initially via his instant messages before we got married. Whenever I would come in a room, he would scramble to close windows on the computer. I suspected he was cheating but i didn\u2019t have any evidence to prove it. So last month, i Remotely activated the automatic call recording i got from the PI on his phone and here i am, all my doubt were confirmed. I decided not to ask him as I followed the instructions of the PI. I took his phone and scan his whatapp QR code and i deactivated the notification so he won\u2019t know. So with this, i was able to veiw all his chat directly from my phone. I confronted him about the message because they were very sexually explicit; things he didn\u2019t even express to me. He indicated to me that it was \u201cfantasy\u201d and said it was in-appropriate conversations and it would not happen again. He then got on me about the whole trust and snooping issue but the thing is, when I asked him straight out if something was going on with this girl, he lied and told me nothing and that he wasn\u2019t even attracted to this girl, and then I spied and found out otherwise. Well a few months later we get married and my now husband got transferred to another cit for work few weeks after the marriage. The first week he was gone I was getting phone calls every night, e-mails etc. The second week, I couldn\u2019t get in touch with him at all as well as his family members. Guess what, I am pregnant. And he still doesn\u2019t know yet. Should I tell him? Or what to see how this unfolds. When he came home I asked him what happened with just the basic check in to let me know you were ok? I can understand if you were busy working but that is basic common courtesy. He gave me some excuse that I didn\u2019t understand how stressful it was and he was busy. Then I happened to ask if his co-worker was down there, and he didn\u2019t answer the question and became real evasive. Then about a day or two later, he accidentally let it slip that she was there and then he saw the expression on my face and tried to turn it around on me saying the reason he didn\u2019t tell me she was there was because he didn\u2019t want to get interrogated and that I was insecure. So a few days after that, I got his IM hacked again by this PI and sure enough there were conversations in there about her coming down the second week and them sleeping together on a few nights. So my suspicion was confirmed. There was also another conversation about her coaching him on how to be comfortable with continuing the affair and deceiving me and about how they were having sex at the office late at night when others went home. Now as silly as this may seem, I still love this man and would like to work this out but I don\u2019t think this would/could ever happen because first he won\u2019t admit to the affair. He won\u2019t admit to the affair because he wants to continue it. Secondly, I can\u2019t trust him and he can\u2019t trust me which is sad because his mistrust of me was me just confirming what I suspected. He doesn\u2019t know that I have the chat conversations about his business trip and him carrying on at the office. My mistrust of him is obvious. Now granted we have only been married for 5 months! If we make 1 year it will be amazing. I found out about the relationship initially via his instant messages before we got married. Whenever I would come in a room, he would scramble to close windows on the computer. So last month, i Remotely activated the automatic call recording i got from the PI on his phone and here i am, all my doubt were confirmed.

I shrugged - is it meaning that I have yet another failure coming my way? I have my first vacation in two years planned in the next 2 weeks. I feel fine. But am I fine? Is the ticking time bomb in my head going off? I have a scheduled EEG on Thursday and yet I have all kudos at work. My life is a mixture of odds. I am attending therapy, I am somewhat healthy and I want to push but I don\u2019t know when I look in the mirror if being dizzy after 3 hours is just me or if it is just a mirage of the fact I have spent most of the last year in and out of hospitals. I haven\u2019t been to the ER in 6 months. I haven\u2019t had to have a packed bag ready to head to the U of MN. I haven\u2019t seen the current new PYG-1 residents working for my neurosurgeon and I don\u2019t want to. Yet I have lost track of time. But despite all of that, I walk, I read. I push. Because I want to be fit. I am done living my life according to brain surgery. If I need another brain surgery, I will watch and wait. But I am done waiting for it to come to me. I am going to start living for the moment. For this moment. Instead of staring in the mirror, unsure of underneath all that skin, my hazel eyes, and my brown hair, my brain is going awry. Maybe right now, right this moment, a protein is clogging its way and my brain is trying to tell me. Maybe my cat being more snuggly lately is trying to heal me because she knows something is wrong. Or maybe she is just being a cat. Maybe it is just confirmation bias. So I grab my backpack, I head to work and I live. Because I don\u2019t know. I record and my body is a scientific experiment but I choose to stop being afraid. Hydrocephalus no longer has a claim on me, I have a claim on it. I am coming for you. ",

Negative thoughts crossing your mind and suddenly you feel like the loneliest person on the planet. You are screaming for help you but no one is there for you. No one is there to understand what you are hiding from the world deep inside. All you see is darkness around and the slightest inkling of hope has vanished. But, Was it used to be like that? Was your world always flinching? You used to notice small things, the warmth of sunlight on your face as you woke up , the birds creeping ,the world engaged in its usual cycle. to a bright flare which forces you to shut the blinds and isolate yourself from the world. You used to be a jubilant folk who wanted to ride the crest of a wave but your fervent zest has faded away. Depression is like that! Like drowning in a quicksand. Like facing against a tsunami. Like walking with a pile of rocks on your back on a hasty pathway. But you have to pretend like everything is okay.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes i do. I've got myself into a long distance relationship. We've known each other for 10 years prior to that until finally when we decided to take it to the next level. We were in love with each other, we were happy. Then few months later he said to me that he'll not be very attentive the next month and i should bare with him and wait for him. He worked for a startup company, and there was an important event which requires a lot of hard work. I was ok with it and i said i will wait. First couple of days were fine, i missed him so much and we barely talked to each other. Then a week later a lot of chaos happened in my life. I quit my both jobs, i was between the jobs for 3 weeks after that. I was devastated, when i reached out to him he wouldn't reply on time, or would reply hours later with just one syllable word. Or would dash off quick replies. I didn't like it. I wanted to share lots of things, consult with him but he wasn't available. Then after some times i just got used to not telling him whatever had happened even if he asked because i knew he is not really listening. All he had in mind was the event. We have become even more distant, barely talked and i felt i was better before getting into a relationship with him. I didn't have expectations, i wouldn't be disappointed by mistakes he made. So i decided i don't want that kind of relationship. So one fine day i told him that i no more want to do this, we were better as friends. He tried so hard to make me change my mind but i was adamant. Fast forward few days, after i asked him if he'd accept me again as a friend or should i leave him alone, ( deep inside i was giving us a second chance by starting over frim scratch, so we can do things differently) but he was so hesitant by his response and i felt it. He agreed but he wasn't really convinced. I knew he wanted either as a girlfriend or nothing. At the end we had a very ugly and messy breakup. He was so aggressive and rude in the way he spoke to me. I have no idea how to deal with this. ",

Actually it all started because my college messed up everything, I got 2 backlogs in my 3rd semester (in labs) due to attendance shortage after that I registered for them in my 7th semester. Results came after the results of 8th semester were announced. And this time my college messed up my results, I got backlogs in my internal papers which were previously cleared in the 3rd semester and no one in the college is helping me. I just completed my engineering but because of that I might have to give an extra semester. Everything in engineering feels like I was in amnesia can't code, can't do anything. Recently I enrolled myself in an online course from coding ninja but I can't follow up with course, I just can't, whenever I try to do it my throat dries up, eyes become kinda blurry, I literally start hallucinating stuffs that I possibly can't, hearts starts beating really fast. Can't talk to people, I start sweating when they ask career retailer questions. Can't sleep at night properly. I feel like their is a big ahh heavy stuff on my chest, feel very inconvenient took me like 1\u20132 hours to get rid of it. I really need help, can't take this anymore. I need someone to guide\u2026. I don't know man I just can't take it anymore. Please help. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! Hi I am a 20 yo living in Sydney Australia with my parents and two sisters. I struggle with everyday life. I left school when I was 15 then completed grade 10 at Tafe. I worked until I was 17 and was sexually assaulted at work when I was 16. I have tried to complete a business diploma for about 3 years. I haven\u2019t been able to, due to my mental state, that no one really knows about. I have been bullied since I was 14 all the way up to when I left my last job at age 17. I have struggled with self esteem issues due to being bullied in high school and my first job. I have severe depression and contemplate taking my own life eveyday. My parents don\u2019t understand as they have no time for me. My father thinks I am pathetic and stupid because I want to kill myself. I dont share my issues with any of my current friends as they are all Christian an lack understanding. I want to have a boyfriend, I really do. I want to understand what having one is like. I don\u2019t understand why these really unattractive mean girls have hot guys and I am still left out. I hate going out to socialise, I have really bad skin. Dispute being a vegetarian and living a really healthy lifestyle. I don\u2019t eat sweets or processed foods. No bread or anything. Yet I still have terrible skin. I don\u2019t understand how people can eat all the chocolate in the world and not even have a pimple or blackhead. I had a crush on this guy and realised that he was legitimately autistic, so it explained why he was really bad with emotions and social cues. I still have some feeling for him. He is apart of this Church I go to. Talking about Church I joined a church at the end of 2018 and am still going. They have social groups and everything. It\u2019s really good. Except for the social bit. When I socialise I seem really bubbly and outgoing but the truth is I have have social phobia. I didn\u2019t go outside for about 3 months straight this year due to social phobia and going to the hospital because I almost killed myself. I hate myself so much. I just don\u2019t see any point in being alive. My mother tells me I am beautiful, but I think that mothers have to say that to their children so they don\u2019t have low self esteem. However I already have low self esteem. I just don\u2019t believe her. When I tell her she is lying she tells me I am stupid. My father calls me pudgy. Recently I have been thinking about wether guys care about cellulite on the back of girls legs and butts. I don\u2019t really know how men or guys think at all. My mother tells me all they want is sex. I have the place that I go to when I really low and suicidal it\u2019s called \u201csuicide ledge\u201d I just go there to think and get away from my current environment. In fact I went there today. Why? Well my younger sister has gotten her L plates and I am still on my L plates, it\u2019s been 4 years and my father said he will teach her how to drive, whenever I have asked him to teach me to drive he says no. I don\u2019t understand why my father hates me so much. In fact I think my younger sister is my parents favourite child. My father has been unemployed for 2 months and isn\u2019t really doing anything about it. Life in Sydney is really expensive, so my mother has to work really late and I never get to see her. I have decided that I want to kill myself before Christmas. I know no one cares at all. I am just there. No one special or anything. Well this is a bit of my heart right now. I hope you are doing ok. \uff08\u2579\u25e1\u2579\uff09\u2661 ",

If you don\u2019t know her, or haven\u2019t heard about her yet, I wouldn\u2019t recommend checking her out, because there is literally no way out. Yes, there are millions of people who are obsessing over her and that makes the problem even worse. I don\u2019t know what I am feeling. I know I have a crush on her but why is this so depressing for me? I think the answer is, I feel like a tiny meaningless speck in the 3 million followers that she garnered over the course of a few days. I feel there is no way that she would ever notice someone like me in the crowd and that makes me feel really bad. Every few minutes I turn to her instagram and her rising popularity hits me hard. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am not hating on her. I am happy for her success. She is extremely talented and deserves the world, but clinging on to her somehow burns me. The feeling of being insignificant really really bugs me. I wish I was famous. I wish I was a celebrity so that there would be a chance she would take notice of me. I want to do things, write a novel, launch a youtube show, or something to get famous but it just doesn\u2019t work out. This is burning me and will probably consume me. ",

            "answer_text": "It's another sex story like many others. Terms like dick,sex are explicitly mentioned. You can stop reading here only. No one is forcing you and no one will.But, if you are willing to read it then please read it all, give advice as am very much vulnerable I am 19 year young teenager. I am the gay . Being gay is the toughest part of my life as I can't leave it and society can't accept it.Being gay is not a choice. Acceptance is basic right of human being. Feeling accepted is nothing more than feeling of freedom. Being gay is normal. For acceptance, meeting like minded people I tried gay dating site that's the my biggest mistake. I am tall, slim , fairly good looking guy. I had met disgusting people over there. Actually I had talked little and then stopped talking to most of them. Incident 1- I met with one 31 year old guy in near by cafe which is not so near. I travelled 30 min to reach there as am much afraid of getting caught myself with him. He is teacher in one institute. He has mass student following. But he chose me as am the one who doesn't know his background. He is the father of newborn boy but ready to get fucked by me . He told me this so effortlessly. Our conversation then took turn to his past where he slept with many males . I feel it so gross that I couldn't handle myself and left after a while and next thing I had done was blocking him. Incident 2- This story goes same as above but here this 31 man is father of baby girl Incident 3- Here, 57 year old mature man, taking interest in me .I was like literally he was even older than my dad how can he just be fine with me too. I haven't understood that how can 57 year old man start talking about sex with 19 year old guy . He sent me nudes that's the worst part ever happened to me. Incident 4- I was added to so called WhatsApp gay group. And first picture which I have received was dick pic, cut,long, thick shaved. I really felt gross after this and I left group immediately. Incident 5- One well build guy approach me to have so called fun. He is also ready for relationship but not ready to chat on WhatsApp. Incident 6- Here , 27 year old genuine guy approached me. He never talked about sex nor dick pic nothing sexual. But within half an hour of our conversation he started using words like jaan, baby and all. I don't feel connected after that as how can someone feel so connected within an hour of conversation. List goes on. All these incidents affected emotionally, as I thought being gay is more than sex. I just want to say \u201c being gay is more than being dick. Have a dick don't be\u201d. For world where straight is a mainstream, please don't throw us out as I can't be same as you people. Each human is different in their way. Please understand the difference, respect it. ",

I care a lot but the people I\u2019m with don\u2019t give a shit about me. They hate me and they don\u2019t want me around. They pretend to care but I know that they\u2019re being fake. It sucks to be around fake people who fucking ditch me( sorry for cussing but I can\u2019t help it as I\u2019m triggered) I mean I\u2019ve done all possible things just to see them happy. But, they don\u2019t seem to care. They utilise that moment and act like they\u2019re happy and ditch me all over again. I mean what the fuck do they think I\u2019m ? A doll that you can use and throw? They don\u2019t stay with me when I\u2019m low. They fucking ignore me and act like I\u2019m the bad guy. They don\u2019t thank me for what I do for them but instead they find faults. They make me feel like I\u2019m a horrible person. I did get that feeling. But then, I joined gate classes. I did find a lot of friends who were well behaved and who nevertheless ditched or ignored me. Their presence made me happy. That is when I realised that I\u2019m not faulty. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m with the wrong people. They can\u2019t fucking make me feel lonely and dejected. I deserve more than them. I still feel a lot lonely tbh. I\u2019m trying to make friends and I hope I do :) ",

Most of them don't even mean it. Because they just don't care. Or maybe, they do. But it is because they pity you and not sympathize you. And trust me, pity doesn't last long. It can just go away overnight. You are all by yourself. Parents will love you always but you don't share everything with them. And they aren't mindreaders, either. Hence, you are all by yourself. Forever is a myth? No! Forever is true but only and only with yourself. Yes, you are forever going to be with yourself. Don't ever depend on anyone. People lend you shoulders to cry on. They will wipe away your tears. But that's not forever. You have hands. Flex them up and wipe off your tears. Remember, God helps them who help themselves. Don't wait for anyone to come and understand you. Don't look around for shoulders to cry upon. Don't find ways to blame the situation. Just look up, Heads up, Nose pointing striaght, And say \"I am around.. for myself.\" ",

So matter is what, every person aware about these things & all person should care what is our responsibility for society and if any person not do this we have to take a stand and raise voice against it.

            "answer_text": "It was 11th of June 2020, Thursday. The worst day of my life. I lost my papa on this day. Almost a week now that my Papa left us. It's been a whirlwind of every emotion. Experiencing a loss like this is hard to describe accurately, and every person who has gone through this has a different experience and situation. I want to cry out loud but I am not crying. Holding on those tears to display I am strong which I am not. My papa was my strength and I was truly a Papa ki Pari. 2017 was a hectic year. My papa started having tobacco because he had instant relief in stress. Me and my brother constantly nag to stop it and my papa as always did what we wanted. In early 2019, he had an oral ulcer. Initially he ignored and then it was diagnosed *Last stage of Cancer*. It had spread to many organs. We opted for Ayurvedic treatment and things were getting better. But all of sudden,the track changed and we lost him within 12 hours of suffering. My Papa's hemoglobin level was little low and we admitted him just for a unit of blood. He was completely good after it. We were preparing to bring him back to home. At 8 in the morning, I went to see him and saw how fast he is breathing. I called my mother and brother to come to hospital immediately. He was conscious and even talking to us. But the condition got worse and we had to put him in ventilator. By evening the doctor gave up and said if you want you can take him home. We came home along with papa around 7 PM. He asked for water and said he is hungry. He then had milk shake - Papa's all time favourite. At 8 in the evening, we saw him taking his last breath. Papa took his last breath so peacefully and we lost him. The thought that I can never see,hear or feel you again makes me cry every second,Papa. I miss you Papa. Someday, You'll be proud of us. I promise. You were a pure soul. I hope you are Resting in Peace. I love you Papa #saynototobacco #oralcancerawareness  ",

This was such a heart wrenching moment. Nearly 50 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed and many others injured when terrorists targeted a convoy with a car bomb at Awantipora in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district today, in what is the worst attack ever on security personnel in the state. The injured have been moved to the army base hospital in Srinagar, 20 km from the attack site. Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the attack. Condemning the attack, the government in a strongly-worded statement, demanded that \"Pakistan stopped supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory.\" The centre also appealed to the \"international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council.\" I am writing my heart out here.

You are just lucky you got a life to live and experience different aspects of it richness, poverty, love, cheating, success, failure, bad times, good times etc. After this life, there's absolutely no way you could get a chance to feel all these things. You aren't coming back on earth. This is just one chance you got. I mean i just wonder sometimes when i am sitting on terrace at night looking at the sky, that what exactly are we, what exactly is this universe or for that matter entire structure out there. Who designed it? Is there really some force up there who designed it or just things happened on their own? What if these things weren't there the moons, the stars, the planets, the universe, what would have been there? I get creeped out just by thinking all these stuff! ",

We hung out all day, played Gaga Ball, Swam, Ate ice cream, etc. On the Fourth of July there was a dance at the camp. My cabin mates hadn\u2019t been trying to get me to ask her to dance for days, so I did. We spent the entire time talking about life, dancing, playing games, and just having fun. Afterwards there was a firework show that the owner of the camp put up. In an unexpected low firework this girl got scared and jumped onto me, we spent the rest of the time lying next to each other watching the fireworks. Ive never had a girlfriend before, and I\u2019m pretty sure camp relationships don\u2019t workout, but she gave me the first hug that I\u2019ve ever had from someone other than family. She also said she hoped to see me next year, is this a thing I\u2019m getting too excited about, or is it a legit thing? ",

Executive attending speak sweetly but no positive outcome. They referred me to IXIGO. IXIGO telephonic support has only IVR support. They asked me to mail them they replied asking me to contact Cleartrip. So both are referring to each other. Email to Cleartrip asked me install app as they don't have email support. I installed app. Chat and mail option inactive due to history of booking not available. Phoned them. Got a super polite Sorry. Booking charges 5607/- cancellation charges Rs 5607/- although cancelled within 10 minutes of booking. Lost my money but learnt a lesson AVOID CLEARTRIP. LIKE PLAGUE AVOID IXIGO ",

            "answer_text": "I want to write this because I want to express my frustration and get back to business. Let's begin. Flashback Oct 2015: I was a 13 year old boy, an aspiring Cricketer in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. I was a little overweight, I went to one of the best cricket academies of Ahmednagar, probably even Maharashtra because Anupam Sanklecha, the pacer from Maharashtra Ranji Trophy team, was from our academy. There was U14 district level selection, I performed very poorly, yes because of my overweight, I wasn't even smart enough to do something about my weight. I was scolded by my coach many times. Even my mother was suffering from diabetes and father was overweight, so we consulted a dietician in Pune. She gave us a nice diet, and I sincerely followed it for 1 month, and I was progressing well. I lost many kgs, I could even run 8km. And even I was appreciated by my coach in front of whole academy for my progress. Then came 25th Jan, the worst turning point of my life. My father was introduced to a IIT JEE foundation coaching class by his trusted friend, whose daughter went to the class. She is a clever girl. I resisted, because I already had a bad experience with coaching classes. I told him, we wait for a year, then we'll decide what to do. He forced me to give the entrance test, which I gave, and as you all know, how badly I may score, I will get selected, after all who will pay their fees. I grew overweight again, and the most haunting part, I developed \u2018man-boobs\u2019. And I was teased in my school as \u201cdoodh wala\"due to this. Now one of my friends let's call him HP, not Hardik Pandya, but that's his nickname, as he too is flashy like him and also he's a pace bowling all rounder, who was in my school, was also in my Cricket Academy. He was my childhood friends, we went to the same nursery, same school. But he betrayed me. He told all my academy mates to tease me \u201cdoodh wala\u201d. I was constantly teased, and I was finished from inside. Now I understood, how a woman felt if she has been raped, here I am a male and have just been teased. I was finished from inside, my love for cricket too was over. 9th and 10th were the worst phase of my life. I lost both my grandfathers. And my friend, well, he became one of the office leaders of the school and scored 90.2% in 10th. I scored 84.2%. Nonetheless, somehow, I managed to get myself to play Cricket back. Now I'm in Bakliwal Tutorials, Pune and every morning I go to Cricket practice in Nehru Stadium Pune. My father has also become smart enough to understand me, he doesn't force anything, but doesn't mean he is lenient on me. But he has become more understanding person. And about my friend, well, Karma hits you back definitely. You sow good, you reap good. You sow bad, you reap bad. In September 2018, he posted something maligning about my another friend, who also happens to be an aspiring Cricketer, on the 'Ask me something\u2019 filter on Instagram, where he himself asked that derogatory question and when he was questioned about he refused to answer who asked that question. And then he was ostracized by our whole friend circle. Now if he hadn't done that thing 2 years ago, I would have definitely made it big in Cricket. Anyways I have expressed my frustration, and now I'm ready to make it big, bigger and better. Jai Shree Ram Jai Giridhar. ",

            "answer_text": "I am honestly tired. Really damn tired. I just moved to Switzerland 3 weeks ago to start my job as an au pair in a guest family. Things are great here. The location isn't ideal for me, since I prefer big cities over small towns and villages but it is better than nothing. But this isn't what makes me tired. What makes me tired is that my head cannot cope with living around people who treat me like a human being. I am suddenly allowed to have feelings? I am allowed to be sick? To make my own decisions? To buy a little more expensive food because it is healthier? To say yes or no to an activity? To spend time in my room alone when I don't feel like talking to people? I deserve respect? I am 24 years old. This is the first time in my life where I do not get screamed at, insulted and guilt-tripped 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. My psychologist recognised that the non-stop abuse and neglect that I suffered through my family made me a sociopath. All the traits for ASPD are there. They did never treat me like a human being and blamed my \u2018autism\u2019 (which I don't have, I was wrongfully diagnosed by an unexperienced psychologist when I was 2 years old) for developing other mental health stuff. I have massive anger issues. I cannot trust people at all, everyone is untrustworthy by default until proven otherwise. I don't experience fear, sadness, anxiety, guilt and other feelings anymore. I grew so numb to the point of being willfully ignorant about everything around me. Nothing can crush me anymore because my parents absolutely destroyed every emotional and vulnerable part of me in the past 24 years. I don't get stressed over the fact that for my age I have a big debt to pay off, with no income until I got lucky with this job. I don't have a plan for the future because every time I tried it, my parents absolutely ruined it for me. Forced me to pay for my education on my own, again, with no income. I legit cannot afford university despite having the right high school degree for it because they refuse to support me. Germany doesn't give a flying fuck about disabled and mentally ill people so I am fucked there anyway. I spent the past 7 years running from office to office, trying to figure out what to do after I graduate. Nothing happened. I don't get a job in my home country because nobody wants to hire people like me. So I am in Switzerland now. My guest family asked me what I want to do after this. I said I don't know. All my life it had been proven to me that everything I plan will be fucked over by either the government or my absolute shitty excuse of parents to the point that I physically cannot care anymore about my plans that go beyond tomorrow. I just wing it, every day is just another fight to stay afloat. I have another 200 \u20ac bill to pay off. Oh, and another one. I honestly lost track because I have more bills that I cannot opt out of with no income that I just stopped caring about them, stacking up more debt. My Christmas money (my parents try to buy my love and affection with money) into paying off debt. I have nothing left of it. I am tired because now that I am allowed to feel, I don't know how to anymore. My feelings died along the way of trying to survive. My empathy has been long gone. Being treated with empathy now is so surreal to me that I get irritated. I don't know what to do now. Because suddenly I am offered to have a life. But I lost the ability to care. I don't know what to do. The past nights I had severe insomnia because this is overwhelming. Being treated like a human being must feel great. Especially when you're treated like that from the start. I'm so numb to the point of only subtly experiencing exhaustion. I wondered why I am so damn tired. Well, I don't know how to adapt to people like this. I have only known darkness for my whole life. I don't know how to adjust to light. I wish I could cry and be sad about it but I am unable to. Being surrounded by emotional people who have empathy and actually care and are supportive just makes me realise how far away I am from that. I have to form a new mask. I wonder how it should look like. ",

            "answer_text": "8Iam a 20 year girl now but when i was in my teens i had this disease called alopecia areata (in which hair starts to fall in patches). And because of this disease I suffered a lot in my school and even in my family. Even if i dont want to remember those days yet i remember how children made fun of me. Intially when the patches were less there was no problem but as i became almost bald i had to wear a wig and that was the worst phase of my life. I was kind of depressed at that time. But i was in 10th standard at that time and i scored only 64 percent marks (which i regret now because we should not let other things effect another). One thing that did good to me during this was that i became habitual of being alone and i found a new side of me. I dont know when this lonliness turned into solitude and it had a positive effect on me. I became more creative and started reading and i ended up writing a poem about life.(based on those experiences) Today i feel happy that all this happened to me because it made me a better and mature person. So i think we should not be regretful for what happened with us feel happy that life gave you such an experience after all these experiences make us a better and strong person.SMILE ",

            "answer_text": "I just got out of my first relationship. (well it\u2019s been a month now) I\u2019m 18, I know i\u2019m young and life is still ahead of me but this breakup has literally broke me. He did it over text, after ghosting me for a day, after looking me in the eye the day before saying that we\u2019re okay and that we will be fine. He kissed me, put this hand on my heart then broke it 24 hours later. I failed my first class of uni cause I can\u2019t stop myself from being sad. It\u2019s been a month since the breakup. It hurts, I\u2019m scared Ill feel like this forever. I don\u2019t wanna be sad anymore. I tried blocking him on social media today but then i added him back, texted him that i miss him, and got no reply. we dated for six months, he was my first kiss, my first everything. I want to move on but i also don\u2019t? i always had hope he\u2019d come back and apologize, but he hasn\u2019t even texted me once since the breakup. I miss him, he doesn\u2019t miss me. I feel like a broken record crying about him to all my friends. Everyone\u2019s told me at least i got to learn something from the relationship but all i learned is that people lie even if they look you in the eye, even if you beg them not to. I learned people change in 24 hours. I learned not everyone\u2019s kind, you think you know someone after being in a serious relationship for half a year, but you don\u2019t. I learned that love is not worth the heartbreak. I don\u2019t want to cry anymore. I don\u2019t want to be sad anymore. I don\u2019t want to want him anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "As a kid, I was very intelligent, I was a fast learner. Me and my brother were in the same school, we use to go together. Everything seemed fine to our eyes, our mother used to prepare breakfast, lunch, dinner. She was fine or we thought she was. Late night, we use to hear their loud noise, their arguments, screams and sometimes things use to break. We never dared to come out from our blankets and see what is going on. Morning, she use to cook for us, pack our stuff and go to her job. That was our ritual. One fine day, we were coming back from school, our school bus use to drop us a little far, we saw crowd has gathered around our house, we ran to have a closer look; it was them, fighting outside in front of colony people, our friends were there too with whom we use to play. It became a habit to watch them fight, argue on small things and I didn\u2019t know how to stop them. I have seen blood, I have seen her crying and him too. I started writing slowly in class, my attention got diverted. I started scoring low marks and they called my parents for meetings which they never attended. I felt like no one cared about me, I use to sit around the corner and cry. My brother was very young to understand anything. I started getting bad dreams about them fighting. I wanted to run away from them, from all those noises. I tried to attempt suicide as well but was not coward enough to leave my mother and brother alone. It was h\u00e0rd, I didn't know I will survive. It was a never-ending fight, we got separated from him but he use to follow us, he use to come and meet us at school premises. There was a time when we had nothing to eat for days and our mother asked people to help. She was earning but all her money went to pay the house loan, school and tuition fees. My father never supported us, now he is initiating but I want him to know that it is too late. I scored less, very less in my 12th board, it was near 50%, I passed but people taunted me to be a below average student. They said I will never succeed. They were right, I will never reach where they want me to but I will where I belong. I love my parents and I will be with them forever, no matter how much struggle we all have faced. My father is an alcohol addict, he is not a bad person but he never did a good thing as well. My childhood is long gone, I am alone when it comes to school friends and college friends. I never befriended anyone except one or two because I was afraid to tell them the truth, I was afraid that people will judge my parents, and me. But now I have accepted that life gives us lemon and we have to make lemonade, ourself. My story is very long, this is just a glimpse of it. I never compare my struggles with others because I know what they have survived or are surviving is very different from my situation.  Edit: Many people are getting confused that I am still there, listening to others. No, I am not and I never did. I didn't listen to them even after getting low marks, I moved forward, took admission and completed my engineering. I was always so keen to learn, to express my thoughts, and here I am working as a Technical Writer with a decent package which a Fresher should get. One Important thing, which matters a lot to me is My mother's happiness and she is very happy.  \u201cI have come this far not just to come this far\u201d  ~Aayushi ",

My dad remarried and I don\u2019t get along with anyone at his house. I have felt like I don\u2019t belong there because I act differently than everyone else and I have brown eyes and they all have blue. Meanwhile, I have always gotten along greatly with my mother. I have to miss school to go to court every month. I have depression and have been putting a smile on my face since I was in 7th grade m, so for about 2 and a half years. But right now, I\u2019m tired of it. I don\u2019t want to live. I want to die but I don\u2019t want it to be my fault. In the beginning of freshmen year of high school, I got into a car crash and got a concussion from it. I didn\u2019t care. Ever since I recovered, I have been numb to any and all emotions. During the car crash, I was hoping I would die. I was thinking that that moment would be the last one I\u2019d ever have. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t die (obviously) and am still thinking of many ways I could use or do to kill myself without anyone suspecting it could be me. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

After all, what can be happy about ruling the land of dead souls? And as if my unhappy job wasn\u2019t enough, you hate me too. For what? For doing a job that chose me, and not the other way around. There I was, a simple mortal, just like you living a simple life until I didn\u2019t. It was just my luck to be the first ever soul that left a body and by precedence, the duty of ruling the dead fell upon my shoulders, not knowing that one day you all would be hating me!  If I had Twitter, I am sure one of you might have started a hashtag to \u2018cancel\u2019 me by now. And why wouldn\u2019t you? For your ignorant minds, anything or anyone associated with My Home is a bad omen, and sadly, that is where I live. And just FYI, I am merely the ruler of the dead; and not the one deciding who lives and who dies. So please, stop trying to bribe me into not picking you. I am NOT the one doing the selection! Which brings me to my other pet peeve \u2013 why don\u2019t you hate the ones who selected you to die in the first place? Be reminded that you make your own places in heaven or hell; I merely provide the ride like an Uber driver. I am simply doing my job, controlling spirits and demons, and frankly, I believe I deserve some gratitude because it is you who are afraid of them. I don\u2019t understand how other Gods and Goddesses, who have negative roles too, are so loved. Why am I the only one discriminated against, pray tell!  I can go on and on but I only wish to jog your memory into remembering that all Gods are equally responsible for all the problems faced by mankind and all of them are equally responsible for solving them. And if \u201csilly you\u201d still blames me, I can understand; you are a human, after all. Yours lovingly *scoffs* Yamaraja  \ud83c\udf3b ",

My husband died 12/14/17 from end stage liver failure due to alcoholism. I'm afaid of how much he helped me deal with my depression. Now I'm a single mom I don't have anyone to talk to, because I've shut myself in so it wouldn't hurt so much. I'm on antidepressants and think they might actually be helping me. I let my house become an unorganized disaster. My entire bedroom floor was covered with laundry that needed done. My kitchen was a mess and I knew it was but I just couldn't get up to clean anything because I was convinced my husbands family would've offered to help me out with the whole situation. I finally have gotten all the laundry put together and washing it. My living room isn't filled with empty fast food containers anymore. The kitchen is my next step I feel like a failure to my children mommy just got lost for a little bit but she's making her way back. I know that just keeping it all in so you don't show you're weak, just makes it even worse. I've talked to my girls and have let them know I love them very much so much I didn't want them to see me hurting. I would sit in shower and just cry for like 20 minutes convincing myself it was best to just not show it. My girls are hurting too they lost their freaking dad to something so simple. I've taken them to a therapist, and I see one myself. The girls know that I'm not going to be super mom for a while but that's okay. Wow I hate feeling so uncontrolled of my emotions, but I do know I am working on getting myself back together. ",

They've never fought like this before, if you have shitty relatives you cannot have peace of mind. And the other thing that bothers me the most is this guy. To start from the start, this was 2years ago we met on tinder (please dont judge), and we hit it off we started seeing each other, from the first date i told him that I'll be looking for something meaningful out of this encounter and not what usually tinder is used for. He had similar thoughts and i was Happy about that, but after a few months of dating he said I don't think we have a future together as our castes are different, my parents will never agree, I spoke to them and they are not ready for this kind of relationship. I was heartbroken but like a strong woman i let the man go not begging him to do this to me\u2026 Things were getting back on track life was good. But when god has decided to fuck up ur life this happens- While we were dating i had referred him to my company for job, i didnt think he would join the company, he gave the interview and cleared it in my company, we had spoken during that process a few times formally as frnds and i was like do what suits you and all he ended up joining my company.. initially I behaved like an ass for obvious reasons, mostly my behavior included avoiding him and talking a lot less than i should with a normal collegue. But eventually i gave in and thought lets forget the past, we can be friends. But then i come to know he joined the company because he regretted letting me go, and not giving our relationship enough time and taking things for granted and also he had convinced his parents by then for me.. I didnt believe him, he kept convincing me for 6\u20137months until he gave in, the reason i was not ready to say yes was i was afraid that he will leave again and i couldn't trust him again after the first time\u2026 so i never took him Seriously and in the mean time i started seeing this another guy lets call him Mr.B. But at this point both the guys were aware about this whole situation. I didnt wana lie to anyone about what was going on\u2026 but after 6\u20137months of his convincing, i think i was softening up for him and i was regretting dating mr.B. It had just been a lil over a month i decided that i wana break up with Mr.B and give another chance to the first guy.{I started pulling back but hadn't broken up yet as i was still confused} By this time he had resigned from our company and had started searching for another job which he got and now his last day was approching. I burried my feelings and said nothing, he left the company.I went on a trip to take my mind of this whole shitty situation i had put myself in. During the trip I don't know what changed but i got the clarity, I decided that i am going to breakup with Mr.B and give this first guy another chance as somewhere deep inside i had burried my feelings for him.. and i still felt for him.. I come back from my trip i breakup with Mr.B and i tell this first guy everything and ask, was he still willing to date me and that i would understand that after 7months of pursuing if he had given up on me, I would be ok with that too. But he hadn't given up and he was happy that i realised and came back to him. After that things were so perfect, we both gave each other more than 100 percent there was so much love as we both knew the value of losing each other. We hardly fought and when we did we resolved it like adults..and there wud be more love after a bad episode\u2026 after a few months i tell him that my parents are searching for guys to get me married, my mom already knew we are dating. he said he would talk to his parents about it. And bam thats when things come crashing down\u2026 Same old situation, but this time i had confidence that he would support our relationship and fight for me, and convince his parents, i couldn't understand he had said, that his parents were convinced why were they saying no again, same caste issue same reasons.. but i still had faith bcz he said he would fight for us, he had met my mom.too and told her he'll talk to his parents this went on for couple of months. To come to the end, he tells me we can't get married, because he thinks he'll manage to convince his parents even if the caste is not same and our patrika doesn't match\u2026 but the real thing is he was never ready to get married, he wants to get a PR and move to australia and all his friends had convinced him that if you get married that will not happen. I tried to make him understand, that i am a career oriented woman too and you know ill always support you in anything and we both can do that together, but no he just ghosted on me and left.  Ive tried everything, but these 2months after him leaving me have been so bad along with the family drama, ive felt so alone and cheated on, i didn't deserve this. He had left me the first time why did he have to come the second time fuck me up all over again, by emotionally manipulating me and then eventually leaving me.It has only left me questioning every feeling he had for me.Everything seems like a lie to me. But im a strong woman and ive picked up the pieces and walked out of this, but ill never be able to get over the fact that he left me like i meant nothing to him, and here i kept thinking that he was the one for me.  Edit 1 : To ans the question if i spoke to his family during this period - i only spoke to his mom on the phone when, he was trying to convince them the second time she said that his father is saying no because of the caste and that she didn't have any problem. Now to this date i keep feeling someone was lying here, and in the end the guy also told me that his parents said yes, but his relatives didnt, and his parents were like you should talk to the relatives first and not tell them that we've said yes. And if they say yes ask the relatives to come talk to us and then we will say yes, that way our family wont look like we are all going against ppl because of caste difference. This whole thing sounded so fishy to me, but i was stupidly in love then, and i let this drama go on for too long\u2026 im going to stick to never let a person into your life the second time again\u2026!!

            "answer_text": "I saw her first time during domain allocation in IBM, Bangalore. National level table tennis player and a really good singer as well. I was totally impressed by her simplicity and engaging looks. But when I saw something like sindoor on her forehead, I was like shit man.. missed it. We started to have casual talks. Once I asked her, when did you get married? She responded that she isn't married. This is the tradition in their family to apply the sindoor. Got huge relief and inner me was so happy. She caught that happiness through my eyes, but didn't say anything. One night, I was getting bored. Called her. Came to know that she was returned from somewhere and was tired. Asked her if we could meet. She agreed. I never felt so nervous while talking to any girl. I still remember stammering in my words while talking to her because of nervousness. Our first meet outside office (Near her PG) and I messed up with it. Man I couldn't even look at her properly while talking because I was blushing and I didn't want to let her notice this. But she was too sharp and calm. Got to know her nature closely on that night. Things were casual. We used to text each other. Shared office life (as we were working on different technologies). I was so happy to have her in my life. Thought life has given me a really big gift. One fine day, during free time she was playing table tennis with her friend. I thought to join and impress her through the game. But she was far better than me. I lost. But there was not even a single emotion/expression on her face that how great she is and she won against me. Came to know about her best friend (entry of obstacle). They were close since first year of their engineering. Actually there was a trio. Two girls and one guy. Best friends. Another girl got in relationship with this guy. But somewhere I felt that my girl was in love with her best friend. But she never expressed because she might cared for friendship. She had a clue that I was crazy for her. But I never expressed directly. Fast forward to her birthday.. Nov 2017\u2026 I'm not so good in remembering names and b'days of people. We used to work in night shifts in same office. I was on sick leave for two days. casually texted her around 11:50 pm. Me : Hi.. She :Hi.. where are you? Me : PG She : What are you doing at PG? Me : Nothing. Just TP (so dumb of me) Then I saw status of one of our mutual friend on WhatsApp for her birthday. I considered myself so stupid on that moment. Called her. Wished her. She was with her college friends for bday celebration outside office. Btw she was so famous in her college and has huge friend circle. May be because of her sweet nature. I decided to make her birthday bit special. Bought cake. Reached office late due to this. Called her office friends. Celebrated her bday. I was pleased to see smile on her face. And proud too because I could make it. Her earrings and outfits was stunning on that day. I wanted to hug her and tell her that she meant a lot to me. Jan 2018.. I confessed my love to her through WhatsApp. I had no plans of doing it but suddenly I couldn't resist myself. She denied. (As she is from a Bramhin Kannadiga family and I'm Maratha.) According to her, her family would never accept this. But I personally think this was not true reason. I think she never considered me liable for her. In terms of looks, lifestyle, thinking, nature. Even I accept that I'm not liable for her because she is so beautiful and I'm no where around it. After my confession, she started to maintain distance with me. Formal replys for my texts. One night in office we had fight. Don't know who was wrong, but there I lost her. I said to her, \u201c I'm going to throw you out of my life.\u201d I said it out of anger. But she did it. Threw me out of her life. Since then, for 9\u201310 months I apologized her so much. Called her. She didn't respond. Blocked me everywhere. Once in office i approached her and tried to apologise. She denied in insulting way. I was totally shattered and broken without her. 2nd Nov 2018.. I called her to wish on her b'day. Texted. After 10 months she talked to me. Just said \u201cThank You\u201d. I asked if we can give a new start for our friendship. Didn't get response for that. 9th Nov 2018.. Received a mail notification. I was copied (Bcc) in her signing off mail. Her last day in office. I got a big shock. It was feeling that someone has snatched my everything from me. I called her, this time she received the call. Informed that she is returning to her hometown. She was busy on that moment so asked me to call at night. I did. But she didn't respond. I called/texted, but got no response. My happiness lies in her, I couldn't make this realize to her. Because of my attitude I lost her. She still thinks I'm a random guy who is stalking her and doing tp. Few wise words.. Be so much capable in terms of looks, physique and career that there shouldn't be any reason for rejection.Respect girls. I'm changed person from that incident but of no use. I lost her.If you feel that there is some body made for you, then never let her/him go.No matter we would meet in life or not, but she would remain as most special girl for me. Thanks for reading.. !! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi everyone ! I hope all of you are doing good:) I want to pour out me heart and all my emotions here today because I am tired and sick of everything going around me. Basically, my life is legit fucked up! I\u2019m a 17 year old South Indian girl. The pressure of 12th Boards in March and JEE Mains in January is getting on my nerves. You might call it pretty normal to have such feelings at this point of time but this is not I am bothered about.What I am afraid of is how I\u2019m going to pay back my parents for everything they have done for me. This year is a very crucial phase in my life. My mom stopped me from going to school in 8th since i got 89.7% and not 90% but my dad convinced her. I had disappointed my parents and all my teachers in 10th boards by getting just 93.33% Then I got into a well reputed college and my parents have spent 4 lakhs in these 2 years. My scores were PATHETIC in 11th (just touched 80%) and my scores in JEE mock tests at college hardly crossed 130/360. During the first PTI in 11th, the principal told my mom that I wasn\u2019t even meant for a local engineering college in front of the entire class and in the list of people who he has decided he would kick out if the performance is bad. She was in tears and she told me that she would never ever come with me to college hereafter. I felt so ashamed of myself. (In my school days, I was a true procrastinator, very chilled and laid back girl, never thought about future and career but stilled efficient enough to get my name in the toppers list.) This college atmosphere was completely new for me where one should be a total bookworm and Einstein and Newton and \u2018regular in studies\u2019 ! After that incident with my mom, I worked really hard but always hovered around 100 marks. With all these scores, I heard only these words everyday: YOU ARE USELESS! ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A PAIN, A SHAME FOR US! HAVE YOU EVER MADE US PROUD?!? INSTEAD OF LIVING SUCH A LIFE GO DIE! WE WILL BE REALLY HAPPY!!! I tried my best to ignore all possible specimen of distractions: stopped going for movies, minimized the time I spent on phone and tv, rejected the proposals from the most hottest and cutest boys and JUST STUDIED. Well nothing really turned out great and I flunked again. At the beginning of 12th I answered another exam on the basis of which the principal will decide is he would let me continue or not. When my parents heard this, I got beaten up by almost all the accessories at home and insults in each and every sentence. Those 7 days of my life were worst than hell. Everyone in the college knew for sure that i would clear that exam and believed me except my parents, and I did clear it with a good score. In my 1st formative I scored 95% but still my mom never came to collect my report card. My mom is sick now and my dad\u2019s business is picking up pace after 4 years. I got the marks of 2nd formative in which i haven\u2019t performed up to mark ( just 92%). I cried a lot at college today. I don\u2019t have the courage to tell my marks to my mom. By now I assume that most of you must have pictured my parents as villains. But trust me they are not, I am really lucky to have them. Frankly speaking, I have failed to be a good daughter, sister, student\u2026\u2026. They have always wanted the best for me and given me the best even if its beyond their level. To a lot of extent what they say is true, MARKS is all that matters in this stage of life at least, their are almost like a trade mark or a brand. They changed a lot and have always been encouraging me that i would surely get into an IIT but i know that its beyond my level and they never understand that. I don\u2019t want to get into a private college because the fees id really high, money is never a matter for them but i don\u2019t want to be a burden on them anymore. I am really freaked out thinking about my future. Although I can\u2019t get into an IIT, I can surely get into a good NIT (my score has improved to 150/360 now). I am scared that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make them happy and proud even this time, I don\u2019t want to fail as a daughter again! These thoughts haunt me everyday. My dad doesn\u2019t treat my mom very well neither did her parents, but to the world he is a sweetheart and my mom is a villain. She is a homemaker and has no one to go to. She always tells me that I should study well, get a good job, earn very well and be Independent, never depend on my husband just like the way she is doing now. When I was young, I did not like her much because she always scolds me and hits me even for a very small mistake and my dad used to take my side always. Now that i have grown up, i can understand her. I have been really harsh towards her but now I really Love her. I don\u2019t want to break the trust and hopes she has on me now. She is the only soul who understands me. How much ever she scolds and hits me, she has bought me everything I wanted without telling my dad, has let me do whatever i want but it was me who has always misunderstood her. I Love You Amma! I will make sure that I make I will make you proud amma. I feel much better now. My heart feels light now. Thank you very much for taking your time to read my post. This is the first time i am writing on quora. Do excuse my grammatical errors. I hope I get the guts to tell my marks to her and I pray to God that that she gets well soon by then and understands my situation:)  ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to share a story written by my best friend. She is a survivor, she wrote her own life in the form of a short story. Each and everything written below happened in her life. She beautifully converted it in the form of a story. Please read and share your views. THE BROKEN WING: MENDED She was a girl, who had dreams, lot of dreams. When talking about her dreams, past tense suits the best. A girl with lot of love and passion. And that was very clear in her bright charming kajal defined eyes. Very talkative and a fun girl she was. Mostly like a butterfly giving and spreading joy. There were hardly anyone who hated her. Everyone thought, only the best will come for her. Everyone assured the same, throughout. Rest of the story reveals the truth though.. She was very romantic and a delicate girl. Like every other girl in twenties, she too dreamed a lot about her prince charming. She dreamed of long walks in the beach holding hands and watching sun kiss the beautiful ocean. She dreamed of never ending talks deep enough to understand each other's soul. She dreamed of never ending kisses till the last wick of the last candle submerged in that paraffin liquid. She dreamt of a family who considers her as their own daughter and not as the wife of their son. She dreamt of kids, a lot of them running around in their garden. Her dreams were never ending and they were never chained. When at last he came, that turned out to be a prince of disaster. She never realised that, coz she was busy loving him for what he was. But nothing was good enough for him. He took away all that she had from her. Her charm, her smile, her love, her nonstop talks,her beauty and everything that was hers, was taken away by that man who was wicked and cunning.He tortured her for nothing but his pleasure. Her cries and her pain made him more happy than her smile.Every inch of her body was tortured for his physical and sexual pleasure leaving her with blood and stains.. She never complained to anyone. She was still not able to remember hurting even an ant for pleasure. And still she was questioning her self, what has she done to go through all this pain. She still stayed as his loyal dog not telling about her plight to anyone. Everyone thought that she lived 'happily ever after', after her marriage. She too never thought that, happily ever after was just a myth. But her life proved that there was no happily ever after. Three months was all that she could bear him. But she and everyone else who knows her story now, know it very well that, even though it was just 3 months in calendar, it was a whole 30 year trial that she has gone through with him. She kept mum for everything except one thing. It happened when she got pregnant with her first kid from him. When he got to know that she was pregnant, he asked her to give him money for paying off his debts with one of his so called business partner, with whom he occasionally sleeps. She never was left with anymore money, as everything was looted by him and his family. When he realised that she don't have anymore money, he told her to kill their kid and demanded divorce. That came as a shock for her. She never could understand how he could ever tell something like that about their first kid. It\u2019s then she realized, it's high time she tell her parents. Then she told the whole story to her parents from the start and they heard it with tears rolling down their cheeks and they promised her that, they will never ever let him touch her. Their warmth and love was the only thing that kept her going forward after that. She realized other than her dad and brother, she can trust no other man. She will have no other man in life. For her, all men are same except for two men in her life. She hated everymen. She hated love, romance, smile, kiss everything. Everything that was once dear to her became her worst nightmare ever. She never wanted a man in her life, coz of the scars her marriage has left on her. She was devastated. She was worried about her unborn baby and her failed marriage. She went into depression soon after. She ate only to keep the baby fine. She never cried in front of her parents. When with them, she strongly made them believe that she was fine. She gave them courage that she will be fine. But when she got back to her room, she cried her heart out. And spoke to her unborn baby. She loved her kid. She sang for the kid, she told stories and she told how much fun they will have in future together. She lived for the kid in her womb. But one day, when her mom came to room, she was shocked. Her bed was covered in blood and she was unconscious. She was rushed to the nearest hospital. There she was taken to labour room. And she woke up hours after and realized she lost her baby and she could never stop crying. All the pain she went through was for nothing. She lost the only thing that made her move on in life. She was more depressed than ever. She never smiled after that. Her tears also dried up. She dint cry to let out the pain. She never talked much after that. Nothing she did after that in fact. She just lived like a log. Inorder to change her from this depression, her parents made her join her forever dream, \"Ph.D\". The first one year, she never talked much, smiled, or laughed. She talked to all. All were her friends and she was a friend to all. But she was changing day by day after that. She was definitely a survivor, who was recovering from depression by her own, without even letting others know. Mending a broken wing will never make it the same, but still it's worth it...

So, last year in July I started an internship job in a media center for the youth (video & photography). At the time I started, there was also a girl (21 years) working there for a student job. We started talking about our passions (video and photo) often and became friends, not close but we had sympathy for each other. She was there 3 weeks and I would be there for 12 months. So in August she left again and I didn\u2019t see her back (I didn\u2019t got contact infos as I wasn\u2019t really interested in her besides our professional relationship. So in October the girl brought her best male friend (26 years), who was a backpacker to the media center and he started an internship as well. We both became instantly good friends and hung out after work together often. As we hung out together this meant that he would bring the girl I knew already with him and so I got to befriend her stronger. The girl and the boy weren\u2019t dating but I respected their friendship and didn\u2019t even thought about doing a move on the girl in a romantic way. So the months went by and April 2018 something terrible happened. At that time she came back again to the media center for a month to work a student job and both her best friend and me are still on our internship. The girl and the guy went on a holiday together and when they came back the girl came to me and told me that he treated her very, very badly during their holidays. He said very terrible things to her, very selfish, arrogant things. He broke her heart and didn\u2019t even care about it! This changed their friendship forever. She came to me in her sadness, poured her heart out and even cried in front of me. As we worked every day together we became closer (also in a romantic way). One day on lunch break, we both laid on a bench next to each other and we talked about personal stuff like background, family, past relationships. At that moment , suddenly without me realizing, I fell in love with her. My last girlfriend was 7 years ago and I haven\u2019t felt such a strong attraction or attachment to a girl in a very long time! Now comes the confusing part. So our friend, as he is a backpacker, he lives in the media youth center which is also a hostel and offers rooms for foreign volunteers. As the girl and I live in the same region we take the same train after work. As we also spent more time after work together we became close friends, she trusted me and I trusted her. So one day after work I walked her to the bus station and we hugged for goodbye for the first time. It was a sincere and warm hug that I haven\u2019t received in a long time (7 years without girlfriend!) At this moment we started hugging when we met in the morning in the train and in the evening for goodbye. Another confusing detail: the girl and our friend were both working on a big film project together and despite her having her heart broken by him they still spent way too much time together after work and in the weekends, they fought often over small things and decisions (he is proud, arrogant and impulsive and she is caring and wants to solve problems as fast as possible, and he doesn\u2019t). One day they had a really, really big fight once again, that he ran away to a new female friend (which made my female friend jealous) and threatened to leave the job and continue backpacking to a foreign country. So that evening, the girl called me and wanted to meet up so that I may comfort her. When she met up she gave me a long (almost too long) warm hug that I almost melted in her arms and it just felt as time was standing still (FYI I\u2019m 6\u20322\u2033 and she is something between 5\u20325 and 5\u20327\u2033 so it must have felt good to her too). That evening I listened to her and gave my opinion on the situation. I knew exactly what she needed to do: get as fast and as far away as possible from that emotional abusive relationship, but of course she didn\u2019t listened and still believed in his good side and that he might change (someday). She held on to the past memories that, no doubt, have been positive. After her month at my workplace was over, we continued to text each other and I asked her out for drinks after work. At the bar I could really feel that the attraction was mutual and I noticed all the positive body language and flirting signs. After the bar we walked back to the bus station and on the way she mentioned her ex-boyfriend (for the first time) not in the sense that she missed him or anything, more like what he did wrong with her and she even stated (also in regard to our common friend) that \u2018she always gets the wrong guys\u2019. After that she also said a few times that I shouldn\u2019t act like X (our common friend) when I didn\u2019t want to talk about my personal problems with her. At the bus station we hugged again. After that we texted each other at least once a week. When I mentioned that I didn\u2019t felt good since some days she wanted me to meet her at her home to talk about it but I declined as I didn\u2019t felt like talking about it with her. Otherwise we couldn\u2019t meet up again due to our busy schedules (she started a job at a tv station). We only met up once after that. She texted me and suggested a meet up at a park after work. As I was on my way to the park she suddenly suggested that Y should join us and he did. I felt miserable. What sounded great at first turned into a shitty hang out where I felt left behind and kind of betrayed by her. We sat in a public park and only after he left we both talked together. Again she insisted on talking about my problem (which in retrospective was kind of a mix of depression/after love depression/anxiety/loneliness but how the f*ck should I have told her that I love her and it\u2019s because of my feelings and emotions that I\u2019m feeling this way?) and mentioned that I really shouldn\u2019t act like her best male friend and talk about problems instead of keeping it inside me and she invited me to go with her to her video job in the evening. I declined again and went home. Again we hugged for goodbye which might have driven me deeper into loneliness. We didn\u2019t talk or text afterwards and only recently we hung out again (as part of a group hang out). Yesterday she texted me to ask for a hang out after work again. She also invited another common friend but (fortunately for me) he wasn\u2019t available, so we spent a good 3 hours together, only the both of us. You can\u2019t even imagine how good that felt to finally spend time alone with her. I hate hanging out with her in a group setting. She always seems to ignore me more or less (I\u2019m rather shy and quiet, though). We visited the old part of the city as she wanted to show me a very beautiful spot of the city but access was closed down for some reason so we agreed to come back together when it is open again. The rest of the evening we spent in the local skatepark on a bench where we talked about personal stuff (cameras, my old hobby skateboarding, family, a documentary she watched recently, childhood and so on\u2026). The light was really beautiful that evening as the sun went down. Later I helped her with her studying for her upcoming exams about camera stuff and photography (so I actually could help her haha). We walked back to the bus station and hugged for goodbye. And for the first time in some weeks I felt really, really happy again. I would really want to date her so that I can spent more time with her, hug her, hold her hand, kiss her (all that relationship jazz) but she is just to focused on the past and the memories with her best male friend that she doesn\u2019t focus on building and strengthening OUR relationship. This guy will only hurt her over and over again and this makes me feel really sad because I can\u2019t really help her (as she won\u2019t really listen to me in that regard). As I\u2019m a poem writer besides photography and videography I wrote a poem that suited the situation as I wrote it in April after she told me about what happened in her holiday, and it helped me deal with the situation she told me about. She liked the poem very much (and understood the deeper meaning of it) and for the first she seemed as if she understood what she needed to do. Thank you for reading this long ass text and if you have any suggestion of what I should do next, or shouldn\u2019t do next, please let me know. THANK YOU FOR READING AND GIVING ME THE SPACE TO WRITE THIS DOWN! ",

Starting the answer as- From a little background considered as bright student performed well in class but not in boards neither 10th nor 12th took a drop believed that i am gonna give it all and gonna show everybody what really iam ( I know a bad thought but still..) Went to kota to fulfil my dream but as happened with most i got distracted there although i not missed any class and also didn\u2019t druged or other things but watched movies and other\u2026.i somehow was able to kept my hope alives there by doing little random study then comes final preparation time where everyone got serious towards there study with full throttle so do i (thanks to my papa)doing study most of the time i did well in both jee and neet (iam a pcmb student) but not az good as i wanted me to do\u2026. Iam happy as parents are happy that iam gonna study mbbs but somewhere deep in my heart i always had a feeling of regret that i didn\u2019t gave my 100% from the start and if i had i would have achieved more i know it maybe offensive for many who work day and night but couldn\u2019t fetch even a medical seat i am sorry to them but its my personal feeling\u2026 Doing mbbs from a college like every average student although by believing you could be at a better place hurts me \u2026but i can do nothing for it\u2026 Nowadays what iam saying to myself to keep myself motivated is cheer up atleast got a seat in a decent college and its not the end of life i will have many opportunities in future\u2026thanks to almighty and my parents.. Thanks for scrolling hope you not get much bored and please forgive for any offensive thing you find up and writing mistakes\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "You can judge me but I know it\u2019s not me. I too love the previous version of mine. So here\u2019s the story start. I was in love with my classmate. She was the most beautiful girl in the class. I never got a chance to confess her in school due to my shy nature. Then after 12th, I went for IIT preparation. Sometimes In the night, I used to miss her so much that tears were coming from the eyes. Sometimes I used to scold myself that why I didn't tell her about my feelings. Time passed and I didn\u2019t clear IIT but got a good rank in the state level college. I Got admission in the college in Delhi and till I never got a chance to talk to her. In my first year, in November or December, I saw her in FB and sent her a request. She accepted a day later. After then we started to talk day and night. I think she knew about my feeling but I never got a chance to confess her cause of my shyness nature. I still remember that In my second year, she called me her home, we talked, she said why I never asked her to come to my home, I told her about my family. We became our best friend. She told me everything about her family like Her family would never be allowed for love marriage. She too asked about my crush in which I told that she is my school crush. Even too in Diwali, Every family member in my home was decorating the house but I was talking to her. I was the only boy who visited her home. Even My friend started to tease me using her name. I was too happy. In my third year, One day a thought came in my mind, What if something happened to me or her so I decided to tell her about my feelings. But I didn't have enough courage to confess her on call So I confess her on mobile about how I feel about her and how my life changes when she came into my life. I was eagerly waiting for her reply. A reply came \u201cWe are a best friend and I don\u2019t want to ruin our friendship and I didn't feel the same for you\u201d. I asked about the problem with me. But then she started messaging me in like 3\u20134 days. I was angry with her then A week later, I met a girl, I proposed her same day and she accepted the same day. We used to talk day and night and yes, I started liking her the way she talked. A week later, one night She asked me to do phone sex. I told her that I don\u2019t know how to do it and that night I saw her completely different. After that, we usually used to do it at night. Then a week later She told me that she had a bad habit of talking to the boys and she has 2\u20133 other BF. It was completely shocking for me but till I had got used to her. So I said ok but around after 3\u20134 months I received a message her that \u201cYou are really a good boy so I am leaving you because I can\u2019t do it with you.\u201d I was completely broken and I couldn't concentrate on my studies for the 2-3 week then I realized that the problem is in me and my nature. After that I about 50% changes myself. Now I am the completely new version of myself and now I see the girl in completely different ways. I am sometimes happy and sometimes really sad. Now I do not feel anything. Now I have 2 GF and I know they love me but I am with them only for sex. I tried to love them but can\u2019t. I do not need any love, I am desperate about sex. Sometimes I am completely silent and don\u2019t know why I started laughing suddenly. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s good or bad for me. But yes, Now I have time for myself. I saw a pic who completely define the stages of my life.  Thanks for listening to me. ",

I am talking about Hyderabad MMTS I don't know how many people are allotted to give tickets in the ticket counter in lingampally, but even though if 1 person is allotted, there will be no problem. Because, if one train is lost, next one will be there. But during nights, there should be atleast 2 members to give tickets or a seperate line for ladies. In some other small stations, there will be one person in ticket counter and other one will be at automated vending machine. But in lingampally, always there will be one. Such AVMs will be always not working. Every night so many ladies suffer in line to take tickets and it would be unpleasant to stand between men. And i respectfully asked the lady who is in counter that \"why can't two members be there?\" After two times of asking, she regretfully with anger face said \"why will they be there?\" Instead of answering query patiently, she answered like that. But all i want is please allot two people or a seperate line for ladies. Atleast if train is missed, there will be company for each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple English Simple english is a joy to read and remember. It is easily understood and commited to memory. This results in an appreciation of the ideas underlying the sentence, paragraph or essay and equips the reader with new points of view. It also assists in accelerating the reading by providing an accessible piece of literature for the lay reader. The nature of language changes with the times and we are unaware of the twists and turns the structure of language has undergone in the interval lapsed. Illustrating this, I say that medieval english was markedly different from the english of the nineteenth century which is itself but a shadow of the format of modern english. Coming into the twenty first century, we witness the use of electronic devices for communication. The attention span of the consumer in this day and age is different from and perhaps shorter than the previous generations. This is specific to the field of assimilation of ideas introduced through language. English it seems has taken a nightmarish turn for the purists of this generation. Harking back to the glory days of classical english the scholars are appaled at the disintegration of the institution of complex language structure. At this point I wish to differ from the language technician. From now on, I will put forward my argument for the acceptance of simple english with certain minimum complexity required to make the language understood to the receiver. Starting at the basics I wish to define the word language accuracy and robustness. Accurate here means conforming to the undersatnding of the largest number of people, also accounting for the diversity within. The word robustly requires of the language to be able to withstand variations in its sentence, paragraph and essay structure without compromising on meaning. With our background definitions of accuracy and robustness, we start the definition of te word language. Language is defined as the part of human activity which communicates ideas and intentions between members of the group thus leading to responses which may be either competitive or co-operative. This definition requires of language the property of stimulus and for communication purposes. The response with respect to the stimulus may be positive (co-operative) or negative(competitive). The words in brackets may be re-ordered to change the response and these four scenarios complete the picture of human communication through language. Ideas are part of the personal language of an individual. These determine the intentions of any person. Moving to the receiver, if these are accurately communicated then the person may hope to receive from the other person the response as expected. However, in the case of inaccurate depiction of ideas, the response may not be deemed reasonable by the person. Here the robustness of language comes to the rescue of accuracy of thought. If language were to possess the property that its meaning remained unchanged through intentional or unintentional changes in structure upto a limit, then one could be confident of oneself in describing ones thoughts and feelings. This would remove uncertainty from the communication paradigm of human activity. The question that remains is difficult to answer but an attempt will be made. How is such a language to be constructed? There is some value which can be ascribed to the truth, which I broadly divide into two competing tendencies, the correspondence and coherence theories. Any language is an attempt at truth telling. This may be at the level of ideas, intentions or feelings or the outside environment. More generally it is the interaction of personality and environment that determines language. Thus language is used to interface with the world. Now coming to the two theories of truth, of which I hope to make a happy reunion, which is also logically valid. Correspondence theory requires that any truth be equivalent to a real world object. As an example, a door is an object used to provide a flexible structure for entry, exit and safety of a room or a house, perhaps also a building. Correspondence theory requires the word \u201cdoor\u201d to mean this structure from the real world. Coherence theory though requires only that the word \u201cdoor\u201d make sense to the receiver without recourse to corrspondence. In both these situations the nature of negation is different. In correspondence theory any entity which is not equivalent to a real world object is false. In coherence only those entities are false which are needed not coherent. By this I mean the entities which do not make sense are false. As illustration of the difference, in correspondence theory the unicorn is a falsehood because it has thus far not been seen to exist. However, in coherence theory it is a real object to anyone to whom it makes sense. As in a horse like creature with a horn on its snout. One may heave a sigh of relief in thinking that modern focus on details has made the question of combining the two possible. Let us see how. For the purposes of proof we will assume the correspondence theory as true and then assimilate the coherence theory into it. Our reasoning is based on the proof by observation criterion, in the same way as science finally gives credence to a theory. The part of the coherence theory which is to be made equivalent to a form of correspondence is from now called unicorn after the illustration. The unicorn is finally the change in electrical potential in the brain synapses and thus confroms to these structures. Hence, it is equivalent to these signals across the brain. How is one to consider the two parts, on one the unicorn and on the other the potential equal is an uninteresting question. Firstly any television converts signals of an electrical nature into metaphorical unicorns. Why does one not delve deep into the origins of this question? Precisely because we have assumed the ad hoc hypothesis of special position of humanity in the cosmos, the grand scheme of things. Now comes the technical side of the argument where the word energy has a meaning familiar in physics, the capacity to work. Entropy is the reduction in work per unit of effort applied. Since the entropy of the universe always increases by empirical testing, usable energy is always decreasing. This gives any person the evolutionary advantage if the person utilises less energy for a task under circumstances of isolation. This may be generally said to be true even in groups, for then the energy of a group is preserved if less of it is used. This of course keeps all else equal. This evolutionary advantage given by nature may be termed abstraction, the ability to remove redundant parts from any picture to read only the necessary and sufficient aspects. This is also in certain contexts intelligence. This provides an easy interpretation of association and analogy, collation and separation. This is part of the survival instinct of man given that evolution is true. Here an important word used is instinct, which is manifested as reflex and voluntary actions. One must be prepared to understand coherence in the light of the previous paragraph and terms introduced in it. We now consider the derangement problem of mathematics, wherein there are envelopes and letters none of which bears the correct address. Let us assume a fixed number of such pairs. Can they be put back into order by a switching process? Obviously they can because this is the essence of bubble sort. For each switch let there be a fixed cost incurred. Then in order for the ordering to be made an energy cost must be incurred. This will in turn contribute to the entropy reservoir and deplete the usable energy at the disposal of the group. Furthermore, the game now is between usable energy and entropy, because any reduction in the first is aggregated as entropy. Is man merely a player of this game, a part of the cosmos in frolic? This seems to be the case. Is the world is merely energy then man is a level of energy between the two sides, a door for exit and entry of energy, from the white unicorn of hope to the one of chaos. The human with the minimum cost of ordering may be considered to have a marked advantage over the other members of the group. This is a game with humans having to allocate their portions to the reservoir of entropy. However, now we have to talk about our English prospects and we will do it thoroughly. Correspondence and coherence can now be talked about on an equal footing by energy considerations. Thus we hope to see an emergence of language which is based on correspondence be it of the internal world of man, his personality, the outside sphere or any interaction thereof. ",
