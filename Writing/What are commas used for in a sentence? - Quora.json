            "answer_text": "People often think they are for \u201cpauses,\u201d but, actually, a better way to think about them is they are used in specific writing situations. Writing is just a primitive recording technology for spoken language, or one can skip speaking the words one is thinking and go directly to recording them with writing. The earliest form of writing was invented about 10,000 years ago, and it evolved into something like what we have today 3,500 to 5,000 years ago. So, commas are used in specific writing situations as part of the system we\u2019ve all agreed to follow for recording spoken sounds or sounds we think in our heads without speaking them aloud. Spelling is also a part of that writing system. Commas, just like spaces or other marks of punctuation, are used to separate things visually in a sentence and make it easier for a reader to understand what is going on. The five major comma rules have to do with where clauses are. Without getting into exceptions such as ejaculations (Bravo!), a sentence has at least one independent clause, but you can have as many independent clauses in a sentence as you want. ",

            "answer_text": "Commas, though usually hated for encouraging complexity in sentences, are usually used to give proper meaning. For example look at the following sentences both the same but a comma only included in one : Let's eat, Grandma.Let's eat Grandma.See the difference? This is how commas can be used to drastically change the meaning of a sentence. Thank you for reading. ",
