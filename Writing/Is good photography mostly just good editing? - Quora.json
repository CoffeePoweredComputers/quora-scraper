            "answer_text": "Ebert\u2019s answer is a very good answer. There seems to be a massive amount of confusion concerning digital photography. None of these questions ever came up in the film days. In the days of film everyone knew and accepted that every image had to be processed. Apparently in digital we have confused the sort of okay job that the camera does in processing for us. We shoot our JPEGs and if we are good enough technically to shape the JPEG we get in varying degrees either an ok image to a fairly poor image depending on how well we exposed it etc. The key thing is that the image was processed. The camera manufacturer sets a conservative middling processing set of algorithms and it is sort of a miracle that an image appears. but because that happens so quickly, it has confused people and some people do not realize that the image was edited/processed by the camera. Or you can process it yourself and be much more precise in the editing/processing of the digital capture. But the sweetest, most sophisticated processing/editing does not mean anything at all if the subject matter is mediocre or worse. So to answer your question directly there is no amount of editing/processing that can make a poorly thought out image into anything \u2018good.\u2019 It all starts before you turn the camera on. One has to be clear in what one is taking a picture of. What is the story that one is telling and is this the best way to tell that story? The most demanding question that we can ask ourselves is \u201cWhat is the purpose/point/story of this image?\u201d And if you can just glibly state it without a great deal of thought it is almost a certitude that you have not given it enough thought. Good photography is about 95% the thought before the camera is turned on. The other 5% is completing the thought and processing the image to achieve your vision. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not always. There are many photographers who take amazing shots and don\u2019t even open it in Photoshop. Then there are those who take ok shots and edit them to perfection (if possible). Compare these two images:   Which one do you think was photoshopped? If you think the first one, then you\u2019re wrong. The second one was. They are both good though. It usually depends on how skilled the photographer is. ",
