            "answer_text": "I would say Yes and No. Why yes ? Because I like when someone gets the benefit of my answer and as a thank you i get money from Quora. Why no? It's a no because I don't need money writing answers to questions which are completely irrelevant in the Quora platform. Nowadays the trends on quora are getting out of the box. Asking personal questions related to somebody's else life or posting some random girls pic to gain more attention is not at all needed here. And when matter of money comes, it's completely worthless to pay for those type of answers who are just trying to gain more followers or views just by posting censored pics. It's basically like you are selling your pictures for money. These matters are never too old on quora and even quora promotes it whereas a good content from a writer never gets viral. Wait viral? I think there are few chosen people who have been hardworking by sharing their knowledge and thoughts and never came across this word in their whole Quora experience. While in contrary there's a fake account with a fake dp of a girl answers some random emotional drama question and gets viral. I really appreciate if Quora starts giving money to answer really good questions, but before that first let Quora atleast start recognising that type of writers who really must be awarded. Just before i hit submit let me just clarify myself. I am new to Quora, and I have only a few hundreds of views on my contents and let's not talk about upvotes. So I don't have anything to brag about myself here. But the answer here is just my honest opinion about what my recent days have been on this platform and going through various of other writers on what are their views about this platform being misused. I may have to regret in near future for being honest, but atleast i will be happy that I am supporting for the good cause here. People may start saying that I am being insecure here, but the matter is not about being insecure or blaming someone. It's just that the type of irrelevant answers are like nepotism in bollywood. They don't succeed nor will they support good contents to become successful. Hope I have not offended anyone by this answer. And if you also agree with me on the above mentioned grievance please try to encourage the good writers and make Quora a better platform. Thank You. :) ",
