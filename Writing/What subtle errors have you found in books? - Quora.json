            "answer_text": "Question: What subtle errors have you found in books? Here we go another opportunity to bash the Jack Reacher series of novels. Let\u2019s see: Jack Reacher rides across the country on buses - The major bus lines only stop in cities larger than 50k, unless there\u2019s a military installation, a Native American reservation or a very popular tourist destination nearby. They no longer stop in small towns and they haven\u2019t for some time. Even the private bus lines only travel between major cities or to specific destinations like casinos or resorts.Jack Reacher buys clothes from secondhand or discount stores - The character is described to be a hulking man of six feet five inches in height. Not only would he have difficulty finding clothing in secondhand stores, he would do in many regular departments of which there are not very many (besides Wal*Mart) in too many places throughout much of the United States.Reacher stays at small, out of the way, motels - The author has clearly never stayed in those types of places in the United States, as most are very dangerous locations even in the best of times. The majority have seen far better days and now mainly house people who are one step above homelessness, transient workers, and people who make their living committing some sort of criminal offenses.It\u2019s clear that while the author may currently live in the United States (New York City to be exact) that he did most of his \u201cresearch\u201d using an atlas and by reading newspaper articles. Here\u2019s one that escaped me for many years until I became an adult: Don Pendleton\u2019s Mack Bolan- The Executioner series of novels frequently had the character using particular rifles for long distance shooting. Those included a .44 Magnum lever action and a .45\u201370 Government model. Neither weapon is particularly good for distance shooting ( I own a .45\u201370) and any knowledgeable shooter would have used something much different. It\u2019s clear that while Pendleton (when he was alive) could write gripping narratives, he was less successful when it came to identifying the correct \u201ctools for the job\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "My all time favorite is from John Baxter\u2019s The Black Yacht (1982), a thriller set in the world of high-stakes sailboat racing (now there\u2019s a niche genre!). At one point a character is on the water with a small, one-person high-performance sailboat called a Laser. He is, for reasons I\u2019ve long since forgotten, trying to be stealthy and inconspicuous, so he has the boat floating on its side (as if he\u2019s capsized) and is treading water alongside it. The moment at which he wants to take action comes, so he flips the boat upright, hoists the sail, and . . . Um . . . no. One of the quirks of the Laser is that the sail has a sleeve sewn into the leading edge, into which you slide the mast before setting the base of the mast into a socket molded into the deck of the boat. There\u2019s literally no way to raise (or lower) the sail on a Laser without shipping (or unshipping) the entire mast, something that\u2019s impossible to do if you and the boat are at sea. This is my gold standard for \u201csubtle error:\u201d It looks completely normal to 99.99% of readers, but that to the other 0.01%\u2014in this case, those who have actually sailed a Laser\u2014it\u2019s as jarring as a red ace of spades.  Honorable Mention: The scene in The Runaway Jury where John Grisham has two characters sitting at the counter at a Waffle House restaurant [a chain so ubiquitous in the American South that its unofficial slogan could be: \u201cIf you can\u2019t find one, you deserve to starve\u201d], and scarfing down pancakes. Waffle House offers (nearly) every classic American combination of fat, salt, and carbohydrates that a hungry diner might want for breakfast. They do things with hash browns that nature never imagined. You can get (almost) anything in the diner-food universe that you want there. There is, however, one exception. They don\u2019t serve pancakes There are currently 77 Waffle House locations in the State of Mississippi, to which Grisham\u2019s family moved when he was four. That he could have reached adulthood believing in some bizarre alternate universe filled with pancake-peddling Waffle Houses beggars belief. And yet . . . But never mind: The Runaway Jury is, inexplicable pancakes notwithstanding, my favorite Grisham novel. Also: I\u2019m now irrationally hungry for a plate-sized pecan waffle doused in cheap maple syrup. ",
