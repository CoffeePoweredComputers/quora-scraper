            "answer_text": "Essay writing after thiking is important.Their own consciousness and thoughts and basic perception today are damaged in the present mode of education.They have to contend with basic contradictions.Please read below. Emotional Alienation We train the kids to be spectators and not as participants in nature as part of nature.They breathe and automatically smell.But we have polluted everything so much that they no longer can http://sense.In fact they cannot even breathe healthily and so they fail even to smell.We maimed them from the natural process of breathing,smelling,sensing,perceiving,understanding,interacting,harmonizing,rapturing,cooperating,and coordinating by mutilating nature. And we teach them that matter can neither be created nor destroyed.When matter cannot be created, at all then how is there any matter at all?And then we drill that matter can be either solid,liquid,gas or plasma.Then under what heading does consciousness be put?We just do not even bother to mention consciousness. We know that in vacuum or in the space in super positional waves,conscious notice creates matter,or may be matter begins creating consciousness as space-time.at the ultimate fundamental level of sub atomic particles and vacuum,it is consciousness that always is the only subject matter.But we just ignore consciousness and the kids are not taught at all. When matter is created it automatically becomes subject to Thermodynamics or the changes in heat.Heat means the movement of atoms or molecules.I do not know whether there is a subject that deals with the relationship,between Thermodynamics and Consciousness dynamics and also tension dynamics.But definitely we do not touch the points relating to the effects of Thermodynamics with the dynamics of consciousness and perception. In space in super positional waves,it is notice by consciousness that creates http://matter.So automatically there must be the creation of Thermodynamics,or the movement of atoms and molecules,all the results of notice by consciousness. We do not teach the kids consciousness at all. YM ",
