            "answer_text": "For a correct and formal letter, put the recipient\u2019s name in the upper left part of the page and put it in full, such as: James Fanning Esq., or Mr J. Fanning, (Never write \u2018Mr James \u2026\u2019 and never use Mr and Esq. It's one or the other.) then, immediately below, put the recipient\u2019s full address, including postcode. For a really formal letter (for example, to a judge) begin the letter with the word Sir, followed by a comma. Or if to a woman, Madam. Then, if it's a legal or serious business letter, put the topic of the letter on its own line in underlined capitals. Then get on with the matter you\u2019re writing about. For a somewhat less formal letter, put the name and address as before but begin with Dear Sir, (with a comma) or Dear Madam, (with a comma) and then begin the letter on a new line with a capital letter to start. Slightly less formal again would be to use the recipient's title and surname, e.g., Dear Mr Fanning, If you begin with Dear Sir or Dear Madam, you should sign off with Yours faithfully, (with a comma) and then your signature. If you use the person\u2019s name (e.g. Mrs Fanning), then you should sign off with Yours sincerely. I would never begin a formal letter with the word Greetings. It sounds as though you lack the nerve to write formally and suggests a salesmanlike intention to persuade. ",

Addresses: 1) Your AddressThe return address should be written in the top right-hand corner of the letter. 2) The Address of the person you are writing toThe inside address should be written on the left, starting below your address. Date: Different people put the date on different sides of the page. You can write this on the right or the left on the line after the address you are writing to. Write the month as a word. Salutation or greeting: 1) Dear Sir or Madam,If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use this. It is always advisable to try to find out a name. 2) Dear Mr Jenkins,If you know the name, use the title (Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms, Dr, etc.) and the surname only. If you are writing to a woman and do not know if she uses Mrs or Miss, you can use Ms, which is for married and single women.
