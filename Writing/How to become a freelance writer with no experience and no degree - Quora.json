            "answer_text": "Edit: I am certain that when I started writing my answer, the question was \u201cHow do I become a free lance writer with no experience and no degree?\u201d I answered with that question in mind but the question has changed slightly, making my answer more ridiculous than it already was. \u2014\u2014\u2014 Frig. You meant \u2018freelance\u2019. Seriously, writing in a blog is a good way to get experience. If you ever get readers who aren\u2019t your mom - I\u2019m describing my own experiences here, not attacking your social network - they can leave useful comments. Some might be smart-assed ones like mine above [edited: now below], but others would engage in your subjects of interest. Heck. Answer questions here at Quora. I try to offer real assistance in answering questions, even if I get a little silly as I did here. And most commenters want to help. I think a degree in writing or journalism would be useful but not required. If you went for a degree in one of those fields, you should also try to learn a little something about fields that interest you. Writers with a degree in journalism but with no science background frequently mess up their reporting of stories with a lot of science in them. In my opinion, most degree programs require you to write, so if you want to write about fashion, you would be better off studying fashion at college than studying writing. At the same time, to graduate from high school also requires a lot of writing. If you are a high school graduate and paid a little attention in English class, you should be able to write. Learn about a subject, then write about it. After you have written, let\u2019s say ten* articles or blog posts, then think about trying to sell your work. \u2014 *More likely, you will need to write 100 or 1000 articles or blog posts before your writing is good enough to sell. Still, you will also need experience in promoting and selling your work so start that early.  My original answer started with: Well, you say you have no experience, but maybe you should expand on this point a little. Do you have no (or little) experience in writing or in using a lance? If you don\u2019t know about lances, why would you want to write about them, for free or for money? I personally write a blog about my experiences in Gangwon Province, South Korea and all that material is free. Starting a blog is a good first step. I could not find an article devoted to jousting but I did find this: Competitive Jousting Article Published in Andalusian Magazine. I suspect that other equestrian-themed magazines might have interest in lances and such. Medieval historians and magazines or journals devoted to that subject might as well. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need a degree or experience to become a freelance writer. You just need to be a good writer. I\u2019m a freelance direct response copywriter. My mentor never finished high school. But he makes millions a year writing sales copy. I also know one writer who took the copywriting world by storm while he was still in high school. Honestly, my clients don\u2019t care about my marketing degree. All they care about is: Can I write copy that will sell their product or service. That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know what kind of freelance writing you want to do. So, it\u2019s hard to give you specific advice. But, to be a successful freelancer, you need to develop the skills required in the field you are pursuing. For example, copywriting is a learned skill. You don\u2019t just wake up one day and start writing copy. You have to learn how to write it. After you know your stuff, you need to start finding clients. And keep finding clients. Freelancing is tough. It takes time to get a freelance business off the ground. And you need to always be actively recruiting new clients if you want to have a steady flow of projects and income. ",
