Can I use \u201cfor\u201d in this sentence instead of \u201cagainst\u201d? The question is invalid as you do not use \u201cagainst\u201d in the sentence so you cannot replace it with \u201cfor\u201d. (I think you meant them the other way round.) It is also two sentences, not one. The second sentence is ungrammatical. It should read \u201cI will probably\u201d. That being said, it does not say what the \u201cthis\u201d is. Is it making the choice, or, stating your choice? Getting back to the original question, it is probably best left as \u201cfor\u201d as \u201cagainst\u201d might be less clear. (Funny how for and against are often opposites but not in this case.) Finally I would like to say that \u2018easier\u2019 does not mean \u2018better\u2019. You probably have family and friends. They sometimes bring you unwanted complications. It would probably be easier without them in your life too, but given the choice, you would choose to have them in your life. ",

Can I use \u201cfor\u201d in this sentence instead of \u201cagainst\u201d? For is correct, as we understand it to mean \u2018for the decision\u2019. I have made a correction to the first sentence. \u2018My life is much easier without pets. I know I will probably end up getting a lot of backlash for this.\u2019 ",
