            "answer_text": "You will first have to search for sites that accept guest posts. You can do this by typing \u2018keyword\u2019 + guest post in google. Make a list of suitable sites. Go through their guest posting submission guidelines. Go through their website content and look for a gap in the content. Write your content to fill this gap. Pitch your topic to the correct person at the website, it helps if you can find the name of the relevant person. Try to build a personal connection with this person. Introduce yourself properly. Tell them who you are and why you are reaching out to them. Your pitch should be more about how publishing your content will benefit them and not about you. Also be sure that you have followed the guidelines and submit your post accordingly. Wait for their response. If after 4\u20135 days you have not received a reply follow up asking for an update. Rinse and repeat. Good Luck. PS: Make sure your pitch is not too lengthy and always check for grammatical errors. ",
