            "answer_text": "I agree with Sam Dornan\u2026.you have to define who the character is before you can name them. Keep in mind speed came have many forms. Does she just run fast or can she do everything at superspeed? Is the power really speed based (I.e. Quicksilver) or is it somehow time based (I.e. Velocidad from Avengers Academy)? Background, personality quirks, and any demographic can influence what her name is and in the long run can always influence how her powers work and evolve as you write her. I suggest writing up an origin story or profile of some type and then go through it again and see what's missing then write it again. Make her a fully realized person woth a life and family and friends and problems and then see if that helps with the name ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the other posters who have said this isn't enough to go on. The personality of the character (or her hero persona) would make the naming easier. For instance, The Flash is a generic name that says something about his powers, but nothing about him. \"Impulse\", on the other hand, speaks volumes about the character AND his powers. I tend to name characters by their personality or what they symbolize. ",
