I admire a lot of intelligent people, read a lot, was taught well by my parents, and got some good education from the schools they sent me to. Since I love to speak my mind\u2026\u2026sometimes it gets me into trouble, because others confuse right from wrong, and as I got older, I learned that black is black and white is white\u2026.you just don't throw caution to the wind and interchange the two\u2026..I just do my best to express my thoughts. Who knows, maybe one day I can come up with a helpful book or blog for those who want to write something enlightening? It's all about balanced points of view on a particular topic. Have you read the input of Robert T. Wagner here? Admirable! I got inspired more by the way he writes! Simply surround yourself with such people, and before you know it, you get better at it. Constantly learning from others, you become a better person, a better writer. ",

Later I took that trilogy apart, put it back together, and turned it into two standalone novels, which both came out in 2017 from big publishers. It was unpublishable \u2026 but it had good stuff in it. Writing it taught me how to write ",
