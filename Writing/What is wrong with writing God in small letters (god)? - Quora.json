            "answer_text": "The two words, God and god, are different words with different meanings. The word god is a regular noun, like deity, entity, being, and lemon. It refers to a member of a class of supernatural beings which are pervasive forces in the universe, and for the most part, includes beings the person using the word does not believe exists The word God is a name, like naming your dog Dog. It refers to a specific god, namely the one from the Abrahamic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Mormon, and a handful of obscure others. If you\u2019re talking about Thor, then you use god. If you\u2019re talking about Yahweh, Jehovah, Jesus, Allah etc, you use God. So, that\u2019s a start on what\u2019s wrong with it. It\u2019s very likely ungrammatical, the cases where you would build your sentence the same using a specific name and a general noun aren\u2019t all that common. But there\u2019s a bigger point here. The problem is that using the two terms interchangeably leads to logical errors, sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally, but at any rate, you end up saying things that look logical, that sound correct when you say them out loud, but which don\u2019t actually follow, visibly so if you use the right capitalization, not so if you use the terms willy-nilly. For example: When I say god, I mean the force that binds us all together, love. You do believe in love don\u2019t you? Now, that\u2019s something I could agree with. I mean, it\u2019s an odd use of the word, but I do believe it exists, and if calling it \u201cgod\u201d makes sense to you, fine, we both believe in that kind of \u201cgod\u201d. But then you say \u201cSo you should come to church with me tomorrow and accept god into your heart\u201d\u2026 and by that you mean God, as in Jesus, Father, Holy Ghost, as in the deity who wants to be praised because after he slaughtered all but 8 humans he made a rainbow\u2026 not some vague non-athropomorophised feeling of love and brotherhood, but a very specific, and very evil, fictional entity. It\u2019s like getting me to agree that \u201cTom\u201d as in Tom Hiddleston, is a great actor, and then asking me to put \u201cTom,\u201d as in Tom Arnold, in my next movie. Look, just because I like one Tom doesn\u2019t mean I like the other. Similarly, you can talk all you want about gods, but don\u2019t confuse them with God. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing wrong with not capitalizing the word \u201cgod\u201d in certain contexts. Being an atheist, I have used the un-capitalized version many times, although it is best to refer to \u201cGod\u201d as the Judeo-Christian/Islamic god/deity to avoid having to deal with this dilemma. Whether to capitalize the word or not can get pretty tricky, since not all people believe in the monotheistic, all-knowing god that comes from the Bible. My rule of thumb for this goes as follows: In some contexts, \u201cGod\u201d can be referred to as if it was any other name, since it is a proper noun. Example: God is nice. Just like how you would say \u201cJoe is nice\u201d or \u201cHe is nice.\u201d However, I try to avoid this form as much as possible because it indicates that the person writing the sentence acknowledges that there is one, all-knowing god, and that this god should be respected by capitalizing its name as \u201cGod\u201d. In other contexts, \u201cGod\u201d does not not have to be capitalized, such as in my former sentence when I said \u201cnot all people believe in the monotheistic, all-knowing god that comes from the Bible\u201d. This is because in this context, \u201cGod\u201d is not a proper noun and can be treated like any other noun. We know this because it can be interchanged with the word \u201cdeity\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d. I remember a few years ago I asked my English teacher (who was very religious since I went to a private Catholic high school) the same question and he said that it is ultimately a personal choice, although most people who speak the English language capatalize the word \u201cgod\u201d because that is traditionally how it has been written. Keep in mind that Christianity is the world\u2019s largest religion, and since English is the most dominant language in the Western world, many people choose to write it as \u201cGod\u201d as a sign of reverence. However, it is important to take note of the grammatical context, since writing \u201cgod\u201d can be grammatically incorrect if you are using it as a proper noun. ",

It is a Christian conceit that there are no other gods but their god (they\u2019re only off by one) so they choose to call their god, \u201cGod.\u201d That makes it a proper name and subject to capitalization. But Christians see the capitalization as a mark of respect, rather than a matter of grammar. They also capitalize He, His, and Him, when referring to their god, although these are pronouns and do not require capital letters. I use lower case g for god, and when referring to the Christian god, I call it \u201cthe Christian god,\u201d or \u201cthe god called \u2018God.\u2019\u201d ",

Some will claim that God is a name, or even a nickname and should be capitalized. I would disagree. \u201cGod\u201d is a descriptive term, a qualifier, and one not well defined at that. My experience is that it's usually invoked as a generic name by people who haven't clearly defined their god or god's, which often leads to confusion in discussions, even on Quora. It's much more informative to speak of Jesus, Allah, the Trinity, etc. than to say, \u201cdo you believe in God?\u201d My feeling has always been, if you don't have a definition of your god clear enough to explain to a child, you probably shouldn't try.

At least in the case of Christianity, not capializing is an insulting action. It is specifically disrespecting the belief in yhe deity. To a great degree it is politically incorrect. It is like using a known term of derision when you know that it is not how the reader prefers to see it. As a Christian, when I speak of God, I am trying to be respectful. But as a Christian, I do not recognize the god of the modern american evangelical christian church. The god of white people, the god of prosperity, the god of oppressing and fearing people from other countries, the god who thinks poor people are lazy and get what they deserve. So when talking about these christans and their god, I want to make a distinction. ",

Capital letters are simply used to help make our writing easier to understand. It\u2019s a bit like punctuation. In the case of \u2018God\u2019 the capital would only be used to show it is a name. For example, the name Thor would normally be capitalised. Where a personal name is not available, but a singular god is referred to, then people typically use the capital to indicate that it is that singular god being referred to. I hope this has helped. Even Quora moderation agree with this assessment, as can be seen in the screenshot below.   ",

Humans invented writing god with upper case letter. God himself doesn\u2019t care for that. I remember myself, when I was young. In school they taught us strictly to write the upper case letter when writing god. It was part of putting fear in our minds when it comes to worshiping common religion. In my country they do that to every child. And I must admit, even now, I\u2019m afraid to write \u201cgod\u201d and in a second I think about school and what they taught us. So, write as you want, without fear. ",

Anyways, nothing bad will happen to you, but regardless if you are religious or not, it\u2019s basically to be respectful of another one\u2019s god, and use the correct \u201cspelling\u201d. And I mean respectful to those respecting you (Golden Rule idea), but sadly, when religion is involved in the conversation, it usually means someone attacks another for not believing in their god. And as of today\u2019s stats, the Christians are far into the lead of kills, rapes, tortures, slaves, etc etc etc Anyways, obviuosly I am atheist, and I won\u2019t die for writing \u201cGod\u201d, but doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m referring to the Christian one\u2026 though most feel it \u201cbelongs\u201d to their god, of course.
