            "answer_text": "Sorry, this is a Monday so you get the mean answer. Way the heck too early to worry about that. You haven\u2019t written it. At the end of NaNoWriMo you still won\u2019t have written it. NaNoWriMo goal is 50,000 words and that barely gets you through the gate of YA (typical lower limit there is 60K). Plus, you know, editing. Thing is, even if this isn\u2019t your first time at the ball you are going to learn quite a bit as you go. Among the things you may learn is that you can\u2019t write suspense but you really like comedy. Or that you are better at short stories. Or that you accidentally started a trilogy, not a stand-alone. You don\u2019t know what kind of book you have yet. So wait. The time to start shopping publishers is when you at least have that draft done. Okay, okay \u2014 if you are mercenary to want to write to order you can research and see what is popular this month. It isn\u2019t the greatest prediction for what will be popular by the time you are ready to submit, but at least you can find out that Dinosaur Romance stories are done and over with and you are better off not starting one at all. So market research? Grudgingly, I say yes, do it. But finding a publisher? Wait. ",

            "answer_text": "This November I am writing a novel (NaNoWriMo), No, you\u2019re writing 50,000 words as fast as you can. That\u2019s not a novel. You\u2019ll need a minimum of 80,000 words to be classed as a novel. It will need to be carefully crafted and pleasant to read. any tips on choosing publishers to distribute my manuscript? Hah hahahhah hahahahahah hahahaha haaaaa. Publishers have strict rules on even getting them to read your stuff. I\u2019ll be surprised if you can get someone to read it, never mind publish it. Not only will whatever you\u2019ve written be terrible, but it\u2019s also likely to be almost unreadable. At best it\u2019ll be a first draft, at worst it\u2019ll be quickly written garbage. You need to edit and refine your work a few times before you let anyone else even read it. Is it based on genre or is it just as simple as googling? Google will help you to find all of the specifics of getting publishers to read your first draft. There are several stages after that including editing and formatting. A note of warning: There are lots of people who will try to get you to pay money to get your work published. If it\u2019s costing you money then it\u2019s a con. Don\u2019t do it. Good luck :) ",
