            "answer_text": "I\u2019m more a playwright than I am a writer of prose fiction. But then your average play is more dialogue-based than just about anything you\u2019re likely to read. Here are a few things I\u2019ve learned. Real people don\u2019t always say the right thing. Ironically, one sign of poor dialogue (if you\u2019re trying to be realistic, at least) is a certain excess of cleverness. Even the most charismatic speakers are imperfect if you listen critically. The most confident people get tongue-tied. The most talkative people can be stunned into silence. Implausibly witty banter is a symptom of implausibly perfect characters. It\u2019s not that your characters can\u2019t be smart or articulate. But they should sound human. Real people don\u2019t always say what they mean. Another sign of poor dialogue is the absence of subtext \u2014 characters who only seem to speak to tell us what they\u2019re thinking and feeling. It\u2019s not that every line needs to drip with subtext, but think about it: how often do people tell you what\u2019s really going on in their heads? What they really want? Your co-worker might desperately confess his love for you in a fit of pique, but if he\u2019s sane he already tried telling you a hundred different ways before actually telling you. Real people only speak when they want something. Even if they just want to hear the sound of their own voice. If you know what your character wants, you\u2019ll know what she needs to say \u2014 or not say \u2014 to get it. If your character is talking but she doesn\u2019t seem to want anything then why the fuck is she talking? Real people play many roles. Do you speak to your uncle the same way you speak to your lover? Unless you\u2019re fucking your uncle, probably not. We all play many roles as we navigate the world, and we all try to adapt ourselves to thrive in those roles. A generally nasty, arrogant person may suddenly become a saint when her grandmother shows up. Remember: your character is also an actor. Don\u2019t be too real. Human speech is a lot less fluent and coherent than we like to imagine. We make little detours, we trail off, we cough, we mumble, we stumble, we misuse words, we repeat ourselves. We\u2019re a mess. But writing dialogue is an art: it entails creating a stylized version of the truth. So go easy on um and er and ... There\u2019s a fine line between realism and real life. ",

            "answer_text": "I see a lot of \u2018said is dead\u2019 discourse going on in the answers. \u2018Stop using said\u2019 is one of the first things English teachers try to enforce in order to inspire better dialogue. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also completely misguided. Let me give you an example. \u201cHello,\u201d I said. \u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cGreat weather today,\u201d I said. \u201cI prefer rain,\u201d she said. Very flat, boring dialogue. Let\u2019s try the said is dead method. \u201cHello,\u201d I muttered. \u201cHi,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGreat weather today,\u201d I declared. \u201cI prefer rain,\u201d she groaned. Still flat and boring, with an extra dose of awkward. Now let\u2019s try something different. \u201cHello,\u201d I said, sidling up to the girl at the bus stop, my hands in my pockets. I cleared my throat, trying to steady my nerves. \u201cHi,\u201d she replied, not looking at me, but staring down at her phone. As I moved closer, she took a step away. \u201cGreat weather today,\u201d I said, my voice breaking. I cleared my throat again, feeling the heat of embarrassment creep up the back of my neck. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of, uh, clouds?\u201d She looked up at me briefly, her stare flat and unimpressed, the slightest curl of disdain in her lip. Without breaking eye contact, she turned off her phone and shoved it into her pocket. \u201cI prefer rain.\u201d She turned her back on me and hurried away down the street, in the direction of the next nearest bus stop, nearly a block away. The problem which \u2018said is dead\u2019 tries and fails to address is the problem of flat, repetitive dialogue that doesn't convey anything except a script of what\u2019s being said. A much more effective way to fix boring dialogue is to break it up with description that enhances your story, makes it easier for your readers to visualize what\u2019s happening, and communicates something about the characters and setting. Describe how they say what they\u2019re saying, what they\u2019re doing when they say it, and try to communicate how they feel about what they\u2019re saying. Here\u2019s an example with three people saying the same line in a different way. \u201cI hate Mondays,\u201d he said, hunching his shoulders and kicking at the gravel like a petulant teenager. \u201cI hate Mondays,\u201d she said with a grin and a wink, and reached for another slice of lasagna. \u201cI hate Mondays,\u201d he said, voice distant, his attention focused on the paperwork he was shuffling through. If the line was just \u201cI hate Mondays\u201d he said, it communicates much less. By elaborating on their actions as they speak, you get vital context on how they actually feel about it. Varying your sentence structure is another way to improve flow. See how in the bus stop example it isn\u2019t just \u2018\u201cwords\u201d he said.\u2019 But also \u2018\u201cwords,\u201d he said, \u201cand more words\u201d\u2019 and also occasionally omitting the dialogue tag entirely when it\u2019s obvious who\u2019s speaking. Mixing it up like this keeps your dialogue more dynamic and interesting to read. A few other dialogue tips- Finding your character\u2019s voices is important to making sure they don\u2019t all sound like the same person. Try to have an idea of each character\u2019s unique personality, and a general idea of their likes, dislikes, and experiences. Making a small list or breakdown of these traits can help you keep track of them. Are they generally cheerful or stoic? Do they enjoy science fiction, hate big crowds? Did they grow up in the city or out in the country? All of these things color how they view the world and how they interact with other characters. A cheerful sci fi lover might crack pop culture jokes with his friends. A stoic cowboy might use his words sparingly. If the character is from the country, they might have a different idea of what\u2019s polite than a character from the city. Avoid writing accents, stutters or inflections. You can imply an accent or stutter with word choice and other character building details. But actually writing out the accent (dropping letters and spelling words phonetically) tends to come across as a bad stereotype, and frequently kills the mood of whatever scene it happens in. Always be reading. The single best thing you can do for your writing skills, dialogue included, is to keep reading! Try the old classics, try new experimental stuff too. Push yourself to try books that might be out of your skill range or usual wheelhouse. Experiment in other genres. Indulge heavily in your favorites, because that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find the techniques that will help you most, but never be afraid to branch out. I always recommend China Mieville because he\u2019s a master of using language in new and interesting ways. I try to read a chapter every night, and often end up spending my whole day off engrossed in a book. It\u2019s the best thing you can do for yourself as a writer. ",
