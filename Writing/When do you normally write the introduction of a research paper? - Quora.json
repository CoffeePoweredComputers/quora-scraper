            "answer_text": "Best practice dictates that the introduction chapter/section of our research paper be written after you have concluded your research. Proponents of this approach contend that this helps you to align your introduction with the entire research paper including the findings. In practice, though, I have found this approach to be quite constraining and (unnecessarily) complex. Therefore, I created my own generic approach to when I write the introduction. As such, I normally write the introduction section at the beginning of my paper based on literature that I have already surveyed within the domain of my research topic. Based on the findings of my research and any new (important) discoveries, I (can) then revisit my introduction and beef it up or tweak it accordingly. Note: This is my own approach, which I have honed over the years - always liaise with your supervisor and be creative while working on your research paper by treating any rules provided as guidelines that can always be adapted to your research needs.
