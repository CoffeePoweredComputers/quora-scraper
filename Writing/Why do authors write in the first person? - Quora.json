            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t always\u2026 and in fact at one point it was unfashionable to do so. My English teacher even went so far to say that first person was lazy writing that should not be seen in a professionally published novel. However, this was the 80s and things have changed since then. And, in fact, she was wrong because there are many examples of it being used in classical stories (more on that later). Different PoVs and tenses serve different purposes. A writer chooses what to use based on the intended response they want from the reader. For example, it was common for fantasy novels at one point to use omniscient third person - a sort of \u2018top down\u2019 view of what every character is doing all the time. This is the style used by Tolkien but it has largely fallen out of fashion now as most writers use a \u2018tighter\u2019 poV which means you only see what one character sees at a time. First person is just one example of that. So\u2026 the three types we have are: First - written as if the character was telling the story, sometimes done in a way that implies they are speaking to the reader, othertimes as a diary entry or similar. e.g. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated trains which was why it was a surprise that I was getting up at 8am on a misty Sunday to catch the 9.25 to the coast\u2026\u201d Second - written as if the reader is the character and the writer is telling the reader (the character) what they are doing and seeing. I call this the \u2018D&D GM style of writing\u2019 e.g \u201cYou walk down the platform, the steam coalescing around you as you drag your bags towards the first class carriage\u2026\u201d Third - written as if a narrator is talking about other characters, none of them are assumed to be the reader or the writer. e.g \u201cBoris, blearly eyed and in a bad mood because of his early awakening, dragged his bags along the steam shrouded platform towards the first class carriage\u2026\u2019 First and third are common, second is very rare - I can only recall one traditionally published book series that uses it - Charles Stross\u2019s \u2018Halting State\u2019 and \u2018Rule 34\u2019 which touch on elements of gaming and so, stylistically, it actually makes sense to use this style. First person in general allows a more intimate view inside a character\u2019s head than third can ever provide as well as allowing the author to develop both the character and their voice - mostly because you are writing it in their own dialect and idiom. It is a less formal form of writing with the use of lots of colloquillism and not necessarily strict grammar conventions because speech doesn\u2019t necessarily have those. This may make it sound easier but actually it can be harder because you have to really think about their voice because they will write like that all the time rather than only in dialogue. It can also allow an unreliable narrator concept. Keep the reader in the dark because the character is actually lying about what they did and saw. Or maybe misled themselves. A few good examples (that violate my English teacher\u2019s statement\u2026) Dracula - written as a series of diary entries and audio recordings by the main characters. I often talk about how Harker\u2019s entries early in the book clearly establish him as a very dull man (he literally does the equivilent of post a picture of his dinner to social media by talking in his diary about how he liked a meal and wonders if he can get his fiancee to work out the recipe\u2026) and how each section has a very different voice. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale - written as the memoir of the hero. Uses very garbled english to establish the character having written it in secrecy and in a hurry with no time to edit or review. Pretty much every Lovecraft story. Often ending with the death of the character writing the piece or, at the very least, ending with a line like \u2018we are just going to go investigate the sinister tomb of dreadful deaths\u2019, if we do not return please make sure this account is published\u2026\u2019 1950s detective novels. Robert Rankin parodies this wonderfully with his character Lazlo Woodbine, who always gets written in the first person even if the rest of the scene is third. There is sometimes even a 4th wall breaking comment about this in a \u201cListen Kid, I said to the Kid, let me tell you this now. You can tell I am the main guy in this book because it is written in first person\u2026\u201d way. However, it is well established that this is the style of that genre. The purpose of it was to allow both an unreliable narrator and also to never reveal what the detective looks like - allowing the reader to insert themselves into the narrative more easily. Well, at least the male ones\u2026 And of course it has become a lot more prevalent now, especially in YA. ",

            "answer_text": "First person accounts lend an aspect of reality to even the most far fetched story lines. Some stories come to you as though you were the person they happen to. I had this experience in writing The Kinky Minx Is Missing which is told from the persona of Dr. Frederick (Smitty) Schmidt, presently a successful GP and yoga instructor in a small New York town. The novel is told in flashback to the mid 1980s when Schmidt was a teenager and in love with a girl from a wealthy, mysterious family, who one day disappeared without a trace. In The Kinky Minx Is Missing, Frederick is forced to recall experiences from his past through questions asked of him by his own children. To most of these questions he feels he must avoid giving candid or truthful answers. I could not have achieved the same tension had I written in the third person although the third person would have allowed me to show events happening from the perspectives of other characters. In the first person we are forced to know first hand only what the protagonist knows and experience only what happens to him. This apparent limit, however, also puts the reader in the position of second guessing or interpreting events ahead of the main character. Often in first person narratives the reader can see errors or pitfalls the main character is oblivious to, thus involving the reader with the welfare of the character in a way that is much more profound. For another example, my book, The White Tar Baby, is told in the third person and I could never have ended that book the way I did had it been told in the first person. ",
