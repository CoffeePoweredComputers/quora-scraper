You might learn something about the ability of people to: Surprise youMislead youInternalise or externalise responsibilityAll valuable lessons. Otherwise this could snf should only be fot yourself. I.e. cathartic. To acknowledge your role in the relationship. Perhaps you could: Write a letter to him - blaming himDeception crosses an ethical standard. He should be reproachedDisjointed values displays a lack of integrityLack of commitment or consideration shows a lack of respect and depth of thinking. Bear in mind, the younger the age, the more reason to expect this.Write a letter to you - blaming youYou have some ownership in your decisions. Were you too trusting?Did you give the relationship too much importance? Does he even really know you? Was he even capable of a serious relationship? Given your age (?), could be realistically meet your standards?Did you have reasonable expectations? Are you not young. Do where could it go? Both of you may have more relationships to experience. Maybe he thinks you and him have reasons to find love elsewhereReconcile these lettersWere you realistic?What can be learned?How can you be better tomorrow?Convince yourself there are better people; and worse, and that risk is managed, not avoided. But that managing risk takes research, questions, and analysis. You might be going on a emotional rollercoaster ride; but it ought to be foremost a rational process. He has to earn your respect.Forgive yourself for making mistakes. Being young is tough. There is a lot to learn. A lot of newness to experiences. You will make mistakes. You will want or expect external validation. This is a source of vulnerability. When you are older it will be easier because you will have achieved more in your life so you will be able to self-validate. Be someone, foremost, and let people see that. Dont be chasing love, trying to please others. This is not to say you dont need to strategise. I.e. going to places where you can meet people who share complimentary interests.",

            "answer_text": "Dear Boyfriend, I am writing this to inform you that I am breaking up with you. You cheated on me and that is not something I can ever forgive or forget. Do not call, email, make postal contact, contact me through a third, fourth or fifth party, text (including social media), show up at my home or place of work/education, and stay away from my friends and family members as well. I have ZERO interest in having any contact with you again for the rest of my life and if you do start bothering me, I will file a police report and get a restraining order on you. I do not love you, like you or even want to have you enter my mind ever again. What you did hurt. You violated my trust and you made me out to be a fool. I hope she was worth it, BTW I have already taken the liberty of letting all my friends and your friends and family know about this incident as well as my intentions. I left all your crap on the curb but I should have told you that yesterday as trash pickup day was like four hours ago. LEAVE ME ALONE!!!! I Hate You, Your Ex-Girlfriend PS- I hope you get the clap!
