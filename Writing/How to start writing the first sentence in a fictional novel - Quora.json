            "answer_text": "At your stage, the first sentence hardly matters.  Start writing anywhere.  Or write a deliberately bad first sentence, and go from there.   One of the best things your writing group can do for you is tell you to cut the beginning.  Maybe you'll need to cut one and a half chapters, maybe more.  Richard Kenna (The Sand Pebbles) wrote Part I of his book twice before realizing that Part I was preliminary; it wasn't going to be part of the book.   Find a writing group.  They'll help you a little with grammar.  Grammar isn't that important at first.  Oh, you want to learn grammar, but you don't need people to correct the grammar (except for educational purposes) before the final draft.   When it's as good as you can make it, then you give it to five friends, volunteers, who will read it for you.  That's when you want your grammar corrected.  Which is definitely before you try to involve a publisher.  (Publishers aren't all that easy to come by.  Don't alienate one by sending her a snarl of grammar errors.)   It is not your job to do everything that your writing group and your five friends tell you.  You job as a writer is to listen for the voice that helps.   There's a saying, something like, \"When someone tells you where there's a problem with your story, they're almost always right.  When they tell you how to fix the problem, they're almost always wrong.\" Leonard Bishop (Dare to Be a Great Writer) was once at a writing conference where the keynote speaker said he spent four months getting the first chapter just right, before he would go on to zip thru the rest of the book.   Leonard's response, when he was asked about that, was to dismiss it as absurd.  You're going to learn so much about the book while you write it, that chapter one is going to be obsolete.  You're going to have to rewrite it anyway, so there's no point in investing a lot of time in the first draft.   The same can be said of first sentences.  Just write it and move on.  You'll have better ideas about what to put there when you get back to it later. ",

            "answer_text": "First sentences can be very tricky. often the whole first paragraph will be an issue. I've even had whole first chapters that are not quite right (I'm not alone here even as a fairly \u2018new\u2019 writer). I will often start with a prompt which is an intriguing sentence. That means that in those pieces I didn't even write the first sentence myself. I will agonise over it sometimes and often I will start writing something based on a sentence I thought up that I really liked. Most of the time though I write whatever first comes into my head ready to refine it later. As I mentioned above sometimes you will have problems with the whole first part of your story that need completely redoing. If you have spent hours agonising over the exact first sentence and need to do this you have wasted a lot of time. To get around this I either use prompts, as I said above, or just start writing without thinking about it too much. When you are editing you will inevitably go back and reword the sentence. A sentence you thought perfect when you first started may well not be when you have finished the whole draft anyway. As for the grammar. I would work at it a little but not be put off. Sometimes my grammar is atrocious but I keep going anyway. It is simpler to fix it later. When editing a book people often send it out to people to edit the grammar so as long as you can be understood then you don\u2019t need to worry too much. I have just sent out my novella to some friends who don\u2019t have a very good grasp of grammar. They will be proof reading and giving me feedback for the first big edit. This edit is all about the story (and may include my first line which I quite like). Once you have the story you can do the grammar edit. I am going to be going through and using various checkers such as grammarly to polish it. I am then going to send it to my Mum and my Nan. They both have degrees, and teach, in areas that mean they will be able to grammar edit. I know this through experience. So overall. Don\u2019t fuss over the first sentence too much. Also don\u2019t worry about the grammar until you have the first draft done. Then go through the piece yourself to get all of the errors that you can fix, and then send it out to an editor. After all it is the editors job to edit! ",
