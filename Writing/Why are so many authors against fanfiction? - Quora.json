            "answer_text": "Question: Why are so many authors against fanfiction? I write books. As far as I know, none have yet inspired a work of fanfic, although I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d ever really be able to check. I\u2019m not wanting anyone to write their own Galaxy Games story, but if they were earnest about it, purely as a writing exercise, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it. But that\u2019s just me. When I was first learning the craft of writing, some of my early stories were works of fanfiction. I had no idea yet what I was doing, but had a strong urge to do it, and found a fun shortcut in having a ready-made universe of ready-made characters. My stories were awful, but the process of writing them made me a better author. I shared my work with friends and strangers in online communities of like-minded authors who provided each other with instant feedback, and I can\u2019t stress enough what a useful learning environment this was. A reader can often tell in the opening paragraph when you\u2019ve failed to capture the true essence of James T. Kirk, while they might never detect the same inconsistencies in an original character. Writing in a universe that readers already knew made it possible for me to receive better feedback which, again, made me a better author. But here\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned over the years that might be a helpful way of thinking about this issue\u2026 There have only ever been three basic plots. Or seven. Or thirty-six, depending how you slice them up. There are also no totally original characters, just a limited number of character tropes defined by function. Also, there\u2019s no such thing as an original writing style outside the accepted conventions of genre. The artistry in writing comes from picking and choosing from among this menu while adding hundreds of author-specific details to create a unique reading experience in an intensely personal voice. When it\u2019s done well, the result is a story that could not have been written by anybody else. Some authors feel violated when such an intensely personal creation is taken without permission and used to create some horrible bastardized version, like the fanfic I used to write. But they\u2019d feel just as violated even if it were a really great bastardized version that compromised their vision. It\u2019s entirely reasonable for them to preemptively request that such versions not be made, and intellectual property law is on their side. If you truly consider yourself to be the fan of an author, and if she requests that others not use her original characters and settings in their own writing, what justification could you possibly make in defying such a request?

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really understand fan fiction. And I\u2019ve never read any I actually was able to finish. Those who can write good fan fiction should be writing something original, imo. It seems a total waste of talent to be painting someone else\u2019s wheel, when they can be creating their own. I\u2019m all for encouraging people to write, but write something original! If you can write someone else\u2019s characters in someone else\u2019s universe, and people want to read it, you can take all of that, and put it into your own universe, and make the characters your own. What I see of arguments here on Quora, stemming from fan fiction, is truly distressing. And the line between canon and fanfic is often distorted so badly, people can no longer tell what is original, and what is not. The story is the story. Period. For me, if someone has a great idea for expanding on the story, pitch the author an idea. They may be happy to co-author. A raw story can still become a great book, if the fan can let go of their own ego, and let the author hone and polish it. Not all authors want to do this. But its a growing thing now, especially with those authors building a universe. We have too many ideas, and not enough time to write them, and anyone with enough raw skill to craft a decent story, can become an asset to the universe. And here\u2019s the thing, I see a lot of fanfic taking characters in a direction the author never wanted to go, and would never agree with, BUT the same story with brand new characters, set in the same universe, doing something else, becomes an expansion of the universe. So why write fanfic and remain lost in a universe not your own making, when you can join some universes properly, or invent your own? To me its a no brainer, but then, as I said, I dont understand fanfic.  Edit: 2020: Another reason for authors not liking fan fiction surfaces on Quora periodically. Fan fiction authors accusing the original authors of stealing their ideas and characters. The sad reality is, author\u2019s can\u2019t afford to read fan fiction anymore, because the only defense against these sort of claims is never reading any fan fiction, so can\u2019t have stolen anything. Fan fiction is often following on from some detail or issue which wasn\u2019t covered fully or to a resolution in an author written book. But just because it wasn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t mean the author was not planning to go there anyway, and that what the author would write might be very close to what a fan might write. So the only way of preventing fan claims that they wrote it first, is not to read fan fiction at all. ",
