            "answer_text": "Here is a great answer for your question:  To begin with, the manufacture of genuine casino chips (known in the trade as \"checks\") is more complicated than one might think \u2013 as you suspect, they're not just discs of colored plastic. They are created, machined, and finished using very specialized equipment, and generally feature several antifraud measures ranging from serial numbers to embedded microchips, as well as each individual casino\u2019s own logo and related branding. Casino chip production is handled by the security printing industry, which also makes things like checkbooks and credit cards. Every stage of manufacture, from the sourcing of raw materials to the delivery of the finished goods, is governed by strict security checks and protocols. Trying to create counterfeit chips that are a perfect match for the real thing, in terms of appearance, weight, and feel, is more or less impossible, even before you start worrying about microchips and suchlike. But let\u2019s say you somehow manage to produce counterfeit chips indistinguishable from those used at Cecil\u2019s Lucky Horseshoe Casino and smuggle them into the house. This still isn\u2019t going to do you much good. If you just walk up to the cashier\u2019s window and try to convert your chips into currency, the casino will immediately wonder where you got them, given that you haven't been seen playing at any of the tables. If you sit down and play a few games first, whether cards or roulette or anything else, there comes a point when you'll have to add your fake chips to whatever stash has come your way legitimately. Think about this. You are literally surrounded by live surveillance cameras, and you've got trained security officers and professional croupiers watching your every move. How are you going to get the fake chips on the table? And even if your sleight-of-hand skills are such that you're able to do it, you're still not going to have an easy time at the cashier\u2019s window. If you're cashing a lot of high-value chips, the casino is going to find you interesting, and that\u2019s not good for you. They may even invite you to step into a back room for a quiet chat about your luck and the chips you've just attempted to cash. Good luck with that.  Other measures also include RFID chips embedded inside of the casino chips, especially the high-value ones.

Counterfeits and forgeries are not difficult for skilled artisans with the proper equipment. Passing the goods is where the problem comes in. Casinos know how many chips they have (and where they are). They count the chips everyday, several times a day. High value chips are tracked carefully.

Making counterfeits is easy. Cashing the counterfeits is hard. Added (Jan 2018): Nevada regulations allow casinos to seize chips if the casino \"knows or reasonably should know\" that the chips weren't obtained in the course of gambling by the individual presenting them. The little-known rule, intended to protect casinos against theft, counterfeit and other types of fraud, allows cage supervisors to keep the questionable chip while they investigate its origin.
