It\u2019s been more than five years since we moved in together, making a place for both of us that was truly a home because it was where we lived TOGETHER. And now, it\u2019s been almost a year since you put a ring on my finger and asked me, and I said yes.\u201d \u201cWith this one ring, I thee wed, with this one ring I give you my love and devotion, with this one ring that binds us together as long as we both shall live.\u201d \u201cAs you are the Moon of his life, he shall be your Sun and Stars. Your love shall be as ever-present as those two celestial bodies\u2026even though they are sometimes hidden from one another\u2019s sight. Your love will be the guiding force that charts the course of your tomorrows, holds your world together in difficult times, and will make life itself shine bolder and brighter than we human beings have a right to dream of.\u201d ",
