            "answer_text": "Under the definitions used by several awards, a story becomes a novel when it\u2019s more than 40,000 words in length. However, the old pulp magazines would sometimes advertise stories as \u201cFull-length novel complete in this issue!\u201d when they were as short as 20,000 words, which would be considered a novella now. And if you want to sell a story as an adult novel nowadays, you need at least 60,000 words and probably 80,000. Technically, to be a novel, a story must also have the right structure \u2014 a complete character arc for one or more characters, building to a climax and resolution of the story\u2019s central conflict. Many people don\u2019t worry about that, though. A book can contain several novels, or none; a reference book might have half a million words, but it\u2019s not a novel, while an omnibus might contain three or four complete novels. A certain number of words doesn\u2019t turn a book into a novel; it turns a story into a novel. ",
