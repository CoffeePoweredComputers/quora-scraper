            "answer_text": " Coming straight to the point. It is dead simple to start a blog. It\u2019s as simple as buying a shirt from Amazon. Starting a blog is easy, setting up takes a few easy steps which I\u2019m going to elaborate on here. #1 Get a domain name The domain name is the address of your blog. It\u2019s how people and the search engines will find what you post on your blog before it ranks on the SERPs. If you\u2019re going for a free blog, you don\u2019t need to buy a domain. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not here for a free blog, because if you were, you\u2019d be already having a free blog on BlogSpot or wordpress.com. Buying a domain name is crucial as the whole branding thing will depend on the name of your blog. Choosing a relative domain name is crucial as people will be recognizing the work by the name. If you\u2019re not aware of how to get a name for your blog, use any of the following tools to generate blog names. Namelix (my favorite)NamiumDomain WheelName Fruits\u2026 and there are many more, but these will do the needful.The last thing you wanna do is spend too much time finding the perfect name. Just pick a decent name and make it whatever the worth you want. Facebook doesn\u2019t have any specific meaning, but it\u2019s worth billions. Once you pick a name, out of all the registrars, I\u2019d recommend Google Domains. Google domains have the lowest price of all the registrars plus it gives the domain privacy for free. If you\u2019re just starting out, I\u2019d recommend you to opt for a free domain on Bluehost[1]. If you need more than one domain, you can then register the new domains on Google domains. This way, you will not only get one free domain but also save $3-$4 every year for all new domains. #2 Get web hosting Web hosting is the space where all the files of your blog will stay. Web hosting is of great significance as the quality of your blog relies on it. It\u2019s great to host a free blog than investing in cheap web hosting plans. I\u2019m not being biased, but GoDaddy is the worst web hosting provider I\u2019ve ever come across. If you\u2019ve ever used it or have someone hosting their website on GoDaddy, you\u2019d know that I\u2019m not wrong here. Sure, the premium plans might be great but I don\u2019t recommend the beginner plans to anyone. So what are some reliable web hosting service providers, you ask? I\u2019m using Bluehost since 2017 and I haven\u2019t faced any issue since then. Sure, there were my issues due to lack of knowledge of the system, but the customer support is very cooperative. Having said that, here are some quality recommendations in terms of responsiveness, uptime & quality of customer service. BluehostHostgatorSitegroundDreamhostWPEngine (managed wordpress)Kinsta (managed wordpress)Side note: Managed wordpress is a web hosting service provider specialized for running a wordpress script. You don\u2019t have to manage anything about web hosting, security, updates, premium features like SSL, CDN & more, which will be taken care of by the web hosting provider. Since you don\u2019t have to worry about anything other creating awesome content, you\u2019d be paying a bomb of money for such premium wordpress hosting. I have created a guide to help you determine the best wordpress hosting provider that suits your budget and doesn\u2019t break your bank. Feel free to check the guide here[2]. #3 Install WordPress Why wordpress you ask? I say why not? Unless you\u2019re a nerd and want to code the whole website by self or stuck in poor CMS like Squarespace & Wix. WordPress powers over 35% of all the websites that are live on the web right now.  This doesn\u2019t mean you should too. I\u2019m here to recommend, not impose. But I\u2019ll surely try to convince you what\u2019s best for you. If you want complete control of your site.If you want a huge library of plugins that can extend the functionality of your blog.If you want a global community to help you with your issues customizing wordpress.If you want millions of beautifully designed themes to lay on your blog and look appealing,WordPress is the right choice. But if you\u2019re new to blogging, you might have heard of wordpress.com as a free blog provider. However, if you\u2019ve not created a blog on that platform yet, you might not know that creating a free blog on the platform will have wordpress.com as an extension to your blog. If example is your blog name, your blog URL would be example.wordpress.com. That looks unprofessional. Even if making money is all you\u2019re planning to do with the blog, it really looks unprofessional. Furthermore, it isn\u2019t SEO friendly to have that type of URL. It will be dead hard to grow traffic on such a URL from search engines. Sure, you can grow the traffic from other channels like social media but surely not from search engines. And at times when search engines are becoming a synonym of search, it\u2019s a foolish step to not consider SEO. So if you\u2019re serious for your blog (even if the goal is to make money) you should consider a professional setup and that setup begins with having a user-friendly CMS (Content Management System), in this case, WordPress. In case you don\u2019t any idea how wordpress.com is different from wordpress.org then you should definitely check out this free guide[3]. #4 Setting up Wordpress If you don\u2019t have any technical bone, you wouldn\u2019t find this part sweet, but this is a one-time effort (in most cases if you don\u2019t make any major changes). However, you will need to keep changing certain things for better performance like permalinks, certain admin settings, managing blog posts, etc. There are a lot of things you should do after you install wordpress, but I will list a few here that are the most important. Delete unwanted & sample posts/pages: If you install a theme from any sources, there are chances that you\u2019d get demo content installed along with it. It comes with sample posts and you need to delete that. Since all the pages get crawled & indexed by the search engines, you don\u2019t want those sample posts.Change permalink structure: As an SEO best practices, you should have a clean URL structure for the best user experience. By clean I mean readable URL that gives a clear idea to the end-user about the page.Update ping list: Ping list are the services that notify search engines when there\u2019s a new post. By default, there are only two services listed in the ping list, you need to update the list from here.Install SEO plugin: I don\u2019t recommend this if you already understand how SEO works, but if you need a helping hand in getting started with SEO, installing a plugin would do that. Out of many such plugins, I\u2019d suggest Yoast & All in one SEO pack plugin that is available on wordpress plugin directory.Enable backups: Backups are crucial since there are updates of plugins & wordpress scripts coming every now & then. To keep the data safe, you need to take the backup just to be sure that you don\u2019t lose any content to any update.Note: I have listed 21 things you should do to setup wordpress[4]. Check out the likes of it. #5 Create custom menus Custom menus help the end-users navigate to the most important pages easily. Custom menus also help you bring the most important pages to the vicinity of the web crawler. Creating nested menus will help you club the pages categorically which will enhance the user experience. Though this seems to be insignificant, when you have a high traffic blog, you\u2019ll understand the importance of custom menus. I know this is just a tip of the ice, but this is what all you need to get started. Setting up a blog isn\u2019t hard, maintaining it is. You will have multiple reasons to not work on the idea, but you will have one reason to make it work out. I\u2019ve been there, I know it feels lost when you move to self-hosted wordpress and you\u2019re on own. But you don\u2019t have to worry, wordpress is a vast community of enthusiast participants who\u2019re always on their toes to help you out. You can bring your issue to the wordpress community to get help round the clock. These 5 times steps are 10,000 feet view of what you\u2019ll actually need to do in order to create a blog and trust me, it only gets easier.
