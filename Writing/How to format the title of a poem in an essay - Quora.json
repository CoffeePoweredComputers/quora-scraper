            "answer_text": "Format according to what will work best for your poem. I am not 100% sure about your question but it is reasonable to have your title about 2 points larger and in bold, in comparison to your name and the text of the poem about 2 points, and in regular, to your name. But that is not a standard rule and you can have all same font and size and style and it won\u2019t be wrong. If you are just mentioning the name of the poem in another written piece then you can keep the same font and size and bold it or you can put quotations around the title. Some will use Italics, and again, it all depends on the nature of the essay. ",
