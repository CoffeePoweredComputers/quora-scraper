            "answer_text": "I love that you said \u201cattached\u201d rather than saying likable. Most of my favorite characters are villains, so it is very important to distinguish between likable characters and those the reader wants to see more of in the story and ones they care about. Perhaps the most important thing about character building is that they must be relatable. How do you do that? That\u2019s the secret. It is easy to tell you to make them relatable, but much more difficult to actually do it. I\u2019ve seen many people try and the characters just come out feeling stilted and forced. One method is to let the reader know what the character is thinking and feeling. As human beings we are social creatures, and emotion plays a key role in our interactions with one another. And, because we are isolated within our own minds with our own thoughts, we love to hear how other people think and see the world, especially when that point of view is unique. But, like any good drama, only let slip out what is necessary to move the story forward. You don\u2019t want thoughts and feelings just spilling out willy-nilly. Dole them out just like you would any story element to build tension, character, and story. I know that many people would advocate doing those exhaustive character sheets. It isn\u2019t that I\u2019m against them, but I would advocate only using them as a rough blueprint for your character. They do a good job of forcing you to get into your character\u2019s head and explore their lives a bit. But, when push comes to shove and you\u2019re actually writing your story, don\u2019t let that blueprint force your character to do something that goes against what your gut is telling you. Allow your characters to live dynamically in the world you\u2019re creating. That will keep things organic and help to make them feel more alive. When in doubt, have them risk everything for a child, old person, or small and adorable animal. Works every time. ;) Write on! ",

            "answer_text": "The clue is in the word \u2018character\u2019. Give them character. It\u2019s not a question of making them funny, or physically attractive, or charming. What do they do in a crisis, when they are needed? Do they step up and do their best, or do they run off? The weaker and more scared and more inexperienced a character is, the more appealing they are when they confront their own weaknesses and fears and try to do the right thing. That\u2019s why the hobbits are the heroes of Lord of the Rings. ",
