            "answer_text": "Man, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s almost been a year since I spoke these vows. This is the first time I\u2019ve published \u2018em. They\u2019re a little long, so I\u2019ll break up the text with some photos from the wedding. Oh, and see if you can catch all the Doctor Who references! :)  Amber, My bride. My best friend. My companion. My beautiful Little Pond. Here we are. Finally, and already. Our relationship of contradictions culminates in the greatest contradiction of all: An end, and a beginning.  I\u2019ve written and rewritten these vows times innumerable and I\u2019ve come to a conclusion: No note, ballad, or poem; no word, sentence, or novel could ever capture my love for you. But that\u2019s okay, because I promise you this: I will never stop searching. My love for you will never be expressed in endings or destinations. My love for you will be a search. A journey. An act of wild, reckless, and endless pursuit of the unattainable \u2026 And I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.  I wish I could stand up here and promise you the world, but the world isn\u2019t mine to give. What I do promise is my world, and all it entails. My love, support, passion, compassion, and enthusiasm.I wish I could promise smooth sailing, but the winds aren\u2019t mine to control. What I do promise is a ship built to carry you to safely, and sails to weather any storm.I wish I could promise you forever, but someone infinitely great than I already has. What I do promise is every second of this time sliver of eternity I\u2019ve been blessed with. I wish I could promise you riches, but every vault has it\u2019s end. What I do promise you is a life of abundance\u2014An abundance of love and support, of strength and vulnerability, of sharing and drive, of passion, and of adventure.I wish I could promise to always be as roguishly handsome as I am today, but, well \u2026 On second thought, have you seen my dad? Maybe that\u2019s a promise I can keep.I can\u2019t even promise I\u2019ll never hurt you, because even the best of intentions sometimes fall short. What I do promise is to always reach for you over my pride; to hold you, to heal you, and to seek forgiveness. God lit a fire in me the day I was born, knowing that you would be the oxygen that brought it to life. And I promise to burn. I promise to burn every day. For you, for us, for who we were, who we are, and who we will be. I promise to be a light in the dark, and a warmth in the cold. But I promise too, to be the oxygen to your fire; that same flame I saw the first time I looked into your eyes and convinced you to hold some random stranger\u2019s iguana. I vow never to extinguish that fire.  And I vow never to tame you \u2026 As if I even could. You are wild, playful, feisty, fiery, and strong. Maybe even a little impossible, my Impossible Girl. You\u2019re a mystery I\u2019ll never solve and I promise to honor that; to uplift and celebrate the wonderful and wild woman God made you to be. I promise not only to honor it; I\u2019ll fight to protect and preserve it. I\u2019ll be your warrior and your defender. Not because you\u2019re a damsel in distress\u2014you aren\u2019t. But because you are who I\u2019ve pledged my love and loyalty to. Because you cannot love fiercely without also fighting fiercely. But a true warrior is more than his weapon and armor; more than a fighter. As Jesus has shown, a true warrior is a servant above all else. And so I promise to serve you, pridelessly and unashamedly.  I will be your support and your respite. I\u2019ll be your shelter, and your shot of tequila when times get hard. I\u2019ll listen more than I speak. I\u2019ll seek to understand before being understood. I\u2019ll hold you when words fail, and carry you when you can\u2019t go on. I\u2019ll lead you when you\u2019re lost, and follow you when you\u2019re found. And I promise never to stop pursuing the man God made me to be. I promise to grow, but to never grow up. I promise to always be your optimist, your hoper, and your dreamer of far-flung dreams. And I will never lose my sense of wonder in the world, in others, or in you. And finally, I promise to never forget family as we become a family ourselves. I will love your parents, your sisters, and your friends, and everyone else in your life as my own. After all, after today, they will be.  I am yours, Amber. Today, tomorrow, and every day to come. In good times and bad. In sickness and in health. No matter what may come. And I will spend every day of my life proving that, giving life to my words through action. I vow all of this before you, before God, and before everyone here today. And I ask anyone here who has heard these vows to hold me to them. I love you, Little Pond. This is just the beginning. In the end, we may all just be stories. But ours? Ours will be the best. Where do you want to start?   Man, I can\u2019t even type those without tearing up. Brings all the memories flooding back. I hope they touched you. And now that you\u2019ve read them, you\u2019re contractually obligated to hold me to \u2018em. You up for the responsibility? Thank you so much for sticking with me to the end. I hope you enjoyed them as much as I did. And, hey, if you did, can you do me a favor? Upvote this answer, then head over to my profile and give me a follow. I promise to make it worth your while. :) ",

            "answer_text": "My husband and I were (and still are) very cheesy romantics, so, alongside the standard vows (in sickness and health, for richer and poorer etc.) we wrote our own vows. My husband unfortunately misplaced his (although he vividly remembers them) but I kept mine in a little scrapbook which I sometimes refer to. This is what I said, obviously omitting the awkward laughter, hysterical crying and sniffling (my poor husband\u2019s first husband kiss was slobbery): I want to start this off by apologising in advance for every bad thing that I will do by you. I know that I\u2019m prone to making mistakes and to messing up and I am so unbelievably grateful to you for sticking with me and for standing by my side in spite of all my flaws and shortcomings. I\u2019m so glad (and a little surprised) that we\u2019ve made it here to our wedding day and I am so excited to see what the future holds in store for the both of us. Nothing that I can ever say or do will ever be enough to express just how much I love and care about you, but, today, I\u2019m going to try to give you and everyone else here a glimpse of my feelings. You are so many things to me. You are my best friend, my biggest supporter, my shoulder to cry on, my moral compass and my everything. You\u2019re also the love of my life, the reason I smile and the best thing that has ever happened to me and I am so happy that I get to add husband to the list of things you are to me, because from here on out, you are my husband and I am your wife, and I have never wanted anything more than to be yours. You came into my life and you changed me. You\u2019ve made me into the person I\u2019ve always wanted to be, but never bothered to try and become. You\u2019ve made me a much better person and I have so many people in my life who can attest to that. If, this is what happens after 18 months of being with you, then I can\u2019t wait to see what happens after a lifetime together. I\u2019ve heard so many stories of people getting cold feet on their wedding day. Tales of all the nervousness and the butterflies and all the sceptical people emphasizing the idea that forever is a long time, well for me, I don\u2019t even think forever would be enough time to spend with you. I want to be with you longer than forever, I want to be with you over the course of more than one lifetime. I just want to be with you. Being with you has brought me the biggest sense of joy and there has essentially been a smile glued to my face since the day we met. Words can never explain how thankful I am to you for wandering into the supermarket the day we met and walking up to my register with your sweet half smile and awkward attempt to avoid conversation. There are so many things I want to promise you, but I know that I\u2019m incapable of ever giving to you. So, while I can never give you forever (even though I desperately want to) and while I can\u2019t even give you tomorrow, I promise to give you my all, and for every moment that I share with you I promise to continue to give you my all, even when I swear I don\u2019t want to. I promise that I will love and accept every part of you for the rest of our lives and I will never try to make you into someone that you\u2019re not. I promise to never cross you or provoke you or belittle you, I promise to never abuse you or mistreat you and I promise you that I will always strive to be the best version of myself. I promise to be yours and yours alone and to never let my heart (or body) wander, for as of this moment, my heart belongs to you, in fact, it has always belonged to you, since the day that we met you\u2019ve had a hold of my heart and for as long as we both live you will continue to have a hold of it. I promise to always be for you what you have always been for me. I\u2019ll be your biggest supporter, cheering you on from the sidelines through everything. I\u2019ll offer you my shoulder, my ears and my full undivided attention whenever you need to cry or talk. I\u2019ll nurse you back to health and pick you up off of the ground when you fall. I\u2019ll never let you forget that I love you and I\u2019ll even laugh at all of your jokes. I promise to wholly devote myself to you and to the life that we will build together. I promise to cherish every moment that we share and to never let anything get between us or between our love. I promise to love you through everything and to stand hand in hand with you in good times and in bad, refusing to let you go. I promise to always make time for you and I promise to never give up on us. No one knows what we will go through once we leave this place and start our journey as husband and wife, but one thing I know, one thing that I\u2019m absolutely sure of, is that as long as I\u2019ve got you by my side nothing can stand in our way because love conquers all. I love you so so so much and I cannot wait to explore the world of marriage with you. I couldn\u2019t have asked for a better person to be my husband. ",
