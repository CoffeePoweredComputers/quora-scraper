            "answer_text": "I am worried about my career, woman in my life, kids, property, and family. So you do you. What if I told you at the end nothing matters so you can leave that stress for a while. Eventually, you will get a job you wanted, you will love your job, new work and slowly you will feel trapped in corporate conditions. You will look for another trap that will pay higher and entangle you with a bundle of responsibilities. You would have less time with your friends and family and less time to thinking alone. Don\u2019t you think this is the best time to have fun? You will love a woman and she will love you the hell out of your life, you will feel surrender your feeling with someone which you are holding back for a long, and one day she will break your heart and you will be single again, wondering what I did? Don\u2019t you think this is the best time to enjoy being single? You will end up buying properties, one to another, you will build a house for the family to live together. And one day your kids will go to college too far from your home, your wife may land a job in another city. You may get transferred to another city. All family members may live in a different room in a large house, so you would be living alone in your room. Don\u2019t you think you can enjoy living alone in a small house right now? For a moment forget these worries and appreciate what you are right now, what you have right now, and what you are doing right now? This is the only way to get everything tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "What makes me happy doesn\u2019t necessarily help you or anyone else. However if find this question interesting since it activates me to reflect on what triggers an happy moment or life perhaps? It happens in a second. As soon as i feel hope or delight about something i start feeling happy that I will be doing and being something that uplifts me. That is why it is important to visualize a state or project that will bring happiness. I suppose that the thing that will make me happy will not stir everybody the same way. However it is about your passions and the experiences you look forward to.. thus is important to know yourself and be aware. Now i imagine the healing effects of the infra red light and its warmth and that is beautiful. I cannot wait to feel that with the actual light here. I know this sounds simple but i have been watching my feelings for years and it takes many acts of consciousness to know that it is working very deeply when you have even passing thoughts and emotions. Also another exercise is to look at what experience you wish to have and focus on it and it\u2019s details. That brings happiness and can also turn around situations that were not that healthy from the start. Enjoy your trip on earth. It was not meant to be easy to live on earth but a lesson on becoming your higher self. ",

            "answer_text": "Makes one feel happy? Well, I can save you time and write just one sentence about it: If the thing is outside of yourself, you\u2019re going the wrong way. Your happiness must come from within you. How do you get that happiness, you take care of, respect, and love yourself. Once you do that, you\u2019ll start to feel a real appreciation in your life. Side note, happiness isn\u2019t worth going after, go for joy. Going for happiness means you want to ignore your other emotions, and that\u2019s not being loving to yourself and to the experience of life. Those emotions are also part of you and so you should love them too if you want to fully love yourself. Wanting only happiness is like wanting a rollercoaster that never goes down, where\u2019s the fun in that? You\u2019re better off striving for joy, because its enjoying life regardless of the experience it throws your way. ",

I prepare breakfast which keeps me healthy and it is always light as I stay home. I prefer to go to bed at 10 pm but if I have to finish chores I take a nap and finish them anyway because I do not feel happy in a messy house. I do not argue with the next person till things go wrong. I discuss my point of view but do not force others to follow what I like. I let them follow their own path until it does not affect his well being( my husband). Everybody is not perfect so I give him space to learn by experience. Good results give me happiness but bad results give him lessons. Same my husband applies. ",

From there my happiness is affirmed by my sense of faith in God through my relationship with Christ. Altogether I have found a sense of happiness that holds moments of brokenness in check. Paragraph? Maybe? Be full of care. ",
