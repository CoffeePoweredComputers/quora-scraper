            "answer_text": "How can I write a biography of my mother? Unless there\u2019s more info for your question (that I\u2019m unable to find) I\u2019d need to know if your mother is deceased. If she\u2019s alive, that makes a huge difference. Alive, she can answer questions, if she\u2019s agreeable, but (not knowing her and her personality) the answers might be a bit stretched, maybe even outlandishly bent in her favor, one way or another. Or she might be a sweetie and want to be as honest as possible, to the point that her answers don\u2019t always contain the right kind of info to build a half-way exciting image of her. Whatever sources you use, whether it\u2019s straight from her or from people who were a part of her life - spouses, children, friends, neighbors, work-mates, schoolmates, and so many more - you\u2019re going to get a huge mix of straight-forward and asides and \u201cbetween you and me\u201d, again, the gambit of answers depending on where the informant is coming from. What point of view do you want to use? If you\u2019re going for first-person limited, then everything you write about your mother will come from your experiences with her, what you know yourself, what you heard from others, and so on. That would be a very personal and maybe not inclusive story since even children don\u2019t always know their parents\u2019 deeper selves, their secret lives. If you use an omniscient point of view, you\u2019re free to utilize anything and everything you can throw into a reference can to use at the right time in your manuscript. It won\u2019t matter that you\u2019re a child of hers since your part in her life will be blended in with all other people in her life and you\u2019ll simply be the storyteller, with no emotional involvement. That could be difficult to pull off. Read some biographies and see what you think about their presentation. If you can imagine being in the author\u2019s place, consider that as a way to go. Examples are always a beneficial way to get a hold of a complex answer. Google this: \u201cbiography of my mother\u201d for lots of examples of formats, POVs, moods, etc. Get all your shit together; all your memories jotted down in no particular format, all physical memorabilia that had a significant part in her life, and why, photo albums, newspaper articles, genealogy that may have affected her life, cards and letters and high school yearbooks and rumors and scandals (not saying your mother has any attached to her, but if you want a raw and truthful account, you\u2019ll leave nothing out). My mother would, and maybe will make a wonderful subject for a biography. But I have major decisions to make before I\u2019d take on that project: who do I want to keep innocent, who am I not being fair to, can I separate hearsay from the truth, am I able to dig deep enough into her secret lives. Writing nonfiction, especially pertaining to real life, and especially again one of our own can be more difficult than anything fiction. More care, more sensitivity and understanding and forgiving, less revenge and resentment and all those elements that only make you appear like a miserable cuss of a child instead of one who recognizes this person as fallible, as a human with faults. I hope this helps a bit. As far as beginning, I kinda like the medias res approach: open at a suitable point in a conversation with your mother (or someone else in a talk with her) and build from that point: a conversation with questions attached, with \u201cstuff\u201d having occurred beforehand, \u201cstuff\u201d that could happen later. But it\u2019s your project; you know, I hope, what you want a reader to take away when the story\u2019s finished. Best of luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, you should ask her all the questions you\u2019d want answersed for the book. You should make recordings of all her answers and take copious notes. You should also interview and record all of her close friends and family. From these interviews and notes you begin to compile your research. You have to find sources (court records, school records, news clippings, etc.) that either corroborate or refute your mother\u2019s recollections. Then after you\u2019ve done all that, you choose the most interesting aspect of the story\u2014the thing you are most excited or impressed by (\u2018Mom fought the Communists in El Salvador as a college student\u2019 or \u2018Mom\u2019s first job was running a one-room schoolhouse for children of women seeking shelter from their abusive husbands\u2019)\u2014and begin to write the story. Along the way you will have to make decisions about order, point of view, voice, and other elements of storytelling to arrive at a completed volume. ",

            "answer_text": "This does depend on how well you know your mother and how long you have spent with her also if she is still alive or has unfortunately passed away.if your mother has passed away in the biography share her personal stories,things that are close to her,how she is as a mother;a wife;a daughter;a sister ,express the things she was passionate about, if she used to keep a diary maybe include paragraphs from it also how other people that are close to her felt about her and what she was like growing up. If she is alive you can include the same things in her biography however you can have personal statements of how she is now like a written interview that allows her to talk about her own life. ",
