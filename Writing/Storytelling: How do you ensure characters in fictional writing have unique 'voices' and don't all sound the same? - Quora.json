            "answer_text": "Thanks for your A2A. You've pretty much got your answer in the comments below in that in order to create a memorable character you, as the writer, must know him inside and out. Know what makes him tick, what makes him mad, what makes him act out. Then you will know how he will react when you put him in danger, or threaten to ruin his business, or have his lovers leave him. Create a background story for him. There are lots of character check lists you can find on the Internet, but don't spend too much time on it. His favorite color is probably not all that important to the story. Focus on the items on the list that carved out his personality and/or made him the man he is today. Think out your characters. Did they have a crappy childhood? Were they rich? Poor? Mom was a drunk? Dad was in jail? Did they have a privileged life? Were they in the military and saw despicable behavior? Did they take part in it? All these things will shape who they are and how they deal with the situations you're going to put them into, and how they will react to others, especially the love interest. Make them interesting and not clich\u00e9d. They can be tough but remember we have to like them, so don't make them too cold. Give them a soft side. A hero always does the right thing, even if his behavior is not always perfect. Make sure your character cares passionately about what is happening. Give him emotions. If he doesn't care, why should the reader? Also give him a flaw. Nobody is perfect and we hate reading about perfect people. We want to relate to the character; we want to become them. And we want him to solve his problem.  Once you 'know' your character, you will find his voice.  A southern belle doesn't sound like a New England cop.  Keep their personalities in mind and hear their voices in your head when you're writing.  Stay true to the character. Just a quick note on naming your characters. Don't use a name so difficult the reader can\u2019t pronounce it. Don't have a John and a Jake and a Jerry. Too confusing. Use names that fit the personality and the time you are writing in. For example very few young girls are named Gertrude today but that was a popular name in the 20s.  ",

            "answer_text": "Again, Quora contributors have lots of really good advice and thoughtful examples for you to consider.   I'd like to offer a couple of rather lengthy observations, too, which mainly pertain to speech dialects, accents, slang, and so forth. When it comes down to it, the sound of characters' speech is in the mind of the reader.   And you can only exert a limited amount of control over how the reader \"hears\" a character.    So try not to overdo it.   Try to build trust in your reader by making the speech of your characters as easy to read as possible, as smooth as possible, so that your characters \"sound\" natural.    Yes, this can be difficult when it comes to highly distinct dialects (like southern Appalachian, or Jamaican English).    But here's a tip from theatre acting:  When acting, don't overdo accents.   Give the audience a good sense of it, but don't try to be so exact that your audience can't understand what you're saying.   Do it well enough, and your audience will simply accept it and continue to pay attention to the play (or story).   So at some point, you must trust your audience.   Of course, having an idea of who your audience is certainly helps. As an anecdotal example, I'll give you this:   I'm originally from the southeastern part of Georgia (in the United States), where there are three distinct regional \"Southern accents.\"   My parents, however, were both from northeast Georgia, with its own distinct groups of Appalachian vocalizations and manners of speech.   Among us native Southerners, we often roll our eyes and mentally groan when we watch a movie in which a non-native Southerner actor (even a great actor that we love) attempts to play a southern character, often miss-mixing a variety of regional accents and dialects that you'd never hear from a real person.    We talk to each other about it, too, laughing at the acting.   Most often, they are stylizing their accents to target a non-Southern audience who would never know the difference.   But to us, their speech sounds somewhat scraping nails across a chalkboard.   Ironically (and this is something we often note to one another), American actors most often \"get it wrong,\" whereas English actors tend to be much better at it.   It's a mystery to us.   English actors Andrew James Clutterbuck (aka Andrew Lincoln) and David Morrisey (of \"The Walking Dead\") are fine examples of this ability to \"get it right\" and deliver a sense of being \"Southern\" without overdoing it.    These actors don't get it exactly right, of course, but they don't distract the viewer with egregious exaggerations, either.   When watching talented actors like these, we Southerners generally have no idea that the actors \"ain't from around here,\" we don't give it a second thought, don't get hung up, and we stay \"in the story.\"   And, I daresay, I imagine that non-Southerners also \"get it\" without being put off by their accents. So, to make the characters seem to be from different places or backgrounds, you really only need to vary them from one another (how they talk) only slightly.   Context will usually do the rest of the work for you. In addition to all of the things mentioned by others (backstories, context, mannerisms, etc.),  how you present the characters to the reader also matters.   That is, the tone of your narration also matters, whether your narration is full of \"gravitas\" and drama, or expressed in a casual or \"jaunty\" manner as in the case of certain comedic approaches to storytelling.    Your narrative voice \"sets up\" the passages wherein there is dialogue.     You can sometimes use contrast to \"emphasize\" the voice of a character.   That is, when the scene is set up very seriously, and the character says something, that character's voice is in contrast to your own.    As I said, this sometimes works and relieves you of the need to over-emphasize accents or slang.    Reading out loud will help you a lot to judge this approach because sometimes you want your reader to pay close attention to what you are saying, and sometimes what the character has to say is the main thrust of the passage. But remember, in the end, you can't force your reader to \"interpret\" the voice of a character in the same way that you \"hear\" that character.   You can only guide the reader along.  The story is paramount, so try not to get bogged down in the elements like dialect.   Let your reader experience the story, but bear in mind that the reader's experience will be somewhat different than your own experience of it.   This is what all of us writers agonize over; that is, the struggle to create and share a written experience for the reader that is fairly close to our own mental experience.    It is ultimately impossible, of course, to make the two (reader's experience and writer's experience) exactly the same. As you can sense, there's a lot that can be said about this topic.   I'm sorry that my own contribution is so long!   But, again, look over, ponder, and study what others have to say.    Stretch your writing ability by trying approaches that you might not be accustomed to or even comfortable with.   And best of luck with your writing! ",
