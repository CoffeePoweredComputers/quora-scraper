            "answer_text": "I think that most people would read these as saying the same thing, but they do not. Each has its own meaning, and both have two! I did my best means (1) that whatever action is being described, it was the best action which I could have done. It may or may not been done well, but it was, among the choices of actions, the best one. It could also mean (2) that for the action I chose to take I did my best while performing it. It may have been a good action or a poor action, but I did it as well as I possibly could. I tried my best means (1) that whatever action is being described as the one I tried is the best action I could have tried. It may have been done well or poorly, but among the choices of actions, it was the best. One could also mean (2) that for the action I chose, I tried to do my best while I performed it. Also, the second sentence, \"I did my best\" means that no matter which meaning, you actually carried out the act. The first sentence, \"I tried my best\" means that you made an attempt to carry out the act. It does not mean that you failed, but it also does not mean that you succeeded. That information is not given in the sentence. The information given is that you attempted. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are correct, but there is a difference between the two. The former often refers to a situation in which a person has tried their best, but failed. That is not to say that this expression cannot be used in a positive context - obviously it can, but this is simply not the first scenario which comes to mind when hearing the statement. In the case of the latter, the person is simply stating that they did the best they could, without providing any information as to whether or not they were successful. This expression could therefore equally well apply to success or failure. Here are a few examples of each in context: I tried my best but I just couldn\u2019t keep up\u2026to keep up, but I couldn\u2019t run any faster\u2026to stop him, but he was too quick for meto keep the situation under control, but things just got crazybut failed miserably\u2026.I think that\u2019s why I wonI did my best that\u2019s all I can tell you\u2026to make sure they were safe\u2026to give them a good home\u2026to give them a good start in life\u2026for you, now it\u2019s your turn\u2026lap yet, that must be a record!\u2026to keep you appraised of the situation\u2026work when I was still at college\u2026to avoid this",
