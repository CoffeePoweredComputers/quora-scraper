            "answer_text": " The best way to figure it out is to go out there and find different jobs and get experience. There will be jobs you hate, there will be jobs you enjoy. With experience you\u2019ll be able to piece together your preferences. Keep your eyes open for opportunities, just because a job doesn\u2019t seem appealing at first it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not Ideal. You\u2019ll be surprised at the type of jobs you\u2019ll end up enjoying. Also, understand that ideal jobs, don\u2019t come without flaws. There\u2019s a part of it that\u2019s going to be a hassle. Consider video game streaming for example:  A lot of people see this as an Ideal job, I mean who doesn\u2019t want to earn money from just playing video games all day right? Well as a matter of fact, this job isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows aside from the cost of having to set-up a good rig, you have to go through the trouble of getting yourself to earn a lot of viewers and followers in order to make decent income to sustain yourself. Some streamers get burnt out and don\u2019t enjoy the game anymore and just play because they have to. Yes that can happen. So as a conclusion when figuring out an ideal job it\u2019s good to plan it out but take into consideration the costs and the negative repercussion of a seemingly ideal one. At the same time actively get to work, you won\u2019t find your ideal job just trying to figure it out. Go at it! Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Start working and find a way to enjoy whatever you do. Soon you will find out what you excel in and what you don\u2019t. As an example my first job was at Kentucky Fried Chicken. I loved it but soon realized it\u2019s very hard work and couldn\u2019t see me doing that unless I owned the store. My second job was at a grocery store. I loved that as well and worked my way up to a journeyman clerk while I was in college. I worked with brilliant people that had college degrees but didn\u2019t want to take a cut in pay to start over in their fields of study. I decided I didn\u2019t want to work in a store my entire life so I took a dramatic cut in pay to begin computer programming. Then I found my passion. ",
