After that date, she should be transferred to the Florida Dept. of Corrections, Florida Department of Corrections. The state DOC will make a determination about where she will serve her time in Florida's many prisons. The web page has information about how to write to her, but until she is housed in a facility, there's no way to write to her. You can write to her at the Hillsborough County Jail, the address is here:Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. ",

Some jails and prisons do have restrictions on who can write and some do not. Not sure about the place you mention. Anyhow, give that a try. ",
