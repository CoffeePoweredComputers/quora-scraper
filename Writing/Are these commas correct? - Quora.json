            "answer_text": "Er, I hate to say this, but most of the answers here already are wrong. The correct answer is \"it depends on what K-titled means\".  You use a comma between two adjectives that are \"coordinate\"; that is, they are of the same \"level\". Establishing adjective order is actually kind of subtle and tricky in English (and in other languages). It's something that native English speakers learn without usually being able to explicate. They know that something is a \"red rubber ball\" but not a \"rubber red ball\"; they also know that \"red, striped ball\" is valid but \"red, rubber ball\" isn't. The order of adjectives is usually given as:     Quantity or number    Quality or opinion    Size    Age    Shape    Color    Proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)    Purpose or qualifier (That list is from Order of Adjectives. Other sources differ slightly in detail.) When two adjectives fall at the same level, they are \"coordinate\", and you use a comma between them.  The rule-of-thumb for figuring it out is to try to reverse the two. If they sound OK in either order, you need a comma. If not, the comma is unnecessary (but you need to get them in the right order.) Since I don't know what \"K-titled\" means, I can't tell you. Can you have a \"K-titled red folder\"? If so, you need the comma. If not, you don't. If you can't tell... then it usually doesn't matter. Complex and subtle judgment calls like this one often vary from person to person, which means that whichever one you use is a matter of your style and nobody else can really fault you for it. ",
