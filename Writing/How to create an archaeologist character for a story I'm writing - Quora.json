            "answer_text": "I'm not an archaeologist myself, but if i wanted to create an archaeologist character, i'll do it just like any other character with specific profession: Research. 1. Research WHAT is an Archaeologist. Find what they are, what they do, what is their purpose, why this profession existed in the first place, how do they works, learn the methods they use, what they contribute to the world, how do they usually survive, and find famous names and their achievement for references. 2. Research on YOUR Character. Remember, your character's profession is an Archaeologist, but why he/she choose it, or how he/she ended in this profession? Was it inherited by his/her family line or something? Or perhaps because he/she really curious about mystery of the past? One good example (archaeologist character) that i can think of when i read your question is this character from Naoki Urasawa's Master Keaton: Taichi Hiraga-Keaton.  He's working as an insurance investigator, an ex-member of SAS of British Army and veteran from Falklands War, but his passion actually in archaeology. The way he\u2019s portrayed in the story will makes you believe that this guy is really an archaeologist. I think you can learn something from this character. Hope this help. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it all depends on what sort of comic book, anime, or animation style you want. You didn\u2019t say anything about what you were going to do with the Archeologist character. Just to be on the safe side, I would start with a TV animation style like on \u201cFamily Guy\u201d, or \u201cThe Cleveland Show\u201d. If you want to do a comic book, do a Marvel Comics, or good manga style of character design. Don\u2019t use the barrel-shaped bodies of the old Hanna Barbera style, which is limited in its use. But an animation style like that of \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d, \u201cJosie and the Pussycats\u201d, \u201cSealab 2020\u201d, and \u201cJonny Quest\u201d is very good. Pick one. Draw a silhouette of a figure first, seen from the right 3/4 perspective. Just work on the silhouette, and don\u2019t draw any features or detail yet. The entire drawing should progress, and develop, at the same time. Don\u2019t just draw a head, or a face yet. You will add shapes and detail, in multiple passes, as the drawing progresses. Once you are satisfied with the animation style you need, then add details and expressions, on the face and hands. Then, the archeologist clothing. If the character looks good, then try drawing a few other sides, and back views. Other perspective views. As for the backgrounds, when in doubt, lower the horizon line, and view your character from a lower point of view, looking slighty upwards, at your character. This is commonly done in TV animation, and comic books. ",
