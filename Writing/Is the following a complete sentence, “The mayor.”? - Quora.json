            "answer_text": "Most people would say no, because at minimum, a sentence must either: \u2022 contain a subject and a verb, as in The mayor sneezed. \u2022 OR be a question, as in Why? \u2022 OR be a command, as in Stop! However, in practice, verbless statements like The mayor are frequently used as if they were sentences. But it is only meaningful if taken in context. For example, if I asked Who is more powerful, the police chief or the mayor? and you replied The mayor, that would be meaningful. Strictly speaking, to make a grammatically correct sentence you should say The mayor is more powerful. But in practice today, the statement The mayor would be acceptable in many kinds of writing - and certainly in spoken English. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on context. By itself, out of context, \u201cThe mayor\u201d isn\u2019t a sentence. But in answer to the question, \u201cWho has more power in this city than the chief of police?\u201d a good answer might be \u201cThe mayor.\u201d Back in the Dark Ages, and I suspect to this day, this would have been called an elliptical sentence. A fuller answer would be \u201cThe mayor does,\u201d or \u201cThe mayor has more power in this city than the chief of police.\u201d The last alternative shows you why an elliptical sentence would be used. Why repeat so much? The questioner knows what she/he asked. Actually, adding \u201cdoes\u201d makes it a full sentence and it\u2019s less abrupt, so if you want to be more polite, \u201cThe mayor does\u201d is a better answer. But in this context, just \u201cThe mayor\u201d is also a true sentence. ",
