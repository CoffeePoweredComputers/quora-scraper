            "answer_text": "It's impossible for me to believe that anything less than two tweets long could be called an \u201cessay.\u201d Of course a 17-syllable haiku is a poem, but poetry isn't prose (how\u2019s that for belaboring the obvious?) Please tell us that the assignment was 250 words, which is still shorter than Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 272-word Gettysburg Address. I doubt seriously that any of the guides offer much help with something this short, but here\u2019s a thought or two if this was a genuine assignment: Don't utilize polysyllabic words, use short words. Don't waste space on quotations from others unless it would take more words to,say the same thing yourself. Get rid of everything similar to \u201cI think\u201d and \u201cIn my opinion.\u201d Consider an \u201cessay\u201d based on a list, but a list that tells a story (250 characters, including spaces): My 9 favorite words: Mary. My wife\u2019s name. Yes! When I proposed. Bobby. My son. Mama. His first word. Sara, Bob\u2019s wife. Pops. What Sara calls me. Jacko. Our grandchild. Grandy. What Jacko calls me. Memaw is Mary. My 2 least favorite: Cancer. Incurable. ",

Start by planning your main point and supporting logic, and write it in as few words as possible, then iterate through as many drafts as needed to get it below the the 140 character limit. ",
