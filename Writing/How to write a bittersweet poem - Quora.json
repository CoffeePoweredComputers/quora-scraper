It's why poets can study rhymes for years and still not get their first line, just like that, on the spot. I write on the spot when I can. :OH, HOW BITTERSWEET, THIS THING CALLED LOVE!:Notice the title? It has 8 syllables and immediately I can see it as the title as well as the first line in the first verse for my 8-6-8-6 poem style seen in common metre hymns.:OH, HOW BITTERSWEET, THIS THING CALLED LOVE!:Oh, how bittersweet, this thing called love, its tendrils to employ,To fascinate, all things above, to conquer man and boy...Such that a maiden steals their hearts, without a single kiss...They're captured when her smiling starts, they're hypnotised by bliss...And she could love, that's not unheard... and linger nearby, too...Perhaps in wait for some kind word... or even, 'I LOVE YOU!':While this is human nature, friends, don't let it get you down...Though bittersweet, it never ends... it's the only game in town!Sometimes proposals don't work out... but sometimes, yes, they do...It's then, of course, without a doubt, true love proves really true...But even then, she can ignore, or play the flirt each day...Her choice, you see, could prove a bore, such that love fades away...:It's bittersweet at times and yet let's not give up on love...But love the more, despite regret... till loved in turn enough...Devote yourselves to tenderness, respect her heart and soul,Perhaps with love songs that express how she makes you feel whole...Good luck with that! Let's hope she's worth the love you choose to bring...Such that you get what you deserve... when she gets her wedding...:Denis Martindale July 2019.: ",

            "answer_text": "First, you gotta dive in to your feelings. If you never experienced love and heartbreaking feeling (at the same time), you need to imagine what it feels like if you had. Thus, the words, diction, punctuation, rhyme or alliteration can describe your feelings best. If you can't imagine that kind of feeling, you can watch movies, which have sad ending but began happily. So far, that works for me. Always. Once the movie triggered your feelings and emotions, write down any adjectives that fit your feelings. You can add any details to your poem to leave it sounds more realistic. Oh, you can also build an irony to trigger your readers\u2019 feeling. You can also listen to sad songs a lot. Once you got that heart dropping feeling or even tears in your eyes, go grab a pen immediately and write anything you feel before it disappears. Good luck. ",
