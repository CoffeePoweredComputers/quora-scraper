            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not correct because \u201ctwice\u201d is modifying the word \u201cbigger\u201d when you actually mean to modify the phrase \u201cA is bigger than B.\u201d In this particular instance the difference is trivial and you will still be understood, but if you used a different comparison you might be out of luck. When you\u2019re modifying phrases like this, you have to ensure the whole phrase is clumped together and then modify it by adding a phrase beside it (usually a prepositional phrase). You can say: A is bigger than B by a factor of two. Here you\u2019ve got two phrases. \u201cBy a factor of two\u201d describes the whole phrase \u201cA is bigger than B\u201d by qualifying how much larger A is. If you really want to slide twice into the middle, you can, but not with \u201cbig.\u201d Big cannot take a modifier in the middle of the comparison in that form. A is twice as big as B. In classical English, \u201cBig\u201d technically can\u2019t support this construction, so strictly speaking I should have used \u201clarge.\u201d Why can large do this and big can\u2019t? I don\u2019t know, but in spoken or informal English it\u2019s not really a mistake worth marking; native speakers do it all the time. In any case, the difference here is that \u201ctwice\u201d describes the whole phrase \u201cas big as B.\u201d Get the pattern? An adjective of scale always describes the whole comparison, and has to be placed so that\u2019s apparent. ",
