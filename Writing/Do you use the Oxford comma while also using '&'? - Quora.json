            "answer_text": "Yes, as an advocate of Oxford commas, I would definitely use it before an ampersand (&) as it's merely shorthand for the word \"and\". In fact, it's probably more useful before an ampersand especially when the list contains items in groups: Typical English food includes roast beef, fish and chips, & bangers and mash. However, it is probably best to avoid an ampersand in formal writing, much the same way it is best to avoid contractions. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that your last sentence looks unnatural, despite having correct commas, is evidence that you shouldn't use an ampersand like that! Ampersands in relatively formal text may be used to form a compound name (e.g. Ede & Ravenscroft) and they **may possibly** be used in certain specialized contexts (e.g. &c.) but they are not used to build an ordinary list in a sentence.So no, one does not use the Oxford comma with an ampersand -- but that's because of typography, rather than grammar. A more interesting point is the ?: punctuation that you used. It doesn't look quite right, and yet I often find myself beginning a bulleted list with a question, and it's hard to know how to punctuate it. ",
