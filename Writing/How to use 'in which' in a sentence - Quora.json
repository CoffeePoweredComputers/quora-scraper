            "answer_text": "Sometimes people want to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition, so instead of saying \u201cThis is the house my mother lives in,\u201d they will say \u201cThis is the house in which my mother lives.\u201d You can also say \u201cThis is the house where my mother lives.\u201d In formal writing, \u201cin which\u201d might be used more often, but in casual speech, it sounds stuffy and overly formal. Remember you can also use \u201cwhich\u201d as a question word, so you might find \u201cin which\u201d used this way: In which hotel will you be staying? Here, there\u2019s a choice of hotels, and I\u2019m asking you to identify the one where you plan to stay. ",

            "answer_text": "Your example is a sentence in which when would be both clearer and simpler than in which. But to illustrate the point that your usage is grammatically correct, I used in which in my previous sentence even though where would have been clearer and simpler: Your example is a sentence where 'when' would be both clearer and simpler than 'in which.' Often in English you can use when and where in sentences where other languages would use a construction equivalent to 'in which.' ",
