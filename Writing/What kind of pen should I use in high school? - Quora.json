            "answer_text": "One you WANT to write with, not one you think you should want. If you have the luxury to pursue this, then spend some time on it. Are you someone who loses pens? If you are, then limit your research to disposable pens. If you keep track of things, your options are a little broader. Is your penmanship particularly large or small? If it is on the large side, then you might want to consider a pen with a broad tip (certainly over .5mm). Pilot makes a disposable fountain pen which I adore for as my natural script is fairly small and it helps me to write larger. If your script is particularly small or light, it is worth the investment in a fine tipped, dark colored pen. I'm a sucker for Sakura Micron Pens; they have a tip that goes down to .2mm which lets me write absurdly tiny and still write clearly. Some other things I think about when picking a pen are how the pen feels in your hand, and how the pen sounds with the kind of notebook you're most likely to use. I like a firm metal tip (again, the disposable fountain pen from Pilot is excellent, I also like uni-ball's micro pens [though their .5mm compared to Micron's .2 seems pretty macro]) on a dense paper (70-80lbs is the recommended weight for preventing bleed). The sound of a metal tip on thick paper ounces like writing to my soul. You may find over time that the weight matters more to you (all of the pens I've mentioned are plastic and therefore very light), in which case you may need to think about investing in a heavier, less disposable pen. This is clearly a subject I've put far too much thought into. If you have any other questions please let me know. Or ignore this, it's horribly pretentious and I'm kind of embarrassed by the detail I've produced. ",

In school, you'll find that more often than not, you're writing on a single sheet of paper, not in a book. This pretty much renders nibbed pens useless. Like actually, fountain pens and ink pens get ruined wicked fast on a hard surface. Plus they make that annoying af scratching noise. I say, unless you want to sound like Thomas Jefferson writing the Constitution with a quill, just use a damn gel/ballpoint pen. Pilot G1's are a personal recommendation. They're cheap, and commonly available in 30 packs. If you're like me, anything available cheap in a 30 pack by definition has to be good XD So there. An extensive analysis of proper pen usage in the high school environment. Enjoy. ",
