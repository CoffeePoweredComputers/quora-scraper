You can create and store up to 20 filters in your Gmail account. Filters are saved in your account until you delete them.Step 1Log in to your Gmail account. Click the down arrow in the Search box to open the Filter dialog box. You can also click the \u201cMore\u201d option, then click \u201cCreate Filter\u201d to open the dialog box. Step 2Type a search criterion for the filter in any field. For example, type the email address of the sender in the From: field to filter emails from a specific sender. Click the \u201cSearch\" icon. The filtered results display. Repeat to obtain the desired results, if needed. Once you obtain the results you want with the filter, proceed to the next step to save the filter. Step 3Click the \u201cCreate Filter with This Search\u201d link to save the filter. The Filter Options dialog box opens. Step 4Click the \u201cAdd Forwarding Address\" link, then click the \u201cAdd a Forwarding Address\" button. Type the email address of the recipient, then click the \u201cForward It\u201d check box.

I am suggesting, just do it manually one at a time because once you get into the computer programming stuff like filters and, criterion and settings and obscure words and things that make no sense. It's broke. Period. Don't even bother trying, they will just lead you to the auto-filter option which is a huge waste of time. ",
