            "answer_text": "I have no idea at this point. Initially, I'd hoped it would be Tulsi Gabbard, because she was the only one who stood by him in 2016, but after Tulsi decided to abstain from votting in the House Impeachment Inquiry, I lost interest in her. Also, the fact that Hillary zclinton has done a fabulous job of convincing many Democrats that \"if she's not with me, she's not one of you\", it already seemed unlikely that Bernie would've gained much by adding her to the ticket with respects to gaining support of voters who needed something extra. After Tulsi, the next obvious choice was Elizabeth Warren, who has sucessfuly gained a reputation as a proponant of Progressive values (in alignment with Bernie Sanders), and they seemed to get along fantastically throughout the Democratic Primary. But in light of the fact that Elizabeth Warren, who endorsed Hillary Clinton instead of Bernie in 2016, and has continued to remain in communications with Hillary Clinton (who is anti-Progressive), and then unexplicably sabotaged the Progressive agenda in the final Democratic debate to through Bernie Sanders under the bus for an alledged comment he nade [to her] in private, more than a year ago, it seems unlikely that he would ask her to be his VP or that she would even be interested. This brings us to the only remaining option (the worst case scenerio), that he might, in an attempt to \"ballance the ticket\" reach out to a Moderate Democrat (which would undoubtably piss off his supporters). And because he has already inducated that he is planning to seek a Woman to be his VP, Amy Klobuchar seems like a high probability. On the other hand, perhaps he will seek a running mate who is not currently campaigning for the Democratic nomination. ",

            "answer_text": "A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump leading Bernie Sanders by 7 points in the State of Wisconsin*, though Sanders was ahead in Michigan and Pennsylvania. This is alarming because the Democrats\u2019 clearest path to victory in November is by flipping Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania back to the blue states that they were for nearly a quarter century prior to 2016. They need all three of them in order to win. I was bearish on Bernie just a month ago. But now it seems that he is headed for the nomination, by virtue of the fact that the moderate wing of the party is fractured between three candidates who are performing more or less equally. And none of them show any signs of dropping out any time soon. Democrats recognize the need to coalesce around a candidate sooner rather than later, and if Bernie is ahead coming out of Super Tuesday, that might begin to happen. Although he\u2019s never been my first (or second, or third) choice \u2014 I have serious issues with his economic policies \u2014 I\u2019m willing to get behind him if it means a better shot at defeating Trump, an existential threat to our country\u2019s national security and, frankly, mental wellbeing. Why did I start by opening with Wisconsin? Well, Wisconsin is home to a very popular U.S. senator. I present to you a name you probably haven\u2019t heard much before, Tammy Baldwin:  Senator Baldwin is unique in that she is both a strong progressive (one of the most progressive in the Senate) and has a history of winning big in a moderate swing state. She won by double digits in 2018 \u2014 very surprising for a progressive in a state that went red just two years earlier. You might consider her Wisconsin\u2019s version of Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar, a well-liked and trusted politician who has won in red, rural counties. But that\u2019s not a great comparison because Amy is a moderate (ironically in the more progressive of the two states), while Baldwin is a staunch progressive. So, she is a good fit ideologically for Sanders \u2014 they\u2019re on the same wavelength. Although conventional wisdom would say that Sanders should choose a moderate on his ticket, 2016 proved that conventional wisdom is out the window. Further, Sanders is an ideological purist. He seems, more than any other candidate, inclined to choose a running mate that shares his views. She certainly does. Certainly, the DNC recognizes the critical importance of carrying Wisconsin. I can\u2019t imagine any liberal Democrat more favorable for Wisconsinites than her. There\u2019s going to be an appetite for a woman on the ticket, especially with a white male at the top. She fits that box. And, despite having been in Washington for over two decades, she\u2019s the strong silent type that carries relatively little controversy or baggage. Not a divisive figure, to say the least. Notably, if chosen, she would be the first LGBT person on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. That would excite a lot of people. The DNC appears to be showing subtle signs of promoting her. On multiple occasions, she was seen standing conspicuously behind Sen. Chuck Schumer during press conferences in the impeachment trial. It seemed odd to me because she\u2019s otherwise one of those senators you just don\u2019t see much of or hear much from. At first glance, she kinda seemed out of place as she\u2019s not otherwise prominent. So this is the most logical explanation. Most importantly for the welfare of this country, she has the practical experience necessary to step in to the presidency should the octogenarian recent-heart attack patient die or become incapacitated. Last month, I said that Amy Klobuchar would be Sanders\u2019 most likely option \u2014 though I did mention Baldwin as a possible choice (for Joe Biden, but the Wisconsin angle makes her a good fit for Sanders, too, if he\u2019s dead-set against balancing the ticket ideologically). I feel more strongly about the latter than I did last month. Although I believe that Klobuchar would be an excellent VP (she\u2019s actually my personal choice for President) and the most obvious choice for him on paper following conventional wisdom, recent polling has shown that her appeal in Minnesota is not carrying over to Wisconsin, currently trailing by 12.5 points in an average of polls.  2018 U.S. Senate election vs. 2016 U.S. Presidential election in Wisconsin A couple caveats: I generally don\u2019t subscribe to the idea that one\u2019s VP choice will cause one to carry the state or even make it that much more likely. It didn\u2019t help Mitt Romney in 2012, or John Kerry in 2004. But Wisconsin was won by a fraction of a percentage point in 2016. So anything that makes a Sanders ticket more favorable or trusted in the State could have a significant effect.As a Minnesotan, I shudder to think that the future of our country hinges on Wisconsin. Yikes. Don\u2019t screw this up, cheeseheads. *To be certain, the Quinnipiac Wisconsin poll is an outlier. Trump leads Sanders only by 0.7 points in an average of polls in the State, and Sanders was up by 4 points in a larger FOX poll taken last month. But if the Quinnipiac poll is repeated and shows a move towards Trump, Democrats will need to take steps to remedy that.  Edit (3/14/2020): Once again, a troll brigade has entered to leave comments completely unrelated to the question at hand. This question is not about whether Bernie Sanders, or any Democrat for that matter, will make a good president. This is not about socialism. This question is about whom, if nominated, Bernie might choose as his running mate. That\u2019s it. Nothing more, nothing less. Yet the the brigade has left demeaning ad hominems all over the comment section. For that reason, I am disabling comments. If you want to debate about who you\u2019re voting for, take it to Reddit. Otherwise, keep it relevant to the question at hand. To all those who would leave constructive and insightful comments, I apologize. This is why we can\u2019t have nice things. Keep it civil and relevant, folks. ",
