            "answer_text": "I've been blogging for 20 years and my blog is only a few years younger than the world's first website (CERN). To find unique and fresh topics, you have to develop a 'nose' for new leads, new ideas, new whatevers. That nose comes from going out and getting flexible with things and people out there. There's no substitute. Once you get the hang of things 'out there,' then it will (or should) come quite naturally to you the ropes of fishing around for information -- research, if you like. You can't research stuff unless you know something about how the world works for that something. Anyone can sit in the bedroom (or bathroom), surf the Web and do that kind of research. Anyone can go to the library to fish around for stuff there too. That's not really research -- it's smells more like preliminary research for flanking action or backup research to hold the rear lines. Realise the Internet has been around for 20 years (yes, how time flies). There isn't a lot out there that is unique, new, fresh, choose the words you like best. That leaves one thing, and I can't speculate how you could do that -- your unique, new, fresh, whatever 'take' (angle) on something. Some people fear that the already written stuff on their blogs will somehow jeopardise or harm their blogs' overall originality of content. It won't. If you produce enough original content (OC) in the meantime to catch up, the dross of before will be eclipsed by the OC of the now and future. In any case, your ability and talents in the writing department also makes for a fair bit of how unique, new or fresh you could express your 'take.' I've worked with writers who have a fresh way of looking at things, only to be let down by their hidebound, hypercorrect, collocated flavour of use of language. Not saying that coming up with something unique, new or fresh needs to push the envelope, but it certainly needs a degree of going out there and push yourself along the road. We all have 24 hours in the day; the rest is up to you. Thanks for the A2A. Hope it gets the general idea across. ",

            "answer_text": "I love seeing this question here because the number one answer to this question in my industry is usually, \u201cread Quora and answer people\u2019s questions!\u201d You\u2019re here, so you can start right now. Let us know how it goes. ;) However, because you\u2019re wondering about \u201cfresh and unique\u201d topics, I\u2019d thought I\u2019d stop you right there. There are very few, if any, fresh or unique topics out there so looking for a new subject matter isn\u2019t going to get you very far.  Even Steve Jobs told Wired that there are no new ideas, \u201ccreativity is just connecting things,\u201d he said. Usually, only your perspective, your angle, and your story can be fresh and new.  Personally, I find this liberating. I love coming up with new ways to talk about ideas. I love the research, I love filtering information through my personal experience, I love trying to tell my truth and saying something distinct on this crowded, noisy web. It\u2019s one of the most exciting parts of my day. Here are tricks I find effective. 1.  Read the news. One of my favorite sources of new and unique blog topics is the news. The news changes every day, so it can give you an unlimited supply of new blog ideas. Keep on top of the news, and you'll release articles that are in sync with people's search queries.  Ask yourself questions while you\u2019re reading. What is the connection between what I am working on and this development? Look for points of synthesis and contrast.  To create content that is truly innovative, try tying in a current event with an unrelated topic in your field. Experts believe that drawing connections between two seemingly unrelated ideas \u2013 sometimes called the Medici Effect -- is one of the best ways to come up with breakthrough ideas and innovations. Make connections that will enlighten others by tying together the news and your business and you will also draw in a wider audience including those interested in the news and those in your field.  2. Use Google\u2019s suggested searches. There may be a lot of the same type of generic blog posts happening in your industry. To get more specific and answers to questions you know people are asking, use Google\u2019s autocomplete for predicted search terms. To find search predictions, start typing a phrase that might tackle a broad topic in your field (e.g. \u201cContent Marketing Strategies for\u201d). Underneath the search field, a drop-down menu will appear with Google\u2019s suggestions for more specific ways to complete the phrase. (e.g. \u201cContent Marketing strategies for small businesses\u201d) Using some of these query suggestions will help you tap into a niche and create more unique, specialized content. 3. Examine problems and challenges. I don\u2019t know what you are writing about or if you are writing for yourself or your company. But either way, you might think you should shy away with any problems that you or your business are facing or challenges related to your industry.  However, tackling a problem head on may actually help you or your company seem more bold and trustworthy \u2013 and it can also help you and the people who rely on your content find ways to solve problems. For example, if you focus on digital marketing, you might think you shouldn\u2019t emphasize the fact that ad blockers are on the rise today. However, instead of shying away from the challenge, try to address it head on and offer solutions to how to get around ad-blockers. Instead of seeming like a Debbie Downer, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll end up as a thought leader. Keep on top of challenges and roadblocks that seem to arise in your industry \u2013 they are great topics for fresh blogs. 4. Read comments. One good way to come up with content ideas that people are looking for is by reading the comments on blogs in your industry. Often, when people finish a blog about a topic they\u2019re interested in, they\u2019ll write further questions or concerns they have about what they read. Browse through the comments on popular blogs, and you\u2019ll likely stumble across a repeated or urgent sounding concern. Then, you can create content on that topic \u2013 which means you content will be meeting an existing demand. Win-Win.  It\u2019s worth mentioning that the company I work for is all about ideas, we created an integrated research dashboard that helps you harvest your best ideas from one screen. Naturally, we write a ton about ideas and creativity, and you can check out our content or our tool over Oz Content.  ",
