            "answer_text": "The best way to write a five paragraph essay is to write an outline. First paragraph:This includes an introduction to the topic, theme, or any relative information. This paragraph can also contain your thesis, claim, or argument. The three body paragraphs should either support your argument or more clearly describe the overall topics of the essay in relation to the requirements of the paper. Conclusion! This is actually my favorite part of the essay. Clearly highlight your core concepts and reword them in a way to incoporate an illuminating understanding of the paper as a whole! The key to a great paper is revision! Proof read and use peer editors for grammatical/spelling errors. Good luck! ",
