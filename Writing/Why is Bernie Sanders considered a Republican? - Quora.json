            "answer_text": "He is not. When he is not running for president, he considers himself an independent, though he caucuses with Democrats. In no way is Bernie Sanders a Republican. He is in favor of things like increased government intervention and raising taxes, as well as cutting defense spending and taking down corruption. In terms of our American politics, he is indeed very left-wing. If there were any Republican quality about him, and this is a real stretch I have to make here, it\u2019s that he is constantly belittled by the corporate Democratic institution. Media sources like CNN and NBC criticize him and influence their polls so as to undermine the real popularity he has in the country. Why do they do this? Well, as places like these tend to be kept under a tight watch by a wealthy group of Democratic elites, they make sure to destroy Bernie Sanders\u2019s anti-corporate \u201cradical\u201d views by undermining them and making them seem to their base like either borderline Communism or less popular than they are. Bernie is a reflection of the new wave in our nation of Progressiveness and Anti-Corruption, and all that\u2019s left now is for that Corruption to concede to the people. ",

            "answer_text": "No, he is technically an independent running as a Democratic Socialist. Which is not a Communist, fascist, socialist, etc.. A democratic socialist is a person who is a cross between socialism and capitalism where he believes that certain things that every american needs such as health INSURANCE should be a public good while the healthcare system should remain as a private good competing for business. Also things like roads, police, fire, military, national power grid, parks, public schools, colleges, etc should be a public goods since they provide equality of opportunity to those who generally can not afford it today due to costs but need it in order to get a better job. A democratic socialist also believes in living wages so \u201cwe the people\u201d do not need to supplement the corporations by providing food stamps, public housing, etc. Basically so a person can actually live in today\u2019s world and be able to afford the basic necessities. So another example is the government controls the means of production of the roads but the cars you buy to use the roads are controlled by private companies. Sanders wants to fix the roads and help give subsidies to people so they can buy new cars that do not have a combustible engines where the car companies fight over you business to buy their version of that new electric car.
