            "answer_text": "I think Flash has been disabled in Chrome (what I\u2019m running) for quite some time. When I go to a site that uses Flash I see the plugin gray box in the flash box. And I\u2019m not even sure about that, because it seems to be that Flash has been irrelevant for like 5+ years now. No professional sites have used it since then.But, I do recall all those game sites, and a lot of games were very cute. It\u2019s sad to see all that effort not being immediately accessible anymore. So much creative work. Some of those games I\u2019ve seen rematerialize in remakes in Android apps. Like sidescrollers with cars with suspensions having to drive across a 2D landscape, stuff like that. ",

            "answer_text": "Websites will just adapt to the change. They will rework their applications in order to run with Javascript instead of the old and clunky Flash. Maybe some games or animations will be lost, but this is it. I\u2019m sorry since I have fond memories of playing Flash games, but it\u2019s the ultimate truth. Something will be lost in the transition and left behind. ",
