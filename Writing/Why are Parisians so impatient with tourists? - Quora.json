            "answer_text": "So, first of all, real Parisians don't exist much anymore. People who live here for more than ten years are a rarity. People who where born here, even more rare. My family was Parisian for more than four centuries, and I remember in school being the only one not coming \u201chome\u201d for the holidays. Home was Paris, and I was the only one, all the others where from some other part of France. People mostly come to Paris for tourism or for a job, and since it's a very expensive city, they very grumpy. So this is one reason. Most tourists also act like if Parisians are here to enhance their vacation experience. Let me give you an example. When I was young I had to dress properly for work. I lived in Montmartre. I\u2019m a Parisienne, so, I have a cute little outfit, a beret even, and every morning like anybody else in Paris, I buy a newspaper, and get my breakfast at my favorite caf\u00e9, a croissant, and an expresso, if possible enjoying it on the terrace. A normal, quiet moment before the hussle and bustle of work. And then\u2026every morning, as soon as they got out of the metro, up to five times per morning, tourist would come to me, and without introducing themselves or caring if they were a disturbance at all, without saying please or \u201cdo you speak English?\u201d, they would yell at me \u201c WHERE\u2019S THE SACR\u00c9 C\u0152UR!?\u201d. There\u2019s signage giving directions. I'm having the only quiet moment of the day. In the end I would tell the direction before they asked the question, and often they would find this offensive. Sorry. You were the fith in 5 minutes. I was at home, doing the stuff you came to see, I know, but I'm a person, trying to live my life, and tourists treat me like a worker paid to give them directions. I'm not. I'm sorry, but since I made no money from the tourists, since they were slowly destroying my neighborhood ( have you ever heard of trashcans, saying bonjour or merci, or even dress properly in what is it,after all, the city of fashion?)\u2026.I\u2019m usually a very polite little lady, but I got fed up. Parisians would like, sometimes, to be able to live a quiet life. They not really patient with self entitled people, too. And like anyb, they\u2019re not really good at talking before coffee :D As a tourist, I try to remember it too when I\u2019m travelling. I\u2019m polite and I make sure not to disturbe people or get in the way. I got people in NY and Goa to be super sweet with me, and wasn't a given! Everyone will be nice, anywhere, if you\u2019re polite and patient. ",

            "answer_text": "By way of introduction, I'm originally from America, and have been living and working in Paris for two years now. First, I don't think that Parisians are noticeably more impatient with tourists than they are with each other. I wouldn't necessarily say that they are naturally more impatient than others are; they just show their impatience more. In America, in the service industry, we're taught not to be rude to customers and impatient, regardless of how we really feel. And I don't think the perceived impatience by Parisians should be considered as 'rude', per se. At first, I thought that Parisians were globally ruder than Americans. Now, after two years of being here, I think 'less friendly' is a better word than 'rude' is to describe Parisians (or the French for that matter). And keep in mind that I'm NOT saying that the French are unfriendly; I'm simply saying that, generally, they are less friendly than their American counterparts. And I believe their level of friendliness is a cultural phenomenon and not something that is malicious in any way. You see, the French are more wary and suspicious of strangers (anyone outside of family or close circle of friends) than Americans are. In America, there's a casualness that is culturally, well, American, which allows Americans to address strangers in a familiar, friendly way. If we know someone's first name and we've just met them for the first time, chances are we will begin addressing that stranger on a first name basis with reckless impunity. And we will go beyond the first name thing; we will smile broadly, shake hands warmly, invite strangers into our lives. The French don't operate that way ; they look at such American casualness with a degree of suspicion : i.e. \"Why is this complete stranger talking to me as if I'm a long-lost friend that he hasn't seen for a long time? He must want something, and is clearly hiding his true motivations behind that grin of his. What does he really want from me?\" And the French don't like being 'taken advantage of' in any way (I mean, who does?), so up comes the wall of 'frostiness'. So essentially, there's a bit of a culture clash that goes both ways and collides somewhere in the middle: Americans are ultra-casual and the French are traditionally formal. Our casual, full-throttle friendliness is often misinterpreted as something more than what it is whereas the frostiness that Americans may feel from the French is usually just an extra layer of protection that guards them from the perceived hidden motivations of strangers. In the vicious cycle of misunderstandings, Americans often misinterpret their frostiness for malicious rudeness. And thus, cliches continue to persist. For better understanding, each side needs to put itself into the other's shoes. It helps to try to find out where the other is coming from, culturally-speaking. ",
