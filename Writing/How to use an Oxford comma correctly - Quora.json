            "answer_text": "This sentence makes you a deeply upsetting Messiah, albeit one who could sell out stadiums: I\u2019d like to thank my parents, Taylor Swift and God. This sentence lists three separate elements, although if the order of importance is ascending, it\u2019s still not clear why you want to thank Taylor Swift more vigorously than your parents \u2014 but that\u2019s your problem, not the sentence\u2019s: I\u2019d like to thank my parents, Taylor Swift, and God. There is a famous example that purports to be similar, using the example of Nelson Mandela, an 800-year-old demigod, and a dildo collector. However, this blog post explains why merely adding the Oxford comma wouldn\u2019t solve the problem, and the writer would probably want to reverse the order of the elements anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201cOxford Comma\u201d (something I always use because it eliminates ambiguity) is the \u201cextra\u201d comma added before the penultimate item in a list of three or more items. \u201cJohn, Mary and Paul went to the concert together\u201d. (No Oxford comma). \u201cJohn, Mary, and Paul went to the concert together\u201d (with Oxford comma). In one of the other answers, Gwyn McVay offers the example of the ambiguity that can arise by not using the Oxford comma: \u201cI\u2019d like to thank my parents, Taylor Swift and God.\u201d Not using it in the above sentence means that you could legitimately read the sentence as meaning that your parents were Taylor Swift and God (though imaging Taylor Swift as the Virgin Mary boggles the mind\u2026).
