            "answer_text": "You can start by looking at this question I just picked apart for you, with apologies to the OP: Loretta B DeLoggio's answer to Do you ever have to look up the questions you've been asked on Google? Placement of modifying phrases and subclauses is particularly important in raising the level of your writing from average to excellent. As I told the OP, I've never been asked a question on Google. I also never have to look up questions; I just open Quora and the questions pop right up under my nose! However, I often do have to look up information on Google or wiki in order to answer questions on Quora. Notice that placement of modifiers as closely as possible to the word or phrase that they are modifying helps make your writing much clearer, which is a basic requirement for eloquence. ",

            "answer_text": "Respectfully, there are better things to be than eloquent: Clear. Effective. Relevant. Relatable, and many more. The desire for eloquence usually means that we\u2019re trying to impress others. But people are usually most impressed with speakers (and writers) who understand their audience or readers, offer content that\u2019s valuable, and communicate in a relaxed, person-to-person way. Big words and complex sentence structures can backfire on a communicator. But you\u2019ll never go wrong by respecting your audience and sincerely trying to give THEM a good experience, whether your words are written or spoken. ",
