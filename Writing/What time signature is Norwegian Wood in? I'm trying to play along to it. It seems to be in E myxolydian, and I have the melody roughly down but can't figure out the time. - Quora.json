            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, I don't have a handy score of \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d to refer to, but I have just been listening to my recording of it, and I would describe this song as being written in 6/8 time. This is similar to 3/4 time, but 3/4 time (a fast waltz time, at the speed that Norwegian Wood is played) would mean that there are three single beats (crotchets) in each bar. This song, in 6/8 time, has six quavers in each bar, divided into two groups of three, with a strong beat at the beginning of each group. A quaver is, lengthwise, half of a crotchet. It sounds a bit like it is in three time, but no; not quite. In the eighteenth century, 6/8 time was sometimes described as \u201cSicilienne\u201d time, after the elegant dance which featured a dotted (slightly lengthened) note on each first note of each group of three quavers. You can hear a tendency towards this dotting in the guitar accompaniment to Norwegian Wood, especially between each phrase of the minor key part of the tune ( where he \u201cnoticed there wasn't a chair\u201d and he \u201ccrawled off to sleep in the bath\u201d ). So, six half-notes in each bar is your rhythmic cue. Emphasising the strong beats slightly, and the tendency towards dotting the strong beats, will give the song forward motion and lilt. ",

The reason you\u2019re struggling to \u2018think the rhythm\u2019 is that the words fit the music in a very idiosyncratic way. Once you start to think of it in four slow beats, it will become clearer. ",
