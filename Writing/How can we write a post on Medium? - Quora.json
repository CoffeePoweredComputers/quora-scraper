            "answer_text": " Three years ago, I decided to start writing (almost) every day on Medium and it was one of the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. My background was in freelance design and I wanted to write a book. After receiving advice from a friend who had been writing for a while, I decided to instead start a Medium publication called The Imperfectionist. What started as one post turned into a posting schedule of 2\u20133 times each week. Over the years, this turned into a solid body of writing that I could leverage for other opportunities (guest contributing, speaking opportunities, even paid gigs). At this point, I am focused on turning this blog into a platform for my first book about making your own ideas happen. When you start writing on Medium, my advice is to remember the following quote from Ernest Hemingway: \u201cThe first draft of anything is shit.\u201d Once you\u2019re ready to get started, publish your first post using this framework for getting started. After using it every day for three years now, I really do believe Medium is the easiest, most accessible site for drafting, editing, publishing, and sharing your writing online. In terms of your blogging topics, I feel like the best subjects for satisfy all three of the following categories: Something you are passionate aboutSomething that you have unique perspective onSomething that is useful for othersPersonally, I created my blog around sharing how to make your own ideas happen because: I am extremely passionate about helping others create their own paths and pursue their own ideasI\u2019ve been freelancing/pursuing my own ideas for my entire professional career (almost a decade)Throughout this time, I\u2019ve met countless individuals who are struggling with common issues (how to position their idea, how to remove yourself as a roadblock, etc.) and they fall into three categories: 1) students, 2) independent creatives, and 3) people who work in corporate settingsAdmittedly, this may take more introspection on your part to find out what satisfies these three areas. Once you do, it will motivate you to blog consistently, which is, by far, the most important thing for growing an audience. Here is the process I\u2019ve used in order to grow an audience on Medium: Write every day for at least 30 minutes and publish 2\u20133 times a week on The Imperfectionist.Set up a newsletter using MailChimp and Upscribe, a service that allows you to crate embeddable email capture forms. Include a form at the end of each article.I use my weekly newsletter to provide value through tidbits of advice for making ideas happen while also sharing early content from my book (outlines, sections, etc.)Continue building this community for the release of future products and services (an engaged audience is always better when it comes to offering products).Don\u2019t forget: creating and sustaining a high-quality blog is a long-term commitment. Hopefully this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about Medium or blogging in general. Cheers and good luck! ",

I know making $200 isn\u2019t a very big deal but still making money from a platform just because of sharing your knowledge or experience is worth trying for.

            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t enter in the details of opening an account or menu items. Too much to tell, but you can probably easily sort out that stuff. If you already have an external blog, probably the best thing is to continue publishing your stories there and then import them in Medium. That way, search engines will continue to index the stories on your blog. Else, you just have to hit new story. Main advice: Good title and good featured picture, as you would do on any other blog. Remember that readers will click only because of those. Title is most important, of course, but don\u2019t neglect the picture (and put the credit reference above it).Use all the 5 tags, and in a strategic way. Keep a list of your preferred tags and try to focus your articles on some of them. That way, you will reach a focused audience and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to earn the Best Writer award for one or more of the topics. Include 1\u20132 tags related with the title (same words is best).Read and comment (appropriately\u2026), a lot. This is fundamental. Else, nobody will see you. Use tags in comments too. Comments count as stories.Don\u2019t be stingy with following interesting authors. Sometimes they follow you back, and this is important at the beginning, to build a minimum number of followers.It\u2019s not necessary to publish daily but it\u2019s a good practice to publish at least twice per week, else you\u2019ll have too few possibilities of being visible.Don\u2019t be discouraged by low stats. Nobody will read your first stories, unless you are already notorious.Once you know the basics, submit to publications. Read those publication, see if they have \u201csubmission guidelines\u201d and follow instructions. Usually they ask for drafts (not published stories). If they won\u2019t answer in a couple of days, the story is probably rejected, but sometimes it can take more. It\u2019s up to you to wait or submit to another publications (or publish on your own), and maybe retry in future with a different story. The first time, they have to add you as a writer. After that, you submit stories to publications from the menu.About writing, all the usual advice apply but the two most important for me are: Have your message clear before writing. If it\u2019s not clear for you, the article will be a mess. Readers will notice and it won\u2019t have an impact.Catchy titles are ok but don\u2019t fool your readers. Always deliver what is promised by the title.",

            "answer_text": "just go to Medium dot com, create an account. You don\u2019t need to pay a monthly fee as you get a few free articles per month and your writing account is part of that. If you want to be paid for your writing, join the partner program which is also free. You\u2019ll need to setup a Stripe account (also free) which is the means by which they pay you. From there, just start writing in the platform. Personally I write in Google docs and copy my work onto medium. You can add photos, links, headlines etc. Create a Title for each article with a tagline. Try to make the article title catchy and raise a question in the reader\u2019s mind so that they want to find out more. If you have a blog, you can post the article both on medium and your blog, but make sure to add a canonical link in Medium so that Google doesn\u2019t penalise you for the double-up. If your writing is good enough, you might get curated which will put your article on the homepage, so you\u2019ll get more views. It takes time to get success but keep going with publishing and you\u2019ll get there. There\u2019s a really good interview with a successful writer on youtube. Its on the digital nomad TV channel. I found it very inspiring. The writer is making over 10k per month on medium. ",

It\u2019s a terrific experience to look for the articles that you might have written yourself, and then to use your powers of observation to see what you can learn about why some got a better reception than others.

Publish direct or see if an online publication on Medium will publish your work. Pay super careful attention to the tags which you can utilize. Read about Medium Membership. It really is too much to condense here. But, I repeat myself, go to Medium \u2013 a place to read and write big ideas and important stories. And research. Good luck. It\u2019s a lot of fun and you will meet incredible fellow writers. ",

The beauty of Medium is that you need to do very minimal formatting to make your post look amazing. If you need to, you can share your draft with others before you publish it, get feedback, make changes and then hit publish.   I find Medium much easier to write in than even my WordPress site. If you're undecided about what to write and the structure of your post (lists vs. essays for instance), start reading some posts and following collections on Medium. Good luck! ",
