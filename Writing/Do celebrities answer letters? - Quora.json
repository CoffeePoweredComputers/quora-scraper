            "answer_text": "Sometimes they answer though their work but that is only if your letter inspires their art. And this will normally only happen if you get high first.=) I did write Stephen King once, and he didn\u2019t respond personally but I did get a personal typewritten reply from his secretary which was nice. She said he used to write his fans back but eventually stopped because it took up too much time from book writing. So sometimes in the beginning they do answer but get too busy. These days they have adopted social media. Personally though I think letters deserve a response more because they cost 50 cents to mail But times are changing. ",
