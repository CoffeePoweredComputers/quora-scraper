            "answer_text": "An argumentative essay might seem very easy to write at first. You have a point and a counterpoint then you argue your position. However, you have to provide solid facts and evidence for both points and then come to your own conclusions in the argumentative essay. Here are some steps to successful argumentative essay writing, Find a Good Topic: To write an effective argumentative essay, you must first find a topic that you are interested in. But it can\u2019t be just any topic. It has to be one where there is no absolute answer but only two sides of an issue. Look at Both Sides of an Issue and Take a Position: After you have found your topic, you need to look at both sides of an issue and make bullet points for both. Begin with the side that you will eventually argue against. This will normally help you to think of more strong points to support your argument. Get Evidence for Both Sides: Once you have picked an appropriate argumentative essay topic, you need to gather proper evidence. This means not just doing a Google or Wikipedia search. While these are great tools to use in the preliminary stage, you need more reputable sources to write a convincing argumentative essay. Look up scholarly essays and books on your topic and use them in your essay. Begin Writing: Once you\u2019ve gathered all your evidence, you are ready to begin writing. After you\u2019re done writing the body, wrap up both arguments while clearly favoring one over the other. You can go through with best online writing service for any kind of writing help for your argument essay writings. ",

Then decide the point of view of both the sides and then plot the whole scenario on the mentioned characters. Although, many people are focusing on hiring the ghostwriters for this purpose and their are many agencies on the internet who are providing this sort of service but, I recommend Hire a Professional Book Writer - Book Writing Inc.
