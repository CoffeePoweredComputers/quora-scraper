            "answer_text": "When we write direct speech, we always finish the sentence according to the mood of statement in the inverted commas. He said, \u201cWhere are you going to?\u201d She said, \u201cI have passed the exam.\u201d Why did he say, \u201cI don't agree with you.\u201d Where did he say, \u201c Why do you come here?\u201d What's about the punctuation marks after those inverted commas? We know that all the examples are the complex sentences and the sentences in the inverted commas (the reported speeches) are noun clauses. The reporting statements (out side \u201c..\u201d) are the main clauses. We never think to put marks at the end of the (complex) sentences according to the reporting speeches (the main clauses). So please tell me in comments what marks should be put at the ends of the sentences. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "In a nutshell, the use of Punctuation marks, to a greater extent is as much a case of rules as that of taste and common sense. Leaving few of them ( Full stop, Question marks, Note of Exclamation) apart, Punctuation hasn't been in the mainstream among school goers, for a self made belief that students will get an insight into the field by themselves. This trend, I think, is common in south east Asia, more or less. In the light of your question, in my book, the use of Comma and Semi- Colon get the first place, so far as common mistakes are concerned. You will be pleased to look at the sentence below: \u201cOne day a black dog was sitting on a bench in a room of my school when a white cat entered into that room with a rat in its mouth\u201d. Such a long sentence without a single Punctuation mark reminds me of a ship ,which has no harbour to reach. The use of Comma is comparatively a big issue before the learner, though they know that it is used to establish the smallest PAUSE. But they, in general, fail to identify the location. Supposedly, if an absolute Participle phrase occurs -- e.g. The meeting being over, we all went home.The Participle phrase here requires (,) after it. Similarly, a comma is used between a principal clause and an adverb clause in order to separate it. In the same line, a sentence beginning with either an adverb or adv. phrase, (, ) a comma comes after it e.g. Unfortunately, he failed. There are some more situations that a learner is expected tobe well aware of. The use of semi- Colon, in my opinion, invites more attention. I would like to quote a line -- There is tears for his love; joy, for his fortune; honour for his valour; and death, for his ambition ( Shakespeare). Semi- Colon denotes a longer pause than the comma. This much here. ",
