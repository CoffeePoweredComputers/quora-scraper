(There is potentially a verb comm, from communicate, which would have a present participle comming, which would make \u2018She is comming.\u2019 mean \u2018She is performing communication.\u2019 But I don\u2019t see it in the dictionary.)

So I guess that from a merely semantic point of view a subject+verb phrase with come is not wrong in itself. Then we should figure out whether that phrase makes sense. If I heard someone utter I am coming A natural question would be where are you going. Come is used in vulgar slang as I ejaculate so it can be misinterpreted. ",
