            "answer_text": "This is a fantastic question. I think there is only one way to build a career in an emerging field like Transmedia where there is no set path and there is no actual \"industry\" to  support a pre-defined career. Make Connections With Other Transmedia Storytellers: The only stable path in the rapidly changing worlds of storytelling is the web of connections you make with other people with similar goals. In larger cities there are transmedia groups and meet-ups. Transmedia Los Angeles and Transmedia Austin are two groups on Facebook. Many figures in transmedia write blogs and maintain a presence on social media. You will gain credibility and notoriety in transmedia by getting involved in and contributing to actual projects, so reach out to these people.  Ultimately the opportunities will emerge from  collaborations with the other individuals in the field, and those opportunities cannot be planned for or mapped out because they haven't been invented yet. The only possible career path is the one you create for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there and thank you for asking such a brilliant question! The emerging field of Transmedia is still very much in a state of flux; with different definitions of what we mean by \u2018Transmedia\u2019 and as many different opinions on how to develop Transmedia as there are examples of it! Many large and medium-sized organisations are still in denial that any such hoodoo exists and are therefore way behind innovators in the field. This results in there currently being few opportunities that are explicitly \u2018Transmedia\u2019. This may, on the face of it, seem like bad news, but it isn\u2019t. Transmedia is an amazing craft and an absolute treasure trove of potential. If you have a passion for Transmedia and work at becoming an authority in this fresh new arena of media content, you can be one of the innovators who creates the industry. The field of Transmedia needs leaders, pioneers and originators. It needs those who not only appreciate what it is, but also how to leverage it to get results. It needs those who do not think in the same way as others\u2014those who realise this is not just a fancy version of multimedia, but way of contextualising media in the audiences environments and their lives. If you can truly see how the world is being changed by Transmedia, don\u2019t sit back and wait for anyone to fit you into their version of what Transmedia should be\u2026 start innovating, start creating and (even if your are limited by resources at the moment), just get yourself out there\u2026 the jobs, the opportunities and the career will soon find you. I sincerely hope this helps\u2014and enjoy developing what will be an amazing career! ",
