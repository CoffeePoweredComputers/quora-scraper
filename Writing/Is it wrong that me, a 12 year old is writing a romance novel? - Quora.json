            "answer_text": "There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with a 12 year old writing a romance novel, though I imagine you won\u2019t want to do an \u201cadult\u201d one since you\u2019re probably not overly familiar with that sort of material. The one thing any writer wants to do is to write about what they know or are capable of studying and/or understanding, and somehow I have a feeling your parents don\u2019t really want you to know/study/understand that sort of content just yet. So yeah, probably stick to sweet and clean for now just to avoid catching that sort of flack. You\u2019re better off to understand the emotional aspect before that other stuff anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not wrong, dear. You can write what you want\u2014lots of people your age try to write romance. It\u2019s a way of examining the concept of romance and looking at feelings that you are still too young to act upon. But remember that you personally know very little about romance yet. I suggest you talk to some adults, and ask them how they found love, if they are willing to talk about it\u2014how they met, what attracted them to each other, and so on. Don\u2019t ask for details about their physical reactions. Those are none of your business. Another way to explore romance is to write fanfiction about your favorite couples in the books or shows or movies you are into. Romance is hard even for some adults to write, so don\u2019t worry much about that. ",
