            "answer_text": "A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening and somewhere we have lost that balance and now part of it is due to technology these Smartphones. Almost people are likely to text their friends than they talk to face to face. Many of you have heard a lot of advice on this like Look the person in the eyeThink of interesting things, topics to discuss in advanceLook nod and smile to show that you're paying attentionRepeat back what you've just heard, summarize itI want you to forget all of that, it is crap. There's no reason to learn how to show, you're paying attention if you are infact paying attention.  Ergo,I have some basic rules but honestly if you pick any one rule and master it- you'll enjoy having a great conversation Everytime. Don't multi-taskI don't mean that just set down your cell phones, car keys or whatever in your hands. I mean Be present, be in that moment don't be thinking about the argument you had with your boss. If you want to get out of that conversation then get out of that conversation but don't be half in this and half in that. 2. Don't pontificate If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response, argument or pushback or growth, Write a blog. You need to enter every conversation assuming that you've something to learn. 3. Use open ended questions In this case, start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question, you're likely to get a simple answer out. Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like, \u201cwhat was that like\u201d, \u201cHow did that feel\u201d. Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it and you're going to get a much more interesting response. 4. Go with the flow That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind. Stories and ideas are going to come to your mind, you need to let them come and let them go. 5. If you don't know, say that you don't know Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR are much aware that they're going on the record and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk shouldn't be cheap. 6. Don't equate your experience with their\u2019s If they are talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member. If they are talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate the job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual and more importantly, it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you suffered. 7. Try not to repeat yourself It's condescending and it's really boring and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations or in conversations with kids. We have a point to make so we just keep rephrasing it over and over. Don't do that. 8. Stay out of the weeds Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the years, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind. They don't care. What they care about is you, they care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. 9. Listen I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said \u201cif your mouth is open, you're not listening\u201d And Calvin Coolidge said, \u201cNo man ever listened his way out of his job\u201d Why do we not listen to each other ? We'd rather talk, what I'm talking, I'm right, I'm in control. This is what they all think.But there's another reason: we get distracted. The average person talks at about 225 words per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute so, our minds are filling in those 275 words. And look i know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but If you can't do that then you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out barely related sentences in the same place. Stephen coven said it beautifully Most of us don't listen with the intend to understand, we listen with the intent to reply. 10. Be brief Be interested in other people Everyone has some hidden amazing thing about them. Go out, talk to people, listen to them and most importantly Be prepared to be amazed. Source: Tedx ",

            "answer_text": "Some examples before we move on to main content ! Phone rings\u2026 Unknown number :-o ? What if it is someone who speaks very Fluent English ? No let it ring ! ( Who knew it might be a very good opportunity for you from someone who was at the crucial point of making a decision whether to give you the opportunity or not ! Now since you didn\u2019t pick up ! Hmmm\u2026 )Made a very good presentation at the office. But you have a competition.Boss says okay 2 minutes to both of you ! Explain the project. By now most of you would be knowing the story from here in your minds !And many more examples can be given !!! Well the need for communication skills is so important in our lives. It gives you extraordinary confidence within yourself. No fear in dealing with new people across the walks of life. Therefore there feels the need to improve upon this aspects for sure ! Some of the ways which this can be achieved are : Master the art of body language : The person conveys nearly 50% of the things he needs to convey through the actions and his body postures. That means that the majority of what you say is communicated not through words, but through physical cues.  Making people feel involved : People often like to hear to someone who accepts to hear them as well. Therefore an important thing to remember always is to discuss and interact with people. Ask for their opinions, experiences etc. \u201cListen more than you talk.\u201d This is what Richard Branson tells business people who want to connect with others. To communicate effectively, first listen to what others have to say. Then you can provide a thoughtful answer that shows you have taken those ideas into account.  Let go off the shyness in you : Most of the people are very shy to speak up thinking that they might be made fun off in public. But actually no one cares. If you are seen taking interest in learning something, majority of the people will be willing to help you. Speak among your friends. Ask from them whether these combination of words suit into this scenario or should I be using these words in this context etc.  Timing does Matter : While some of their jokes might not be appropriate for the workplace, standup comedians are certainly effective communicators. Comedians like Louis CK, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle are able to host compelling 90-minute comedy shows, in part because they have mastered The Art of Timing !  Be Specific and To the point : People out there don\u2019t like to hear bullshit ! The weight of your words is inversely proportional to their number.A small, but effective speech is enough to gather attention and communicate with the crowd. Remember to communicate using nonverbal and verbal cues. Listen carefully to what others have to say, and over-communicate in novel ways to ensure the content of the conversation sticks with the audience.  Thank You ! ",
