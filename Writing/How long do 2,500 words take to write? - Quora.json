What took you so long to write only three words? asked the enquirer. The author replied. I cound not decide which order to put them in. The time spent actually writing is far less than the time spent imagining the story. Today I have written the first 250 words of my story of 2500 words. I have 10 days to improve and expand those 250 words by 100% to reach my wordcount target. ",
