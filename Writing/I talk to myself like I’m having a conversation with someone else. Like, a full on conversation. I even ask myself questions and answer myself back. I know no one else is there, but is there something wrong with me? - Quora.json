            "answer_text": "Short answer is no nothing is wrong with you. Many people talk to themselves like that even I do, psychologist say it is a sign of intelligence that your mind is able to do things much quicker than normal people. No doubt you also talk faster than anyone you know. Talking to oneself is also a great way to make intense situations less complicated because you are able to hear your own calculations of what to do next. I do it at work all the time and people ask me why I do it, why? Because it helps me complete things quicker rather if I just sat and did it in my head. You could also be needing someone to just chat to aswell as myself I get lonely sometimes and find myself asking myself questions mainly because I notice well no one is around so who's their to say I'm weird or crazy?. Or You are just simply filling in social voids, in other words it's the brains way of saving yourself from loneliness. You might even do it because there aren't any other intelligent people to talk to and who better to understand your own thinking than yourself. Don't stop doing it because you think something is wrong with you because nothing is wrong with you unless you have been taking some trippy mind warping drugs then nothing is wrong, especially that you have noticed it and are able to question it that just proves more that you are healthy and mentally stable. Anyway Those are some possible reasons you might talk to yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I sure hope not (\u201cis there something wrong with me?\u201d) - I do the same thing! Have out-loud conversations with parties I know are not present. This is simply a way to clarify your own thoughts. Your thoughts are jumbled together in your brain, overlapping, jumping around from topic to topic; they are amorphous things, ideas that are fragile. By putting a voice to them, you are adding a layer of cognition to a thought, isolating it, so to speak, endeavoring to focus on that particular thought. Sometimes all it takes is a few words or phrase to solidify a thought in my head, as in, \u201cI know that; no need to get uppity!\u201d or the much more dangerous reply, \u201cFuck off!\u201d (I say dangerous because I may be able to utter the phrase out loud in the privacy of my own living room, where saying it to the person I\u2019m thinking about would spell undesirable consequences I may not be willing to take on). No, there is nothing wrong with you. Keep on with your private (out loud) conversations. Lechaim! ",
