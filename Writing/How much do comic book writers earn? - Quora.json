            "answer_text": "Honestly i am writer, and my main problem wasnt how much i will make it was a matter of time, idea that you are asking someone to work for free while he could do something payable in that time. 90% of artists out there are asking for money upfront EVEN IF IT\u2019T KICKSTARTER PROJECT. Drawings are +100$per page or less usually. There are even retarded people that won\u2019t tell you they will charge upfront until project almost start.
