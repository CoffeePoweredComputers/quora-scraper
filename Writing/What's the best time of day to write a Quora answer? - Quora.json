            "answer_text": "I see increase in activity at 4 times during the typical week workday. I come in in my morning (East Coast of the US) to see that Europeans and early East Coast risers have commented, upvoted, answered. Activity ticks up about 10AM East coast time. When the West Coast crowd starts in at their 8AM, I see it increase steadily until around their 10AM, my 1PM, at which point other East coasters are also having their lunch and we get a pile of activity. East Coast evening, post work, then one more uptick at about my 10PM, West Coast post-work.  Presumably, after I turn my computer off, the Europeans do the same. So - early morning, mid morning, after lunch, after dinner, before bed all get quick upticks. We all seem to have a 5-Quora-a-day habit. ",

That moment when you feel your head \"I know that. I've been there. I've done that. I've gone through that phase\". That's the best time. You have to answer that question before that feeling wears off. Else you won't be able to answer it with a 100% commitment to the question and to your answer. If you are asking in terms of getting more views on your answers, then I have often felt it is better to write on the weekends. I mostly do the opposite though. I write here mostly on week days as I am at office and have continuos access to internet. During the weekends I go to my home town and barely get time to write on Quora.  ",
