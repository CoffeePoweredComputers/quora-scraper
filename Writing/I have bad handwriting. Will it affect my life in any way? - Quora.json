            "answer_text": "According to figures, 61 per cent of teachers believe there has been \u201cdeterioration in the quality of handwriting among students in the last five years\u201dAlmost two-thirds \u2013 64 per cent \u2013 admit that illegible writing \u201chas prevented them from awarding the full marks a student deserved\u201d, while 35 per cent said they had found emoticons in exam answers.It emerged that 82 per cent of teachers believe students are losing traditional skills such as handwriting and mental arithmetic \u201cdue to over-reliance on technology\u201d.Margaret White, a handwriting expert, said: \u201cLack of practice \u2013 when you aren\u2019t using a pen and paper to take notes on a regular basis \u2013 means it\u2019s easy to slip into bad writing habits, such as gripping the pen too tightly or applying too much pressure on the paper.\u201cThis can make writing uncomfortable, not to mention inefficient, so it\u2019s unsurprising nearly half of students tell us they suffer from aching hands or pins and needles in their arms after lengthy exams. Fifteen per cent even report getting blisters.\u201dStudents themselves admitted to shunning handwriting.Some 89 per cent of those responding to the poll said they now revised using laptops and computers, while more than half deemed the \u201ctraditional method of note-taking with a pen and paper outdated\u201d.
