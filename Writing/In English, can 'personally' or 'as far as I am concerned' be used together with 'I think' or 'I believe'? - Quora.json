            "answer_text": "Personally, I think \"personally\" goes fine with \"I think\" or \"I believe\". It's a good choice if you need to disambiguate the \"in my subjective opinion\" sense of think/believe from the \"as far as I know\" sense.  On the other hand, as far as I'm concerned, it's not useful to combine \"as far as I'm concerned\" with \"I think\" or \"I believe\". If you're using the phrase literally, to limit your opinion to the aspects of the situation that concern you, then it's redundant. And if you're using the phrase figuratively to mean \"in my not-so-humble opinion\" then following it with an \"I think\" is anticlimactic. ",

            "answer_text": "Saying \"personally, I believe\" is redundant. If it's what you believe, who else but you is believing that. It's wordy and unnecessary. I encourage my students not to write \"I think.\" If that's what you're writing, and you're not crediting another source, we understand it's what you think or believe.  Saying \"as far as I am concerned\" says, for me, \"I'm speaking for myself, and no one else\" or \"I am not voicing the opinion of the group.\"  But if you are telling me \"as far as I am concerned,\" I understand that what you think or believe. There is no need to spell it out. ",
