            "answer_text": "Well, first think about the type of character you have. You can always go to a translator and put in some sort of uncommon language, then translate an adjective describing your character into that language. If the language you chose does not use English letters, what I do is improvise the shapes of the symbols to make English letters out of the shapes. Sometimes I end up with words like Kae Mihn, other times Mjyquin, etc. Once you get your combination of letters, say it out loud and re-spell it for a name. If your chosen language does use English letters, just say it out loud and rearrange spelling. You can always go to either Fantasy name generators or Name Generator or another naming website to select random names, or if you have a letter in mind, like you really want your character\u2019s name to start with an M, search \u2018names that start with M.\u2019 if you want to get really into this last option, draw your character (or get someone else to do it for you) and look at them as you scroll through names. Sometimes people look like their name should be something specific. (someone thought my name was Stacey at an amusement park once. It\u2019s not.) Anyway, you will eventually find the perfect name for your character, so good luck until then! ",

            "answer_text": "Well.... you can take a page from a master... J.R.R Tolkien. This might sound... involved, but it could pay off in big ways. Create your own language.  Keep track of it... like a dictionary excel file.  Then, you can base names on words you've created.  I mean, the origin of the last name Cooper... someone who makes barrels.  How about Baker... I wonder what that family did way back when.  I know that sounds simplistic... ... but if your characters come from a harsh community, almost barbaric on the frontier, they might have a harsh language.  Something guttural... like Klingon or German.  Many hard consonants, K's and such.  From this hard language, you can then develop names that sound like your fictional words. Garen Tokaan, from the Tokaari clan, was raised to be the fourth generation of Tokaaris farmer in his district.  He was proud of his father, Gu'Klar and the farm he had helped build over the years.
