            "answer_text": "Which is David McCullough's best book? I have read all of David McCullough\u2019s books to date, from \u201cThe Johnstown Flood\u201d through \u201cThe Wright Brothers.\u201d And I\u2019m eagerly looking forward to reading \u201cThe Pioneers,\u201d when it comes out in May. I would recommend all of McCullough\u2019s books, but if forced to pick just one as his \u201cbest,\u201d I\u2019d pick:  \u201cJohn Adams\u201d is s full-realized, compulsively readable, flesh-and-blood portrait of our second president, who played many key roles in the foundation of the United States. Yet, while his name is known to most Americans, few Americans actually know much about him. Adams was a fascinating and complex man, and McCullough does an amazing job of bringing Adams to life, presenting him in context and as a fully-realized human being. It\u2019s little wonder that the book spent close to a year on national bestseller lists, including several months in the #1 spot. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a tough call. I haven\u2019t read all of his books but I intend to do so. In no particular order: The Path Between the Seas was very good. With McCullough\u2019s writing it feels like you are there observing the building of the Panama Canal. The Great Bridge also puts you in a position of watching the Brooklyn Bridge getting built. His love of research shines through everything McCullough writes and this is no exception. My favorite is The Johnstown Flood. So realistic you feel like you are tumbling down the mountain with the unfortunate victims. ",
