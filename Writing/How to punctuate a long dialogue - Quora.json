Quotation marks are used, and it\u2019s usually interspersed with action and description to help the reader track who is speaking but not using a lot of \u201cshe said,\u201d \u201che shrugged.\u201d Monologue is one person talking, and you punctuate that by giving an open quotation mark at the beginning of each paragraph to indicate the person is still speaking. Close the quotation when they are done. Ex. \u201cWe have all heard we should believe in ourselves, have faith in ourselves, but this advice assumes a key component. It assumes yourself is not a selfish, narcissistic moron. Come now. We both know the truth about you. \u201cWe are beasts, you and I, spiteful, vengeful, gloriously petty, and insufferably aloof. We don\u2019t seek truth, we seek affirmation of our current views. We order same day shipping without thinking of the overworked warehouse employees, the environmental impact, the Chinese slaves who manufactured the part. We rush to comment on issues we know little or nothing about. \u201cTo believe in oneself is to put undeserved faith in a finite, fallible being. It is to honor the irrational, and to celebrate a proven fool.\u201d ",
