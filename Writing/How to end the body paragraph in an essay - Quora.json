            "answer_text": "The body paragraphs make up the bulk of your essay. Each body paragraph should emphasize and support a particular point that parallels and advances the thesis presented in your introduction. The body paragraphs should expand on your supportive facts; you can use as many body paragraphs in your essay as you need to adequately support your thesis. When you conclude each paragraph, always tie it in to the next paragraph to help your essay flow for your reader. Decide what subject the body paragraph will be focused on to support the summary thesis presented in your introductory paragraph. Make sure the subject of the paragraph has a logical connection to the subject that the next paragraph will focus on. Blend the two subjects in the concluding sentence of the body paragraph you are working on so that you can move easily into the next subject. Conclude the last body paragraph of your essay with a sentence that summarizes the subject you elaborated on in that paragraph because the next paragraph will be your closing paragraph, which should summarize the conclusions related to the overall thesis rather than to specific points.
