            "answer_text": "You can find units on this structure in most upper intermediate or advanced students\u2019 books. The unit is usually called something along the lines of \u2018negative inversion\u2019 or \u2018emphasis\u2019. To add emphasis to a sentence, you can invert the usual word order so that it resembles the word order of a question and place a negative adverb at the beginning. I have never seen such a big cake. (normal) Never have I seen such a big cake. (emphatic) Your example happens to use more than one clause. These types of inversion only invert one clause in the sentence and have a set formula, (No sooner\u2026.than). (Another one is \u2018Not only\u2026.but she also\u2026.\u2019) Any tense-aspect can be used, although here past perfect is more common. Immediately after I had eaten, my stomach began to rumble. (normal) No sooner had I eaten my dinner than my stomach began to rumble. (emphatic) Other tense-aspects can be used, but they are less common and you need to be careful of the intentions.. No sooner does he smile sweetly, than he turns around to stab you in the back. (probably an annoying routine) No sooner will she walk in the door than she\u2019ll start foraging in the fridge. (probably a complaint) No sooner would he have finished one painting than he\u2019d start another. (probably of a deceased person) ",

            "answer_text": "1)We use past perfect and past indefinite tense 2) we also use both sentences as past indefinite tense . Please observe the following example: 1.) No sooner had he reached the station than the train left . The above sentence is constructed with past perfect tense and past indefinite tense. 2.) No sooner did he reach the station than the train left. The above both sentences are written with past indefinite tense (before and after than). As we used ( did) instead of had so we have used present form of verb (reach ) after did ,and after than the sentence has remained the same like(the train left). In conclusion it can be said that if we analyse the above two sentences in the 1)ist sentence we have used past perfect tense before (than ) and past indefinite after ( than) and 2)In the second sentence we have used past indefinite tense before (than)and also past indefinite after( than). Both sentences are grammatically correct. ",
