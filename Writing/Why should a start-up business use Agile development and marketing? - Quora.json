            "answer_text": "Startups are agile by necessity. It\u2019s not that they necessarily employ any particular flavor of agile, or have any prescribed processes (in fact, they almost certainly do not) but rather the part where there\u2019s short bursts of work and regular assessment and prioritization. Somewhere along the line, many people forgot the Agile Manifesto, and they started focusing more on the processes and tools than the individuals and interactions. \u201cWell, Scrum says we should use this tool, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d That level of prescriptive \u201cagile\u201d is literally antithetical to the agile manifesto. The first freaking emphasis of it! But look at how startups do operate. There isn\u2019t \u201cwe should do Scrum and be Agile!\u201d But there\u2019s a lot of \u201chey, since we\u2019re remote, what way of tracking simultaneous work is best for you all?\u201d See the individuals and interactions part of that? Working software is paramount. We have some feature that we want out, and we just need it out yesterday. I don\u2019t know exactly what the perfect response to someone updating 3 different clients at once and then trying to make another change is, just get it to work in a reasonable way and get it out thee door, we don\u2019t have time. Customer collaboration is so much more important than contract negotiation during the early phases. A lot of startup features wind up in there because someone at a company goes \u201cya know, we have like 10,000 people who do x, y, z, and it\u2019d be sweet if a product did a, b, c to completely cut that out for us.\u201d The last part of the manifesto is Responding to change over following a plan. Again, this is everything with a startup. It\u2019s not shrink-wrapped software anymore. When OfferUp sees that they\u2019re spending a fortune dealing with complaints over repeat offenders, they don\u2019t go \u201cfuck it, we have a plan!\u201d No, they put in a rating system, so buyers and sellers can see \u201coh, this weird shady message is from a guy with 5 one-star ratings. No thanks.\u201d And then no email to OfferUp. Don\u2019t let the existence of agile flavors define agile. That\u2019s really what this is. Look at the agile manifesto, and look separately how startups operate. There, you\u2019ll find a ton of overlap. There are many methodologies which tag themselves as agile, but between poor implementation and potentially heavy amounts of process, we often see a team hold a few more meetings, call itself agile, and make a miserable team. Let us not forget that the word agile was chosen because it is to be able to move quickly and nimbly. ",

            "answer_text": "The bulk of the answers submitted thus far show a very strong bias that equates \u201cstart-up business\u201d with \u201csoftware development\u201d. Which leads to additional biases toward undefined agile methods. This is unfortunate. While on-line businesses are incredibly easy to start, especially from a capital basis, and can definitely benefit from what agile approaches have to offer, Agile is neither a panacea nor the only method that should be used. There are many start-up businesses where the use of agile software development techniques as the primary organizing principles would be irreparably harmed. For example, a proprietor looking to start-up a local pizza shop has many important decisions to make that would suffer under an agile approach, particularly the potential negative impact on time and material expended prior to opening the doors. I\u2019m not saying that certain aspects of a non-online start-up, particularly market development, might benefit from a short-cyle iterative approach, but only after traditional market analysis and demographic research have been performed and prior to capital being expended. Finally, the stats should be reviewed. Since the Agile Manifesto was published, the success rates for start-ups have not improved. This would suggest that while high profile companies (and individuals) who promote the use of agile everywhere, the reality is that it has not really moved the needle, despite widespread attempts. ",
