            "answer_text": "Really, they can appeal to anyone who\u2019s not homophobic, as long as the writing is good. While I haven\u2019t read any gay romance novels, something like A Snowflake in Spring Chapter 1, a frozen fanfic and others of their sort would come really close. The Elsanna audience is neither incestuous nor lesbian/gay (I\u2019m pretty certain I\u2019m not). However, I find the relationship cute, and a lot of the writers on FanFiction are actually wonderful writers, bringing their AU worlds to life better than even some novels I\u2019ve read. EDIT: I\u2019ve noticed the other answers seem to think of day romance novels as purely F/F or M/M, but there are at the very least, fanfictions with both, as well as hetero relationships in them. eg. Pariah Chapter 1: Pariah, a kim possible fanfic, Era of the Warring States Chapter 1: Prologue: The Before Time, a kim possible fanfic, Only One Year Chapter 1: The Plan, a frozen fanfic. Albeit, I do admit that all of those tend to lean heavier towards F/F, but the main characters of both series were female to begin with. I\u2019m certain that there are others out there leaning in different directions, just I haven\u2019t gotten around to reading them. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like F/F porn is mostly made for straight men \u2014 Surprise! \u2014 M/M romance is mostly made for straight women. It isn\u2019t necessarily that gay men aren\u2019t reading them, but they are a tiny audience segment. Appealing to the much larger group of female readers is a way to make these books economically viable. Now there are some publishing houses that are more LGBT than others, but M/M is pretty much the realm of women authors writing for a female readership \u2014 sometimes under male pen names, though.
