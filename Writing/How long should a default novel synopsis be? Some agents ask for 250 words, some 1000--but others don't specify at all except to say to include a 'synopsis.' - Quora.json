            "answer_text": "Rule #1 - do EXACTLY what an agent posts. They do not post things because there is an industry standard, they post to see if you can follow instructions. I hate writing synopses more than almost writing anything, but everyone wants one. My wife knows to leave me along on that day because I hate them, don\u2019t respect them, and think bad things about whoever wants it. I can\u2019t publish the last one because the book is still being revised. But I can tell you the structure. Synopsis: this was 3 paragraphs which identified the genre (YA) the protagonists and the basic premise. Then I listed the story. Act 1 - Paradise with clouds. This is about 7 paragraphs that set up the situation, the main characters and conflicts and sets the conflicts in motion. Act 2 - Everything falls apart. We learn the characters back-stories and motivations, and there is LOTS of conflict and pretty much everything goes to hell. Act 3 - Things get even worse, but our protagonists have a thin string of hope and keep trying. Conflicts are resolved for better or worse, and all the plot points you set up in Act 1 are reconciled. Not necessarily with victory. For example in Act 3 our male protagonist achieves his goal, literal victory, but the price he pays is far too high. Yet there is hope at the end. My personal books are always tragedies, yet inevitably I blink and there is some reconciliation. In my new one, Dash & Laila (a YA adventure set in Morocco) succeed in their journey but pay heavily. The theme is the betrayal of teenagers by adults. Ironically, this book sold without a synopsis, and I was so happy. If you are asked for one, put your time into it. Yes you will have to give up your ending and other good stuff. It might be the toughest thing you ever have to write. The one I referenced above came in at two pages. Took me about ten hours to write it and boy was I in a foul (fowl?) mood. :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Any agent I have sent Query letters to always is very specific on what they want. If you look them up on their site they tell you exactly what they want just go by that. Just remember this for the agents that don\u2019t specify less is always more. They only want a paragraph about the book no samples nothing so the best thing you can do is learn how to write a query letter. That\u2019s the best advice I can give you. Good luck in your writing ",
