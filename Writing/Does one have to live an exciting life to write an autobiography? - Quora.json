            "answer_text": "No, you do not have to have an exciting life past, or present, but, an autobiography is a tell all book, if there is nothing exciting to tell, a boring read.. Ex: Robert always wore a bow tie to work, the other executives always wore ties. He felt very noticeable when he was wearing a bow tie, the odd man out, and that is the way that he wished to be perceived. Robert\u2019s goal was to become an astronaut , he always wanted to travel to space, that had always been his lifelong goal to do that, to explore life beyond earth. Finally his wish was about to become a reality, he had been accepted by the NASA program for their very next mission to enter into the space program, He was elated! See the difference? A bow tie versus an Astronaut? No comparison! An autobiography is a book of truths, and should have remarkable and exciting news to share with a reader. Regards, Author Dia Stone ",
