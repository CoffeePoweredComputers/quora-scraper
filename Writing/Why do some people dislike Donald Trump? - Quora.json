            "answer_text": "It is interesting as to why people dislike President Trump. In watching news, from CNN, NBC, etc. it\u2019s blatantly biased. In reading a couple of answers to this question it\u2019s major Trump Derangement Syndrome. Long winded thought but absolutely zero answer. Such as \u201cwe get to wake up every day and see from the news how he\u2019s embarrassed us\u201d. In watching the news much of it is manipulated. For instance, claiming he embraces KKK. Nothing further from the truth. His speech(I listened to the original and did not include what was \u201creported\u201d) was good. He put down racism. Also the infamous clip of Trump allegedly making fun of a disabled reporter. That NEVER happened. Again, clever video manipulation. Even the reporter said it never happened. And again you have to dig to find the original speeches. I wanted to see for myself if this was actually done. It wasn\u2019t. I recommend you watch YouTube of the speech and Brandon Straka also has an excellent critique These people that spout he \u201cspits in the face of minorities and women\u201d really have not had the opportunity to see on the msm all the great things he has done the past three years. Nor do they research critically. Such as: deregulating what The US has of natural resources. Coal mines are opening back up creating jobs. Clinton and Obama crippled us with energy and farming on regs. He signed Three bills that affected Native Americans, in a very positive way, a bill for the Hong Kong protestors in support, signed into law what proponents say is the most comprehensive federal prison reform bill in decades. There are so many more! These were promises he made while campaigning. He has fulfilled his promises to the best of his ability while being absolutely bullied by msm and the Democratic Party. He is a champion of veterans but you\u2019d never know it from the press. The press has been abusive so why would you really talk with them? The abuse doesn\u2019t stop there. His whole family has been bullied. Melania quietly goes about her charitable work. What she gets in return, criticism of Christmas decorations. This year the Christmas decorations must have met muster, but the press attacked her for a wearing a cream colored coat. Really? Melania went to a hospital to champion a wing meant for babies born with addiction problems. Instead of the staff cheering that press was there to promote this needed service, many, unprofessionally, stood outside in protest. Of what? Someone that believes in your cause and pull in press, and you turn your back. When Puerto Rico had their crisis, aid was sent. Instead much of it was hidden so people could say how bad man Trump did not send aid. This week that warehouse was found. They hid sent aid while their own suffered. How does that even make sense? Water, cooking supplies, baby supplies, batteries- you name it, it was all there. Was there an apology to Trump? No.  A very dangerous man was taken out in Iran. If you name any bombing the past twenty year, I guarantee solomenis name was on it some how. When bin laden taken out, kudos to Obama. Saddam, Bush gets cheers. Because it was Trump, instead of cheering that we were kept safe for one more day, Hollywood and liberals piped up saying they stand with Iran, without understanding what really had happened. Why? All because it was Trump and because of the way the press pushed the narrative. CNN has such a way to spin it\u2019s insane, the hatred. Recently they\u2019ve had to pay up major money to Nick Sandman. They didn\u2019t want to go to trial for 1) bad publicity2) they knew there was enough evidence to convict them and they\u2019d lose publicly. All because a boy wore a MAGA hat, standing with his friends at the Lincoln memorial. A group of Black Hebrew Israelites were also there hurling insults. Then a Native American begins pounding a drum in this kid\u2019s face. All starting because of his red hat. One reporter even said the kid had a punchable face! Would you want a reporter saying that about your kid? The kid was just standing there embarrassed. Support Trump or wear a red hat and automatically you are racist, nazi or white supremest Forbid if you are Black and support the president.  People are also tired over this impeachment fiasco. It is driving people away from the Democratic Party. Me? I was a registered democrat. However, after watching all that was done for eight years to divide this country and weaken it, I walked away. Then, after seeing the total manipulation by major news outlets, and researching exactly what President Trump has done for us, this country, it was the right decision. By the way, has my life improved since he took office? Yes. We have a few stocks and the dividends are doing nicely. Also the 401k. We took the time to graph when Obama was in office vs the past three years. We wanted to do our own comparisons. During the Obama years it rose slightly and petered out, just barely maintained. Once Trump took office, it was amazing! Large jumps. We definitely know if Clinton had taken office she would have continued with regulations and strangling trade agreements. Our savings would not be as great. ",

            "answer_text": "Donald J Trump has been a very, very popular man. His reality tv show was very popular and it ran for 11 consecutive seasons. YouTube still holds tens of videos of talk show hosts who asked him if he would run for President. For 35 years everyone from Barbara Walters to Oprah, and everyone else in between asked him the same question. Donald Trump consistently criticized both parties in government as stupid for allowing countries like China, Europe, and the NAFTA neighbors take our jobs and creat such huge trade imbalance. Trump criticized the government for the national debt and illegal immigration. You should watch the videos and see President Trump\u2019s agenda shaping up. The dislike or hatred for Donald Trump is the result of a very emotional and effective campaign. There are 3 principal campaigns used by the Democrats against everyone if their opponents. 1. Emotional, 2. Racism, 3. Attacking the opponent\u2019s intellect. And number 4 is the morality attack, especially sexual improprieties in the era of MeToo. In the emotional campaign they stir emotions on the against their opponent using devices people relate to in a personal level. This is the Identity Politics. Women, Gays, Immigrants, Minorities, Religious, etc. So, they campaign to show their opponent as opposing the different group\u2019s interests and stir personal emotions against them. 2. Democrats are historically, the party of Slavery, Segregation, Anti Civil Rights, KKK, etc. Eisenhower authored the Civil Rights Act, but couldn\u2019t pass it through the Democrat Congress. JFK didn\u2019t bother and LBJ snatched it by ramming it by fiat and thus began to shed their racist past and throwing it on the Republicans. The Republicans never knew how to counter attack. Democrats own the Black vote for decades and constantly accuse the Republicans of racism, Jim Crow, Hitler, and KKK. 3. George Bush became very popular with his response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Some Democrats thought he was lucky. War Presidents have historically been popular, mostly because wars unite the people. Democrats began their campaign as soon as they saw the opportunity. George Bush is not an articulate man. He has a history of speech gaffs. So, they campaign of idiot, moron, unintelligent George Bush began. Combined with all the other devices, the idiot campaign began to get seared into many peoples\u2019 minds. The double-graduate, double-term governor of Texas, and double-Term President was an idiot. He\u2019s also a businessman and baseball team owner. Now, Donald J Trump beat 16 of the top Republicans in the primaries, including the Bush Dynasty. Then he went on to beat the \u201cmost qualified person on the planet,\u201d as endorsed by President Obama. Hillary Clinton is the most popular Democrat carrying the name of the most popular saxophone player on the planet. President Trump is too popular already and he used a lot of comedy and some of the wittiest comebacks against opponent attacks. The Democrats threw the kitchen sync at him. Trump is a billionaire New Yorker that talks like a cab driver. Because of that, he really speaks to blue collar and labor Americans. The forgotten people that includes the poor and crossover to the overtaxed middle class. Donald Trump is a regular Joe that made it. People relate so much to him that they\u2019re not surprised at anything Trump says or does. Everybody knows a philanderer, foul mouth, American. Actually, the Democrats opened the doors to Trump when they didn\u2019t remove Clinton from office after being impeached for his sex scandal. So, they cancelled any Trump sex scandal. ",
