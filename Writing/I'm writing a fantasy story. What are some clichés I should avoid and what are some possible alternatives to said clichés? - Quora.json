            "answer_text": "These are some cliches I absolutely HATE\u2014but can always expect, to such a degree that I can sometimes peg them the instant they introduce a character in the first few chapters: The big, lovable guy\u2019s going down. They will introduce to you a lovable big guy\u2014a gentle giant, maybe? Or perhaps a large, loud, mountainous man with no manners who just makes you love him anyway\u2014and he\u2019s going to die in the end. It will probably be in a heart-wrenching, heroic way, or just in a sad \u201cshouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d sort of way, but he\u2019ll die none the less.The enemy who was a former friend. Oftentimes in movies, they show these strong, formidable former-friends or brothers who\u2019ve now decided to turn on the protagonist for some reason or another (the reason varies, but often it has little to do with the protagonist himself and more about circumstances out of the protagonists\u2019 hands). The strong friend rarely stays on the protagonist\u2019s side but rather ends up becoming an obstacle he must overcome. And, that former friend is often (albeit, not always) destined to one of the following fates: A) To remain a bad guy who hates the protagonist until defeated, or B) to snap out of their evil ways on their death beds and express regret over their choices. But once they\u2019ve settled into their evil ways, there\u2019s no sign of regret or any lasting feelings or empathy towards their best friend or brother they\u2019re now trying to kill. It\u2019s 100% dedicated hatred. I\u2019m not interested in that.Romance. Every story seems to have a romantic pairing\u2014especially if the hero is a male protagonist. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s in the story handbook: \u201cmust fall in love by the end of the story, and love interest must somehow either A) need rescuing, B) help save the day, or C) Both\u2014\u201d Far too often, romance sort of cheapens the themes to many stories. It complicates things\u2014and often not in a good way. Heck, it\u2019s such a modern compulsion that \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d movie created an entirely new character who was never in the book just for the sake of having a couple, which destroyed the emphasis on the brothers\u2019 bond in \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d as well as Tolkien\u2019s point on how bizarre and refreshing it was to have a Dwarf and Elf become friends in \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d Additionally, \u201cThe Giver\u201d movie made a romantic pairing with a girl who rarely spoke in the book, but for the movie she had to help the protagonist escape and was the main reason he was able to push himself forward.Those who talk about their future before a climax are probably going to die. This one is not always a given, and you have to keep an eye out for other indicators, but I can almost always tell who\u2019s going to die before a big fight when they start their \u201cwhen this is all over, I want to\u2026\u201d hopes and dreams discussion. It is cliche, but the effect usually is to try to establish more characterization so it hurts the reader/viewer more when they die. Also, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to try and talk about the future when they are trying not to think about dying\u2014but still, it\u2019s a big red flag to many readers.The Under-est Underdog vs. Most Likely to Succeed\u2014This is two in one, but the hero is probably one of the two\u2014either A) Mr. or Ms. Perfect (who needs no help, who is handsome and beautiful, who can do everything because they are just so awesome\u2014even if they don\u2019t know it yet, and even if they are humble about it. Truth is, they probably carry the team, to include any friends who tag along). OR the hero is B) the MOST awkward, most unlikely, biggest loser who finds out they are the last hope or chosen one with ultimate potential. The one who everyone expected to fail who can rub his or her success in their doubters\u2019 faces by the end. There are fewer average Joes in the literary world because they take more work to write. A perfect character or a \u201closer\u201d character already has most of the development created by going off the expectations already in the reader. However, the average Joe is an individual who has to be introduced to the reader. Unlike the underdog or most likely to succeed, we don\u2019t know the average Joe\u2019s strengths or weaknesses. We can expect Ms. Perfect to be pretty and popular. We can expect Underdog to be socially awkward and possibly bullied. What about Joe? What can he do? How would he fare?Cannon Fodder. It usually seems that writers want to have the reader or viewer feel some sort of loss in battle to make it feel realistic\u2014but it\u2019s too early for any major characters to die without destroying the plot or jeopardizing the mission. So, they create the extras, a no-name. If you see the protagonist(s) fleeing with one or two unknowns (a random guard, a friend of a friend you don\u2019t know, some mundane member of the group who previously had no real appearances until now) you can expect that to be the sacrificial character. They\u2019ll probably stay behind to buy the other characters time or be hit in the crossfire or something. It\u2019s actually humorous when you can peg it before it happens. \u201cWait, who is this guy? Ah, the cannon fodder.\u201d Sometimes writers try to introduce them a little bit before hand by throwing in a short introductory scene or two hoping to make you like them more (and sometimes it works, but you have a short time to make people like them), but ultimately, they\u2019re just extras for the purpose of being killed off.\u201cTo Be Continued...\u201d Books aren\u2019t complete anymore. Apart from me not liking it, with my students, I\u2019ve noticed that this also discourages many who aren\u2019t really into books (but who\u2019d like to at least try to be). For them, it\u2019s intimidating and robs them of the accomplishment of finishing. After all, there\u2019s nothing more frustrating then dedicating the time to a book to find it\u2019s \u201cBook 1\u201d and will probably be in publishing for the next several years. I want to feel excited about a story and victory at having completed it at its end. Yet, \u201cto be continued\u201d stories leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. As such, this is one of the 3 big things that will make me drop a book almost instantly. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019ve read books in a series or trilogy before and loved them\u2014but now these books are ALL a series or trilogy! And often, I find that I waited forever for book 2 and was seriously disappointed when I finally obtained it and started reading it. Waiting for book 2, 3, and more may cost you readers. Like Eragon\u2014did anyone really even care about that book anymore by the time the last book came out?Know that it\u2019s not always bad to use cliches, but you have to be very careful when using them. If used correctly, they can still be good. If using them cleverly, you can defy expectations and be ironic. But, note\u2014especially when starting out in writing\u2014it\u2019s very dangerous for your story to use cliches. ",

            "answer_text": "I like reading and watching stuff in the sci-fi/fantasy category and if I chose things I\u2019d like to see fixed: Power Inflation Typically there\u2019s a set up of good guys versus some sort of bad guys. Then the bad guys are defeated. If you\u2019re writing a one-shot deal, then you\u2019re good but if you\u2019ve got a longer sequence of books then what typically ends up happening is that the next bad guy is even more powerful than the last. It\u2019s done for dramatic reasons. However, it\u2019s silly. Say originally you\u2019re fighting vampires but then the last bad guy is the uber-vampire. Okay good. But then, next time around you think it\u2019s not interesting to fight vampires again and they already defeated an uber-vampire. So, now they have to fight the mega-alpha-vampire and then that leads up to the super-duper-mega-ultra-alpha-and-omega-vampire. Then it just gets stupider from there. The point is to make the journey, or the story, or the situation interesting rather than the enemy. Then you don\u2019t have to resort to power inflation. Spaghettifying Factions Another issue is that some authors like to continuously introduce spice to their story by introducing yet another unknown faction, or person, or character trait. Character traits that don\u2019t exist at the beginning of a novel should be earned. A cowardly character learns to be brave. I dislike novels in which a character is made more interesting by suddenly revealing they actually have witch powers but they were a normal before. By the last chapter everybody and their mom secretly had a long ancient bloodline that gave them powers. That just gets silly. The other macro-version of this is the constant introduction of new factions. Your characters face orcs. Then they fight the orcs for a while. Your war story goes nowhere. Now you introduce dark elves. That goes nowhere. You introduce shadow ogres. Before you know it, even you don\u2019t know what factions you wrote up. An Unnecessary Destiny or Prophecy If you\u2019ve got a good plot lined up, or a good premise (eg. three factions are beset against one another and you follow the Byzantine politics of faction A) then don\u2019t randomly throw in destiny or a prophecy. It tends to be plot cancer that overrides all your other threads for no good reason. Needlessly Attacking Cliches Lastly, don\u2019t needlessly throw away cliches because they are cliches. Doing them well makes for a good plot.  Anyway, without knowing anything about the type of fantasy story you are writing, I can only give you my personal grievances of fantasy/sci-fi in the world. ",
