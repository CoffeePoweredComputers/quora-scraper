            "answer_text": "In a class co-taught by a professor of African american studies, and a professor of native american studies we read Neil Gaiman's Anansi boys. (Spoiler). In this book Gaiman does a 180 on western assumptions about race in literature, and describes only white people (as far as race or ethnicity is concerned), while all the major protagonists are Black. I did not realize this on my own, but it was pointed out by another student in the class. After a second of cognitive dissonance I realized that it made sense, all of the clues were there that we were reading about black people and I just didn't pick up on it because I am used to conventions of western literature where it is normal to establish the race of non-whites, and to not establish the race of whites.  The one African-american girl in the class also fell victim to convention and pictured the main characters as white, although, if I remember correctly, it was her who pointed it out to the rest of us that they weren't. The professors noted that this was entirely normal, it is not the individual's race that determines what race they imagine people to be in books, but the cultural norm. Of course, this might not hold to be true 100% of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot speak for others, but as for myself, it depends much on the context and the novel's setting. If the novel is set in the western world, I tend to assume the character is white/caucasian (I hate the concept of races but just make more sense). BUT this is very general thing and there are many factors that infulence my perception of the character. If, for example, the character has a name Surrendra, I wold tend to consider him and Indian person. Also, If he is described as an owner of the Red Dragon Taiwan Restaurand, I think I would think of them as Taiwaneese, even though their name might be David. The way the charactes speek might be another indicator of their race. If the character speeks the African American Vernacular English, then I assume they are black.  To sum up, my starting point is my own race byt this gets very easily changed by the character's context and the setting.  And one more thing, since I read a lot of fantasy, I can often assume that they are not human. Dorg Hammerbeard will very probably be a dwarf, for instance. Thanx for A2A ",
