            "answer_text": "1. Headlines should be descriptive As I mentioned in a recent post on journalism and SEO, some lamented the passing of the pun headline with the coming of the web. They were fun, and there\u2019s nothing to stop them being used in print, but web headlines do need to be descriptive. Who knows, maybe you can manage both in one headline. The problem is that non-descriptive headlines don\u2019t work so well out of context. The headline has a big effect on rankings too, so they don\u2019t work for SEO. It short, it needs to tell people what they can expect from the article. 2. Avoid crappy clickbait headlines Definitions of clickbait will vary, but I think many people will agree on what crappy clickbait is. There\u2019s this kind of garbage which appears on many news sites these days. There\u2019s worse out there, but this is from a Washington Post article on Syria, very relevant\u2026 Clickbait can also refer to headlines that don\u2019t deliver on their promises. Too much hyperbole, tips on SEO that promise to revolutionise your marketing strategy, and so on. Yes, headlines need to be enticing, but there\u2019s a balance to strike. Don\u2019t overdo it. Headlines which promise the world and bring in traffic only to disappoint will not work as a long-term strategy. 3. Headlines have to work on their own When we write articles, it\u2019s easy to think of them placed on top of the article and forgot that they\u2019re often seen out of this context. They\u2019ll be seen in tweets, newsfeeds, newsletters, search results pages and more. They\u2019re often competing for attention with other articles, and your potential readers will scan and decide whether to click in a relatively short space of time. So, the headline needs to work alone as, hopefully, these examples from SEW\u2019s Twitter do: 4. Think about headline length The web, in various ways, limits the length of your headlines: Google will only show the first 55-60 characters of a page title, so bear this in mind when creating headlines. Keep it under 55, or consider what will happen if it cuts off at that point. We\u2019ve just about made it with our internal linking article, while Moz and SEOmark are well within the limit. As for the KISSmetrics post, we\u2019ll have to click to find out what these commandments will do\u2026Social media. Consider the character limits on social posts. For example, if you want to tweet an article, adding the URL and image, then the headline shouldn\u2019t be too long.Email newsletters. It varies according to the device or email program your subscribers are using, but shorter headlines are more likely to be viewed in full.Readability. Sorry to state the obvious, but it\u2019s easier to read and digest a shorter headline quickly. Make it too long and people are less likely to read it.All in all, my advice would be to keep headlines under 60 characters where possible, especially if you\u2019re looking to create evergreen content which works well in search results. Which is why the following headline is 103 characters long. 5. Don\u2019t promise what you can\u2019t deliver This ties in with the clickbait point to an extent, but you can write a good headline and not deliver on the content. Now, some of this comes down to quality. If you offer what you bill as \u2018killer tips\u2019 and they\u2019re just collated from a bunch of posts around the web, without much original thought or detail, people will feel like they\u2019ve been had. There\u2019s a tendency towards adjectives in headline writing that can sometimes oversell content -\u2018amazing tips which will supercharge your content marketing\u2019 etc. If you\u2019re going to go bold, you\u2019d best be confident that your content matches the title. I\u2019ve gone for \u2018the ultimate guide\u2019 on a recent ClickZ post. Think I\u2019ve gotten away with it so far\u2026 6. Be concise As we know from point four, there are a number of reasons to keep headlines relatively short. Take time and look at your headlines. Is every word essential? If not, remove it. 7. See what works and learn from it Take a look at your analytics, and look at the articles that are being shared more on social media. Can you spot a few common features? For example, these are the five most shared SEW articles from the past six months, as shown by Buzzsumo. I\u2019d say in all cases the title tells the user what to expect if they click on it. They\u2019re all relatively short too, and of course, we have a couple of lists in there. It\u2019s good to look at a mixture of tools to get the right idea. What works on social isn\u2019t necessarily the same as what works in terms of traffic, or in terms of leads or conversions. However, some common factors should emerge that will help you create better headlines. 8. Add keywords to headlines The rule was always to front-load keywords, but this is supposed to be less important to Google now. I\u2019d still want to get my keywords in the title though. It will help with ranking, it\u2019s more likely to be used as anchor text if people link back to your site, and these keywords can also catch the attention of your target audience on social sites, in newsletters or in search results. 9. Don\u2019t be afraid of lists It\u2019s easy to mock the listicle, but the plain fact is that they work well online. People like lists, it tells them that the article has a defined structure and should therefore be easy to read and digest. These are the top ten pages from the past year on SEW. Five are number, six are lists. If I stripped out the homepage and category pages, there\u2019d be more. \u2018How to\u2019 also works well for us \u2013 four of the top 20 fit this pattern. Then there\u2019s asking and answering a question \u2013 these work on people\u2019s natural curiosity and, if written well, are useful to the reader. 10. Collaborate on headlines Sometimes I\u2019ll come up with headlines alone, but I find it helps a lot to discuss with colleagues and bounce ideas around.
