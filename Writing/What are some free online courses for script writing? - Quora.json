            "answer_text": "I have read a lot of the available resources on writing. Most of the counseling is nice to read at the moment, but too abstract to really help a craftsman who\u2019s trying to comprehend the structure beneath that which he wants to do. A cool exception is SCREENWRITING 101, an e-book by FILM CRIT HULK. HULK is a film critic slash screenplay professional who both knows the craft and is a no-nonsense communicator, i.e., it\u2019s a guy who, instead of pointing that obscure truths exist, tries to graps and convey these truths in the extense that it is possible for him to do it. It\u2019s also cool that he urges his readers to keep in mind that a good deal of practice and professionalism is required before the existance of any chance of success in this field. Storywriting is a skill that\u2019s hard as hell. That said, I wish you good luck and I wish that the book I reccomended ends up helping you. ",

Of course, it concerns episodes for TV or Web, but it has been very interesting and a good challenge: active learning (learning by doing) and peer to peer evaluation. ",
