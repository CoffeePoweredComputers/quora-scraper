            "answer_text": "They are three ways to boost your sales: 1. Get more clients2. Sell more to existent clients3. Sell more often to your clients This is very general of course. If you in B2B sales like me, your first mission will be to get more clients. And this is how you do it: 1. WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BUYING?Like most people I used to think that people buy products and services. And as I found out it is simply not true!What people actually are buying is solutions to their problems! Problems create pain in human experience and as Zigmund Froid told us people are always trying to get away from PAIN and always will seek for PLEASURE. This is the way our brain works.  So the first mission of every sales rep is to understand what problems or pain they are experiencing, what bothers them, what they are not satisfied with, what cases them to wake up at night will cold sweat? And you find it by simply asking:\"what is the challenge you are facing right now?\", \"What would you change or do differently in the current product?\"\"If I could give you the ideal product, what features it will have?\", \"What you don`t want to see in your ideal product/service?\" Stop selling products and sell solutions to people pain and problems. 2. PROSPECT LIKE A PRO!The second task will be find new clients by prospecting. They are many ways to do it. You can cold call, send emails, go door2door, use the social media and use referrals. Of course it is better to use a HOT leads, but if you are a new business or a new sales rep your only choice is the cold approach. Prospecting is the toughest part of selling and most sales people try to avoid it. Because you can be rejected, people will tell you terrible things about you and your product and so on. In order to be outstanding in prospecting you must develop \"Unbeatable Mind\" this is the biggest secret of every sales master. In order to thrive you must generate new prospects every day! In my experience you must speak between 10-15 decisions maker per day. If you do this every day, week, month and year you will be successful in selling. Getting new clients into your business is the number one priority. 3. CREATING RELATIONSHIPS. Their is a saying in sales: \"you don`t close a deal you open a relationship\".The number one skill in selling is to learn how to build relationships with people. People usually will buy from people that they know, like, trust and believe that they can help them. Here are ten commandments for building a relationship with people:1. Talk about what they want, and not what you want.2. Make them feel important-all man desire to feel this way.3. Don`t argue with people. No winners in arguments.4. Listen to people. It is a rare commodity today.5. Don`t critic people-every fool can do it, but wise man don`t6. Smile! It affects your tone of voice, people like happy people.7. Find something good in every person.8. Be grateful for the opportunity to to business with people,9. Price people. Don`t be sleasy, do it because you really believe in it.10. Be honest. No one likes lairs. 4. FIND THE GAP.The is the bridge between where people want to be and where are they now.Problems or pain this where they now.Solutions and pleasure-is where they want to be in the future.Your product-is the bridge that connects between the two. The bigger the gap between where people are and where they want to be the more valuable your product and the more valuable your product the price you can charge is higher.The gap is a measure of customer dissatisfaction.In order to find the gap you must ask questions: \"What do you need in a solution?\", What you would improve in your current product?\" 5. BUILD VALUE. Value is what people are expecting to get out of a product or a service. What is the emotional satisfaction a man will get from using a product or service? Value is not a thing this is a process called valuing. The bigger problem a customer have and the more it is urgent the value of solving it goes up. If we have a desire or a need goes up the value of the solution or getting that desire also will go up. So CREATE VALUE!The equation to create money is: VALUE=MONEY.Selling is a process of exchanging value for money, and the bigger your value the more you will get paid. 6. OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICEWhat is more easy to do: to  recruit a new client or to sell to an exciting one?I know that you know the answer, of course to sell to the existing clients.In order to sell to your clients more and more frequently you must maintain an outstanding customer relationships. As I said in the begining sales is all about relationships. The more people trust you, the more they like you, the more they will buy from you. We all must focus how to create more trust in our relationships with our clients and create clients for life! Best regards!   So more clients ",

If you haven\u2019t spent time dialing in your ICP (Ideal Client Profile), then you need to do so. Figure out what makes these people tick. What moves the needle for THEM? If you\u2019re focusing too much on features; bells and whistles, then you are going to end up turning people away. They don\u2019t care about what features your solution has, they care about how your features will help make their jobs easier, make them better, and help get them to where they want (and need) to go. Every time you ask for 15-20 minutes of someone\u2019s time, it\u2019s like withdrawing from your bank account. If you don\u2019t have a relationship with that person, it\u2019s like trying to withdraw $20 out of a bank account that has $0 in it. Even if you\u2019re not educating someone on your solution, you can help them stay ahead of industry trends and provide other, actionable advice. And every time you do that, you\u2019re adding a small deposit into that bank account. If you do this with someone, you\u2019re adding $2 into that bank account. As time goes by, that balance grows and you can make your $20 withdrawal when the timing is right. But just having your ICP dialed in is not enough. In business, timing is everything. You must have a way to know which people, in your marketplace, are actively \u201cshopping\u201d for the solution you\u2019re selling. Now, the timing is right. With person-level buying intent data, you will know exactly which people are shopping and researching for this type of solution. You\u2019ll know when they\u2019ve started researching YOUR company. Then, you\u2019ll know the person\u2019s name, how to contact them, where they work, and how far along their own buyer journey they are. (Disclaimer: I own this product, marketology.) Freakishly accurate, person-level buying intent data that eliminates the guesswork in marketing, outreach, and sales. You'll smash sales quotas, fill massive revenue gaps, and go to bed with a smile each night because you know you're only ever pursuing people who are actively shopping for your solution. Relentlessly pursuing peace of mind for our friends in the B2B tech world through identity resolution and person-level buying intent data. Making marketers smarter - 12Thirty1 ",

            "answer_text": "Your B2B sales campaign is all about being able to attract prospects and keep them there. But winning customer loyalty is easier said than done when the majority of businesses are receiving over ten sales presentations every single day. You need to develop your B2B sales strategy so you can increase your conversion rates. Here are the best ways by which you can develop your B2B sales strategy and take advantage of an industry that\u2019s growing by 14 percent per year:. 1. Use social media to know more about your competition. Social media is often used for researching customers. B2B companies especially should use this tool to find out more about their competition. The leading social media network for B2B companies is LinkedIn. It's quickly become a hub for professionals in this industry. Follow the major influencers in your niche to learn what they're doing. The more data you can gather, the better. You don\u2019t necessarily have to copy what others are doing, but you can quickly find out what is and isn't working for them. 2. Learn to differentiate yourself from the competition. The key to long-term success in B2B sales is to constantly differentiate yourself from the competition. Naturally, this is easier said than done. The moment you find something unique, the clock starts ticking down. It won\u2019t be long before someone else copies your idea. But differentiation should still be at the top of your priorities list. You should always stay one and two steps ahead of your competitors. Leveraging the unique elements you have will help you to stand out from your leads' perspective. 3. Stop cold-calling, start researching. Everything in the world of sales revolves around data. One area where data comes in handy is in figuring out how likely a business is to respond to you in a positive way. The reality is that cold-calling is no longer the best use of your time. Less than 5 percent of cold calls will lead to anything. Researching your prospects in advance will make it easy to establish a relationship and to figure out where your offering fits in with your prospect's business model. The majority of businesses have no time for cold calls. They\u2019ll quickly cut you off because they don\u2019t want to have to waste their time explaining their company to you. Yes, researching takes time. You\u2019ll have no choice but to reduce the number of leads you\u2019re getting in contact with. But you\u2019ll be increasing your chances of converting those leads. Related: Don't Wage a Price War. Win Sales by Eliminating Your Competition. 4. Cut to the chase. The B2B sales cycle should contain as few steps as possible. Your prospects don\u2019t want to listen to the long speeches and sales fluff you come up with. They want to know how you\u2019re going to solve a problem for them. They want to know how your solution is going to directly or indirectly make them more money. Show respect for the time your lead has. Think about an elevator pitch approach and how you can pitch your solution in that same amount of your time. Your solution should be easily explained in less than a minute. Create a strong value proposition and let your prospect decide if it\u2019s worth it. Improve on your long-term ideas. So many companies are obsessed with closing the sale right now. This is short-term thinking. B2B companies will live or die based on the number of customers who stick with them through thick and thin. The best B2B companies are concerned with closing the sale, but more so with building their own reputations. That\u2019s what convinces other people to approach them and then come back for more. So, think about how you\u2019re going to build your reputation. Have a long-term plan, which will include getting back to people after they\u2019ve bought into your unique selling proposition. As the relationship advances, have a strategy for how you\u2019re going to upsell. ",

Many times I have seen companies/individuals are always running after new leads and not fully capitalizing existing clients. It's 15X harder to make the first sale to someone than it is to make the second sale to them. This means... The significant revenue is in the Back End... Not the Front End. Think - HubSpot, Netflix, Dollar Shave Club, etc. Without a back end offer and strategy, it's easy to get anxious about future sales. Knowing this... When I get a new client... I believe the real work has just begun. If I can sell one new solution/license in their company... I can sell multiple over two years period. (this is where the real money is made) Just by doing these two things every month, your sales will multiply: 1 - Call existing customers and do 10 minutes check-in 2 - Incubate new/back end sales opportunities Don't have a back end product? No problem... Your customers are your single best source of new product ideas, which can turn into easy-to-sell, high margin, back end sales opportunities. ",

            "answer_text": "Make sure you are using a strong CRM program, with an integrated follow up system and that you are utilizing it efficiently. Create and keep updated profiles on all of your existing, as well as, any new potential clients that you have and add to your funnel; make sure to take the time to add each call/email/visit/interaction you have and to add personal notes (what's important to them, interests they have, kids, family, hobbies, things you have in common etc) so you have to reference when following up in the future. These are key to keep a full and constant flowing pipeline. Keeping a solid follow-up system in place is critical to maximize the earning potential for each client/account. Even after a sale, especially after a sale it's important to follow up with your clients to make sure that everything is going good and they don't need any further assistance and/or need for additional services you may offer/sell; if you did your job right and built trust and rapport with them, then they are your best resource for additional clients and business to fill your pipeline! A high percentage of my new business comes directly or indirectly from my existing customer base, in the form of referrals and repeat business; what's even better is that it's free marketing/advertising AND coming referred from a mutual source lowers a lot of the initial barriers and makes for a much easier, more smooth and usually much faster sale. Networking, exceptional customer service (going the extra mile and following through with what you promise) and follow up are all very critical in business to business sales. One more thing\u2026ask for the sale! So many consultants present and pitch the product/service, but fail to actually ask for the sale and/or attempt to get a commitment! \u2026Best of luck ",

            "answer_text": "B2B sales typically rely on multiple people signing off on a decision, therefore, it is important to find out where each of these individuals spend their time. While social media may bring visitors to your site, email marketing may result in increased engagement with offer downloads. You shouldn\u2019t just focus on digital channels, either. Trade shows, industry events, networking events, and outbound initiatives can all be contributing factors to your success. It is important to track these initiatives in your marketing automation software as well to make sure you're capitalizing on bringing in leads from different areas. B2B sales cycles are typically much longer than B2C cycles, so, you need to take this in to account in your marketing and sales planning If you have 80 percent of your leads about to close, but nothing is in the middle of your pipeline, you're going to have a prosperous month one and then go on to month three or four with almost nothing because you weren\u2019t building your pipeline. Make sure to strategize based on your sales cycle so that your entire sales funnel is being nurtured at all times. Most companies have clients that fit into various personas each with a different need. There is no one size fits all method for sales today. Modern sales is about focusing on educating each prospect with specific content targeted to their needs. Think about their company and what their needs are; then, you can focus on helping them solve their problems, not just pitching your services. Thought leadership is one of the biggest buzzwords in online marketing. Done right, though, it really does make a profound difference in sales timing and value. Although inbound marketing has a focus on organic traffic and SEO, B2B marketplace have the option of using paid advertising strategies to increase sales. You can leverage this kind of strategy if you're looking to see results quickly. Also known as pay per click (PPC) advertising, paid search involves bidding on particular keywords so business webpages appear in a prominent place on search engine result pages. ",

Do not limit yourself and be prepared for an open-ended conversation with your prospective clients. 2) Talk to the decision-maker \u2014 If you do not want to waste your time convincing one person after another having countless conversations to close one deal, make sure that you talk to the decision-maker. If you are unable to connect to them directly, use referrals, or mutual people to reach them. 3) Choose outcomes that benefit both \u2014 While negotiating with your prospect, try to reach an outcome that is a win-win for both the sides. It will show your respect and willingness to work with them again in the future and build long term relationships with your clients. 4) Follow up extensively \u2014 Do not hesitate in reaching out to your prospects after they have given a yellow signal. Try to fix a particular time when you can connect to them for a follow-up and keep doing that until you get a definite answer. 5) Build trust \u2014 When you have just started your business, you must build trust with your clients and prospects. It is the only way that your business can sustain in the long run. There are many ways in which you can build trust, like having a friendly conversation with your client rather than a formal one, being honest with them, actively listening to their problems, and being empathetic to them. 6) Prepare short demos \u2014 Try to give short and simplified demos to your prospects. Overloading them with irrelevant information would not be a good choice. Provide only that information which is necessary and what your prospect would be able to retain. 7) Prioritize customer satisfaction \u2014 Remember, if your customers are happy and satisfied, they will come to you again and again. It will build a good reputation in the market, which is essential for any start-up. You can ensure that your customers are satisfied by providing them with after-sales services, taking feedback after regular intervals, and making your reach out process easy. 8) Target small businesses \u2014 Targeting small businesses would be good for a head start. They would be easy to convince as you, being a start-up, would be able to relate to their problems and identify their pain points easily. 9) Make the perfect sales pitch \u2014 Before you make your pitch to the prospect, spend some time researching their needs, values, and pain points. This will help you prepare an effective sales pitch and close the deal comfortably. Do not spend too much time on exaggerating the benefits of your product or your company. Focus more on grabbing the interest and understanding the needs of your prospect. 10) Use online methods for marketing \u2014 Whether you want to find leads or attract prospects, all your problems have one way out, go online. You can use LinkedIn to generate quality leads, use different social media platforms to promote your business, or start writing blogs to attract more prospects. All the best, thanks! ",

Some of the most well-known methods generate leads are: Content Marketing: The creation and sharing of online material intended to stimulate interest in a brand or service is called \u2018Content Marketing\u2019. Publishing EBooks, white papers, guidelines, infographics, case studies and any other information relevant to your target audience and giving it away for free can greatly aid a lead generation exercise. Use Call-to-Action ads to draw consumers towards exclusive (free) information in exchange for an email address. For example, creating an EBook called \u201cThe future of B2B Lead Generation\u201d will get attention and adding CTA such as \u201cGet it free only for today!\u201d pushes the person to download the book and creates an opportunity to get their contact details. On getting their contact details, a service such as Replyup will set up a sequence of follow-up emails to routinely remind them of the product and stay relevant in the mind of the consumer. If your content is informative, entertaining and sociable it becomes the perfect tool to capture interest in the brand as it satisfies the main motive behind why people use the Internet. Free Content attracts people easily, and they start assuming your expertise when they benefit from the content. Soon people will feel free to socialize with you as their comfort level increases (especially on platforms such as Quora). This way the content isn\u2019t impersonal and starts having a more human touch. Social Media: Use different social media channels to promote your brand through a great content strategy, which uses a mix of well-researched articles, eye-catching videos, and statistically rich infographics. LinkedIn is a great tool for prospecting and its potential as a lead generation tool should be harnessed by connecting with the large network of professionals it hosts on the platform. LinkedIn Groups are important for visibility and can be used to engage in conversations with key employees of companies you want to target. On joining a group, it sends email updates about the topics being discussed and unlocks opportunities to become a part of the discussion. Conducting Paid Search Campaigns: Use the vast network of Google to conduct a Google AdWords campaign. Adverts can be posted in the following ways through the AdWords system. 1. The Display Network \u2013 Adverts that appear on various websites that have agreed to allow Google to serve adverts to its visitors. Cross-referencing this with your target audience to be more specific about what sites the adverts appear on. 2. The Search Network - These adverts are situated at the top of the search engine results pages. 3. YouTube adverts \u2013 These are very effective in increasing brand exposure, but not so good for generating new leads. Re-marketing is a process in which Adverts are displayed to people that have already visited your website making them extremely targeted. This helps in brand recognition and reinforces your brand's presences in the audience\u2019s mind. Establishing a target cost per sale is crucial with AdWords. It is a bidding war so you can find yourself constantly bidding higher and higher so it\u2019s important to understand the associated click statistics. Networking: Start networking at Trade Shows and business related events. Many of these are not great but if you know the decision makers of your target clients will be attending then why not try and get some face-to-face time with them? Target events where decision makers relevant to your business will be attending. Find opportunities to speak at events to demonstrate your knowledge. Search Engine Optimization: Put effort into SEO. Tools such as Moz, SEMRush, Ahrefs and Raven can help you gain good organic rankings. However, SEO can take some time to achieve any real exciting results. Hard work and patience is the key to reaping rewards from this activity. Use Google Analytics to monitor how your traffic levels are doing. Using a combination of competitive and long tail keywords, you can increase your website traffic as well as increase conversions on your website. Lead Generation Companies: If this seems too daunting and you want to focus on selling your product rather than nurturing leads, I\u2019d suggest hiring a Lead Generation company to do the groundwork for you. It\u2019s an efficient way of generating leads and can make the selling process more efficient for you and your sales team. I have recently worked with a couple of companies and conclude that Ripple is one of the best. They\u2019re an all-around service that is a prospecting, outreach, and email management tool altogether and have an easy to use interface. Even though they are a fairly new company, I\u2019m impressed with their work. It's also important to remember that in B2B the pace is comparatively slower than B2C, so don\u2019t try to rush leads into sealing a deal or you might lose them completely. At the same time keep an eye out for competitors and their strategies to stay ahead of the curve. ",

Deals will close at a higher rate if the CEO joins. Customers love to talk to the CEO. Even the CEO of a 4 person startup.Slow it down and hyper-personalize your emails and communication. Don\u2019t misuse tools like Mixmax and Salesloft and Outreach. Slow down, research the customer, get to know their needs, and who they are. Tell them how your product truly will solve their problem. Watch your hit rate go up.Pitch >all< the stakeholders. Take the time to do a personalized demo and pitch for everyone that might use your product. Make the time.Start a weekly webinar for your (or ideally, all) prospects. If the company isn\u2019t doing one, you just do it. Invite all your prospects each week. This is a great way for them to continue to engage, even if they don\u2019t want to do a traditional sales call this week. More here: Webinars Almost Always Work | SaaStrListen to each others\u2019 calls. Get Gong or Chorus or whatever and listen to the calls of the top closers.Deeply, truly understand the product. Know every feature, every use case. That\u2019s who customers really want to talk to. And why they sometimes buy from one vendor over another. Study up here.Work harder. This isn\u2019t as trite as it sounds. Are you really working as efficiently as you can? As hard as you can? Are you wasting a lot of time? The best reps really do get more done with each hour.Treat each prospect like a king or queen. Especially the smaller ones. Don\u2019t talk down to smaller customers or deals. Every customer cares about their business, small or large. Treat even the smallest customers with the same respect as the big ones, and watch your close rates go way, way up here.Always add value with each email, call, Zoom, etc. Are you sure that email you are about to send adds new value? Make every interaction count. Make sure each one adds value. If it doesn\u2019t, slow it down and figure out how to add value.Be hyper-responsive. No one wants to wait 24 hours for a sales rep to call them back. No one. Email or call them back within 90 seconds. Watch your close rates go up. Especially, when the competition doesn\u2019t.Help your customers more after the deal closes. You\u2019ll be tempted to move on to the next deal. But if you keep helping after, that dramatically increases the odds they refer you to other potential customers.",

Research, Research & Repeat:Research about the company, their entire portfolio, what are they into, what they are looking for, what are their problems, Is your product right for their business. Search everything about them before confronting them with your product. Spend more time on Researching your existing clients, find out how they found your company, what problems they are facing, and why they choose your company to do business. Use their comments and challenges to know what will be useful to solve it. Prioritize your leads needs:More than what you can solve, focus on what needs to be solved. Focus on prioritizing the lead needs and show them how are able to solve those pain points of their affirm and can create value. Stop delaying, just grab the chase:The least interested in listening to your sales fuzz and long salesy dialogues. Take your hand directly to the chase. Focus on addressing their problem rather than throwing long sales speech. Respect your leads time. Think about pitching your solution and explaining it in a few minutes and to extend it for too long. Create Powerpact Case Studies:Creating case studies is the tactical strategy that adds fuel to the fire. B2B people or decision-makers need the validation of similar kind-off ROI minded people before making a purchase. Backing your strategy with a case study or white paper makes it more responsive and creates a brand impact Leverage the Power of Video:When there is a lot of information to be shared along with handling multiple decision-makers, using the video content strategy is the best way to do it. Create buyer-persona specific videos, thus catering to every different pain-point of each decision-maker. A CEO will be more concerned about its ROI whereas an IT manager will more concerned about its setup and specific uses. The key is catering to what everyone needs, instead of what you can give.

For example - simple A/B testing on offering free trials, requesting demos, requesting pricing can influence how quickly a deal closes and the buyers experience with your brand/product. If each sale is substantial, adding one additional sale through this method could be huge. Marketing is another tactic- Writing content (specific content) - do not go out and product dump, no one gives a shit.- attending conferences/tradeshows- partners for blogs, events, products, integrations (channel sales essentially)- social media Saleslock down a process for prospecting, qualifying and closing. make something scalable so you can hire x and produce y with little deviation.

It\u2019s often a natural development for a B2C (business to consumer) salesman to \u201crank up\u201d and proceed with finding a job in B2B sales. As a salesman or a manager, if you are about to transition to B2B, it\u2019s good to know what to expect before diving in.Here are some important pointers to look into to optimize your B2B Sales strategy. 1.Build a relationship- Establishing strong relationships is one of the most important parts of B2B sales. Once a sale is closed and customer satisfaction has been reached, everybody involved wants to stay in touch and keep the business alive. 2.Up your game- When selling to consumers, sometimes all it takes to make a sale happen is a good lead, skilled eloquence and a dash of personal charm. Business sales, on the contrary, have a greater requirement for sales skills and experience. The reason for that being that your targets will no longer be regular people whose lives you\u2019re trying to help improve. This time you\u2019re going to be working with trained professional buyers, often in very high positions, who will see right through you the second you show up. ",

First you have to identify your target market and ideal customer profile. After that you need to connect with the decision makers in a company on LinkedIn to start conversation with them. You can send connection requests to them and if they accept your request you can let them know about your products and services. In case, if they don\u2019t accept your request then there are free tools available which can be used to get the contact info of your targeted person and then you can drop them email and start conversation. In my previous company I used a tool RevDriver by SalesIntel - it is a free chrome extension which gives you all the contact info of the person once you visit their LinkedIn profile. Till date I use this tool and I am getting good results. This is not the only tool, there are many more. Maintaining Relationship with Customers Once you closed a deal make sure you contact your client regularly and help them if they need. Once they become your loyal customers, they will let others know about your products and services and will bring you business. Hope it helps! ",

The stats offer a very simple mantra, keep following up. But most salespeople follow-up religiously but see average results. To really boost your sales reach out to your potential customers at different channels instead of focussing only on one. I am talking about cold-calling, Emails, Twitter, Linkedin & more. The reason this works is simple. Not every sales team can actually apply the multi-touchpoint outreach and followup strategy because it is really complex and time-consuming to implement. We faced the same problem and that\u2019s how we built Outplay - a tool that helps you outreach and followup on prospective customers at multi-touchpoints on scale! Edit: I am an Outplay team member.

With the use of a website visitor identification tool such as Visitor Queue you can understand how your visitors are coming across your outbound marketing and invest in those channels accordingly. Not only are you able to see how these visitors are coming to your website, but you get the key contact information, page visited, and social media information. Through the use of this information, following up with leads and converting them to sales becomes much more manageable. Having a conversation about what your lead is interested in a more natural follow up than a cold call or email. This also ensures that you will be able to make personalized outbound campaigns to convert them. ",

Then find ways to improve those areas. For example - we notified a large amount of time was spent trying to book demos with our inbound leads. So we built an option into the Drift \u2013 Messaging For Marketing & Sales live chat to enable sending calendars. Quickly cuts out the ~5 emails it takes to book a meeting. Another area to look at is what things do sales reps skip that are part of the current process. Sales naturally does the least amount of work necessary to make the most money - so they are skipping for a reason. How can those steps be improved, so they are a value add and not just a time suck.

            "answer_text": "The biggest bottleneck in a sales workflow is anything that has to be done manually. For example, if you\u2019re manually writing an email that could be templated because you send it a lot or send it to lots of people, you\u2019re wasting time. To improve your B2B sales workflow, you need to find ways of automating repetitive tasks. Some things obviously can\u2019t be automated, like demo calls. However, other things can be automated with the right tools. For example, you can automate your high volume prospecting emails with a tool like SalesLoft. Automate one-to-one emails using templates and a tool like Yesware. Lead research and tracking can be automated with a tool like RocketBolt. Even call scheduling can be automated thanks to X.ai. Basically, the more you can remove direct human interaction in your sales pipeline, the more efficient you\u2019ll be. ",
