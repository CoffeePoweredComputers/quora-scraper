You probably haven't eaten or slept since Saturday, so maybe try some toast with peanut butter and a glass of milk. In any other case, I would never recommend this, but I know what's it's like to be strung out on too much blow. From a clinical perspective that is.. Anyways. When someone who isn't me would feel really uncomfortable, have that rock in his or her stomach, and convinced he (or she) was having a massive cardiac event, booze kind of helped to take the edge off if my friend didn't have access to a benzo. Coke is a money trap that only ends when you're too broke to afford groceries. Even then I've seen people go to drastic measures. To be completely honest with you, it's not worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A How can you come down off too much cocaine? Well with time you will come down. Come down isn't all that crappy from Coke. Or if you wanna be risky and do something people will say is a bad idea (not I, but I've never had a problem with this) you can take a benzo, opioid, or other downer. If you go the taking a downer route, I'd suggest a benzodiazepine to help you. Don't be dumb and over due the downer\u2026you don't want bigger problems. Or you can go to the hospital; I wouldn't unless its life or death myself (hospitals treat you different after they know that your a drug users). And of course whatever you do keep telling yourself that you are calm and relaxed. Positive Affirmations really do work. Good luck, be safe, love you ",
