Comparing poems is futile, like comparing beauty, or love. But this one seems really good right now to me. REFUGEE MOTHER AND CHILDChinua Achebe No Madonna and Child could touch that picture of a mother's tenderness for a son she soon will have to forget. The air was heavy with odorsof diarrhea of unwashed childrenwith washed-out ribs and dried-upbottoms struggling in labored steps behind blown empty bellies. Most mothers there had long ceased to care but not this one; she held a ghost smile between her teeth and in her eyes the ghost of a mother's pride as she combed the rust-coloredhair left on his skull and then -singing in her eyes - began carefullyto part it... In another lifethis would have been a little dailyact of no consequence before his breakfast and school; now she did it like putting flowerson a tiny grave. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to put forth a poem in Hindi (as opposed to all the English poems on here), which hit me hard the first time I heard it. This is one of the best Nazms I've ever come across, and ironically it is as true today as it was more than half a century ago. It was penned by Sahir Ludhianvi, and was put to song in a movie called Pyaasa by Guru Dutt. The poem/song is  \"Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaaye Toh Kya Hai\" (What is this world to me, even if I can have it?)  Ye mehlo, ye takhto, ye taajo ki duniya,Ye insaan ke dushman samaajo ki duniya,Ye daulat ke bhookhe riwaajo ki duniya,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  Har ek jism ghayal, har ek rooh pyaasi,Nigaaho mein uljhan, dilo mein udaasi,Ye duniya hai ya aalam-e-badhawasi,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  Yahaan ek khilauna hai insaa ki hasti,Ye basti hai murdaa-parasto ki basti,Yahaa to jeevan se hai maut sasti,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  Jawaani bhatakti hai badkaar ban kar,Jawaa jism sajte hein baazaar ban kar,Yahaa pyaar hota hai vyapaar ban kar,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  Ye duniya jahaan aadmi kuch nahi hai,Wafa kuch nahi, dosti kuch nahi hai,Yahaan pyaar ki qadr hi kuch nahi hai,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  Jala do ise, phoonk daalo ye duniya,Mere saamne se hata lo ye duniya,Tumhaari hai tum hi sambhaalo ye duniya,Ye duniya agar mil bhi jaaye to kya hain?  The meaning in English, though not as powerful as in its original, is below. I tried to find the best translation, and have modified it as I see fit.  This world of palaces, thrones, and crownsThis world of societies that resents humanityThis world of those hungry for material wealthWhat is this world to me, even if I can have it? Each body is afflicted, each soul thirstyEyes are confused and hearts are full of sorrowIs this the world or the realm of the senselessWhat is this world to me, even if I can have it? In this world where a person\u2019s being is only a toyIt is an establishment that worships deathHere it costs less to die than to breatheWhat is this world to me, even if I can have it? Youth wanders about dipped in sinYoung bodies are decorated like they are marketsHere love is treated as a product to tradeWhat is this world to me, even if I can have it? This world where human life is worthlessWhere Loyalty is worthless, where friendship is worthlessWhere love has no meaning at allWhat is this world to me, even if I can have it? Burn this world, set it on fireRemove this world from my sightThis world is yours, you take care of it.What is this world to me, even if I can have it? The video of the song:    ",
