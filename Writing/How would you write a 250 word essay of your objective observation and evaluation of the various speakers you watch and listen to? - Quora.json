The first question is always \u201cwho is the audience?\u201d And for this question specifically, who are the speakers? All the ones I see on the news programs in a day? All the speakers I happen to listen to at an academic conference? Whoever they are, I can\u2019t think of a situation in which a 250-word essay describing and critiquing them would be the right tool for getting that information across to someone else. ",
