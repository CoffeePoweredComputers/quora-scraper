            "answer_text": "Horror narratives work in roughly two ways, I feel. Let's call them fast fuse and slow burn. -1-  (via Imgur) The fast fuse relies on sudden unexpected reveals, preferably under dim lighting and in a murky fog, so that your body's fight-or-flight response is triggered by something you barely spot from the corner of your eye before it overwhelms you. Jump scares (such as those seen in the Five Nights at Freddie's videogames) are the best example. -1.5- Imagine me (the writer) telling you (the reader) that I am actually a disembodied alien intelligence that burrows into your brain through your optic nerves and then feeds off whatever scares you the most. In fact I am currently manifesting as a nightmarish monstrosity RIGHT BEHIND YOU-  (via Five Nights at Freddie's) -2- Whatever fear is sparked off a setup like this one would require the immediacy of the first (or second) person to cut the fastest route through your disbelief - and that is good, because thinking about it at any length would render our setup ridiculous. Fast in this case equals effective. Most Goosebumps novels (targeted as they are at a younger audience) use the first person narrative so you can get swept along in someone else's torrent of inner terror. Give Yourself Goosebumps books use the second person and give you choices that increase your identification with the central characters and their misfortunes. I have blazed through many of these books over a single white-knuckle night and often been scared by things I would laugh at, given time and daylight. Read a few (in one sitting!) to see what I'm talking about. My personal favourite was the first Night of the Living Dummy. -3-  (via Goodreads) Now, the slow burn is a bit harder to pull off. It uses the tools of world building that other genres (including non-fiction!) employ, so that the narrative has a semi-plausible base to stand on. It is only when readers begin to add up the pieces later, in the confines of their own head, that the lopsided structure begins to topple. At which point you step back and let them bury themselves. -4- The stories of H.P. Lovecraft belong to this category. Evidence suggests he was a paranoid and racist man who never quite learnt to live with other cultures, but his dread also gave us terrifying stories about otherworldly creatures whose sheer cosmic scale meant they could squash humanity like mosquitoes - maybe without even realising they were doing it. Lovecraft wrote in both first and third person, but (since a lot of his dialogue was atrocious and his human characters a bit two-dimensional) the horror arose mainly from our viewpoint being peeled back, back, back to reveal the known world being built on impossible shapes the size of continents. Shapes moving like they were alive. Most Call of Cthulhu games (based on his most famous creation) feature a sanity metre that bleeds out if you look at monsters too closely - thereby reminding you that the creatures are not from our reality, and also giving you some indirect control over the worldbuilding. -5- If you enjoyed Goosebumps, you might also be interested in Fear Street by the same author, R.L. Stine. Unlike Goosebumps, this series targeted young adults - which meant more raging hormones and streetsmart, slightly cynical characters who did not scare as easy. Fear Street stories were scarier for the reader because they shared a universe - you might read a hundred pages about a beauty queen being stalked by a deranged psycho before she casually mentions some friends who ran away a few months ago. Friends who (you're certain) got devoured by a vengeful spirit two books ago. Friends who might turn up later in this book with sharper teeth and unfocused eyes\u2026 -5.5- Remember how a previous example talked about alien intelligence burrowing into your optic nerves? Fresh evidence suggests that it transmits not through text but color - more specifically, in the guise of advertisements for a product that doesn't exist. It is only when the reader goes looking for said product that it begins taking over - and by the time they notice themselves changing it is already too late to stop. Boy, all this talking sure got me thirsty. Got any Non Cola-Cola in the fridge?  (via Gfycat) [PS - these demarcations are simply rules of thumb, the examples included as dissected (rather than live) specimens. Find the combo that works for you!] [PPS - Speaking of which, I personally recommend The Boogeyman (short story) and The Dark Half (novel) by Stephen King for examples of how these lines can be blurred to great effect.] Happy trails!

            "answer_text": "Personally, I would write it in third-person. First person accounts are often written that way in order to be unreliable and \u2018hide\u2019 some information from the reader. With a horror, you want the reader to know the information but hide it from the character: building the suspense and tension that horror relies upon. What you could do, is change between the two - have the tale start in first person, get that intimate point of view of the protagonist and all the weird things that are beginning to freak him or her out; but then jump to a third person perspective, where the kindly friend says the protagonist is going mad and doesn\u2019t really need help (thereby showing themselves to be neither kind nor friendly!) - this section can also show the monster or villain\u2019s point of view. Good luck :) ",
