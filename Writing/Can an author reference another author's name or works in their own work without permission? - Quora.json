            "answer_text": "I'm not a lawyer, but I'd think there are rwo permissable uses. The first is what Thursday Bram suggested. Having a character carry the book, mention the book, note it on a coffee table or in someone's bookshelf, even say it's his or her favorite book should be perfectly okay. As Thursday cautions, you might get in trouble with negative mentions. If you're going there, check it out with Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts at http://www.vlany.org/aboutus/index.php. If you are quoting from the book, I'd think fair usage applies. A short quotation should be okay. The longer it gets the more you may need either the author's permission or legal advice. Third situation: I had an author contact me about using my book on documentary filmmaking almost as a character in a novel she was planning. The protagonist would be making a documentary and as problems developed would consult my book (or possibly even me!). In this situation, as the author being quoted, I would reserve right of approval. Unfortunately it never happened. ",

Barry Hampe has pretty much nailed the doctrine of fair use.Try to put yourself in the referenced author's position, and if you feel aggrieved, get an opinion from a copyright lawyer, or better still, contact the author in question as Barry suggests. If they've been dead long enough you won't need to. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! If, however, you are saying something that isn't true about that author, there can be problems. If it's just a mention, like \"X had a copy of King's newest novel on her coffee table,\" you're fine. I would recommend against drawing negative connections to an author, if possible, though \u2014 don't make your least favorite author the idol of a serial killer in a piece of fiction, for instance.
