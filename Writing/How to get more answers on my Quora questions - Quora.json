The more people you follow, the more will follow you and your question will appear to more Quorans in their feeds. Answer Questions of interest to you with thoughtful concise answers. As you become more well known, more Quorans will also read your questions. As an FYI..I left Quora several years ago and have only been back since last summer. Few of the people I \u2019knew\u2019 then are still here. Yet I have close to a thousand followers simply because I write answers that seem to appeal to people. ",
