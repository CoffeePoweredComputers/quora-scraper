            "answer_text": "If your boyfriend is living in the barracks or in on-post quarters, no. Only Servicemembers are authorized to live in the barracks, and often those room assignments are based on unit of assignment. The only people authorized to live in on-post quarters are the Servicemember and their dependents. As a girlfriend, you are not considered a dependent. If your boyfriend lives in off-post quarters, yes. However, there are some things to take into account. If your boyfriend is lower enlisted or a junior NCO and maintains a room in the barracks, he will not receive a housing allowance for a sustenance allowance. The financial burden may severely cut into their pay. If you are co-signers of a lease, only the Servicemember will be covered under a military clause; if your boyfriend is reassigned to another duty station, he will be able to get out of the lease but you will not. If your boyfriend is reassigned to another duty location, only his household goods will moved at government expense (up tot he allowable weight for his rank) and only his travel expenses will be covered. You will be responsible for covering your travel and moving costs. ",
