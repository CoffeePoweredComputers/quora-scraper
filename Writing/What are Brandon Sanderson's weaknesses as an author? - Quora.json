            "answer_text": "His magic systems tend to be a (the?) primary focal point of his stories. This can start to feel monotonous after a while, even though each of his magic systems are very different from each other and are quite original. Though I really enjoy Sanderson and have read most of his work to date, I\u2019ve found it refreshing to be reading the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series by Tad Williams. The magic is much more ambiguous and is really only in the background. Contrast that with Sanderson where his magic usually plays an important role in the emotional climax of almost every book. Sanderson\u2019s prose is also nothing special. His vocabulary is good, but his prose overall just kind of does the job. His prose is nothing like Rothfuss, Williams, or Tolkien (among others). Overall, Sanderson\u2019s writing can sometimes feel a little formulaic: interesting magic system? Check. Emotional climax/hero badass moment near the end? Check. A bunch of reveals leading into the sequel? Check. The thing is, it\u2019s a really good formula that sells a lot of books. But it can start to feel overdone after a few Sanderson reads. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read only one of his books, Warbreaker. I liked it, but it was definitely set in Poughkeepsie, not Elfland, to use Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s comparison. That is, the characters talked and acted like characters in a contemporary realistic novel. Only the rules of the world they live in are strange. Whether that\u2019s a weakness is a matter of taste, but my favorite fantasy stories are more poetic, mysterious, and alien. Obviously I can\u2019t say whether I\u2019d have the same reaction to his other books. ",
