            "answer_text": "11/8, most likely. Which could also be represented in a lot of other groupings, like 12 123 123 123, 123 123 123 12, or 123 123 12 123. And, if you really want to get funky with it (and a little pedantic), you could also have things like 1234 123 1234, 12345 123 123, or 1 12 123 1234 1. You probably wouldn\u2019t, 9 times out of 10, and if you did, most people would still count it in groupings of two or three. But you could group it in larger units that aren\u2019t intended to be broken down into smaller ones. I\u2019ve written that way before, such as including a bar of 4/8 that was phrased as 1234 instead of the more common 12 12, and I\u2019ve used a pretty funky 11/8 grouping before, that was something like 12 12 1234 12 1, to get a really off-kilter feel going. Sky\u2019s the limit with time signature groupings. But I\u2019d say 123 12 123 123 is almost certainly 11/8. That or a bar of 5/8 and a bar of 6/8, or something similar. But probably 11/8. ",
