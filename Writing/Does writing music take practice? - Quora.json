            "answer_text": "I have written a lot of songs. It took me about three years of experimentation (coming up with interesting chord progressions/melodic ideas and developing lyrical themes) before I completed my first song. After that, I got on a roll and have never stopped. The one thing that changed a bit over time was that my songs got shorter and less lyrically extravagant, because I came to understand that brevity and clarity are virtues for a song that you play for others to listen to\u2014and also, it\u2019s easier to memorize a song if it doesn\u2019t have too many verses or really lengthy verses. It\u2019s also worth noting that I record snippets of musical ideas quite often, and only maybe one in 10 or 20 ever becomes a song. And then not every completed song becomes one that the band works into our repertoire. I work at it on practically a daily basis, but I come up with a \u201cgood\u201d song about once a month. ",

I attempted to write some music shortly after those classes and my attempts were futile. However, one day I was starting to write something and I got really frustrated. SUDDENLY it all seemed to click into place and I\u2019ve been writing music now for almost 35 years. Then I needed to work on writing better lyrics so I tutored someone online in music composition and they tutored me on improving my lyrics. I now have several compositions in the U.S. Copyright Office, copyrighted with my name on them. So I guess the answer to your question is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure does and creating music (muzik) can be deceiving. Although I kinda understand the question, there are people out there(same ones that think pop tunes is electronic noise) who will not respect your music and think you will always be novice and the heel of the joke. Especially if we are talking about 1 iv v chord progressions. The more we do something. the more easily things become. Without a effort to progress forward, could be the same as the difference between dreams and goals. Js bach said music relatively speaking, is in two catagories. To glorify the Lord, and to refresh the soul. Like chess all the lines have been drawn already, There are only so many ways to make someone smile, someone dance, or the emptiness of a minor chord progresion making you sad. We know the music we make is on the right path if the people around you enjoy it. After all if your not enjoying the music you create, who will? If you can be happy with your creation, that certainly will be a way to keep your soul refreshed and possibly, someone elses ",
