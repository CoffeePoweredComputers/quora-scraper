            "answer_text": "Are they using caps elsewhere? Is their caps key broken? Does Julia have a problem with it? Does she use caps in their usual positions when she writes emails to this friend? Does the friend get irritated if someone writes their own name without the caps? In my case I prefer gud spelin wh\u2019nevah posibol, whether it is in an email, IM or whatever, simply because it\u2019s easier to read; I don\u2019t need to be deciphering \u201cwhat was this person trying to say\u201d word by word. And \u201cpeople writing my name wrong when they\u2019re answering to an email that\u2019s got it spelled correctly\u201d is beyond a pet peeve: sometimes it\u2019s an honest mistake (these apologize when I point it out and avoid doing it again), but for some it\u2019s a power play and yes, disrespectful. People who tell me it\u2019s \u201cno fucking deal\u201d always turn out to get angry when others misspell their names. If Julia likes her name with a cap J, then that\u2019s how it should be written. Because it\u2019s HER name, not yours or mine. If she liked it written julIa I\u2019d think it\u2019s a bit silly, but I\u2019d write it julIa: because it\u2019s HER name. ",

            "answer_text": "Consistency is polite. If the the entire email (including other names) is in lower case, then you\u2019re not singling julia out in any way. Perfectly courteous, no problem. However, when you capitalize Percival and Melisande and Cyril but poor julia stays lowercase, that\u2019s putting her down, which is rude. See what I did there? \u201cPutting her down\u201d because you\u2019re using lower case not upper case. Ha hee hee hoo ha snort. Grammar puns are hilarious. ",
