            "answer_text": "Business Proposals are documents created for the sole purpose of asking for something - usually business! There are two types of business proposals: Proposals written in response to an RFP Proposals written for a business idea for which you hope to gain a particular market segment, funding, or a business partnership. In this case, there is no competitive bidding process. A proposal written in response to an RFP should be pretty straight-forward, because the rules, regulations and guidelines are clearly stipulated in the RFP itself. However with a 'cold' business proposal, there are no specific guidelines from the targeted audience. The challenge is to create a proposal that is highly customer-centric. Here are 7 tips to writing a 'cold' business proposal: Research, research, research! Without an RFP to guide you, be sure to dig out every bit of public information about your target audience. Use their website, brochures, case studies, annual reports, newsletters etc. Go to your online library database and find out even more about them. You want to know enough about them to anticipate their needs, and write a proposal that addresses those needs! Pay them a visit! If their location is convenient, you may consider dropping by their office/facility. You might be fortunate to observe something or ask a question that could uncover further interesting information about your audience's needs and challenges. Plain English please! Your goal is to communicate not to impress. Eliminate the use of lofty words and technical jargon. Your proposal must be clear, concise and compelling. Don't assume that everyone is familiar with your 'tech-speak'. Differentiate between features and benefits of your product, service or idea. Be sure to give as much detail as required to persuade your audience that you are a worthwhile investment. Remember, features explain how your product or idea works. Benefits explain what the audience gains from using your idea. You must strive to answer the question that they will ask: \"What's in it for me?\" Political correctness: Be sure to use language that is acceptable to one and all. Your proposal cannot be deemed to be offensive to any group of people. The general rule here is, if in doubt, don't! Presentation: Whether you write the proposal yourself, or you hire a writer, be sure to apply the highest standards in document preparation. You must be familiar with the segments of a business proposal. If your proposal is not for solicitation of funds, then some sections of a standard proposal may not be relevant. Finishing touches: Make sure that the document is edited and scrutinized for visual appeal. Pay attention to spelling and grammar, layout, font and size, margins, visual aids, spaces between text, high quality paper, professional printing and binding. Note this; a sound business proposal is an important factor for taking your business to the next level. Take your time to carefully draft out this document or better still outsource it to professionals.  Here is one useful resource I have made use of recently. The services were professional and top-class and I highly recommend to anyone looking for an outstanding business proposal. A good recommendation for business proposal One final thought. Don't wait for a prospect to invite your proposal (RFP). Be proactive and find prospects who are likely to be receptive to your business idea. That's innovative marketing! ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a business proposal is essential to move things forward. This is done most especially if you need to make a move on something big, but do not have the authority to do so. When it comes to the process of writing the proposal, there are several steps that are fairly simple. Following such guidelines could at the very least make you come up with a proposal that would work. The first step, evidently, would be to identify the audience who will be reading your proposal. Get a better understanding about their personalities by finding out what issues they care about the most and how it could possibly benefit them. In a nutshell, put yourself in their shoes and have a better understanding about how they would receive your proposal. After getting that out of the way, it is now time to define the root of the problem. Thoroughly explain the entire purpose of the proposal, along with the full details of the entire situation. Logically, the next step would be to identify how you intend to go about with solving the problem. Again, explain it in deep detail, and note the number of people you will need, if necessary.  To conclude the proposal, once again state the problem at hand, as well as the breakdown of the projected costs. To entice the audience a little, identify how this proposal would be benefitting them, one way or another. Before sending out the proposal, make sure to proofread for possible errors such as spelling or grammar. And as much as possible, try to make use of an active voice, rather than a passive voice in the tonality of your writing. http://www.business2community.com/strategy/write-proposal-get-want-01649527 ",
