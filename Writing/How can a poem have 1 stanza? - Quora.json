            "answer_text": "A poem can absolutely have one stanza! Shakespeare wrote a ton of them!! One of his, the classic \u201cSonnet 18\u2033, is below, in all its single-stanza\u2019d glory\u2026 Sonnet 18by William Shakespeare Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date;Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;And every fair from fair sometime declines,By chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st;Nor shall death brag thou wander\u2019st in his shade,When in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st: So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. source: Poetry Foundation Single-stanza poetry is widely varied in its different forms, as others have already answered. I find them a great way to create a punchy, pithy kind of poetry because you don\u2019t have a lot of time (space) to get to your point! That being stated, of course, one stanza should not be a free verse poem of like 100 lines with no paragraph break. To me that\u2019s cheating, and brutal for your (reading) audience. If a stanza goes any farther beyond the 14 lines length of something like a sonnet, well, that\u2019s sort of begging for a break imho. Two-stanza poems are perfectly fine, too! In fact, they\u2019re a great form for certain specific purposes (as are poems of three stanzas).  (Here\u2019s an interesting deconstruction of some Shakespeare sonnets, btw, that I found while going over to get my copypasta of 18\u2026 https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47051/the-essential-shakespeare-volume-xii-space-saver-sonnets) ",

            "answer_text": "There are many styles of poems and, like Cal stated, they can do pretty much what they want to do. Like Kayla mentioned, there is the Haiku, which is a 3-line short poem that uses sensory language to capture a feeling, or image. It is often inspired by an element of nature, a moment of beauty, or another poignant experience. The first line has 5 syllables, the second has 7, the last has 5. An example of a Haiku: Whitecaps on the bay:A broken signboard bangingIn the April wind.[Anonymous]And let\u2019s not forget the Senryu, (one of my personal favorites), which like the Haiku, also has three lines. The first line has 5 syllables, the second with 7, and the last has 5, like the first. Two examples of a Senryu: Hypocritical: To proclaim a Godly self, yet write hate in verse.[by CJ Heck]Take everyday wordsbeyond everyday talentand write them alive.[by CJ Heck]You can also just have a single stanza poem, such as these below: MemoryMemory is a fragile thing;A bee\u2019s honey, and its sting.[by Violet Wiggins Newton]FriendsSome are true;Others are not.They\u2019ll either love you,Or what you\u2019ve got.[by Bea Myers]I hope this helps you!
