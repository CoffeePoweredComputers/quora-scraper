            "answer_text": "Obviously, he was convicted and fond guilty of alll three accounts. A lawyer who could read the transcription of the trial would be an interesting reference. What were the technicalities of his conviction? But also interesting to note that Philippine Law in 1896 was still medieval. Any \u201ctsismis\" was alteady considered evidence. In fact, companies in the Philippines can still fire you over \u201ctsismis\". In 1872, Father Zamora was found guilty over a letter that contained \"lots of bullets\" which was jargon for gambling, bullets referring to fambling funds. Father Burgos was convicted over a false state witness. Jose Rizal would have been convicted over \u201ctsismis\" or absurd evidences of his links to Katipunan, such as a portrait found in their meeting places. Nevertheless, absurd in today's standards but considered strong evidence in a backward society like the Philippines. In fact, Rizal was not even against Spanish rule in his books. Ibarra was a creole, his bestfriend a peninsular, his arch enemy a dominican and alferez. Both the novel's heroes and villains alike were Spaniards. His main object of ridicule was the indolence of indios like Sisa's husband and Elias's father, stupidity of the judicial system that convicts people based on \u201ctsismis\" (Elias father the indio, Don Rafael the creole, Sisa the indiotgen later on Ibarra the creole were all convicted based on \u201ctsismis\"). Rizal was just as racist against indios much like the friars wgo wanted him dead. So as per laws of the time, yes he is guilty of treason, sedition and rebellion. Why? Because the Church was absolute, a holy ancient institution ordained by God himself. In 1800s, the doctrine of \u201cDivine Right of Kings\" had not yet fallen and replaced by Liberalism or Republicanism (exactly what Rizal et al wanted, tge demise pf the Church and rise of a secular government). It's like being executed for speaking against Duterte. You are against a tyrant but not the Philippines. Rizal was against tge churvh but not Spain. Unfotunately, Duterte IS the Philippines and the Church IS the government. Thus, Rizal was convicted for treason and sentenced to die a traitor -by firing squad and facing away. He was to be shot in the head, facing away from the executioners and possibly blindfolded. Thus, the next questions regarding his tiro de gracia and facing his executioners last minute, pleading the executioners to spare his head, etc etc. ",

            "answer_text": "In a land where people have free speech, I would say probably not, unless he actually called for revolution. In America even that's questionable in our era because people write dystopian novels in which revolution takes place. He was only writing fiction as well, in which he explained the wrongs of the Spanish colonial system. I believe he was even invited by revolutionaries to join their movement and refused. He wanted to change the Philippines for the better while remaining within the Spanish culture and domain. I believe Rizal liked the beautiful things about Spanish culture. ",
