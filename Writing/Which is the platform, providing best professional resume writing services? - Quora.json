            "answer_text": "Making the choice to work with a CV writing company is an investment in your career - one that will help show your industry your true value as a professional. Online reviews, video testimonials, customer success stories \u2012 these can all offer an idea of the kind of work the company puts out. Do some sleuthing into the company\u2019s history as well. Have they established themselves in the industry, or are they just starting out? Reviewing information on the \u2018About Us\u2019 or \u2018Company History\u2019 sections of their site will give some insight into their level of expertise in the field. You want to make sure the people you are entrusting with your CV know what they\u2019re doing. Depending on the service, a professionally written CV can cost upwards of $500. While that price tag may suggest a higher-quality product, it isn\u2019t feasible for everyone \u2012 nor is it indicative of quality. Take a look at your finances to see what you are able to spend. While there may be variations in quality and assets, this investment in your career still needs to be affordable. To expedite the job-application process, most companies now use applicant tracking systems \u2012 software designed to scan CVs and eliminate those it deems least qualified. Your key to passing through this automated gatekeeper is peppering your CV with the keywords, skills and industry-specific jargon it is searching for. There are many variables in the hiring process that are out of a writer\u2019s control after finishing your CV. As a result, it\u2019s not possible for a CV-writing service to guarantee someone a job offer. Still, there are ways they can assure you that you will get a return on your investment. Some services will rewrite your CV for free if you don\u2019t receive twice as many interviews within 60 days of receiving your final copy. Guarantees like these are key when you are choosing a CV-writing service because they can give you the confidence that your CV will give you positive results. ",

            "answer_text": "A good CV should reflect part of who you are instead of just being a white sheet of paper with billet points. It's the first opportunity to make you stand from the rest of the applicants. the software is just the tool that you use to achieve that. Personally I redesign my CV every 6 months and I use Sketch to do so. I like to use icons and move every element freely, adding colors and layers to enhance certain things. Office suite or Apple suite, Google Docs, are all good too. There are no wrong answers. You could even achieve a great CV with Paint. ",
