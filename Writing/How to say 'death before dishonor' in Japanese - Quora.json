            "answer_text": "Sorry but my Japanese isn\u2019t good enough to properly form a grammatically correct translation for this but if I had to say (and I could be wrong) It might be \u201cFumeiyo no mae no shi\u201d once again I might be wrong as these are words not commonly used or taught (at least not to me). So don\u2019t completely take my word for it. Though it shoukd be good enough that a native Japanese speaking person would understand what you\u2019re saying. ",
