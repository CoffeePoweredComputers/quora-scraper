The thesis of The Death of the Author (\"the death of the author is the birth of the reader\") is interesting from the perspective of 2010 with interactivity and the semantic Web.  Barthes would not have predicted the current hostility towards copyright or the ascendence of computer code as de facto law, but they comport well with the notions of living text expressed in Barthes' 1967 essay.

In particular, his concept of the \u201cstudium\u201d (general interest value of a photo) and \u201cpunctum\u201d (an arresting detail) was a very useful tool for cultural critics wishing to explicate the value of photographic images.
