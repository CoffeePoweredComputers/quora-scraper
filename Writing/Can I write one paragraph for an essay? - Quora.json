            "answer_text": "You can write anything you want, but you are unlikely to end up with a quality piece of writing. I think you are asking whether one paragraph equals an essay. Probably not. If you have a lengthy paragraph that makes a claim and supports it with sufficient evidence, you probably need to separate the information in the paragraph into several paragraphs according to the main points you make. If it is just a single paragraph, you likely have not written a thorough enough writing sample to fulfill the requirements of an essay. ",

            "answer_text": "No, you can not write one paragraph for an essay; that would be like calling a strawberry a smoothie. In proper writing, your statement of topic should be 3\u20135 sentences long, and is to be supported with at least 3 points of argument. Each argument should be 3\u20137 sentences. Lastly, you must conclude your argument by presenting your conclusion based on the arguments that you have presented. This should also be 3\u20135 sentences long. Each thing I mentioned is supposed to be separated by a blank double-space line or an indented line, implying a new paragraph. A paragraph is a unit of measurement, and it presents a slightly different but related topic to one\u2019s discussion. An essay implies a minimum of 5 paragraphs. Any less is fundamentally not an essay, but a long response to a short-answer question. ",

There are a lot of people who say an essay should be five paragraphs, but it\u2019s an extremely limiting rule, and unless you\u2019ve been instructed to write a five paragraph essay, there\u2019s no reason to stick to it. As a rule, you\u2019ll write your essay in three main parts. First, you\u2019ll introduce your topic to your reader. Next, you will have body text in which you discuss the topic in more detail, and finally, you\u2019ll have a conclusion that tells your reader what you were able to see after looking into the facts or thinking through the topic.
