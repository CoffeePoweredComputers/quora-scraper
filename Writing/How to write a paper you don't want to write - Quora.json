            "answer_text": "If you really don\u2019t want to write a particular paper, let others write it and you put together the pieces (always citing the work of others). Here\u2019s how I did it. 1) Identify a few other key papers related to the subject of the paper I have been assigned. 2) Skim those papers, copying (and keeping the references) parts that apply and pasting into my document. 3) Go over my paper full of quotes from other papers, rearranging and summarizing the quotes. I add a little text to pull them all together. I always end up with a few ideas of my own that I throw in. My new ideas sometimes mean that I look up more source material, but that\u2019s OK. 4) Edit a bit to make sure it\u2019s reasonably clean and polished (and that the citations are present and correct). You\u2019ll never have enough time to make it perfect. 5) Add my cover page / heading as appropriate and submit. That strategy got me a 4.something GPA on my master\u2019s just a few years ago. ",
