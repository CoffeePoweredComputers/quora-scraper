            "answer_text": "Yes! For sure. It is like throwing stones in a placid lake and enjoying the small ring of waves till it becomes a addicive frenzy, enough to cause turbidity in the water. The waters do not fight back or bite back and the damage is cumulative before it is too late. In a staid and rhythmic cycling of water and solids in the water body, if daily load of waste is added it overwhelms the process leading to change in biota and physical characteristics of the water. Hence human society has to be responsible as fresh water is limited on land and easily degraded in quality. Use but treat and responsibly recycle. ",
