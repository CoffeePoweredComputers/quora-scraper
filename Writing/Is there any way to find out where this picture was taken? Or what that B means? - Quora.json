            "answer_text": "Hard to tell. The single letter marking in that spot appears to have been somewhat common. Here\u2019s an example with a \u201cC\u201d:  This is, according to Wikimedia Commons, a Flak battery in firing position somewhere in Germany in 1943\u2026 I\u2019ve found other pictures of 8,8cm Flak guns \u2013 which is my best shot at guessing what type of gun \u201cyours\u201d is \u2013 marked that way with differing letters. My guess is that it might be a way to denote the individual guns in a battery\u2026 For placing this, the guy with the white tunic could be a hint. My first thought was he might be navy \u2013 but apparently, white tunics as part of the summer uniform were issued to pretty much all  parts of the Wehrmacht and SS at different times.  So, we can say this was most likely taken in the summertime. Wearing the summer tunic with open collar and tie was apparently only allowed relatively late in the war \u2013 likely around \u201943, so this would be later than that. The presence of the white summer tunic pretty much rules out Africa \u2013 the Afrikacorps had their own, somewhat distinctive uniforms. The landscape looks a lot more like Europe, as well. My guess from what little scenery can be seen would be either Northern or central Germany, Northern France, the Netherlands or somewhere in the plains of (North)Eastern Europe in the summer of \u201943 or \u201944\u2026 ",

The troops are from the German airforce, which also handled the anti aircraft warfareThe gun is a german 8.8cm FlaK gun, in the desert camouflage",
