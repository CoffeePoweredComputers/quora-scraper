            "answer_text": "Writing an email is something that can be important to have been written effectively to make the reader intrested enough to read the whole matter rather than just ignoring it. Firstly, to make it catchy the crucial aspect is your Subject of the email. Make it a precise one but having a curious hint about your matter. Then, comes your body of email where you want to add phrases, here, the initial thing you need to check is the person to whom you are writing because that will decide the tone to be used to express your content including sentence usage.Like, it is obvious you won\u2019t be formal with a friend of yours. If thinking of adding phrases, obviously you should know some alongwith their context of usage, to make it more effective. You can try to go for use of complex sentences with a good variety of vocabulary and idiomatic language, again as per the context. Like, if an email for a friend to thank for a gift, you can add \u2018I was on seventh sky when unboxed that watch\u2019.Similarly, to an official giving you an opportunity you would say \u2018I feel grateful that such an opportunity knocked at your door\u2019. Hope I answered your query, still if any doubt then do ask for it. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are writing an email, it would in most case be for some official purpose. In that event, make sure your words are formal ones, which are also clear and concise. Don't too much experiment with unfamiliar words, as there is risk of being misunderstood by the recipient. Try to learn certain frequently used words or phrases used in a formal setting. Even if you have to disagree, make sure your sentence construction are not too much offending to the other side, but at the same time you drive home your point. Don't write too much than what is required. ",
