Every page should have a clear heading or poem title. The foreword should be inspiring, and at the beginning you should also include a table of contents as a quick reference. The editor at the publishing house would polish the content, and choose the cover. However, you could choose a picture for the cover which sets a tone for the book. Should it be a book about poetry (as opposed to a poetry collection) , this would be a different kettle of fish. ",
