The American Library Association champions open and equal access Access to Library Resources and Services \u201cEquity extends beyond equality\u2014fairness and universal access\u2014to deliberate and intentional efforts to create service delivery models that will make sure that community members have the resources they need. Often these needs are different not only as the result of race and ethnicity but also owing to religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identification, socioeconomic status, or physical ability. Libraries are major sources of information for society and they serve as guardians of the public\u2019s access to information. The advent of the digital world has revolutionized how the public obtains its information and how libraries provide it. As the digital world continues to evolve, libraries help ensure that people can access the information they need \u2013 regardless of age, education, ethnicity, language, income, physical limitations or geographic barriers. Core values of the library community such as equal access to information, intellectual freedom, and the objective stewardship and provision of information must be preserved and strengthened, now more than ever. For intellectual freedom to flourish, opposition to censorship of materials is not enough. Access to materials, without prejudice, to every member of the community must also be assured. As one of the core values of librarianship, \u2018Equality of access to recorded knowledge and information\u2019 which involves \u2018insuring that all library resources are accessible to all overcoming technological and monetary barriers to access\u2019 goes hand in hand with democracy and freedom.\u201d Bonus: Here are 9 Unexpected Benefits That Come with Having a Library Card.

            "answer_text": "I can only answer for the United States. For print books, authors make their money from the sale of the book(s) to the library. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s a one-time payment. Granted, that book will get worn and need replacing, so long as it\u2019s even somewhat popular. And libraries who buy one book by an author are likely to buy more\u2014again, provided it\u2019s even a little popular. Authors also generally embrace libraries carrying copies of their work. (As you can see in Lawrence Watt-Evans\u2019s answer.) Circulating copies of library books draw in more readers, and if they like the book, they\u2019re likely to talk about it to friends and family, pulling in more interest. If they really like it, they might buy their own copy. That\u2019s happened to me several times now. And here I thought that if I worked at a library, I would spend less money on books\u2026 Anyway, that\u2019s just for print. Ebooks are a different matter altogether. When a library carries an ebook (or e-audiobook) they\u2019re only licensing it from the publisher. That license is only valid for a certain number of circulations. Once that number is reached, the library has to pay to license the book again. My understanding\u2014and I welcome correction if this is wrong\u2014is that the author receives royalties for every such license, provided they\u2019ve earned out their advance. ",

Several countries have what they call \u201cPublic Lending Rights,\u201d where authors living in that country do get a small royalty for each time a library loans out one of their books. The UK does this, and I\u2019m pretty sure some of the Scandinavian countries; not sure where else. (I believe Canada has considered it, but I don\u2019t know if it ever went into effect.) It\u2019s paid for out of general taxes, library patrons don\u2019t pay any fees or anything. The U.S. does not have public lending rights payments. Of course, every copy of a book that a library buys pays the regular royalty rate. You might think writers would resent all those people reading their books for free, but most of us were readers first, and love libraries. We consider it part of recruiting more readers. ",

It makes no difference if the sale is made to an individual over the counter in a book store, ordered and delivered by mail, or bought by an institution, for example a hospital, nursing home, prison, school, or library. All of these sales result in a payment to the author, but none of these buyers send a payment to the author. The author's cut is contained in the book's price. Libraries do not receive their books free; we pay for each book we accession. (It is true that we sometimes receive donations, but those books have been bought by someone, and the author got his cut. The standard word for the author's cut is \"royalty.\") ",

While I\u2019m not sure on the particulars it\u2019s possible authors end up with more royalties when libraries purchase digital collections that include their book. Depending on the licensing agreements a book may be able to be borrowed by multiple people at the same time, this is essentially like purchasing two copies of a book. The cost for the digital library may be cheaper per book for the subscription period but subscriptions have to be renewed so the library will be paying again eventually. Not sure how the numbers work out for sure though. ",

In New Zealand Libraries\u2019 right to purchase and lend material is legislated and this allows them to do a couple of things that might otherwise be thought to contradict copyright. However, one year when I was studying to be a librarian I had a couple of weeks work making a list of all the books held by New Zealand authors in the Teachers College library I was working in. This list was used by the New Zealand Book Council, I believe, to offer NZ authors compensation for presumed list earnings. It\u2019s also worth noting that numerous studies have shown that areas with healthy public library systems pend more on books than areas without, as libraries create and develop readers at all ages.

There\u2019s no additional payment to authors beyond the sale. However, some countries and locations do have an additional payment to authors based on loans. (The United Kingdom does this, but I am not familiar with all the details, just that it\u2019s up to a certain amount per year per author. That\u2019s through the Public Lending Rights scheme.)
