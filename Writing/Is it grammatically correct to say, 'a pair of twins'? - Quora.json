            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question. As another Quoran has indicated, a pair of twins could mean two sets of twins. That\u2019s certainly a reasonable read of the phrase - and a reasonable usage. However, things mean what they mean, not what we impute to them. Some languages have something called a \u201cclassifier.\u201d It\u2019s a word that indicates \u201cwhat type\u201d of thing we\u2019re talking about, or gives details about it. Here\u2019s a good article about one language - Mandarin Chinese\u2019s - use of classifiers: 5 ridiculously specific Chinese classifiers \u2013 ChineseMe English seems to use a few classifiers, a bit. My favorite example is \u201ccouple.\u201d Here\u2019s a typical use of the word as an informal classifier in the dialect of English I speak: [At the home improvement store] I\u2019m just after a couple two or three options. By the same token, though in the past \u201ccouple\u201d might have meant literally two - and still can be used that way - nowadays it means \u201can amount less than a few,\u201d the phrase \u201ca few\u201d also having fuzzy boundaries. So, it we look again at the phrase originally cited - \"a pair of twins\" - and see the word \u201cpair\u201d more as a classifier than a quantifier, then the phrase is both correct and correct when only referring to two babies.
