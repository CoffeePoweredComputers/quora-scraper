            "answer_text": "This is dependent on the kind of work they produce and the kind of writing you do. If they are looking for a finished version of a dramatic script, send them what you have. Same rule applies to corporate films, TV commercials, documentaries. Always make sure your work is protected by a copyright. Laws and rules vary from country to country, but look into what it takes to protect your work. Many times production companies want to make sure that you can really write, and that you can actually finish something. This request for samples of your work is the first test/step of whether they will want to work with you. Always ask for guidance when submitting your work. Ask if they want an entire screenplay or just a couple of scenes. Remember, people work with people they like. So be professional, prompt, and clear about what what they are looking for. Best of luck. ",

So they all for sample script. Just write few and don't really sorry. I mean let them be shared to everyone. Put your copyright as the paper background. That will help. Keep original ideas with you..
