            "answer_text": "In many offices, a paralegal is your contact, intake person. Some lawyers appear in court, go into offices across a wide area or even multiple states. Treat a paralegal same as a knowledgeable lawyer. Have all pertinent info, pictures, proof with you when being interviewed by a paralegal. They are not receptionists, they do most, if not all the research and law book reviews to find related laws pertaining to your particular situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, the same skills one needs for any negotiations. Prepare ahead of time by looking into the laws, local codes, etc. so you will understand what is or is not possible for your situation. Make note of the points you need to bring to light during negotiations. At the discussion, listen carefully to the paralegal, without interrupting. If needed, write down notes on the paralegal\u2019s presentation to remember what questions or comments you need to address. Do NOT become angry or irritated, remember that the paralegal is only doing his or her job. ",
