            "answer_text": "If it isn't normal, it jolly well ought to be! One of the great problems many businesses suffer from? Employees get a job. It is specific and detailed. If they can do their little bit, then they have achieved, and the main thing that matters? They get paid at the end of the week. Problem with that? It is easy to lose perspective on the contingencies, the things beyond the immediate task, the overall condition of the business, the market. If you could do something which could encourage employees to think of the business as bigger than just their domain of production, what would it be? Something as simple as asking for a business plan maybe? What will building a business plan do? It will force the employee to think about Market needMeeting market needResearching solutionsDelivering solutionsUnderstanding costMarginResources requiredOpportunity costfurther growth opportunities.Which of these is harmful to the employee? Which is beneficial to the employee?* *This may be a trick question\u2026 Employees who can do this successfully will experience a few interesting things. They will be promoted significantly faster. They will be trusted. They will be respected. Why? If I have the choice between somebody who has shown me they can think strategically versus somebody who just wants to come to work from 9 to 5, my choice is obvious. I will employ the person who tries to understand the breadth of the business. This person will be my early warning system, they will propel my business to the leading edge, IF, I let them! Hell, they might even be wrong, but expansive thinking will benefit me and my business far more than any other attitudinal constant I can think of, because that will rub off on the rest of the team. I want people who will do my job better than I can. In fact, I believe this so firmly, that I have advised many people who can't find jobs to study a business, then write a business case for why they should be employed, and how their employment will profit the business (over and above their cost of course!). I would be incredibly hard pressed or even downright foolish to turn someone down if they came to me with that proposition! ",

            "answer_text": "They are asking you \"How to eat an elephant?\" and expecting that you would answer \"one bite at a time\". It is a normal question and understand that they are not expecting a business plan in answer, they are looking for how you will tackle this - are you asking the right questions, do you know the industry language, how you approach planning and strategy, do you know what is important in business etc. For example, if I would be asked for a Business Plan in an interview I would answer by saying, Let's split the business plan in to four broad sections and take it one by one - Strategy, Organization, Operation, and Finance.  If you don't mind, I would like to start with Finance so I can get a better understanding of the business, do you have any preference where we start? Once I have said this much, I have A. engaged the interviewer in my answer and B. set a direction for this discussion.  In most cases, your Interviewer would say yes starting with Finances is fine. Now, ball is again in your court, you play it by asking some relevant questions that will help you build the financial of the company - so two major pieces are Income and Expense Assets & Liabilities, do you have any data on Balance Sheet & Income statement so I can study it?  This Q&A like discussion goes on, you keep control of the discussion by asking questions, taking notes of key information and work you way through each section. Be ready to also answer a question in return of your question. for example, let's say you asked, can I have a list competitor pricing? Now, interviewer may question back asking you that why is that important and how does that info change your plan etc?  Once you have all the info, ask for a few minutes to put it all together. Now, it comes down to your skills in putting a lot of information together in a cohesive and comprehensive manner to present a strategy/ business plan.   You can model this approach (break down & attack one by one) to any such big picture questions, as the goal of interviewer is not really to have a right or wrong answer from you but to observe how you approach problems, how detail oriented you are, how much breadth and depth you have in your understanding a particular subject matter etc.   All the best!
