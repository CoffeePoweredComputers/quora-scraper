            "answer_text": "\u201cIs Mexican Spanish (language) the same as Spain Spanish?\u201d  Not completely the same. There are enough differences between the dialects to result in occasional and significant misunderstandings. There are some people who seem to think that there are only differences in \u201caccent.\u201d Quite untrue. There are significant differences in lexicon/syntax, grammar, and phonology in the spoken dialects. There are people in Spain who seem to think that what they hear in films produced in Mexico is the extent of what the difference might be, never realising that the dialogues are usually crafted in such as way as to be understandable by the untraveled residents of Spain and other countries Someone from Spain can provide a distinguishing difference when saying \u201ccasa\u201d and \u201ccaza\u201d but in Mexican you have to rely on the context. Send a kid from La Mancha to find a guajolote\u200b and see what happens. Send that manchego and someone from Jalisco to bring you a tetera and see if you get two different items. Tell someone from Lepe that you have caught a guagua and see what he thinks of that. Actually, there are many hundreds of such differences, and opportunities for misunderstandings and failures to communicate effectively. ",

            "answer_text": "Same language, different features (accent, idioms, expanded vocabulary, regionalisms, etc), which do not hinder mutual intelligibility. As much as people like to idolize one language variety over others, it is important to keep in mind that all languages are alive and different speakers use them in different and particular ways depending on external aspects such as time (languages evolve, change and disappear in time) , context (the way you write a love letter is different from how you write a term paper) geography, etc. All these variables enlarge the linguistic stock (body) of a language and every speaker will have different registers that they'll choose from when faced with a given situation that requires language and communication (context). Just like a wardrobe, you don't wear everything you own at the same time: some garments are seasonal, some are for everyday use, some are for special occasions, some are for the feet, some are for the torso, some are for costume parties. Bear in mind that Spanish is not spoken in Spain (or any other country for that matter) as a single, indivisible unit (just like British English, Iberian Spanish is a collection of regional variants). There are several regional variations, accents, idiomatic expressions, word choices, etc. In Spain this augmented by the fact that the country is split into regions where people speak/study other official languages in addition to Spanish (Castilian) such as Catalan, Aragonese, Galician, Basque, etc. Spanish, as we know it today, is but one language. It is spoken as a first language by several hundred million people that live in fairly spread out, vast territories, some of which have been isolated for centuries - it is only natural to find variations. In this sense Spanish and English are very similar whereas languages that are \u201cconfined\u201d to more clearly defined territories and peoples tend to vary less from community to community as it is the case with Icelandic, Georgian, Romanian, etc. Italian, German and even Norwegian (with its relatively small native-speaker base) as national languages are mostly contained within the national borders of their countries (yes, there are large communities living abroad and German is (or one of) the official language in Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, etc.) but their own regional variants are clearly marked. There are distinct features in the German spoken in Bavaria but it doesn't make it any less German than the variety spoken in, let's say, Hamburg. SImilarly, Nynorsk and Bokmal have their own sets of peculiarities but still, they both embody the Norwegian language (together with the other varieties). The same applies to Spanish and all its branches with their distinct features, their words loaned from the other languages they are in contact with (Nahuatl, Quechua, French, English, Portuguese and so on). Spanish is constantly evolving to suit the needs and to speak to the social, technological, political and environmental changes of its community of speakers. ",
