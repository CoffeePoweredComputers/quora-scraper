            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s employ some perspective. Screenwriters are not first responders, we\u2019re not curing cancer or saving the environment. However, going out on a limb here, it\u2019s probably safe to say that most everyday heroes like to sit down and watch a movie now and then. For those who like or make movies, yes, it\u2019s pretty important to have a screenwriter involved. As someone who has been passionate about watching and making films for a long time, it\u2019s easy to forget that, if a filmmaker is doing their job well, their work should be invisible. When watching a film, a viewer should be taken away, swept up in the story. Audiences should not be thinking \u201cthat\u2019s a great shot\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s a great line\u201d or \u201cthe special effects were amazing,\u201d they should come away from the film having been engrossed, entertained, touched and/or provoked. If a screenwriter does not write an entertaining or, in a best case scenario, rich and meaningful story, chances are good that the film will suffer. If you have ever seen a movie you did like or a movie that you liked until it started to fall apart, the reason is usually the screenplay. Sometimes the blame can be on the writer but there are many times when a film starts production before the screenplay is fully ready and that can be blamed on the producers. Similarly, speaking from personal experience, a director can make changes to the screenplay once it is in his or her hands and damage what had been a good screenplay. ",
