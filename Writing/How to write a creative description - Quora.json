            "answer_text": "So, kind of like when you answer the Who, What, Where, When questions for other types of writing, you'll want to do the same with descriptive wiritng, only using the 5 senses as a starting point. Then, as you go along, you'll want to include adjectives and smilies. Now, I don't mean like \u201creally big/super smelly/very short\u201d or cliches like \u201ccool as a cucumber\u201d. You want to show, not tell, correct? You want you reader to have an experience. So take those into consideration when writing a creative description, and you'll be well in your way to painting a picture with words! ",
