            "answer_text": "For some teachers / professor you should be within the lime - so basically no words over the limit. Generally, I would aim for slightly below the limit to ensure that I have not gone over. In some cases, professors will not read past the limit, so your conclusion might be completely useless! I actually had a professor do this to me; however, he had miscounted the paragraphs and lines, so his count was incorrect. He fixed the mark when I brought this to his attention. Today, most of your papers are done on computer and \u201cword count\u201d is more specific. All the more reason not to go over the limit! Most students need to tighten up their sentences and paragraphs to be more concise and to the point. This not only will keep you within limits, but it will also make your argument stronger.
