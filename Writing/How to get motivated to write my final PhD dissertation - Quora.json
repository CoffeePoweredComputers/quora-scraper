            "answer_text": "(1) Stop yelling at yourself. (2) You\u2019ve done an awful lot. And a PhD notoriously pushes you through at least one major personal growth phase. Spend 5 minutes each morning genuinely congratulating yourself for something, acknowledge how hard it was \u2014 not how easy it should\u2019ve been, or would be now, but how hard it was for you to learn everything you needed to (including managing your advisor or funder) to get it done. OK, just do that for a few days (or even weeks. When you\u2019re motivated the work goes much faster.) Maybe write down any of the congratulations that you really felt proud of, whether they\u2019re \u201cbig\u201d or \u201cresume-worthy\u201d or not, and tape them to the wall or something so you can see it. (3) At some point you will think, \u201coh you know what? That\u2019s right! I did do those things! I can do this! I can find a job after! My fears are just fear, they\u2019re not reality,\u201d and you\u2019ll be motivated to start. (4) Capture that motivation by writing ONE page. The outline, or the intro, or the experiment that was really easy to explain, or the argument you\u2019ve been having in your head. GREAT! If you\u2019re past that part, then write one page on something that is next. (5) When you think you can do more, hopefully that same day but maybe not, do more. Think in terms of 15 minutes. Between your 15 minutes, you can march in place, do planks, jumping jacks or burpees or whatever to get your heartrate up. This will fix your stress. (6) Eventually you\u2019ll do more than 15 minutes because why stop. Great! But when you take a break, still do 15 minutes of moving. (7) At some point you\u2019re going to need to make a writing plan, but that will happen anyway once you\u2019re humming along. This is the basic pattern: write, take a physical break,\u2026 write, stop, relax before sleep.  If this doesn\u2019t work, call your campus mental health line and set up appointments to talk to a therapist \u2014 presumably covered by your grad student insurance. Getting stuck at this point is SO common they have talked to literally thousands of students like you. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy. This is the hard one. The final hurdle. At the end of the day, you literally have to sit down and start writing. Simple, right? It really is that simple. Just sit at the computer, slit your wrists and let the words pour out. Fortunately, there are some things that can help. Don\u2019t look at it as writing. See if you can get into it by planning out your document. Get all your research into piles and then start planning how you will present it. At first, it will be a high level and then you can start filling in some basics using the research you have in piles. In the end, you will have some data not used. See if your document plan is incomplete and the data can be used or see if the data is irrelevant. Either way, you can then go and firm up what it is you are trying to say. You are nor creating a novel here. You have worked on an argument for the last three years, so you know what you are trying to say. Now sit down and say it. Don't look at it as \u2018writing.\u2019 Look at it like filling in the blanks of the puzzle ",
