            "answer_text": "The disrespectful behaviour - on your part? Be prepared to grovel. Denounce yourself for starters. Admit what a miserble twit you are and that you have shamefully misbehaved and it is killing you. You cannot live with yourself and you want to beg for forgiveness. Promise to never be disrespectful again as you have learnt your lesson and are now fully aware of the horrible feeling it has left you with. Do not say much more. You can express your sorrow in one sentence. Do not write an essay. Say what you feel in such a way that the other person will recognise your guilt feelings. Good luck. ",
