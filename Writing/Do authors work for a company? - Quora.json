            "answer_text": "Rarely. The most precise answer to your question (from an American perspective) would be whether authors are employees of a company. The largest percentage of authors (as a percentage of total titles in the market) are self-published. They work for no one as an author but themselves. The next largest percentage of authors are not self-published and don\u2019t work for a publisher for a wage. These are authors who have a trade publishing deal \u2014 usually referred to as \u201ctraditional publishing.\u201d They are independent creators from whom the publisher licenses the rights to produce and sell their works (just as is the case with musicians and record labels). In return, the publisher invests in the production and publication of their books and pays a royalty. A small subset of this is the relatively new hybrid or co-op publishing business model, in which the publisher and author share in the investment of the book\u2019s production and publication. However, the legal arrangement is essentially the same as a trade-publishing deal. A smaller percentage of authors are engaged by companies in a work-for-hire agreement. In this instance, the authors are independent contractors \u2014 not employees \u2014 who are paid for their work, and typically a flat fee. They are effectively self-employed. And the work once completed and approved is fully the property of the company that hired them. The authors have no ongoing ownership or intellectual-property rights at all, but may receive a royalty. (Most don\u2019t, however.) Last is what you\u2019re describing \u2014 when a person is a salaried or hourly employee of a company (whether publishing or not) who authors a book as an employee. By default, this work is the property of the company, but in some instances, the ownership may be shared. One example is a friend of mine who wrote a few books at the assignment of her company, which was a publisher of craft-related books. It as all done as part of her job (she was otherwise an editor there), and the publisher fully owns the rights to those books. But in the grand realm of book publishing, authors as employees are a very tiny percentage. Thanks for the A2A. I hope this helps! [Answered: Do authors work for a company?] ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \u201cwork for\u201d. In general, even authors published by the same publisher are not employed by the company, they are under contract for a given number of works and that can change with sales numbers. Authors who go the self-publishing route are not paid by a publishing company but earn on sales only. In the past, there have been publishers who had \u201cin house\u201d writers, but I don\u2019t think that exists any more. So, essentially, authors are not employed by the publishers. Now, if the author writes for a magazine, that can be different as there are some who are full time employed by the magazine and thus by the publisher. This goes for anything from Time to Good Housekeeping, although some do purchase articles submitted on spec by freelance writers. ",
