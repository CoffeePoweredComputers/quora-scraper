            "answer_text": "A character\u2019s breaking point is one of the most important aspects of any story, whether it is fiction or non-fiction. It is the basis of your entire story. It provides a turning point into the whole story. So, it is not the kind of thing that can be toyed with. You cannot just have a breakthrough with a character whenever you want. That would be very reckless. While creating characters for any story, we ensure that each of these characters have some role in the story. Each character should have a motivation, a particular part to fulfill and carry the story forward. Building the proper character arc, keeping the character\u2019s role and motivation in mind, is very necessary. As a reader, I would say that a build up is very essential before any character\u2019s breaking point. Placing the breaking point of a character whereever you want, without proper buildup will definitely loose the interest of the reader. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideally, it would happen shortly before the climax of the story. This is when they\u2019ve done everything they can and they still fall short and hit rock-bottom. It is right after that they reach a solution and takes the story into the climax. There is no exact formula for that, but you want to try to keep the timing as tight as possible to maintain the tension in the story. Write on. ",
