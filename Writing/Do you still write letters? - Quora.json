            "answer_text": "I do. In fact, I just got a new pen pal for the first time in years. She posted a call for a pen pal on her blog, and I answered. We've been writing to each other for about two weeks now. We're just a couple of strangers slowly getting to know each other through handwritten words on pretty paper. I've always felt more confident expressing myself through writing than through speaking, so letters are one of my favorite forms of communication. When I was in my teens and early 20\u2019s, my best friend and I used to converse mostly through hand-delivered letters. My first boyfriend and I got to know each other through letters. We eventually started writing a fantasy story together. He wrote his part in a letter, then I wrote my part. Back and forth it went. The last letter I wrote before meeting my new pen pal was to a woman I knew from my old church. When I was a teenager, she made a huge impact in my life, so I wrote to her a couple years ago to let her know how much she and her guidance meant to me. She used to write to me when I was away at camp. I loved getting her letters because she always stuffed the envelopes with little pieces of confetti or plastic trinkets. I had saved all those envelopes and their contents, so I put a handful of tiny hearts in that first letter. We wrote back and forth to each other for about a year. Now that I'm thinking about it, I owe her another letter. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing a letter is the only reason that my father and I have been in contact for the last month, even though we\u2019d never spoken before that in our lives. My father has been absent all of my life, as something happened (which I don\u2019t know about) which caused him to leave back when my mother was pregnant with me. She\u2019s always been pretty open and has never lied about anything to me, but always said that I had to be 16 before I could attempt to contact him myself. Roll onto June 2016 (a few weeks before my 16th birthday) and I managed to find my half-brother (his side) on Facebook. After a little searching I managed to find my dad\u2019s account. While his account was public he didn\u2019t have any contact details on it (and I didn\u2019t want to message him on Facebook directly). However, he did have his workplace, which was in a school. I left this for a few months as I had finished school in late June and started College. However, I decided in November that I would try and contact him. So I wrote him a letter and sent it to the school. While I sent the letter on November 29th 2016, I still hadn\u2019t heard from him by the New Year so began to give up. However, it wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t intend to respond, it was because he didn\u2019t actually get given it until January 10th 2017. I included my Facebook account and he sent me a message on January 12th saying while he didn\u2019t want to meet straight away, he would like to make contact via Facebook and we\u2019re still messaging each other about 4 or 5 times a week. So, while we talk on Facebook now, the only reason we\u2019re in contact is because I wrote a letter to him. Other than that, I write letters to my 5 or 6 pen pals around the world as well. ",

The laptop passed a nasty smile And he broke down to tears. .As the fingers ran on the keyboard, He stared in desperation and gloom... And glanced at himself...his cover shined. But, none could save him from meeting his doom. .The notebook, his constant companion\u2026 Lay under a pile of dust. They shared a congenial look of despair And, looked away to \u201crust\u201d. . The so - called \u2018advanced\u2019 digital era Had given them a lot of pain. The pen, burning with rage and envy, Considered the lappy .... the biggest bane. . But, having faith in kindness, He had a ray of hope in his mind. Just then, a girl reached out to them And their destinies shined. . Exuberance in her eyes, Satisfaction and enthusiasm in her look, She thought of something\u2026 To scribble down in HER notebook . In the era of Whatsapp and e-mails, She decided to WRITE, And adorn the sheets with her beautiful handwriting.... Which was a rather unusual sight. . Happily, clutching it tightly, She ran to her Mum, To show her, the creation... That left her awesruck and numb!! . . . This was the little creation, this poem... And, the girl...none but me... Who aspires to WRITE and become a writer, So that, NO pen and paper remain in agony.... . Hope you liked it. Please upvote and keep supporting as I have worked very hard for this. \u2764\ufe0fPeace to all\u2764\ufe0f Thanks,Aditi Rai PS - This poem is self - written... ",

Instead I would prefer writing a letter once a week because that would probably be the best way to actually convey how I feel about them. I seldom express myself to someone face to face. I can't do it. But ask me to do the same through message or letter, I will be more than happy to do it. So to answer your question,yaa I do write letters. ",

I convey now through email, what I was conveying earlier in the form of letters. There are other means of carrying our interactions these days among various other parties - like SMS ,, WHAT'S APP, etc. , So, letter writing has almost became negligible, except in the case of official correspondence.

            "answer_text": "It is mostly official formal letters these days. I remember the days when letter writing was the common mode of communication. I studied in a boarding school. I used to write a letter every Sunday to my parents and would get a letter from them every Friday. Writing letter was a nice thing where I would spend some time penning down what I did in the whole week. The best part was waiting for the reply. The feeling you get when you are eagerly waiting for someone\u2019s letter is very special. These days with advance in technology, everything is fast and there is no experience of that special feeling. ",

The Pune Times restarted their comics in spring,2017. Now I am not saying it was my protest that led to this but this was to show to you that letter writing is extremely fun, if done with the proper passion. Its a great form of communication, but should never be treated as an obligation, otherwise the fun goes out of it. ",
