            "answer_text": "Formal letter is a request for something that is meaningful to you. It\u2019s like talking to a higher being asking for important something with respect. Direct to the point, not hurting, not offensive, not too personal. It\u2019s an introduction of yourself since you are a stranger to them, make it short but not too short. Tell them what they need to know but not what you wanted to share. Instead of going from place to place which is time consuming and you really wanted to do it at the same time \u2026 write a formal letter ! It\u2019s like \u201cWhat\u2019s in your brain we can accommodate?\u201d \u201cAre you an Architect? Tell Me about your records\u201d.Since you are not there personally, we do the formality of writing! God Bless ",

            "answer_text": "You can find templates for creating a formal letter in Microsoft Word or other word processors or within Google Docs. However, here are a few key requirements. First, if you\u2019re not using a letterhead, then your name and address should appear at the top. It can be centered, or justified right. Either way, a justified right date should appear below name and address. Below address on the left side of the page is the name, title and address of the recipient. Below this information, put in a space and write your greeting, e.g., \u201cDear Mr. So and So\u201d, Dear Jamie, or even To The Hiring Manager, or To the Head of Customer Service. At the bottom of the letter, after a space and justified left is your closing. You can choose any number of possibilities, but I prefer Yours truly. Sincerely is sometimes appropriate. If the letter is formal, you wouldn\u2019t use Your friend, or anything personal. Put several lines between Yours truly and your name. The extra space is to allow room for your signature. Put it in an envelope, put on a stamp and mail it. By the way, for formal letters it is far better to type the address on the envelope rather than hand write it. ",
