One thinks \"How do I make this sentence better ?\" and the one who has keeps on asking himself this question constantly to himself ends up saying \"The movie was nothing but quantum entanglement of charred carbohydrate particles of existential tomfoolery , inane drudgery , unadulterated nonsense and audacious lunacy with a smear of processed bovine essence soaked in tears of metaphysical torment.\" So is \"Is using big vocabulary words in English good in writing anything? .

If you make use of lexicon wisely, you may make the text more decorative and vivid however at the other end if reader is not familier with those words then he has to sit with a dictionary. So it completely depends whether you are writing for educational purpose (in text books/for kids) or for help on some matter to laymen (user manuals etc). ",
