            "answer_text": "Reflective essay explores the writer\u2019s life experiences. While writing about those experiences, the writer describes about how those experiences has changed, grown or developed him. A reflective essay\u2019s structure can slightly change based on who the audience is. I would like to share my way of writing a reflective essay. You just need to go through the following steps: Step 1: For selecting your essay\u2019s topic try to think thoroughly about any particular event. Ask yourself, how you feel about it, how it influenced your life and why? This will allow you to construct a thesis which will be the central focus of your essay. Step 2: Now, write down the thesis statement. Then define the main concepts and arguments that will justify it and help readers to pursue the growth of your experiences and thoughts, organize them into paragraphs and connect them with your thesis statement. By applying this technique, you will be able to understand the essay\u2019s structure in a more effective manner. Lastly, order the paragraphs as per the logical sequence. Step 3: Write an effective introduction in the beginning so that it will grab the attention of the readers and they will stay connected with your content. Step 4: Address your illustrations, concepts and supporting arguments in the body paragraphs. Each paragraph should emphasize one experience or issue along with its reflections. Step 5: Your viewpoints should be briefly summarized in the first sentence of your conclusion. Sum up your content by providing some main findings and closing reflective thoughts from your essay. State how your experience could be beneficial to others and what you\u2019ve learned from that experience. This section should be effective as your introduction section. Therefore, by following each and every step properly you will be able to write your reflective essay. I wish my answer will be valuable for you. Best Wishes! ",
