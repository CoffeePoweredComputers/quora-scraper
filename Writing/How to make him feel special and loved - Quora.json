            "answer_text": "Men are different from women. Men would like to sole problems. They look at every situation as a problem to be solved. If you want to please and make him feel special, give him opportunity to solve problems and help you. Men are also egotistical. Appreciate his good work, praise him whenever possible. Listen to his problems and empathise. You don't have to do anything. Just listen, that's all. Recognise he is in charge. If you take charge, he will get hurt. There is a book on this subject, \u201cMen are from Mars and women are from Venus\". I recommend it. ",
