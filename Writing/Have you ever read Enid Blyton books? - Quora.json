I started with Noddy and Big Ears, went on to the Magic Faraway Tree when I was about five, and finished up with the Famous Five and the Secret Seven when I was a little older. I remember for several years I strongly identified with George of the Famous Five. I thought she was wonderful. A couple of years ago, I saw an offer on Amazon Kindle for three of the books and bought them, and went for a stroll down Memory Lane. I couldn\u2019t believe what an objectionable little brat she seems to the adult me. No wonder I was clouted so often when I was a child. They were certainly fun for a kid to read, but I clearly didn\u2019t have much taste. ",

While there I met the most interesting girl, with a wild imagination. She was from the States, but had lived in Great Britain and was reading a book I hadn\u2019t seen in the US. I think it was a Roald Dahl\u2019s \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d. We discovered we were both bookworms and she invited me to her fancy home where she introduced me to The Famous Five series. I think she had Eight and I borrowed them all. The adventures this crew went on were nothing I had read before and I couldn\u2019t get enough. Through Cindy I also fell in love with Puffin books and even now, I attach a specific and unique scent to those beloved young adult paperbacks. Thanks for asking! I saw this a bit ago and didn\u2019t know where on Quora the question went. I had to answer! Your question brought back the best of memories. ",

They also taught me what great fun a good mystery-adventure can be. Both reading and writing one. ",

The most extraordinary aspect of her prolific output, beyond a lot of the virtues described in the other answers was that she produced books that were the best in category for every age group starting from 3 to 12 in the minds of parents, as well as children - boys and girls. She was a monster hit in India. Kids who could not afford to buy them would borrow well thumbed versions that had been kept in family closets for decades as a treasure. I buy them for my seven year old son. When 5 years old, he enjoyed the Noddy books for all of six months, and even the Amelia Jane stories about a naughty doll for a similar period. Now, alas, he has moved on to his primary passion of Star Wars. That's an amazing accomplishment for any author of children's books, unlikely to be ever repeated. ",

But Enid Blyton books are perfect for young budding kids, as the language is easy to read and difficult words are introduced slowly. I have been enjoying the books and looking forward to have light reading in between Murakami and Lee Child work. ",
