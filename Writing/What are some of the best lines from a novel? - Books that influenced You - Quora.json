Illogical thought processes must be challenged when they arise. Wrong answers must be corrected. Correct answers must be affirmed. - From the Erudite Faction ManifestoKnowledge is Power. Power to do evil or power to do good. Power itself is not evil. So Knowledge itself is not evil.But that wasn\u2019t the first time I ever saw her. I saw her in the hallways at school, and at my mother\u2019s false funeral, and walking the sidewalks in the Abnegation sector. I saw her, but I didn\u2019t see her; no one saw her the way she truly was until she jumped.I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.I think you're still the only person sharp enough to sharpen someone like me.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit \u2019em but remember it\u2019s a sin to kill a mockingbird.Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.Angry people are not always wise.Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.I must learn to be content with being happier than I deserve.The Ask And The Answer by Patrick Ness We are the choices we make, nothing more, nothing less.Sometimes the rumour of an army is just as effective as the army itself.War makes monsters of men.A thing worth learning is worth learning well.If you ever want to see how small you are in the plan of god, just stand at the edge of an ocean.You have to crawl before you walk.",

            "answer_text": "Let me share this heart-touching book named A Thousand Splendid Suns, a 2007 novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. The story covers three decades of anti-Soviet jihad, civil war and Taliban tyranny seen from the perspectives of two women, named Mariam and Laila. Mariam is the scorned illegitimate daughter of a wealthy businessman, forced at age 15 into marrying Rasheed, who grows increasingly brutal when she fails to produce a child. 18 years later, Rasheed takes another wife, 14-year-old Laila. They live in a world of old-time values and refuse to accept the need for women to have an identity beyond what can be seen under a burqa. Mariam and Laila become allies in a battle with Rasheed, whose violent abuse is endorsed by custom and law. Rasheed is murdered by Mariam, the Taliban drives out the Mujahideen, and the United States drives the Taliban out of power. The author gives a forceful portrait of despotism where women are dependent on fathers, husbands and especially sons, the bearing of male children being their only path to an accepted social status. The following are some of my favourite quotes from this book: \u2018\u201cYou see, some things I can teach you. Some you learn from books. But there are things that, well, you have to see and feel.\u201d\u201cLearn this now and learn it well. Like a compass facing north, a man\u2019s accusing finger always finds a woman. Always. You remember that, Mariam.\u201d\u201cAnd the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold.\u201d\u201cBoys, Laila came to see, treated friendship the way they treated the sun: its existence undisputed; its radiance best enjoyed, not beheld directly.\u201d\u201cOne could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\u201d\u201cOf all the hardships a person had to face, none was more punishing than the simple act of waiting.\u201d\u201cA man's heart is a wretched, wretched thing. It isn't like a mother's womb. It won't bleed. It won't stretch to make room for you.\u201d\u201cMarriage can wait, education cannot.\u201d\u201cTell your secret to the wind, but don\u2019t blame it for telling the trees.\u201d\u201cBut the game involves only male names. Because, if it's a girl, Laila has already named her.\u201d You can find this book at free of cost or at a cheap price (includes only the shipping charges) at MyPustak: an online website that sells good-conditioned second-hand books.
