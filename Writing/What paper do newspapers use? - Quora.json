            "answer_text": "Once upon a time they were used to print the news. Nowadays they are used to print advertisements. I have put newspapers to the following unconventional uses. I use a double broadsheet as a liner around the inner surface of my kitchen garbage can to prevent rotten organic stuff from sticking to the sides. When I attend my monthly Quora meets, I carry an old newspaper. Since we all sit on the ground with patches of grass and mud, a newspaper prevents my pants from getting soiled. I even lend extra sheets to others sitting nearby. I have observed families doing this while on a picnic. My wife uses it as a shelf liner and replaces it every few months. She uses it to place inside the lids of jars to make it air tight after the lid is firmly pressed into position. This keeps ants out of sugar jars and moisture out of jars storing flour. We have also used newspapers to wrap vadas or puries bought from eateries and when we gently press from outside, the newspaper absorbs extra oil and reduces that much oil from entering our system. (*** Edited to add *** Not recommended. The ink in the print gets mixed and is likely to be consumed) In trains, in winter, I have spread two or three layers on the sleeper berth between the cold wooden surface of the berth (in the olden days) and my bedsheet to act as an additional layer for insulation, to keep me warm. I use it to wrap foot wear (slippers/chappals) while packing and stuffing them into my suitcase along with my clothes and other miscellaneous stuff. And also when a bit of loose cash is needed, my wife rounds up all the old sheets, makes me tie them up and take them to the Raddiwala and get as much as I can from him after he weighs the stuff. Invariably I bring back 10 or even 20 percent less than what she would have extracted if she had accompanied me in the car while on my way to the paper recycling vendor. The last use these days is to get to know what the news is that the owners of the paper want me to read and what they have been paid to print. I have to look for it starting from the third or even fifth page of the paper these days. The first few contain full page ads of new cars, new cell phones, jewelry dealers and new residential projects in the city that I am never going to buy and have no interest in. \u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re asking what type of paper is used on which to print newspapers, you\u2019ll have to tell me what part of the world you\u2019re in. Generally speaking, newsprint is the paper used, but what started out being substrates or variations on wood pulp have now developed into many different categories. When the first serious waves of ecological awareness came through around the 1970s (in the US), the wood pulp rejects from the manufacture of fine papers was simply washed and washed and washed, and a little chorine was thrown in; the paper was then super-pressed into sheets, and then web rolls. They used the thinnest possible weight that still allowed printing on both sides without bleed-through. Skipping a few decades of experimenting\u2026 now newsprint rejects almost completely any chlorine bleaching due to its harsh treatment of water and the water table. Post-consumer waste (paper that has had previous uses and is returned to mills for conversion) is combined with a long list of other materials, including a range that runs from bamboo to plastic in the search for acceptable additives to make newsprint. The worst is the type that\u2019s as thin as the old telephone books: that hasn\u2019t enough body to hold up and read as we all seem to like to do. One unintended consequence of environmental constraints on papermaking has been the resizing of the newspaper page into all sorts of \u201cjunior\u201d sheet sizes. Paper\u2019s expensive to create, and newsprint is a volatile commodity. Newspaper printers seek something opague and lightweight that will still grab newer inks\u2014which don\u2019t have the petroleum and other chemical products they used to include. The impossible dream of newsprint has always been an ink that doesn\u2019t end up on your fingers. Truly small community papers have the challenge of making the decision about short-run web printing, which certainly reduces overall production cost but ends up in a smaller size publication, sometimes called a junior tab (for tabloid). I hate them but understand the choice. Waddah, was that what you wanted to know, or am I off base? ",
