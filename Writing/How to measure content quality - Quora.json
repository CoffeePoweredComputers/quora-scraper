            "answer_text": "Over the years (decades) there have been a few approaches use to measure content quality. There are nearly two dozen well-known readability formulas that aim to measure how easy it is to read a document. Most, if not all, were developed in the last century, before the birth of the world wide web. Some of these readability formulas were developed for general use while others are for specific types of documents, like technical or educational. The formulas are typically based on word count, sentence count, and syllable count. With the rise of the internet, and Google Analytics in particular, some people began using metrics like bounce rate, scroll depth, and time on page to infer content quality. Unfortunately, these don\u2019t work very well as they are difficult to interpret and can be manipulated, intentionally or otherwise. For example, time on page needs to take into account the overall content length \u2013 shorter pages can be read quicker than long ones. A visitor could spend a short time on a page because: it was easy to readthey just skimmed the contentsthey got distractedor many other reasonsAt MarketMuse we use a more advanced method to determine content quality \u2013 we look at the topical coverage of a page for a particular subject. Pages that cover a topic comprehensively score higher than pages that don\u2019t. We use machine learning to create a topic model for any given topic. This model contains a list of the 50 most relevant related topics for that subject and its distribution (how frequently the term is used).  We compare your page to the topic model to determine how well you cover the subject. The screenshot above shows a partial list of topics related to local content strategy, with the most relevant appearing at the top of the list. The current score for this page is 25, while the target is 41. The target value is based on an analysis of the content scores for the pages appearing for the Top 20 in the search engine results pages. The red squares with a value of 0 indicate that the topic has not been mentioned in the page. Read a bit more here: What Is Content Score? ",

            "answer_text": "You can measure the content the way we are doing at TheDigitalFellow. We measure all the metrics of all the platforms every week by tracking how many people are seeing our content, engaging with it, reading and sharing it. But many times, we see engagement which can\u2019t be measured. It is called the dark media platform engagement which is through WhatsApp. Here 100s of people (CXOs), who have opted in to read our content every day. The traction of this dark media is measured through the benefits which may not be an instant gratification like the number of likes on Facebook & Instagram but gradually when you start getting called from out of those 100 CEOs. Then, those calls get you business and those businesses get you more references. And we are getting it. So, just imagine those 100s of top management people recommending you to other 100 people. That\u2019s how you measure the traction through dark media if it is working for you or not. Also, if you go to conferences and if you are making good content, make sure that your community in noticing you. Like every time when I go to a conference, people come to me saying, \u201cHi, are you TheDigitalFellow, I've been reading your content.\u201d So if your content is good people are going to look at you. And once you measure your content using different tools be it your respective social media analytics tool or other 3rd party tools like Microsoft Power BI, you will have a clear idea, what's working for you and what\u2019s not. Accordingly, create your content the next time keeping in mind your buyer persona and buyer journey. ",
