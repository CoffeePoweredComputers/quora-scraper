            "answer_text": "Alrighty, OP, I\u2019m going to do you a solid and tell you how to actually sell gun control to people who do not want to give up your guns. First off, forget getting gun control stats from a legal perspective. The numbers are pretty obvious. Gun laws and gun availability has zero influence on deaths. Some places you could give everyone a dozen nuclear missiles and it would still be safe. Other places you could straitjacket everyone and they\u2019d still try to awkwardly nudge each other into traffic. As for those safe gun control paradises like Britain, Australia, etc, the evidence does not support the conclusion. The true test is whether they would see a corresponding uptick in violence if their gun laws were revoked. Because if gun ownership increased a thousandfold, but violence only tenfold, clearly it\u2019s not the gun ownership causing the violence. No, what you want to do is argue for gun control paired with actual crime prevention measures. You see, many of us gun folks like to think that we have them to resist a tyrannical government. Many of us also actually believe it, especially the ones who were actually in the military. But I think we all know that our use case is much less likely to be against our tyrannical government (especially since we have not seen any insurrections in reply to things like wiretapping, and the TSA security theater, and the ever-increasingly-complex tax code), and much more against criminal activity. So what you want to argue is essentially: Dear gun owners: We will make society so safe that you don\u2019t need them. But unlike other people who say this, we\u2019ll take suggestions from YOU - what would we have to do to criminals so that you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever need guns to protect yourself from them? Do we need to abolish plea bargains? Do we need to execute robbers and burglars and rapists? Do we need expanded mass surveillance to ensure we can catch criminals as soon as they are found? Do we need mandatory sentencing for using weapons to commit crime? Do we need to repeal Warren v. DC and require police officers to protect? Whatever it is, say yes. I wouldn\u2019t enjoy giving up my guns, but I would begrudgingly do so if I can be assured that the government will, in fact, protect me. ",

            "answer_text": "Marie - to put it bluntly you are putting the cart before the horse. What you should really be looking at is not gun control but the reasons behind gun violence and what can be done to address those issues. You see, the gun is just a tool, a powerful one - which makes its misuse dangerous (just like a chainsaw, a knife, a car, or a truck - all implicated in major acts against citizens in recent memory) but is relatively safe if properly handled. And remember, there are well over 300 million guns in the US alone in the hands of over 90 million people (almost, but not quite, one in three citizens). If the gun was truly the problem we would be awash in a sea of blood - but we are not. The very great majority of gun owners are very responsible law abiding citizens whose guns never cause a problem. Of the 30,000 or so deaths a year occurring with a gun about 2/3 of them are suicides. Guess what, if they were determined to take their life and they do not have access to a gun they will do it with something else. So, here, the gun is not the problem - the desire to commit suicide is. <Point #1 to address - how to reduce suicides>. The second major group of gun related deaths is by criminals using a gun in a crime. This can be a robbery, assault, or a gang shooting - and it amounts to around 9,000 of the gun related incidents in a year. Note that in this case the number of guns used that were acquired illegally runs to roughly 80% (per the FBI). No gun control measures will restrict a criminal - they are already intent on breaking our laws and one more (or any number more) will have no effect on them. So how do we deal with them to reduce this source of violence? <Point #2 - how do we limit or eliminate criminal gun usage without impacting law abiding citizens? Especially as criminals do not generally acquire their guns through legal channels.> And please note that gun control does not appear to work with criminals, in fact, if anything gun control exacerbates the problems as our most heavily gun controlled areas exhibit far more gun violence of this type (criminal) than areas having more permissive gun laws. Don't believe me - look up the stats for Chicago, New York, Detroit, and California - then compare them to Vermont, Arizona, and Montana. So, again, I urge you to look at the problem, don't just attack the tool. If we had gone after controls on the items that Timothy McVeigh used to destroy the Alfred P. Murragh building in Oklahoma (and the people in it) we would have slapped background checks and other insanity on people buying diesel fuel, garden fertilizer or renting a large truck. (if you are unfamiliar with that particular incident please look it up in Wikipedia). We didn't. So why do that for other things such as firearms? Now we've reduced the number of gun related incidents in a year needing explanation to around 1200 - about 900 of those are police related incidents. I wish it were less but, as there is a fairly good chance that a criminal will try to shoot a cop (happens way to often), I can't blame the police for using their guns to preserve their lives and the lives of others. Now that leaves us with around 300 remaining gun use incidents in a year and these are primarily defensive use of a firearm to stop a criminal intent on harming someone. Actually, the estimates on the defensive use of a firearm range from a low of 250,000 times a year to over 2 million times a year (depends on who collects the stats), but even at the low end those guns you are talking about \"controlling\" were used to prevent a crime or assault 833 times for every time the trigger was pulled on one - I'd say that represents commendable restraint on the part of the gun owners in general. And, again, those incidents were in defense of life and property. Defense from a criminal act. (Oops, there are those pesky criminals again - so what CAN we do to limit criminal activity WITHOUT restricting our law abiding citizens ability to defend themselves from just such criminal activity???) So you see, you are really asking the wrong question - your questions should be:1) How do we reduce the incidence of suicide?2) How do we eliminate the criminal use of firearms?and for #2 we need to understand3) What drives the criminal use of firearms?is it a) general criminal intent? b) antisocial discontent? c) a mental issue? d) terrorism? e) something else? If so, what?understanding the components of the problem will allow us to tackle it without willy-nilly restricting the rights of law abiding citizens - who by the way are NOT the problem and ARE the only ones who will follow your new laws - which are totally unnecessary as they do not address the real problem. Check out CA and NY for example - gun control heaven. Almost everything the gun-control crowd can think of to impose on the citizenry. Has it stopped suicides or criminal activity? Nope. Not even slowed it down. Maryland has some of the strictest gun access laws in the nation yet the Jacksonville shooter acquired 2 guns through their processes and took them to Florida where he committed his criminal act. Doesn't seem like gun control - which is really all about \"control\" if you look at it - works. So let's look at what the problem really is and address that - then we might just have a chance. Good luck Marie - I would be interested to see what you eventually come up with and decide to do. Please keep us informed. ",
