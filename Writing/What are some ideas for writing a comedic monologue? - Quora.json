            "answer_text": "Robin Williams once said, \u201cI do comedy because it\u2019s cheaper than therapy.\u201d Remember negative times in your life, times when you were in emotional pain, or were uncomfortable, or were embarrassed/humiliated. Many sarcastic yet funny things can be said of such events. I myself have done some open-mike comedy/talent nights. I once had a terrible adventure at LAX (Los Angeles International Airport). I recall being so angry and frustrated. I made a routine out of it, and for a few weeks after, people would come up to me and insist I get back on the stage and tell it again. Apparently I struck a chord\u2026 Read the newspaper. Politics is an easy target, same for celebrities\u2019 stupid antics. Look at sports. Read the classifieds. In my opinion, most comedians are Absurdists. Albert Camus is quoted a few times as saying variations on \u201cLife is absurd.\u201d It\u2019s like the other saying, \u201cTruth is stranger than fiction.\u201d Life can be quite bizarre sometimes. Comedians and humorists see these weird events and behavior and make jokes out of them. By finding the utter insanity in everyday life can someone find humor, even in the most boring stuff. It\u2019s a matter of perception, and if you can perceive how odd the world truly is, there are jokes to be made. Groucho Marx was the king of snide/sarcastic one-liners: He once had a woman who had eleven kids. He asked her how come she didn\u2019t stop. She answered, \u201cWell, I love my husband.\u201d He replied, \u201cWell, I love my cigar but I take it out of my mouth every now and then.\u201d George Carlin pointed out how crazy English is: There\u2019s so much, just pick up his book \u201cBrain Droppings\u201d to see what I mean. Lewis Black must be the most angry comedian I have ever laughed to. Dom Irrera makes fun of his Italian heritage, and of life in Philadelphia. Billy Gardell makes fun of his Irish roots, and of his life in Pittsburgh. Almost all comedians point out how crazy their marriage/kids/job is. Ron White is extremely sarcastic. Jeff Foxworthy makes fun of being a Redneck. Go to YouTube and look up people like Tim Wilson, Sean Morey, Mike Wysocki, Billy Crystal, Rodney Carrington, Rita Rudner, Heywood Banks, the Bob & Tom Show, Piff the Magic Dragon (no, I didn\u2019t misspell his name), Rodney Dangerfield, Howie Mandel, Gallagher, those I mentioned above, and oh so many more. That might give you some guidelines. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been argued that laughing is a physiological response to anxiety stress. And if you think about it, that makes A LOT of sense. Anxiety puts actual physical stress and tension on the organs, and laughter \u201cmassages\u201d a lot of that tension away. It doesn\u2019t necessarily make your life any easier. It can help you cope. This ALSO makes sense when you think about \u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d The things that we find most funny tend to be the things we\u2019re most anxious about. Sex, money, difficult relationships, parenting, job difficulties\u2026etc. If it doesn\u2019t make you anxious, then it\u2019s probably not funny either. I strongly recommend watching \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d with Jerry Seinfeld. Not only is it hilariously entertaining and intellectually stimulating, they talk a lot of shop. These are some of the most hardworking, successful comedians talking about how they do it. One very helpful pointer from the show that you can try right now is that a lot of stand up comes in the form of proofs. You start by saying something completely absurd, and then you give all the funny real world reasons why it\u2019s actually true. It\u2019s probably easier than you think. Think about the one thing that makes you most nervous, most tense and uncomfortable. There\u2019s probably something fundamentally absurd about it. Otherwise why is it so difficult? So say that thing and don\u2019t be afraid to make it sound as ridiculous as it is. Then prove it up. Go watch some stand up right now, and see if you can find comedians doing this. Then try it yourself. ",
