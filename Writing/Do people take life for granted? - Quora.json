            "answer_text": "Without a doubt, yes. When you reflect upon the universe as a whole, we\u2019re likely one of the only living beings in existence. There\u2019s only one chance to live life to the fullest, and I see it thrown out every single day, and I even do it myself. But that\u2019s no excuse for me. Often times, people never really fully understand this, and so a small problem in the world we live in could appear so much worse just because of how we think in the moment. Don\u2019t be afraid to take the chances you desperately want because you\u2019ll never know what would\u2019ve happened if you didn\u2019t. We\u2019re so scared of the \u201cwhat if this happens,\u201d that we solely think it\u2019s our only probable outcome. How we move forward as a species on this planet is through taking the chances. Later on in life, you\u2019ll always wonder what could\u2019ve been, and you\u2019ll regret not taking the chance of chasing after what you wanted. Because of the fear of judgment or way of standing out against normality, we try so hard to fit in; because us humans act on two things: acceptance, and avoidance. Yes, the road may be difficult, but focus solely on what you want to achieve, and you will inevitably get it. There will be hardships in this road, but that road will appear with whatever path you choose, so think about what type of life you really want to live. Another thing we all take for granted and never fully realize is that we do not have enough time; we never do. I learned this through my role model, who has inspired me to use every single second to the fullest. This is the true meaning of living life to the fullest; cherish the small and big things. You never know when something might just disappear in your life. Go live your life everyone. Make the time worth it because we only get the chance once. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yes. The uppermost question would be why wouldn\u2019t they? I am thinking expressly of life this minute because I am pondering your question. Last night, when my cat Owain crawled on my chest to purr and settle down I thought of his warmth, comfort, weight and sound. What I was actually doing was experiencing his life. Did I take it for granted that he had life? Yes I did. I am used to life. I see life in recognizable forms all around me. Life has recognizable seasons. I recognize death as an inevitability. I watch leaves curl and fall every year as I also watch them sprout green again. It\u2019s when I think of my own close calls or I read or remember someone young who was lost that I sink into \u201clife\u201d. I miss people in my life who have died, but I am also gifted with rationality. When I was a teenager I was so objective. Death was a fallacy. We had two facile everyday expressions. They were facile because they were difficult to comprehend in reality. The expressions were.. Today is a good day to die, until I was hit by another car at 16. I was stopped at a red light so no, it wasn\u2019t my doing. When I was taken to the hosp for emerg surgery and saw my physician dad retch when he looked at me I understood instantly that I could die. Expression hit a little close to home and it was shifted to the back burner. The other was a true facility, Life is for the living. Yes again, not clever, just sanguine. I don\u2019t blame myself for rote observations. Until I have reason to question life, life simply, is. Life is stages not an if.

People get mad if their phone breaks, we can still survive with or without a mobile phone. Why should we get mad at such simple things when there are people living in war zones, without sanitation and health care. The people who have it all really do take life for granted, I always say collect memories not things because when it comes down to it is your flashy car, or the latest iPhone going to really matter if it were your last few days? No the thing that would matter is having the people you love most around you, family and friend not face book and your Instagram followers. ",
