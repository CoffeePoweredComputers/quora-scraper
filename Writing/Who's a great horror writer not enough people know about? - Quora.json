            "answer_text": "I bet most of you haven\u2019t heard of my very favorite horror author, Tananarive Due. She\u2019s a smart cookie. A former journalist, a current professor at UCLA. She runs a well-maintained Twitter account. She pals around with Jordan Peele. Her horror is afrocentric. It focuses on black people in America and Africa. Her style sometimes recalls Poe, if Poe were stylish and modern and pared down. There\u2019s also hints of LeGuin in there and Oates. But her voice is her own; the scary ideas sometimes just pour out of her like some gloomy ectoplasm emanating from a medium. You can hear Lavar Burton reading one of her short stories here, on his podcast. Personally I prefer the long-form fiction where she gets to stretch her legs a bit and explore ideas and go down rabbit holes. On a rainy weekend you can curl up with some hot tea and My Soul to Keep. I highly recommend it.  ",

            "answer_text": "William Sloane is a particularly skilled horror writer who deserves a wider readership. Sloane was a Brit who wrote novels that are reminiscent of Lovecraft, but he had much greater command of the language than old HP. He only wrote two novels, both of which are damn good, and which can be found in a single-volume reissue called Rim of Morning.  Robert Westall is another Brit who wrote stunningly good horror. Westall is actually well-known for some of his fiction for children (The Machine Gunners won a Carnegie Medal), but less popular are his brilliant novellas, which can be found in collections like Spectral Shadows and Antique Dust.  Finally, I\u2019d suggest you track down the hard-to-find collections of Steve Duffy. Duffy\u2019s short stories have been anthologized in numerous Best Of style compendiums over the last ten years, and deservedly so. His work is dark and disturbing and very much worth the read.  ",
