            "answer_text": "Often this is from discomfort holding the implement. I\u2019ve written in a little detail about this elsewhere. Be sure he is angling the paper, resting his arm on the desk so it is anchored, and holding the pencil or crayon with thumb and first 2 fingers while other fingers curl up under hand. He should be at an angle so he can see where the tip meets the paper, and weight is on his elbow, so hand and fingers are free to move. If you try writing with your whole arm in the air and the pencil held randomly where you cannot even see it, you have to really push down to keep it on the paper, and it makes arm and fingers sore. Really frustrating. You may also want to talk about his name. Is it long? Do kids make fun of it? My nephew Lafayette goes by Fate. Now is a good time to decide if he wants to go by his middle name or a nickname or something. ",

            "answer_text": "Another Quoran started down this path, the path that maybe it\u2019s uncomfortable. If it is, another step is getting these gel grips to put on his pencils. That makes it more comfortable for him to write. If it continues, you may want to pay attention to whether or not he has issues with other things that fall into fine motor skill categories, eg, buttoning shirts, tying shoes, cutting food. If he struggles with some of these, he should be assessed by an occupational therapist. He could have issues with fine motor skills associated with sensory processing disorders. This won\u2019t be quite on the same spectrum as autism, but it does cause issues where he might experience discomfort with things you might find completely comfortable. Think about how he is with socks, tags, etc. ",

Please don\u2019t overlook this one.Encourage his writing overall.I think periodically giving him the opportunity to color in his name. I say periodically in order to make it a unique opportunity rather than a chore.And a couple more: You might make a sign of his name, that he contributes to, in which each letter in his name stands for something.When I was younger, I remember doing a shield (really a crest) for our family, I can imagine something similar working for one\u2019s name.",
