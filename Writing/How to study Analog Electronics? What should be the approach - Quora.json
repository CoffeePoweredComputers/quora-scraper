            "answer_text": "Hii... Thanks for asking this question in Quora. It is good to see that students are interested in Analog electronics.  Before providing to the point answare I want to discuss something related with Electrical. Electronics are nothing but a small part of electrical. If someone is good at electrical then he knows almost maximum things related with electronics.  If you want to learn analog electronics from core and want to be Master in this field, then I strongly suggest you to start with power law, ohms law, krichoffs law and other fundamental principles and theories. After knowing and practicing this you could determine how to apply two basic properties of electrical- voltage and current.  Now learn about transformer and motors together. How they work. How transmission made. How motors are controlled.  Now it is the time to learn semiconductor. How they control an analog electronic circuit. First learn about diode. How they work.  Next capacitor. Faraday's law is important, many student overlooked it. At this point you can make an ac to Dc conversation using transformer, Diode, and capacitor.  This will help you to go further. Let's do some software work. Learn how to read datasheet. Every electronic or electrical component comes with an datasheet which provide sufficient information about how to implement those in a circuit.This is a very important thing to all.And almost every datasheet available on Internet today. You have to familiar with BJT and Mosfet controlled by current and voltage respectively. Try to bias them using ohms law.You will get information from their datasheet. After that try to understand switching usuing transistor. Also in the same time learn about switches and verious type of relays. Now this is the basic of analog electronics. I hope you are not satisfied. Game is not over yet. Sad but true, many ECE students couldn't overcome this small steps.  Every single components have different types. All are different from other. You need to know more about them. Here fundamental principles and knowledge will help you to take the right decision.  If you learned those above points perfectly then get ready to learn how to use analog ics. Try to make small work specific circuit. Try to learn how to design pcb.  Try to do small project which must have below points- 1. Must have a practical approach.2. Must have smps based power supply.3. Must use at least two or more ics.4. Must have low power consumption.5. Circuit should be compact and use transistor transistor logic.6. Entirely made by you and even pcb design also. ( Veroboard prototyping, design pcb in Veroboard style)  Some useful things to be learn-1. Oscilloscope. (Learn everything about this electronic machine) 2. Function generator. Some useful information-1. For price datasheet and component related queries Elements14. com 2. You can make entire circuit in software. Learn how to use Pspice or lt spice and proteus.3. For pcb design use Eagle from cadsoft. Do mistake. This a part of the game. But don't do same mistake two times. Learn from them. They are the best teacher.Some good things for self development - 1. Write everyday problems somewhere, maybe in a dairy or something like that. 2.always set task for yourself. I use Google task widget in my phone. It's a useful thing. I always get alert about what to do tomorrow or even after five days. And it will increase your productivity. 3. Be more organized. Place each thing in perfect order. It will create posetive effect in your brain. When you are organized in your day-to-day lifestyle, your work will also get organized automatically. 4. Always be curious about your work. If something are happening right, don't just move on and stay happy, but ask yourself why this worked perfectly and be curious. Also when something not worked, don't get dipressed and leave them, but find why they did not and be more experienced. 5. Before starting a project learn and get sucess. Make flow chart of your work process and divide your large work into some small works. Don't go hurry, try everything at once and fall.  6. We are bounded by Internet. Use this resource at it's best. Learn how to learn. Just in my case, in my spare time, I search Quora, read answare, here is many good people. Also some questions are really great, in most cases I don't know what is the answer. I googled, use wiki, learn them, I spent sometimes at instructable.com, love this. I know it will be difficult but its not straight but the bad roards are the thing that makes a skilled driver. Calm ocen don't make a skillful sailor. Best of luck. Hope this will help you. Regards,SaV ",

            "answer_text": "Hiii\u2026\u2026Its nice to see your eager in Analog-Electronics.I think and its my personal experience , if u want to learn any subject first try to Feel it.I am giving some Methodology to built a foundation in any subject/Chapter/topic\u2026 1. Collect Information - Collect proper information regarding your topic of interest and make some idea about it. (Don't think a lot about the wrong/wright ideas ).2. Transform Information into Knowledge - With the help of some good text-book ,try to make positive idea about the concerns topic.3. Built Concept - Its a final stage,where you will be able to become a Expertise in that topic. Information --> Knowledge --> Concept  Now I am going to  discuss some very useful and practical facts about, How becomes a expertise in Electronic. 1. If anyone wants to write a eassy about any topic then first and for most thing is need of Vocabularies. And all vocabularies comes from our basic 26 alphabet only.So please first learn and study more and more about the alphabets of any electronic systems (means study more and more about the basic blocks of any electronic system). Example :- If you want to know about the Power-Supply system, first know about there basic building blocks i.e.Transformer , Rectifier , Filter , Regulator IC .2. Refer some good fundamental book/Online Lectures to make a \"Theoretical Base\". (At initial stage don't  panic about numerical problems).3. Make own handwritten notes during study.4. Never feel shy and hesitation in asking anything. 5. Be regular on Quora  to ask your doubt. Here .. I am giving list of some most fundamental book for electronics. a) Electronic  Principles    by Albert Paul Malvino ,David .(***) b) Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory by Boylestad, R and          Nashelsky .(**) ",
