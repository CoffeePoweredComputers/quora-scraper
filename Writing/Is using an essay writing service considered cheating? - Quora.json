            "answer_text": "Of course using an essay writing service is considered cheating. The purpose of the essays inflicted upon students by teachers is to help students learn to reason critically. A student is asked to expose an idea, to develop and explain it, and to defend it against potential critics. This is how we learn to adult. Grab those opportunities. In the real world you starve or get arrested if you fail. In school you get a \u201cbad\u201d mark. When I was in high school, our PE classes were held in the football locker room under the stadium. There was a sign over the door when you went out onto the field: \u201cSweat in practice so you don\u2019t bleed in the game.\u201d Hello! Write the essays yourself. Improve yourself. When you start your business, you\u2019re the one who loses money. Amirite? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Why would you think it might not be? You are taking an essay written by someone else and putting your name on it. That sounds like fraud to me. Turning in an essay from an essay-writing service can mean you get a failing grade on that paper. Or that you fail the class. Or that you get expelled from school. It also means that you didn\u2019t learn what you were supposed to learn by writing that essay. It lowers the quality of your education. ",
