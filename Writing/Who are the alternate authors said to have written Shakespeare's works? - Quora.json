            "answer_text": "They are too numerous to list. Some time ago the list was more than eighty and it has grown since. And the range of plausibility is equally impressive. Everyone from Elizabeth I to Daniel Defoe (born 1660, 44 years after Shakespeare died). What\u2019s amusing, or sad depending on your point of view, is that the \u2018evidence\u2019 cited for each of these candidates is basically the same, consisting mainly of coded messages within the works or alleged similarities between the candidates biography and the plots of the plays. The big three are Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. One could hardly have chosen a more unlikely trio. It\u2019s almost if the deniers were trying to make themselves look ridiculous. Bacon had a brilliant mind and was a first rate essayist, but he was a decidedly minor poet. In addition he argued that theater should have moral purpose. Hardly the attitude for the creator of such lovable scoundrels as Falstaff and Autolocus. Marlowe is arguably both the best and worst pretender. His writing, up to the point of his death, equaled if not exceeded Shakespeare. However it is so fundamentally different from Shakespeare that only most tone deaf could mistake one for the other. And Marlowe never matched Shakespeare talent as a dramatist. Most all, he was killed in a fight in 1593 and his supporters had to concoct a ridiculously complex conspiracy theory were he faked his death, somehow living in secret while he continued to write. The best that can be said about Oxford is \u201cWhy?\u201d. A second rate poet and all around spoiled dissolute aristocratic, there\u2019s nothing to recommend him. Ther are only about 20 minor poems than can be reliably attributed to him and he died in 1604, almost a decade before Shakespeare\u2019s last play. Anti-Statfordism is a textbook example of a crank conspiracy theory. There is no objective evidence, arguments are based on dubious if not outright falsified claims and the theories can only be advanced using sophistry. ",

            "answer_text": "There are an enormous number. Whole books have been written listing the candidates. List of Shakespeare authorship candidates - Wikipedia isn\u2019t actually complete. There are two important things to remember: It was not until well over two hundred years after his death that anyone suggested that the Elizabethan author known as William Shakespeare wasn\u2019t actually William Shakespeare, the Stratford-born actor. It isn\u2019t just a matter of misattribution, but dozens of Shakespeare\u2019s contemporaries who collaborated with and praised him would have to be involved in a conspiracy to conceal the real author. The other factor is that a lot of Shakepeare\u2019s works weren\u2019t actually written entirely by Shakespeare, but were still included in his works. Most Elizabethan playwrights were playwrights. They were craftsmen who put together plays and they often collaborated or contributed to each other\u2019s work. Shakespeare was noticeable because even in his lifetime he was regarded as among the best. It was Shakespeare\u2019s name that sold, so it was put under the title. Shakespeare\u2019s plays were published because other people thought they would make money out of publishing them as his plays. ",
