            "answer_text": "If you are in high school, go to the teach first. If that isn\u2019 satifactory, I suggest a letter to the academic principal. If in college, I\u2019d go straight to the Dean of your academic major and CC the chair of the department. I advise this because a grade change would go thtough them anyway. Chances are there is a grade change form that requires signatures. In either case, be sure to include the reason(s) for your challenge beyond stating your grade was unfair. If you don\u2019t have cause or a solid reason, I wouldn\u2019t bother. As a long time teacher, if I had \uff045 for every student who said their grade was unfair, I\u2019d have retired long ago. ",
