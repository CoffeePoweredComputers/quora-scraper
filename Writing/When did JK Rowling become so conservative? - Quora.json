            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s not mix being conservative with being an outright bigot, which she is. Unfortunately she has always been this way. Back in the 90s she admitted to being a solid Christian, that\u2019s the first red flag. The fact there are only two black boys at Hogwarts, the poor one being the ONLY child whose father ran off and left him, the other being a rich kid with family problems says a lot. The only black girl? Stereotypically loud, rude and butch. The goblins are designed to represent Jewish people. Dumbledore was a token gay that she said would be elaborated on and never did it. Why is this important? Her pseudonym, Robert Galbraith, is the name of a gay conversion therapist who openly experimented on homosexual men. Shall we also discuss how she lied about never mentioning Hermione\u2019s race and that she\u2019s, in fact, back, but in book 3 she said \u2018Hermione\u2019s white face\u2019. She started blocking people who sent her pictures of the quote, the same thing she did when she raged about illegal immigrants not being given housing and support but when people said she\u2019s a billionaire and could easily open a shelter for them or take them into her mansion, she started blocking people again.

            "answer_text": "She didn\u2019t. Rowling still supports the Labour Party both verbally and financially. Some people think she became conservative because of statements she has made about transgender issues and freedom of conscience. I think Rowling has probably been misunderstood and misrepresented in this regard. She only defended the right of someone to have their opinion without losing their job, and she talked about something really personal from her past. She has also stated that she loves transgender people. I think that what happened in her past probably makes it hard for her to communicate about this issue and convey fully how she feels. Unless I see Rowling come out as a raging transphobe\u2014I have to conclude she is likely being unduly vilified. ",
