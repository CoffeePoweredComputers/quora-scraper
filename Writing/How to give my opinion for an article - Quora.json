            "answer_text": "We all have thoughts and ideas, many we keep to ourselves until we have gathered sufficient information and verification to substantiate an opinion. If one is going to have an opinion presented in an article it must be clearly articulated, evidencing knowledge, understanding, and perspectives of subject matter in specifics, generalities and alternatives. Taking a \u201cmiddle of the road\u201d stance is safe and often sensible in a variety of circumstances; but there are many many developing or serious long term matters that need a new perspective given lack of progress resolving contentious or critical concerns. The recent bridge collapse in Italy has, according to long held views and concerns, been due and overdue remediation and repair but these have been stymied by procedural failings to address major infrastructure repair and replacement \u201cfor decades .\u201d Your opinion should not be loose lipped lunacy nor flippant fluff and fancy. Prior to offering any opinion for public disclosure- as an article implies or affords-do due diligence: get the latest details, relevant news updates, supporting and oppposing viewpoints, to buttress your current, relevant and considered opinion. Just restating or modifying without objective support will make your opinion just more subjective parroting, or mere non committal tweaking and speaking-devoid of possible or actual progressive pronouncements and principle.
