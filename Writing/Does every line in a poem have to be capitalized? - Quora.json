            "answer_text": "No. If you\u2019re trying to write a traditional sonnet, you may want to\u2014but even that is not necessary. Capitalizing the first word in every line of a poem was simply \u201cstandard practice\u201d\u2014convention and tradition\u2014in poetry for a long time. It\u2019s no longer considered necessary, and in fact, some people (and I\u2019m one of them) argue that it\u2019s unnecessary \u201cornamentation\u201d and actually somewhat of a distraction. I think it helps separate sentences within a poem\u2014and thus aids clarity of meaning\u2014 to just use standard punctuation, and only capitalize a word if it is the beginning of a sentence, rather than the beginning of a new line. And of course, if you are writing free verse, it is really counter-productive to capitalize the beginning of each line, especially since in free verse every line is not necessarily left-justified. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Fabio, The answer is \u201cno\u201d because there are no rules in poetry. The fact that the first words of each line in a poem are usually capitalized is a convention, nothing more! The name e.e. cummings became famous in the English-speaking world precisely because he flouted the usual conventions of punctuation and grammar and was still able to write great poetry! Read his famous poem, \u201canyone lived in a pretty how town\u201d online and you will see what I mean! Yours truly, Paul ",

Why does a proper noun start with a capital letter? Why do ALL nouns in German start with a capital letter? It\u2019s convention. It\u2019s the way we do things, and the way we were taught. No rhyme nor reason for it. We just do it \u2014 unless you\u2019re e e cummings. (An example of e e\u2019s poetry: somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyondany experience,your eyes have their silence:in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,or which i cannot touch because they are too near your slightest look easily will unclose methough i have closed myself as fingers,you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose ) ",
