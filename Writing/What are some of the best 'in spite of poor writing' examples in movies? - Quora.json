            "answer_text": "Okay, here\u2019s a really guilty pleasure - guilty because I am a screenwriter and a screenwriting professor who regularly rants that it is nearly impossible to have a good movie without a good screenplay. In the 2011 film Friends With Benefits, Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis deliver such appealing performances that it is almost possible to ignore the sub-par plot. In fact, as I recall, there really isn\u2019t much of a story until well into it when the makers decided that they\u2019d better find some way to bring the movie to a conclusion. Granted, these actors are playing fictional characters and delivering dialogue created by a screenwriter that obviously contributes significantly to their appeal. My point is that I liked both characters so much and found the chemistry between the actors so electric that I would have watched 90 minutes of them folding laundry. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t cant say \u2018poor writing\u2019 per se, but these shows/movies were incredibly foolish they were brilliant.  Angie Tribeca. This show has inevitably of the best ratings, and it\u2019ll have you laughing at how stupidly brilliant the script.  The scary movie franchise, a horror movie that\u2019s hilarious.  Haha, I basically watched this one, because Rihanna made a cameo.  Doesn\u2019t have great ratings, but it\u2019s funny. Last but not lease..  With serious cast such as Liam neeson and Charlize Thero, they pulled off the comedy quite alright. The list is endless, I hope I answered your question :) ",
