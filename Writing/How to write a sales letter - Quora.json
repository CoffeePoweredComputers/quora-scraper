Also you should remember about a structure of the letter. The structure is standard. It includes an introduction, a body and a conclusion. Don\u2019t forget about it! Try to make it easy to read.

            "answer_text": "Does your brain go clear when you start composing a direct mail advertisement? Do you have smart thoughts that some way or another don't meet up on paper? Provided that this is true, you're not the only one. This is the most critical part of a decent direct mail advertisement, however it's regularly ignored. Envision yourself as the reader of your letter, and compose what the client needs to know- - not what you need to say.Organize your letter. Direct mail advertisements, much the same as secondary school research projects, require a presentation, a body and a conclusion. In the presentation, explain why you're sending the letter. The body is your \"attempt to close the deal,\" where you'll clarify why your offer is powerful. The conclusion wraps it up by quickly uniting your focuses and soliciting the client to exploit from the offer. ",
