            "answer_text": "Solution: A Self-Blogathon Blogathon (aka Blog Marathon) is a program in which you & your resources come together and actively participates towards writing blogs on anything that interests you. It\u2019s you going to be easier than it sounds, Trust Me! The blogathon will take place over 4 hours (1 hour each different day or 4 hours in 1 day) and each one of you will come out with a polished blog ready to be published. And here\u2019s how you're going to do it! Workshop 1 - Importance of writing blogs, & selecting individual\u2019s topic of interest for blog writing. (Duration 1 hour) And why should you write blogs exactly? Blogs are an easy way to share your expertise and knowledge with others. Blogs are also a great way to promote products and improving company\u2019s visibility which inturn generates sales. Blogs give introverts a voice. I can provide a ton of statistics that support these thoughts, but I\u2019m not going to bother you with any of those. Now select a topic of interest, take up anything you like \u2013 ANYTHING! Here are some of the popular topics writers choose Travel & Food.History & Politics.Technology.Fashion & Lifestyle.Sports.Fitness.Finance & Business.Music & MoviesI\u2019m sure coming up with a topic of interest was not that difficult after all! Now that you\u2019ve chosen of the topic of interest, what I want you to do is visualize your blog as clearly as possible in your mind. Think of your blog as a movie that has a beginning, middle and an end! With characters, you love of course. Quickly pen down all your thought on a piece of paper, don\u2019t worry about the sequence \u2013 just write about anything that comes to your mind! That\u2019s it for the first session \u2013 you can now take a well-deserved break! Workshop 2 - Rough draft of Title, Introduction. (Duration 1 hour) Your movie is now ready to be shot! Get a cup of coffee and power up your laptop! It\u2019s probably your first blog ever and you should be super excited. You have a mental map of your blog, now think of an appropriate title (You could consider multiple titles & choose the best one later), here are some popular types of blog titles \u2018How to\u2019 titles \u2013 Eg: How to run a successful business?\u2018Numerical\u2019 titles \u2013 Eg: 3 ways to run a successful business!\u2018Assurance\u2019 titles \u2013 Guaranteed strategy for a successful business!\u2018Curiosity\u2019 titles \u2013 Secret of creating a business empire.\u2018Quotes\u2019 titles \u2013 \u2018A big business starts small\u2019 \u2013 Richard BransonYou can look for more ideas online or come up with own unique titles \u2013 it\u2019s completely your choice. Now for the INTRODUCTION \u2013 Remember, this is your hook! It\u2019s one of the most interesting section of your blog rather it\u2019s an important writing skill that you absolutely need to acquire. Because people have a very short attention span (~8 seconds) and you need to use those precious few seconds to grab their attention. There are multiples of doing that \u2013 by telling a personal story, rags to riches story, story of a popular brand coming into existence, a simple joke, an incidental finding, a short & quick moral story, a statistical story or mind-blowing facts (All these are a google search away). Choose your introduction carefully keeping in mind the audience you\u2019re catering. Workshop 3 \u2013 Drafting the body & conclusion. (Duration 1 hour) The BODY \u2013 To draft the body of my blog\\article, I use what I call the \u2018Elimination Method\u2019 and here\u2019s how it goes. Keeping my wholistic story in context I put everything (Literally everything and anything) I have on my mind and everything I researched about the topic I\u2019m going to write about on my word document. I read through the big chunk of data I\u2019ve composed and start eliminating things I dont require & rearranging text as per my story. Afterwhich I start to review it and reread it multiple times. Once you do this, everything will fall in place and make a lot of sense to you. Trust me! It works :) Some writers have a more streamlined approach and their able to write it in a structured from the beginning. Keep in mind that this requires the ability to think clearly and a strong mental map. The CONCLUSION Part of Your Blog \u2013 Regardless of how good a writer you are, it\u2019s always important that your blog brings value to the person reading it. Value in terms of bringing a smile on their face, an increase in their EQ\\IQ, provoking productive thoughts, a life receipe, a workout schedule and some blogs are amazing enough to change someone\u2019s life. Bringing value to your reader\u2019s is the most sustainable way of becoming a good writer and the best way of bringing back audience to your blogs! Give me a thumbs up, if you think I added any value to your thoughts today Workshop 4 - Polishing & Submissions, followed by indulging in your favourite food!(Duration 1 hour) Your almost ready! This phase is going to be super exciting! Read your own article\\blogs multiple times. Keep in mind no matter how good a self-critic you are, the blog is still your baby and you could be partial towards it. It\u2019s strongly recommended that you get it reviewed from another person, possibly a mentor! You could even send it to me, I\u2019d be more than happy to review you blog. And don\u2019t forget to give credit to your sources. My friend, this is your first article and I\u2019m so proud you did it! You can now indulge in your favorite food cause life is short, the food tastes amazing and you\u2019re going to be publishing your first article. There are multiple ways to publish your article, the simplest way, for now, would be to pusblish it through LinkedIn. I will cover more on \u2018how to publish your blog\u2019 in the next article. You never know, you could just discover a writer in you and you\u2019ll also be making good use of all the extra hours your getting #workingfromhome during this unprecedented time that COVID-19 has presented to us. Pretty amazing right! Blogs and Social media is a love story we\u2019re all aware of, blogs can be shared with a wide range of audience using social media platforms like twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. If you have yet to start a blog, it\u2019s never too late to get started. There\u2019s really no excuse why you shouldn't start one today. Somewhere out there, someone is waiting to hear from you.
