            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t get really technical here, since this looks like a really fun topic to take on. So I don\u2019t want to ruin it with being super technical and logical. Instead, think about it like the movie \u201cInception.\u201d Where that had dreams taking place within dreams. It\u2019s basically the same formatting, except you\u2019re putting a story within another story. If you already know how to make a story on its own then you already have half the battle done. Now, just make sure that you know enough about the story that you\u2019re supposed to describe in order to properly set up your own story to build around this other story. Hopefully I gave you a fun way of looking at it. ",

            "answer_text": "You could write about process. How does the character go about writing? Does she have a hand-written journal, or does she write exclusively on a computer? Does he write in the morning before the rest of the world wakes up, or does he wait until the world around him sleeps through the night? Does the writer edit as they go or wait until the piece is complete? When he is trying to work something out in his head, does he go for a walk or do the dishes? ",
