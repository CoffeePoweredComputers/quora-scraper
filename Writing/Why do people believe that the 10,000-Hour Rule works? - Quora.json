            "answer_text": "Malcolm Gladwell has a reputation for compiling good research and popularizing it. Some have attempted to debunk his popularizations as being too simplistic, but he writes in an accessible way, and that brings him credibility among many people. So when he writes a book, many people believe it. Scientists might raise a lot of questions, but Gladwell expressed things in such a common sensical way that he gains a lot of credibility. His analysis sounds very plausible. Anyone who ever worked to master a musical instrument or any other skill knows that it takes a lot of practice. Personally, I've never met anyone who is an expert at something who didn't spend a lot of time working at it. I believe the notion that some people are naturally skilled at anything is a myth. It always takes a lot of practice, no matter what physical gifts you are born with. I'm not familiar with any of the debunking studies, but I would take a careful look at their methods, both in terms of data collection as well as analysis. ",
