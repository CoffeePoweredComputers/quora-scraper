            "answer_text": "Sanskrit is older than Avestan. So Avestan developed as a younger cousin of Sanskrit. I have answered another question with a similar premise. To understand the Vedic sources I have given, you obviously need that background first. Without having that background, do not dismiss this as false or untenable. Although Vedic Sanskrit and old Avestan are related languages, internal textual evidence shows that Vedic culture, and hence the Sanskrit language are older. In the Rig Veda, the gods are addressed as both \u201cdeva\u201d and \u201casura\u201d!! Examples: RV 1.24.14: \u201ckShayann asmabhyam asura pracetA\u2026\u201d in praise of VarunaRV 1.35.7: \u201cvi suparNo antarikShANi akhyad gabhIravepA asurahsunIthah\u2026\u201d ; RV 1.35.10: \u201chiraNyahasto asurah sunIthah\u2026\u201d in praise of Surya.RV 1.174.1: \u201ctvam rAjendra ye ca devA rakShA nRRn pAhyasura tvam asmAn\u2026\u201d in praise of IndraRV 3.3.4: \u201cpitA yaj~nAnAm asuro vipashcitAm vimAnam agnir vayunam ca vAghatAm\u2026\u201d in praise of AgniAccording to the niruktam (ancillary branch of Veda, etymology & semantics) of Yaskacharya, which uses the traditional list of words called nighaNTu, the word \u201cdeva\u201d is derived from \u201cshining, illuminating, generosity, or due to being divine (i.e. dwelling in celestial worlds)\u201d, and the word \u201casura\u201d means \u201cgiver of wisdom and spiritual enlightenment\u201d as \u201casu\u201d is a synonym for \u201cknowledge\u201d: \u201c\u0915\u0947\u0924\u0941\u0903 \u0964 \u0915\u0947\u0924\u0903 \u0964 \u091a\u0947\u0924\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0964 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0941\u0903 \u0964 \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0903\u0964 \u0927\u0940\u0903\u0964 \u0936\u091a\u0940 \u0964 \u092e\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0964 \u0935\u092f\u0941\u0928\u092e\u094d \u0964 \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0907\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0915\u093e\u0926\u0936 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f\u201d \u201cketuh; ketah; cetah; cittam; kratuh; asuh; dhIh; shacI; mAyA; vayunam; abhikhyA\u201d these words are synonyms of wisdom/knowledge. So all this was groundwork for showing that in the Rig Veda, \u201cdeva\u201d and \u201casura\u201d are synonyms. However, a tectonic shift occurs in the later Vedic literature (Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda, Brahmanas, etc) where only \u201cdeva\u201d is used for the Vedic gods, and \u201casura\u201d is now used for the anti-gods. The derivation of \u201casura\u201d now changes to \u201ca-sura\u201d i.e. \u201cnot sura\u201d, and \u201csura\u201d now becomes a synonym of \u201cdeva\u201d. This is totally unknown in Rig Veda, where \u201casura\u201d has absolutely no negative connotation. In parallel with the later Vedic literature, in the lands neighboring west of India, the person called Zarathushtra begins preaching a new set of beliefs that are distantly related to the old Vedic religion. But there are some radical new beliefs. A central tenet is that the god is called \u201cahura\u201d, which is the Sanskrit \u201casura\u201d, and the anti-god is called \u201cdaeva\u201d, which is the Sanskrit \u201cdeva\u201d. It is from the Avestan \u201cdaeva\u201d through Hebrew, then Latin that the European languages have the word \u201cdevil\u201d, \u201cdiavolo\u201d etc. So you see, in the Avesta, the words have the exact opposite meanings as the later Vedic texts. But the Rig Veda sees no such dichotomy as there is no reason for it, as seen from the original meaning of the words. So it can be concluded that in the later Vedic period there was a struggle between the Vedic people and their cultural cousins the Zoroastrians, which was so significant that the fundamental religious expression changed forever. Even now, most Hindus would not believe that \u201cdeva\u201d and \u201casura\u201d were once synonyms. And Zoroastrians would never consider the two words as synonyms either. In conclusion, Vedic culture and Vedic Sanskrit were a much older and unified setup than Avesta and Zoroastrianism. ",

            "answer_text": "Sanskrit did not originate from Avestan, rather both languages origin in the same Proto-Indo-Iranic. They are so close to each other that the dead Avestan language was recovered throught Vedic Sanskrit. To say that Sanskrit is older then Avestan or that it is its root is false and very problematic. In Avestan ai and au (not Ai Au) survived from Proto-Indo-Iranic. In classical Sanskrit these diphongs no more longer exist but have e and o insted. I read once Vedic Sanskrit kept these original two diphongs. There are masses of avestan words that indicate that Avestan did not have its root in Sanskrit, but the similarity can\u2019t be doubted. So, no. Sanskrit did not branch off from Avestan. Both branched of Proto-Indo-Iranic and Sanskrit is not older then Avestan. ",
