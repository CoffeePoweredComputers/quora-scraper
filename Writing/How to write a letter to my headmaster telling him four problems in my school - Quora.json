            "answer_text": "The letter should be in FORMAL format rather than as a FRIENDLY letter format. I will try to outline this format for you with some commentary interjected. 1) Upper right-hand corner your school address, then directly below it the date. 2) Skip several lines and then upper left offer a greeting, either \u201cSir\u201c or \u201cDear Sir\u201d or \u201cDear (followed by his formal name). This upper left-hand margin establishes the margin for all other paragraphs. (I recognize that the headmaster might be a woman, in which case I would likely address her as \u201cDear Miss/Dear Mrs. \u2014-\u201c 3) Introduction should state precisely and briefly the reason for your letter. 4) Body of the letter should contain the four problems you wish to address. If the problems are of any length in that you wish to offer commentary about the problems (explanations of the problems, examples of the problems, consequences of the problems), THEN you may want to address each problem in a separate paragraph. If so, direct the headmaster to this fact at the beginning of the body of the letter that expresses problems. Let the headmaster understand your formatting, your structure. 5). Offer a concluding paragraph. It is important. It should be a brief closing summary or a powerful, meaningful statement for anyone to ponder regarding the school situation, or a suggestion that you would greatly appreciate a response to your letter by a headmaster\u2019s return letter, or personal conference (if indeed this is your desire), etc. Any or all of these conclusions are pertinent. 6) Lower right-hand corner should be a closing that remains formal, closing choices such as \u201cSincerely\u201d or \u201cSincerely yours\u201d or \u201cRespectfully.\u201d 7). Directly below the closing should be your typed name, and directly below your typed name should be your signature. Headmasters are often inundated with \u201cheavy\u201d schedules. So much to do; so little time to do it. Your letter, if structured and verbalized clearly and relatively succinctly, can be a pleasure for the headmaster. GOOD LUCK ON A POSITIVE OUTCOME!!! ",

            "answer_text": "There's no secret trick to it, just write down what you want to say, in your own words. It doesn't need to be lofty and wordy, just honest, polite and respectful. Are you a child? Im assuming you are. My friends and i wrote a letter to our headmaster when we were 13, complaining that the school was really cold, and since we weren't allowed to wear coats in school, this made it difficult for us to concentrate on our work because we were freezing cold. The letter was about 5 lines long. He read it out in assembly, and said he was really pleased to have received it, he'd turn up the heating, and he'd like to invite other pupils to write him letters about things if they saw any problems in school. And some children did, and some things changed for the better. In your letter, be concise and to the point, and suggest solutions if you can think of them, but don't feel like you have to. You can keep the letter anonymous, but then you might not hear what's being done about the problems, or why nothing is being done. So consider putting your name on it. So here's how to try it: Dear Mr Phillips, I\u2019m writing you this letter because I'm concerned about a few things and i just wanted you to know about them, so maybe you can solve the problems. Firstly, it's really hard to find books in the library because nothing is signposted. Please can we have some signs? Secondly, there is a lot of bullying that goes on in Class 4A. We've told the teacher but she just keeps ignoring it. Maggie and Elsie are being mean to Sadie and it's making her really sad. Thirdly, the girl's toilets need a bin for sanitary towels in each cubicle. It's embarrassing to have to come out of the cubicle and throw it in the main bin. Finally, it's hard to see the board properly in classroom 105 when the sun shines, it reflects off the board and we can't read what's on it. Some blinds would solve this problem. Thanks, Emma Jacobson. ",

            "answer_text": "To The Headmaster, Greenhouse School Mao, Manipur. Subject: A constructive observations on the inefficiency of the school and remedial measures. Dear Sir, With due respect, I the undersigned would like to put forth some of my observations and opinions to your esteemed office under you kind consideration. TransportationUniformsFeesTeacherAs a student who has spent almost a decade in this school, I am indebted to the college for what I've become and owns a big share of responsibility especially in moments as this when the administration and whole functioning of the school is quickly degrading. Firstly addressing the issue of transportation, our school is at least 4Km away from the students' residences. At this era we can expect no parents making their children walk such distance by foot. And there are no proper means that could be availed for their daily schooling. To this I suggest the administration under your leadership, work towards extending the hostels and building new hostels, making it a totally residential one. If not purchase a bus for the school. The bust can be plied with monthly fees and the investment of 15 lakhs can hopefully be recovered in 10 years making it a win-win investment for both the school and the students. In this way the number of students decreased in the last few years can be retained. (And go on addressing the other issues respectfully, with a genuine concern. What is needed in this type of letter is not criticism. Anybody can criticize but takes lots of Education and years of experience to give a useful tip. Don't address the problems as a stranger, who are you to interfere? Such a question can divert the real intention. Be someone willing to share the failure and even more responsible in claiming a share towards a solution. Writing with such a clear perspective, will avoid any kinds of misunderstanding and this can be settled for good) . Looking forward to working together in any capacities for the welfare of the school. Thank you for considering my opinions, in anticipation. Sincerely Yours, Atheo School Captain Cl-XII Science (F) ",

A plea made to an authority such as your school dean, principle, and your teacher/instructor/mentor should begin respectfully, e.g., \u201c Dear Sir/Madam/Dean/Mr./Ms. Smith,\u201d followed by a clear statement of the point of your message. It need not be wordy so that concise enumeration of your interests is best. for example, \u201cI am having several problems that interfere with my education I would like you to consider which are, 1) Student outbursts in class contribute to my loss of concentration and so I\u2019d like you to inform my teachers to better control other student\u2019s conduct. 2) I would like the school to offer both counselors and tutors so that I can seek help discussing problems that I face at home and school. 3) There are no study hall resources where I can go to quiet work on my courses when I have free time. 4) I would like my courses to end at least fifteen minutes before the next course so that I can ask questions of my instructor that may help me to clear up my misunderstandings about her/his lecture as well as give me time to walk to my next class before the course begins. Please take any necessary actions that will help me resolve these barriers to my learning.\u201d Of course, these are totally fictitious needs or demands and I assume you can modify them to meet your own needs. However, I suggest you be courteous and to the point with your school authorities and to respond to their suggestions with workable alternatives to theirs (so, \u201cPRACTICE\u201d \u2014 a rebuttal or your position \u2014- \u201cmakes perfect\u201d) if they are not able to closely meet your needs. Also, you can tell them that you will discuss these with your parents and request they also help you better have your needs met. Good luck. ",
