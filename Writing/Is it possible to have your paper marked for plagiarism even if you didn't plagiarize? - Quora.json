            "answer_text": "Every time I quote someone, or cite someone, I get marked for plagiarism. That\u2019s why a good instructor will look at the paper directly to see what was marked and what wasn\u2019t. That being said, if more than 10% of my paper is quotes, or improperly cited (I \u2018summarized\u2019 too closely to the original quote citation) then I am still guilty of plagiarism because it is also about how much is written in your own words. (Remember, I\u2019m writing research papers, so nothing short.) BUT, if you are not quoting, and not citing, (and I assume that you are doing this properly), then it is nigh on impossible to accidentally plagiarize. Plagiarism is, \u201cthe practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own\u201d define plagiarism - Google Search. Thus plagiarism is more than just copying words and sentences, it includes copying ideas. In marketing, their are only so many ways to define the marketing mix (aka, 4ps), its also considered general knowledge at this point, so normally wouldn\u2019t be considered plagiarism if you forget to cite Kotler for this idea. But it would also be a small part of a larger paper. But lets be honest, if you and I come up with the same idea, independent of each other, we would explain the idea in different ways. I write differently than you do, and vice-versa. So no, generally speaking, it is not possible to accidentally plagiarize. I have yet to have a student, who claimed that they didn\u2019t plagiarize, return to me after I showed them the original source of their material. Sometimes they will initially say that they might have used the source material for guidance. Note: rewording someone else\u2019s work, or even outlining their work, without proper citation is plagiarism. I heard of a single experience, I believe it was here on Quora, that I can see happening, is when a student is accused of plagiarism, but the professor doesn\u2019t actually have source material to show from where it was copied. The student (author) insisted that the professor claimed it was plagiarized because the style of writing was higher than their normal spoken conversations. That is, this student read alot, and wrote to mimic how they read, not how they talked. Because the professor didn\u2019t have source material to show it was copied, I would have to give the student the benefit of the doubt. But, well, I\u2019ve always found source material before I accuse a student of plagiarism. So, again, in short, no. There are so many ways to structure your writing that it is nearly impossible for a student to accidentally plagiarize (or be accused of plagiarism but be innocent). ",

            "answer_text": "The goal of a plagiarism detector is to spot any possible match in a submitted text with the other resources. Based on this statement: 1) only your instructor makes the final decision of whether it is plagiarism or not. Just like Alexander Smith mentioned, all quotes will be flagged as a match, however, this does not make it plagiarism. 2) false positive results are still possible. Not all plagiarism detectors avoid false positive results. This happens especially when students write papers that requires formulas, abbreviations, common phrases, etc. If you have not plagiarized the paper, it should be easy to prove it using a plagiarism report.

            "answer_text": "From experience, yes, but I guess it depends on what level of education you are at and how thorough your markers are. It happened to me in school (this was in the 90\u2019s) due to a supposed friend leaning over my shoulder and copying my work. Then his was marked first which resulting in me being accused of plagiarising him. If it\u2019s plagiarism from the internet, then there are tools that can be used. Check out this question for more information on that: How do professors know if you plagiarized or not and what tools do they use? In cases like mine, tools aren\u2019t going to much use as it\u2019s just one student\u2019s word against another. Nothing was done in my case to allow me to prove my innocence (in fact I was told to drop it when I protested). The other student\u2019s paper got marked first, therefore mine was plagiarised. That was the facts of the matter for that teacher. Fortunately karma got to the other student in the end as I wised up to him after this and he had to copy from someone else next time he tried it and that time he got done for it. I think that to accuse you of plagiarism your markers are going to have to present what they think you copied from. If you know you didn\u2019t copy though you should be able to prove that you didn\u2019t. ",
