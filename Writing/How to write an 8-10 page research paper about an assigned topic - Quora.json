            "answer_text": "One simple way to write a research paper is to follow a template or outline. Start with a topic. Identify a specific issue or challenge relevant to your topic. Search for previous articles and scholarly work on the specific issue or challenge, and read the abstract. Then scroll down to the findings or conclusions section and read what the author(s) discovered. Next summarized your understanding of what the various articles had to say about the topic, the specific issue and the challenge. The key is to be specific and not wander and include other areas not focused on your topic.

I would then make an outline, arrange the notes accordingly and then begin writing. Keep a list of the references for the bibliography. Good luck! ",
