            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most organic way to discover a novel idea is by writing a short story and realizing \u2014 or having someone point out to you \u2014 that what you\u2019re dealing with is bigger than a story. Sometimes you will just begin to write something \u2014 not knowing whether it will be a short story or novel \u2014 and discover what it is after you begin.  How do you know if a story is begging for a larger format? Here are some signs that your short story is actually a novel in disguise. 1. Is Your Novel Idea Truly Novel? Have you seen this story before? Does it feel overly familiar or trite? Though Willa Cather was correct when she said, \u201cThere are only two or three human stories, and they go on repeating themselves,\u201d you must tell the story so that it feels completely new to the reader. 2. The Short Story Is Simply Too Long. Like poetry, there\u2019s a certain elegance to short story writing: space allows for only the essentials. A short story should run no longer than 10,000 words, and this is on the outside. If you\u2019ve already pared the story down to what is necessary and it\u2019s still too long, you may be dealing with something bigger. Remember: if you open the door to a new aspect of the story, you have to go inside. This means that you either need to cut off certain paths that your prose follows, or you need to expand and commit to those narratives. 3. Too Many Characters Are Needed to Tell the Story. If the number of characters in your story makes it confusing, first check to see if any can be eliminated or combined. You may often find that more than one character can fulfill the same need in your story, and therefore can be combined. 4. The Theme, or Themes, Have Not Been Fully Developed. If you\u2019re working with themes rather than a theme, this is already a good sign that you\u2019re craving a more generous format. Be very clear with what you\u2019re trying to communicate through the story, and whether or not you\u2019ve been successful. Is the theme too big to explore in under 10,000 words? 5. The Story Encompasses Too Long a Time Frame. Although there are no hard and fast rules, a short story generally covers a brief period of time. With exceptions, most short stories cannot comfortably cover years of a character\u2019s life. If your plot involves an afternoon or a few hours, you\u2019re probably right to choose the story format. That said, there are novels that cover short periods of time as well. The pages you need to tell a story will depend on your writing style. 6. One of Your Readers Has Pointed out That This Could Be a Novel. If someone has said to you, \u201cHey, I\u2019d like to read more of this,\u201d it\u2019s a good sign that you\u2019ve stumbled onto some rich material. Before embarking on something as time-consuming as a novel, you do want to be sure that you\u2019ve chosen a topic or a story that will hold people\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not an easy thing to achieve, so if you\u2019ve done it, pay attention. 7. You Don\u2019t Want to Stop Working on It. The most important thing in writing a novel is that the material can sustain your attention for the years it will take to finish the book. If the thought of living with these people for longer than a month makes you tired, don\u2019t torture yourself, no matter what your readers say. On the other hand, if this story has only whet your appetite, then keep working. If you\u2019re lucky enough to find something that inspires you to that degree, by all means, go with it. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, if you want to stand up in front of an audience and read a short story it better either be very funny or extremely gripping if you are going to try and hold their attention for more than 2000 words.  The ones I've had the most success with have been in the 800 - 1000 word range.  When you're reading on stage it seems like an eternity and like you're boring the audience rigid anyway, even if you aren't, so shorter is better. On the page you get a bit more time - but I've never had good feedback on anything over 3000 words. One tip I've seen some writers use is to create an 'abridged' version of their story specially for reading out. ",
