            "answer_text": "Interestingly enough, I find less of my couples writing their own vows. It\u2019s a little (or a lot) nerve wracking, many people don\u2019t want to speak in public, and the fact that our ceremonies are all personally written makes them already feel unique. Many of my couples DO write letters to each other, to give to each other first That\u2019s what we did. ",
