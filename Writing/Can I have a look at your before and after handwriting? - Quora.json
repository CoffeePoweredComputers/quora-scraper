            "answer_text": "Hello , thank you for your question ! hope you and your family are doing well in these times. handwriting is ever changing , and there\u2019s not an exact before an after writing really , it changes everyday. I have deliberately made few changes , like the letter S in the beginning of my signature for a better married life , or the letter t in my writing for my goals in life. These are few of the many examples that I have forcefully changed but other than that I can assure you , our writing is not gonna be identical even if we compare it on a daily basis. Hope you got my point. Thank you , Take care and stay safe. ",
