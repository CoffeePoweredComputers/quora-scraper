            "answer_text": "There are two parts to this question and both are very important. The first is who do you write the letter to? A lot of institutions have a special committee to handle requests for fee reduction or deferrals. It is quite common and to reduce the workload on the school principal and to avoid putting the principal in a position where he/she could be accused of improper behaviour such as favouritism or discrimination, the committee will handle all these requests. The principal may very well be the head of the committee but the work is done by other people. The second thing you have to take care of is to produce evidence of hardship and supporting documentation. Let us say for the purposes of illustration that you had a part time job to help you pay your fees and through no fault of your own, the hours available to you were cut, thus reducing your income. What you would need to produce here is a letter from your employer stating this and if possible a commitment to increase your hours as business improves and a copy of your bank statements showing the reduction in your income. Also if you could show that you have made reductions in your other living expenses as well then that would strengthen your case. If it were possible I would also include a payment schedule showing how you intended to get back on track once your financial situation improved. There is no point in lurching from crisis to crisis by being unrealistic about your ability to catch up on the deferred fees. All of this and more can be found out by chatting to the appropriate student finance officer in your institution. The most important thing to remember is that it is in the institutions best interest to keep you registered because if you drop out then they may very well be losing several years fees for the sake of a little bit of flexibility now. Furthermore, it is very important to stay calm and not get too anxious. You are not the first student to find themselves in this position and nor will you be the last. This is a problem with a workable solution as long as everyone acts in good faith and completes their side of the bargain. As for the wording of the letter, it should be business like, brief and to the point. i would start it with the following: Dear Principal x. My name is Y and I am currently registered as a full time student in the school of ZZ. I am writing to you in relation to my tuition fees which are currently due and I would like to discuss with you the possibility of deferring my fees for 3 months or paying these fees in instalments. The reason for my request is that due to current downturn in business I have had my part-time employment income reduced by 50%. I have attached a letter from my employer as proof of this. I have made every effort to reduce my living expenses but I now find myself in the position that I cannot pay all of my commitments in the short term and I must reorganise my finances. I feel confident that this is a purely temporary matter and that things will return to a more positive financial footing in the next six months. I have attached documentation to support my request for a fees deferral Yours sincerely ",
