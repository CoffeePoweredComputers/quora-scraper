            "answer_text": "It\u2019s related to the final sound rule, what you called batchim rule. Here, I want to call \u201cbatchim\u201d as \u201cconsonant\u201d for objectivity. \u20141\u2014 When a word ends with a consonant, then it can make only 7 sounds: \u3131 [k\u031a], \u3134 [n] ,\u3137 [t\u031a], \u3139 [l], \u3141 [m], \u3142 [p\u031a], and \u3147 [\u014b]. They\u2019re called \u201crepresentative sounds\u201d. \ubc11 [mit\u031a] (underside, bottom) \uaf43 [k\u0348ot\u031a] (flower) \uc637 [ot\u031a] (cloth) As you see, no matter the final consonant is either \u3137, \u3145, \u3148, \u314a, \u314c, \u3146, or sometimes \u314e, they all sound as [t\u031a]. So, \u201c-\uc5c8-\u201d or \u201c\uc788-\u201d itself is pronounced with the sound. \u20142\u2014 When a word with a consonant at the end meets another word beginning with a vowel that has a meaning, I mean, not something like a marker (postposition), ending, or suffix, then the representative sound of the former word is carried on the next vowel that it becomes a new consonant at the beginning. [k\u031a] becomes [g], [t\u031a] becomes [d], and [p\u031a] becomes [b] before a vowel. \uc637 \uc785\uc5b4 \u2192 \uc637 [ot\u031a]+\uc785\uc5b4 [ib\u028c] \u2192 \u201c\uc624\ub514\ubc84 [odib\u028c]\u201d \uaf43 \uc5c6\uc5b4 \u2192 \uaf43 [k\u0348ot\u031a]+\uc5c6\uc5b4 [\u028cp\u031as\u0348\u028c] \u2192 \u201c\uaf2c\ub365\uc368 [k\u0348od\u028cp\u031as\u0348\u028c]\u201d \uc78e \uc704 \u2192 \uc78e [ip\u031a]+\uc704 [wi] \u2192 \u201c\uc774\ubdd4 [ib\u02b7i]\u201d (When [w] meets a consonant before, then it fuses with the consonant like one sound.) \ubd80\uc5cc \uc74c\uc2dd \u2192 \ubd80\uc5cc [pu\u028ck\u031a]+\uc74c\uc2dd [\u026fmsik\u031a] \u2192 \u201c\ubd80\uc5b4\uae08\uc2dd [pu\u028cg\u026fmsik\u031a]\u201d \u20143\u2014 When a word with a consonant at the end meets a grammatical morpheme like a marker, ending, or suffix with a vowel in the beginning, then the final consonant of the former word is intactly carried onto the vowel without changing into the representative sound. \uc637\uc774 \u2192 \u201c\uc624\uc2dc [o\u0255i]\u201d, NOT \u201c\uc624\ub514\u201d \uaf43\uc744 \u2192 \u201c\uaf2c\uce28 [k\u0348ot\u0255\u02b0\u026fl]\u201d, NOT \u201c\uaf2c\ub4e4\u201d \uc78e\uc5d0 \u2192 \u201c\uc774\ud398 [ip\u02b0e]\u201d, NOT \u201c\uc774\ubca0\u201d \u201c\uc788\uc5c8\uc5b4\u201d is, thus, pronounced like \u201c\uc774\uc368\uc368 [is\u0348\u028cs\u0348\u028c]\u201d. \u201c-\uc5c8-\u201d is a grammatical ending for showing past form, and \u201c-\uc5b4\u201d is a final ending. So, all the \u3146 sounds come out without changing into their representative sound. Korean has lots of pronunciation rules that it can be tricky for you to learn them. But as we can see they\u2019re \u201crules\u201d, they\u2019re affordable or doable if you step forwards one by one. Hope it helps. :) ",

            "answer_text": "\u3137,\u314c,\u3145,\u3148,\u314a are sounded as [t] when one of the consonant are ending consonant. So, \uc788\uc5c8 is sounded as [it eot] primitively. However, \uc5f0\uc74c\ubc95\uce59(Thr rule for concatenation between consonants <-- I don't know official English translation of that.) dominately makes the final sound. So, the final sound is \uc774\uc37b[isseot] (eo should be replaced by official symbol of linguistics.). In that case, first t takes a role of bonding sound between \uc788 and \uc5c8. Two syllables were concatenated by ending vowel of first syllable. ",
