Being able to share my own mind with other people, and having the possibility that some of what I share has a positive effect on another person's mind is more than enough for me at times. Being able to have such an open platform to give ourselves is more rewarding than some people truly understand. Some people do it for the money, or the validation. Either way, it's about how we use it and what we do with it based upon our choices influenced by how we think and feel caused from our personal experiences. So yeah, being able to share what I've learned and what has helped me, it warms me internally. Either way, a little thank you if you can organise your mind and enable yourself to feel more than just words in this format. The knowledge that can be gained, and in-turn how this helps our choices and helps form more wisdom is a big positive ",
