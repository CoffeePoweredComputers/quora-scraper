            "answer_text": "When you know exactly what the purpose of your business is and you have set up the systems to deliver the purpose of your business; you have put the right people into the correct positions to support the systems and you have the measurements available to measure how well your business is delivering on its purpose, there is no need for a performance standard. You can discuss how well a member of staff is supporting the purpose of the business at any moment in time by reading your metrics and every member of staff know exactly how they are supporting the systems that deliver the purpose of your business. If you feel the need for a performance standard it suggests that neither you nor the staff member is clear on the purpose of the business and how that member of staff is supporting the system within the business that is delivering the purpose. So start by accurately defining the purpose of your business, and that is never from your perspective but from the perspective of how your business is serving your clients. ",
