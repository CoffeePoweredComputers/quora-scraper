            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. There are only so many changes you can make to a short story before making more is pointless or even detrimental. When you reach the point where you\u2019re changing stuff just to change stuff, you\u2019ve gone too far. What aspects of writing ability are you trying to improve? Plot pacing, worldbuilding, and character development? There\u2019s not much word-count room for those in a short story anyway, so unless you\u2019re working on improving your \u201ceconomy of word,\u201d you\u2019d be better off using a novelette/novella for improving these skills. You should also keep in mind that much of the \u201cbig picture\u201d aspect of writing is down to personal taste: there is no single \u201cright way\u201d to show characterization, to describe a setting, or to advance the plot. There\u2019s no one \u201ccorrect\u201d narrative voice; if it works for that story, it\u2019s good. Unless you know what you\u2019re aiming for with these things, rewriting a story won\u2019t do anything except give you a lot of practice typing. If you want to improve your skills with the \u201ctrivia\u201d (those are sarcasm quotes, kids) of grammar and punctuation, you shouldn\u2019t need to continuously rewrite a story to get it right. (Need help actually learning grammar and punctuation so you don\u2019t have to rely on the often-wrong Grammarly or some other grammar-bot program? I recommend the Grammar Girl website, although I\u2019m also rather partial to the \u201cWriting Glitch\u201d posts on North of Andover. The latter contains a lot of snarky humor, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing.) ",
