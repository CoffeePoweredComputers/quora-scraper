            "answer_text": "To be frank I think \"as\u00ed-as\u00ed\" is more commonly said by people who learned Spanish as a second language. My personal experience is that Spanish speakers would pretty much universally use \"m\u00e1s o menos\". I did wonder if I was just making an assumption based on my own upbringing. That it might be more popular in other countries. So I am glad to see people from other Spanish speaking countries confirming my suspicion. I was so confused when I heard people learning Spanish in college using it. That's when I found that it is commonly found in textbooks for learning Spanish and taught as almost a \"default\" answer. It actually made me doubt whether French speakers really say \"comme ci, comme \u00e7a\" or if that's also a French textbook thing. ",
