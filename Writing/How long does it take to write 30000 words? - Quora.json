            "answer_text": "I notice the other answers so far are about typing speed. But I think the asker wants to know about writing speed, which isn\u2019t the same thing. It\u2019s almost infinitely variable, as each author writes at the their own speed. Some authors put in a 6 to 8 hours writing day, and write 10,000 words. Others will write for the same time and only put out 5000 words. So for the first, you\u2019d be looking at 3 days, for a total of 18 to 24 hours work. The latter would double that to 6 days and 36 to 48 hours work. But for authors who write say 2000 words in 3 hours each day, this extends to 15 days. Slower writers will take longer. Now if one takes the question further, to how long does it take to write a novel, we get this: 10,000 words a day yeilds a 60k novel in 6 days, or a 90k novel in 9 days. 5,000 words a day yeilds a 60k novel in 12 days, or a 90k novel in 18 days. Depending on how much editing and proofing is needed, either can have a book released monthly, and the 10k a day people can have 2 books out a month (and do). 2,000 words a day yeilds a 60k novel in 30 days, or a 90k novel in 45 days. The 60k can be released every 6 weeks, and the 90k every 8 weeks. A bit of variability depending on if the author writes every day or not. A lot do. ",

            "answer_text": "What a timely question. I was just sitting here thinking about this very thing. I ponder if Quora is reading my mind\u2026 *crackles knuckles, and listens to the groans of my constant readers\u2026 If I\u2019m transcribing, 1.5 to 2 days. It\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m transcribing around 4000 words an hour, averaged over five-six hours. My body and brain cannot physically handle more than 20,000 words. I can, in reality. But I really pay for it for a few days to a week later. Every once in a while I make a miscalculation or I forget what day it is and have to panic to meet a deadline. It takes about 5\u20137 hours to hit 20,000 words. It takes another 4\u20135 hours to get that last 10,000 words in, and then proof, and then I\u2019m worthless for a week. \u202630,000 words in a day makes my brain really mushy. To make the math simple \u2014 100 words a minute. Maximum 6000 words an hour. You\u2019d have to maintain that pace, rhythm and focus for five solid hours. It\u2019s one of those things when you see on paper, but when you sit down to do it, to type words and word patterns you\u2019ve never seen or heard before \u2014 to think anybody can do that, that\u2019s insanity. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s one or two people out there who are that .0001%, but for the rest of us mortals, that\u2019s crazy. \u2026 But! This week, I started a new job for Metta Center for Nonviolence--Promoting Nonviolence Worldwide. Like filled out a payroll form, like kinda \u2018officially started a new job,\u2019 started a new job. I haven\u2019t been on anybody\u2019s payroll in over five years. I\u2019ve been freelancing and unmanaged, working out of Canada and everywhere. It\u2019s not really even a new job. It\u2019s a job I\u2019ve already been doing, but at the moment, they have enough work and funding to pay me, and filling out a payroll form made it easier for us. (Please feel free to donate to them!! This is NOT a lucrative gig for anybody.) Today, I hit 15,000 words, did a few administrative things, had to adjust an audio, and upload a fresh version, tweaked some macros that were bugging me. And now 120 minutes of video is searchable by text/ready to be used as captions, as well as a nice to read document. That\u2019s a good workday, with adequate breaks and a lunch in there. \u2026and my brain isn\u2019t that mushy. I really could have done more. \u2026I have a few months of work ahead of me, that I\u2019ve been begging to do\u2026now I have it! Ack! What have I done!! 30,000 words might be achievable in 7\u20139 hours \u2014 because I\u2019ve typed millions of words for these folks and know their lingo, single speaker, spectacular audio. (Although he\u2019s the most challenging guy I\u2019ve ever transcribed. He throws in words from so many different languages, it confuses my google. You\u2019d think both google and I would know what he\u2019s saying by now. But no, we don\u2019t. He keeps me on my toes like no other.) Plus, this is old archived stuff from 10 years ago. It\u2019s almost amusing now and not traumatic\u2026especially amusing, because I still have to google stuff to remember how to spell names and cities and things.  There\u2019s always a glitch in the process or some lengthy distraction that rips apart my ability to focus. It\u2019s really challenging for everything to go right and hit that 20,000 mark before I\u2019m utterly exhausted and need a nap. But that\u2019s another thing with this new gig. There\u2019s no deadlines. There\u2019s a MOUNTAIN of files that need to be transcribed, as well as other things. I don\u2019t have to worry so much about what files I\u2019ll be hearing next or how we\u2019re going to eat next month. I\u2019ve been pecking on these files for a few weeks already, but my ears had to go off to a refugee camp in Uganda and that mess is still working it\u2019s way out through my pores. I need to be hitting 30,000 words a day. I don\u2019t know how to explain it\u2026 I don\u2019t know how anybody can physically do that. \u202630,000 words is a lot o\u2019 words to hear, read, type, and proof\u2026it\u2019s a lot, y\u2019all. Especially when the files are heavy and not about very pleasant things. \u2026 But at the end of it, I\u2019ll have built my version of a metta metabase. It\u2019s so very much meta metta. It looks bad right now, but it\u2019s slowly growing. I haven\u2019t had time to count all the words, because my prior organization system was a mess and I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. Oh, it just needs layers! Seriously, the secret to good art, is layers. (Nobody knows what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m fairly certain nobody has ever done things the way we\u2019re doing things\u2026and nobody really seems to understand why I\u2019m still around, doing things \u2014 including myself.) And I know what I\u2019m making. I\u2019m slowly learning the art of wordcraft. Instead of test tubes or chemicals of the alchemist, the material I have gathered is the wordsmith\u2019s proverbial gold and dynamite. I know it\u2019s in there. I\u2019m just not sure how to get it out, yet. Maybe it\u2019s my weird version of a work of art that only a few will ever see. But golly, seeing the mammoth amount of metta data\u2026it\u2019s really gonna be a cool thing, well, almost a cool thing. I still have no clue what I\u2019m doing and just kinda making stuff up as I go. It\u2019s like a digital painting, but with other people\u2019s words. Every keystroke, is like a brushstroke, is it not? It\u2019s truly the art of a scribe, trying to show my species how much I love them, despite their wickedness. It looks like a simple spreadsheet at first, but then you get deeper, and deeper, and deeper, down to the letter \u2014 and the enormity of it smacks you in the face and it becomes so hard to comprehend. Personally, I\u2019m finding it kinda impressive that all of that came from the same fingertips. It\u2019s a ginormity amount of amazing words. \u2026I think I can do 30,000 words in a day. There\u2019s some blank spaces that need some color. It\u2019s not even 1/2 way there. I think it\u2019s currently over a million words. But if I can get this next section out of the way, then I\u2019ll have time to polish all the jagged bits while I can focus on it. Plus, there\u2019s the importance of the campaign, that\u2019s of the utmost importance right now.  I think I\u2019m going to be taking a Quora break. When I hit that 30,000 word-in-a-day mark, I\u2019ll come back and edit this answer with something more precise. I predict with breaks and whatnot, it\u2019ll be around 12\u201314 hours, no matter what I do. And I think that\u2019s a good limit for human capacity. I think if I take a 2-hour nap when I hit that 20,000 mark, I can get in that other 10,000 without causing issues for the next day. I might be able to hit 5000 words an hour. If I can hold that for six hours, I\u2019ll be fine, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s reality. We shall see how my week proceeds\u2026 ",
