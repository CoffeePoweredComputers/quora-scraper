            "answer_text": "Read all classic essays on the subject. For example Montaigne: \u201cRather a well-made than a well-filled head.\u201d Take notes. Write your own thoughts while reading, whenever you agree or disagree with the author. Think of the good and bad teachers you have known yourself. Why were they good or bad? What is the essence of teaching? What is the aim? What are the new ways of teaching today? Organise your thoughts. Write a first draft. Don\u2019t loose time with too many details. Ask people to read the draft and tell you what they honestly think of it. You can also ask a professional editor to help you. Then rewrite the book: cut off everything that is not essential and develop the best parts. As a rule of thumb, keep in mind that shorter is always better. And be clear. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s really personal topic because for every person there are different ways to learn and that\u2019s why different people think good about different teachers. Of course, in case you don\u2019t know what to write, you can use a help of professionals on this site http://writemypaper.today/ and your essay will be perfect. On my opinion, a good teacher is a man/woman that is know how to teach every kid in the class. What I mean is - a good teacher must make a subject interesting for every student. ",
