Check again that spelling and grammar are correct. We need to get more attention from readers. 2. Think about readers. If you are writing for kids you should think about kids.

            "answer_text": "The most important element of content writing is the ability to say focused on the question you are trying to answer. After you have nailed down the initial question, then everything else falls into place around that. This is easy when you are in school and the question is given to you by the teacher, but when you are writing on the internet, the question may not always be so obvious. Try these questions to get you started: Sales content: \u201chow do I give the reader enough information about [thing you are trying to sell] to proceed further into the sales process?\u201d Personal essay: \u201cwhat is the one thing I want the reader to know about me at the end of this?\u201d Professional writing: \u201cwhat is the idea that I need my reader to understand after they read this?\u201d By keeping the question in mind, you can help focus yourself as you compose your piece.
