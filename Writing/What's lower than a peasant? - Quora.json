            "answer_text": "The term \u201cpeasant\u201d refers to farmers, holding and working the land. Over the course of the 1,000 years we lump together as the \u201cMiddle Ages\u201d the percentage of peasants who were \u201cfree\u201d (meaning they paid rent for the land they worked, rather than holding it in exchange for \u201cservice\u201d) increased to the large majority. The \u201cunfree\u201d peasants are referred to as serfs. So within the peasant class, serfs had a lower status than free peasants. Both free peasants and serfs had a higher status than agricultural day-laborers, i.e. itinerant workers without land who worked for wages \u2014 or sometimes just a food and drink. All had a higher status than slaves. I\u2019ve written frequently on the comparative advantages of serfdom over slavery, but here, again, are two summaries, one from the Middle Ages and the other from the Ancient World. Middle Ages: The 20th century popular image of serfs was expressed in the Hollywood film \u201cThe Kingdom of Heaven\u201d when the lead character (I hate to call him Balian d\u2019Ibelin because he bore so little resemblance to the historical figure) says to the Hollywood Imad ad-Din that he \u201chad been a slave \u2015 or very like\u201d meaning (inaccurately) that he had been a serf before coming to the Holy Land. The conflation of slavery and serfdom is not only inaccurate, it fundamentally inhibits our understanding of feudal society. As I noted in the opening essay on kings and subjects, feudal society was based on the concept of mutual contracts \u2015 a fact that made medieval Europe very litigious by the way. The fundamental difference between slaves and serfs was that the former (slaves) had no rights, while the latter (serfs) had very clear rights. Let us start by looking at slavery. Slaves own nothing \u2015 not even their own bodies. They can be mutilated, tortured, raped and killed by their masters without the latter committing a crime. Anything slaves produce, even their own children, do not belong to them. Their children belong to their master, who can choose to kill or sell them. As a result, slaves cannot and do not have families. They rarely even know who their parents, siblings, and children are. The products of their hands, from crops to works of art, also belong to their masters. The magnificent pottery of ancient Athens, for example, was the work of slaves who might have been from any part of the ancient world.  From the Duke of Berry's Book of Hours Serfs historically derived from Roman slaves. With the spread of Christianity in the 4th century AD, however, slavery became increasingly unacceptable because Christianity viewed each human as a soul loved by God. Within a few hundred years it was universally accepted in the Latin Church that no Christian could be held as a slave. But the economy of the period was still utterly dependent on the labor of those former slaves to plant and harvest the food needed by all. So the status of slaves was altered and became one of serfdom in which the former slave was still required to till the land and was not free to leave it, but was granted control over his person and with it the right to marry, have a family, and above all retain 50% or more of his produce depending on locality. Compared to slaves, serfs lived a very privileged life!  From the Duke of Berry's Book of Hours Furthermore, at the time this status evolved, the concept of being \u201ctied to the land\u201d was not seen as a brutal violation of \u201chuman rights.\u201d On the contrary, the contract between serf and lord gave the serf both physical and economic security. The lord was responsible for providing armed protection against outlaws and raiders, and the serf not be thrown off the land any more than he could walk away from it; he was guaranteed his share of the harvest not just one year at a time but for as long as he and his children and his grandchildren and their children etc. lived. Renowned French historian Regine Pernoud points out in her book Those Terrible Middle Ages: Debunking the Myths (Ignatius, 1977, p.88): It was this intimate connection between man and the soil on which he lived that constituted serfdom, for, in all other respects, the serf had all the rights of a free man: he could marry, establish a family, his land, as well as the goods he was able to acquire, would pass to his children at his death. The lord, let us note, had, although on a totally different scale, the same obligations as the serf, for he could neither sell nor give up his land nor desert it. Furthermore, archaeology increasingly provides evidence of the very high standard of living serfs could attain. Clever peasants, like clever lords, made judicious marriages. Through good marriages and careful husbandry, peasants could accumulate more and more hereditary plots of land. It mattered little that they did not \u201cown\u201d the land in the modern, capitalist sense of the word; feudal lords didn\u2019t own it either. The point was that some serfs accumulated the right to use the land and harvest its produce. Peasants that accumulated more land than they could themselves cultivate, hired laborers to work it for them. A wealthy serf could build a large house, purchase furnishings, and other luxuries, and live like a lord \u2015 just as long as he didn\u2019t try to leave his land. Archaeological finds demonstrate that peasants in England in the 12th and 13th century had glazed pottery, glass drinking vessels, pewter cutlery, table-cloths and imported French wine. They also had musical instruments, dice, cards and board games. They were not living in filth, overburdened until exhaustion, or groveling about like the pigs.  From the Duke of Berry's Book of Hours The standard of living among peasants increased as Europe became more prosperous and new technologies, from the horse collar and horseshoe to axles that swiveled and plows that could turn the soil, were introduced. These new technologies increased farm productivity dramatically. By using horses rather than oxen, for example, the amount of land one farmer could cultivate doubled. These technologies also enabled land that had previously been considered marginal to be brought under cultivation. With more land under cultivation, it was possible to introduce (in the eighth century) the three field system, which left one-third of the land fallow each year. This enabled the soil to regenerate and so the sustainability of agriculture increased. As a result of these innovations, European serfs: \u201cbegan to eat far better than common people anywhere, ever. Indeed, medieval Europeans may have been the first human group whose genetic potential was not badly stunted by a poor diet, with the result they were, on average, bigger, healthier, and more energetic than ordinary people elsewhere.\u201d (Rodney Stark. God\u2019s Battalions. HarperCollins, 2009, p. 70.)  From the Duke of Berry's Book of Hours As prosperity increased, so did the demand for goods, spawning an increase in industry and trade. This, in turn, led to greater urbanization, and with improvements in transportation technology (think of the splendid naval architecture of the Vikings), trade started to spread farther and farther afield. The First Crusade (1097-1099) re-established regular contact with the Byzantine Empire and the Near East, and for the next three hundred years, Europeans dominated the sea lanes of the Mediterranean. Pilgrim traffic, crusades, and trade with the Levant produced a great economic boom that financed the great palaces and cathedrals, monasteries and guild halls, and many more humble dwellings as well. Yet, urbanization also made serfdom increasingly burdensome. Serfs no longer feared losing their land but longed for the greater opportunities in crafts, industry, and trade that beckoned from the cities. Thus by the twelfth century, serfs were demanding their freedom and more and more mechanisms for emancipation evolved. By the end of the Middle Ages, there were, in fact, many more free peasants than serfs in Western Europe. The crusader states were an exception to the overall feudal model. Founded centuries after slavery had disappeared from Western Europe and settled by free men (since serfs could not leave the land to pilgrim to the Holy Land), there were no serfs at all in the crusader states. An Comparison of Helots (peasants/serfs) and Slaves in Ancient Greece.  In 413 BC, according to Thucydides, an estimated 20,000 Athenian slaves ran away to the Spartans, who had established a permanent fortress at Dekeleia. For these oppressed and exploited individuals, the Spartans were liberators. Their story, however, is virtually ignored by the usual depictions of Sparta that stress the \u201cexceptionally harsh\u201d lot of Sparta\u2019s helots. As I have tried to point out in earlier posts, helots enjoyed significant privileges that chattel slaves in the rest of the ancient world did not. First and foremost, they lived in family units, could marry at will and raise their own children. Almost equally significant, they could retain half their earnings. Such income could be substantial, as is demonstrated by the fact that no less than 6,000 helots were able to raise the significant sum of five attic minae necessary to purchase their freedom in 369 BC, according to Xenophon. In contrast, chattel slaves had no family life and their children belonged \u2013 literally \u2013 not to them but their masters. As to the fruits of their labor, these accrued exclusively to their masters, and even freed slaves (at least in the case of former prostitutes) had to surrender some of their earnings in perpetuity to their former masters after their manumission. In Athens, furthermore, slaves could be tortured for evidence in trials against their masters, because the Athenians believed a slave\u2019s word was worthless unless obtained under torture \u2013 a bizarre and chilling attitude to fellow human beings. I would like to note, further, that Athens\u2019 economy was no less dependent on slaves than Sparta\u2019s was on helots. Slaves worked Athens silver mines -- under appalling and dehumanizing conditions worse than any horror story told of helots even by Sparta\u2019s worst enemies. Slaves also provided essential agricultural labor and manned the workshops that made Athens famous for its handcrafts. Even the statues on the acropolis, the wonder of all the world to this day, were largely the work of slaves, who earned \u201cwages\u201d only for their master\u2019s pockets and had to make do with whatever scraps he deigned to give them. Defenders of Athens are apt to point out that Athens\u2019 laws prohibited the execution of slaves and no one but the slave\u2019s own master was allowed to flog a slave. In contrast, war was declared on Spartan slaves annually and an organization, the kryptea, allegedly existed solely for the purpose of eliminating potentially rebellious helots. These Spartan customs are indeed harsh, but they should also be viewed in perspective. First, according to Plutarch, both the annual declaration of war and the creation of the kyrptea post-date the helot revolt of 465 and have no place in the Golden Age of Sparta, the archaic period. Second, even after the helot revolt and the onset of Spartan decline, we know of only a single incident in which helots were in fact executed without cause. According to Thucydides, in ca. 425/424, 2,000 helots were led to believe they would be freed, were garlanded and paraded through the city, only to then \u201cdisappear.\u201d Everyone presumes they were killed. If this really happened as described, it was an unprecedented atrocity. If true, it besmirches the record of Sparta for eternity. It would nonetheless also still be only an isolated incident. Beside this atrocity, I would like to place as exhibit B the slaughter of the entire male population of island city-state of Melos by Athens in 416. Melos was a free city. It\u2019s only \u201ccrime\u201d was to remain neutral in the Peloponnesian war. Yet Athens subjugated the city, slaughtered the adult males and made all the women and children chattel slaves. I\u2019d call that an atrocity too \u2013 and every bit as bad as the disappearance of 2,000 helots. There is no doubt about what happened to Melos. We have many sources and know the fate of many individuals that further verify and illuminate the brutality of the event. But the story of the 2,000 helots has only a single \u2013 albeit usually reliable \u2013 source: Thucydides. As Nigel Kennell in his book Spartans: A New History notes, Thucydides\u2019 dating of the incident must be off because at exactly the same time (425/4) Brasidas was recruiting helots to fight with him \u2013 something he did successfully. Why would young men have been willing to volunteer to fight with Brasidas (which they most certainly did), if they had just seen 2,000 of their fellows slaughtered? It is so unreasonable to believe helots would have volunteered if the alleged massacre had just taken place, that Kennel concludes that Thucydides was referring to an incident that had occurred at some vague/unknown time in the past. That is surely one explanation, since after Brasidas\u2019 helots had proved their worth as soldiers, i.e. after they had proved just how dangerous they could be to the Spartiates, no less than 700 of them were liberated by a vote in the Spartan Assembly. This means that, if Thucydides is correct and the Spartans had once been so afraid of strong, healthy helots that they slaughtered 2,000 of them before they were trained to bear arms, by 421 a majority of Spartan citizens had no qualms about freeing 700 helots, who were not only healthy, but trained and experienced fighting men. Why would they free these 700 hundred after killing 2,000 others? It doesn\u2019t add up, and so the story of the murder of the 2000 has to be questioned. While it is possible Thucydides was describing an earlier event, it is almost certain that the only evidence he had was hearsay. The modern historian should not exclude the possibility that the entire \u201catrocity\u201d was either a gross exaggeration or outright propaganda. And who would have a greater interest in spreading rumors of such an atrocity than Athens itself? An Athens, whose slaves were deserting in droves by 413. One thing is clear: those 20,000 Athenian slaves, who turned themselves over to Spartan mercy, did not expect to be slaughtered. Either they had not heard the \u201ctruth\u201d about how the Spartans \u201creally\u201d treated their helots, or they didn\u2019t believe the stories they were told by their Athenian masters. Thucydides is silent on what happened to those 20,000 former Athenian slaves, either because he doesn\u2019t know \u2013 or it wouldn\u2019t fit into his neat polemic against Spartan brutality. We know, however, that Sparta\u2019s citizen population had already declined dramatically by the end of the 5th Century BC and yet Sparta kept fighting and winning battles. It did so by relying more and more on non-citizen soldiers, and a fleet manned by non-Spartiates. It is also in this period that the first references to a curious new class of people, the \u201cNeodamodeis,\u201d emerge in literature. The most common interpretation of this term is that these \u201cNew Citizens\u201d were freed helots or the children of Spartiate men by helot women. There is, however, no reason to assume that some of these new citizens were not freed Athenian slaves as well. If so, then these men surely found freedom in Lacedaemon. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that questions like this, are spawned by the frequently used concept of the \u201csocial pyramid\u201d  to depict historical (and also contemporary) social stratification. This \u201csocial pyramid\u201d image of a society, gives the erroneous idea of society being a simple top-down hierarchy, widest at its base, with a large underclass of oppressed peasants and slaves, and then increasingly narrower middleclass, nobility etc. However no society ever, in reality, looked like a pyramid. Pyramids as structures might not collapse, but a society with a \u201cpyramidal\u201d shape WILL collapse. Unlike pyramids, societies are never widest at the base, and rather than looking like this (for a more contemporary image)  they rather look like this\u2026.  The astute reader will see that the bottom rungs of society, is NOT the widest/largest class or group, but rather that the \u201cpillar\u201d or \u201cbase\u201d of society is usually somewhat higher up on the social ladder : Working class and lower middleclass or (in an agrarian society) peasant and serfs. That is because the real \u201cunderclass\u201d, those at the bottom rung of society were never neither the working class nor the peasants (again in an agrarian society) but rather those unfortunate poor devils that were society\u00b4s outcasts : beggars, street prostitutes, outlaws. The lowest rungs of any society, is NEVER its foundation base or supporting pillar. If that was the case, said society would be on the verge of collapse. The lowest rungs of society is not a base, but rather a sewage drain, into death and destruction. The actual foundations are rather working class and/or peasants, which is somewhat higher in the social strata, sometimes even to be classified as lower middleclass. Societies are not pyramids\u2026but rather like the Gilbert-Kahl model. ",
