I\u2019m sure it can work for you too. 1. Read other blogs as much as you can. When you do this, open a document on your desktop and jot down ideas you will get from a blog that interests you. 2. Read comments on other blogs and your own. There are many ideas you can get from a person\u2019s comment on a blog post. 3. Ask questions on your blog or social media\u2026even on your email list. Something like \u201cWhat would you like to read about?\u201d You can even make it a questionnaire. Choose a few topics and see what people want to know. Then write about it. 4. Always stay in touch with your email list and ask them what they need to know. 5. Social media is a fine place to get ideas in your niche of what you want to write about. 6. Sometimes if you are wracking your brain to figure out what to write about, it is a \u201csign\u201d that you need to clear your mind. Take a walk, go to your favorite place, pet a dog\u2026.anything that will take your mind off of thinking what you should write. You will then receive clarity. 7. Jot down all your ideas even when you are out and about. I can walk into a retail store and see how their business can grow if only they were online. I\u2019ll jot down everything and voila..a blog post is born. 8. No matter what your niche is, keep reading\u2026keep learning and never stop. -Donna ",

            "answer_text": "I see this question so often, and I always laugh because it's really asking, \"How do people find things to talk about\".  The answer is that when you have something you want to say, you say it - you blog about it.  If you don't have anything to say, why open your mouth to prove how little you have to say?  Leave that to the politicians.   The reason there is so much redundant \"space junk\" floating around on the Internet is because so many bloggers feel they need to say something when they actually have nothing to say. Unfortunately, when you blog for business, you do need to say something, just as at a dinner party you can't keep your mouth shut all evening. (I've tried.  It doesn't work. People will look at you funny, especially your spouse.)  And that is surely why you are asking this question. So my first tip is to make sure that when you open your mouth, you are not proving how little you have to say.  That means writing something unique and refreshing.  You can find some tips on this point from me and five other bloggers at 6 bloggers share their tips to help you craft better content - Social Media Slant Here are my five top tips: Most of my ideas come from the things that I do during the day.  When I comment on another blog or on a social media post, I often realize that I could write more than just the 100-200 words I'll be leaving in the comment, and I go on to write 1000+ words in a blog post. I also participate in mastermind groups on Skype;  often those discussions get me thinking, and as I develop thoughts, I need to write them down and share them with the world.  It's just something a writer has to do. Other things that happen during the day inspire me.  I wrote once about the saga of one of our barn cats.  I wrote once about how setting fire to our septic tank taught me a valuable business lesson. I've written about various customer service examples I have witnessed.  Take notes, because your life is overflowing with blog topics. Anything that solves a problem is a great topic to write about.  If something is getting under your skin and threatening to pop up in blisters of frustration, write about that.  And, of course, offer your solution.  If you have customer or reader feedback, complains of questions, write about those problems.  And, of course, offer your solution.  Readers love solutions to problems.   The key is that you are writing about your thoughts on the topic, your experience and your observations. That's what makes your post original and worth reading.  Otherwise, you might as well just pass it up, because everything has already been written somewhere by somebody, and the last thing the Internet needs is more space junk floating around. To summarize:  Expand on your own comments in social media.Build on ideas from conversations you have.Observe what people around you do.Solve your own frustrations, and those of customers.Write from your own experiences, with your own thoughts.
