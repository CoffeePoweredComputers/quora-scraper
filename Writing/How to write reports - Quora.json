You can also check our information on assignment writing for tips on planning, finding information, writing and reviewing your work. Step 1: Decide on the 'Terms of reference' To decide on the terms of reference for your report, read your instructions and any other information you've been given about the report, and think about the purpose of the report: What is it about?What exactly is needed?Why is it needed?When do I need to do it?Who is it for, or who is it aimed at?This will help you draft your Terms of reference. Step 2: Decide on the procedure This means planning your investigation or research, and how you'll write the report. Ask yourself: What information do I need?Do I need to do any background reading?What articles or documents do I need?Do I need to contact the library for assistance?Do I need to interview or observe people?Do I have to record data?How will I go about this?Answering these questions will help you draft the procedure section of your report, which outlines the steps you've taken to carry out the investigation. Step 3: Find the information The next step is to find the information you need for your report. To do this you may need to read written material, observe people or activities, and/or talk to people. Make sure the information you find is relevant and appropriate. Check the assessment requirements and guidelines and the marking schedule to make sure you're on the right track. You may also learn how to write an information report. If you're not sure how the marks will be assigned contact your lecturer. What you find out will form the basis, or main body, of your report \u2013 the findings. For more on finding information: Research and reading Steps for writing an assignment Step 4: Decide on the structure Reports generally have a similar structure, but some details may differ. How they differ usually depends on: The type of report \u2013 if it is a research report, laboratory report, business report, investigative report, etc.How formal the report has to be.The length of the report.Depending on the type of report, the structure can include: A title page.Executive summary.Contents.An introduction.Terms of reference.Procedure.Findings.Conclusions.Recommendations.References/Bibliography.Appendices.The sections, of a report usually have headings and subheadings, which are usually numberedThe basic structure of a report (PDF 262 KB; opens in a new window) Step 5: Draft the first part of your report Once you have your structure, write down the headings and start to fill these in with the information you have gathered so far. By now you should be able to draft the terms of reference, procedure and findings, and start to work out what will go in the report\u2019s appendix. Findings The findings are result of your reading, observations, interviews and investigation. They form the basis of your report. Depending on the type of report you are writing, you may also wish to include photos, tables or graphs to make your report more readable and/or easier to follow. Graphs - BBC Skillwise website (opens in a new window) Appendices As you are writing your draft decide what information will go in the appendix. These are used for information that: is too long to include in the body of the report, orsupplements or complements the information in the report. For example, brochures, spreadsheets or large tables.Formatting and presenting your assignment Step 6: Analyse your findings and draw conclusions The conclusion is where you analyse your findings and interpret what you have found. To do this, read through your findings and ask yourself: What have I found?What's significant or important about my findings?What do my findings suggest?For example, your conclusion may describe how the information you collected explains why the situation occurred, what this means for the organisation, and what will happen if the situation continues (or doesn't continue). Don\u2019t include any new information in the conclusion. Step 7: Make recommendations Recommendations are what you think the solution to the problem is and/or what you think should happen next. To help you decide what to recommend: Reread your findings and conclusions.Think about what you want the person who asked for the report should to do or not do; what actions should they carry out?Check that your recommendations are practical and are based logically on your conclusions.Ensure you include enough detail for the reader to know what needs to be done and who should do it.Your recommendations should be written as a numbered list, and ordered from most to least important. Step 8: Draft the executive summary and table of contents Some reports require an executive summary and/or list of contents. Even though these two sections come near the beginning of the report you won't be able to do them until you have finished it, and have your structure and recommendations finalised. An executive summary is usually about 100 words long. It tells the readers what the report is about, and summarise the recommendations. Step 9: Compile a reference list This is a list of all the sources you've referred to in the report and uses APA referencing. APA referencing Step 10: Revise your draft report It is always important to revise your work. Things you need to check include: If you have done what you were asked to do. Check the assignment question, the instructions/guidelines and the marking schedule to make sure.That the required sections are included, and are in the correct order.That your information is accurate, with no gaps.If your argument is logical. Does the information you present support your conclusions and recommendations?That all terms, symbols and abbreviations used have been explained.That any diagrams, tables, graphs and illustrations are numbered and labelled.That the formatting is correct, including your numbering, headings, are consistent throughout the report.That the report reads well, and your writing is as clear and effective as possible.Source: https://www.openpolytechnic.ac.nz/current-students/study-tips-and-techniques/assignments/how-to-write-a-report/ ",

            "answer_text": "Let me first give you some tips regarding writing reports. Always keep it simple.Try to keep the content of the report as much simple as possible. The purpose of a report is to make the data understandable and because of this pretty simple reason, the layout of the report must be in such a way that the reader is able to get the data without much trouble. IntroductionAlways keep in mind that the layout of an efficient report is the important key. So, always include a creative and interactive introduction to your article. This can be wrapped up in 4\u20135 lines however it should be more like an opening paragraph to give a brief idea of what the article is going to be about. BodyYou can use jargons while writing the body of a report. You can keep the language used in the rest of the body simple. There should be sections in the report with each having a suitable title. ConclusionThere are many people who would just go through the introduction and the conclusion so it should be jargon free and as simple as possible. RecommendationsPut all your recommendations in priority and try to elaborate it a little in a simple language. Always remember to put all the content in the report in a very logical manner and in an understandable language with the most important information coming first. ",
