            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been quite active on Quora for 2 years now and read a lot of readers here. To be honest, some writes only relevant answers with solid rationale by their soul & heart while on the other hand, some writes only irrelevant answers which doesn\u2019t provide any value to the readers here. I believe this simply violates the policies of Quora. It is now being treated as a photo sharing platform just to earn views & \u2018virtual\u2019 followers. As you have asked about the best writers on Quora only in 2020, I think these reputed & respected writers mentioned below are \u2018evergreen\u2019. They are adding values every year to the entire Quora community by their answers. I love reading their answers based on their rich experiences from all the spheres of life. Some maestros which I would like to mention here are: Awdhesh Singh (\u0905\u0935\u0927\u0947\u0936 \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939) SirRajan Singh SirAmitabha Tripathi SirBalaji Viswanathan (\u0baa\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bbf \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0ba8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd) SirGopalkrishna Vishwanath SirHector Quintanilla SirKalpit VeerwalSaranya Ravichandran Ma\u2019amI would urge other readers to read their answers & you will gain some great knowledge from all fields in life.
