            "answer_text": "I think some people believe that a story has to be written in chronological order. Often, when I have a really good scene in my head, I write that - even if it\u2019s not in the right order or it\u2019ll be a few chapters ahead of where I am. It helps keep the idea fresh and the motivation rolling. If I have a great idea for a scene, there\u2019s no sense waiting for the scene to actually happen in the plot. Just write it now and fill in the gap later (as long as you make a note that you\u2019ve created a gap, ha!). ",
