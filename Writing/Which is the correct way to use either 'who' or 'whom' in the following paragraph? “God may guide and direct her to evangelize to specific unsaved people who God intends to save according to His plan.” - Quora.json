            "answer_text": "The answer is \u201cpeople whom.\u201d That is because \u201cpeople\u201d in this case are the receivers of the action. It\u2019s a case of subject versus object. People in this sentence are not the subject of the sentence (doing the action), they are the object, or receivers of the action. For some additional help on this topic, see below. WHO and WHOM WHO and WHOM are used as personal pronouns and refer to people, but choosing between the two can be confusing: RULE: WHO/WHOEVER always substitute for subject pronouns: I, YOU, SHE, HE, and THEY. WHOM/WHOMEVER always substitute for object pronouns: ME, HER, HIM, and THEM. So, what is the correct word to use in this case? \"Who/whom is the party for? If you answer the question, the right choice becomes clear: \"The party is for him.\" Hence, the right choice is WHOM. Tip: A good way to decide the issue is to substitute HE or HIM (or She or Her) for WHO or WHOM. Then it is fairly easy to see which sounds the best. Make it a statement that answers the question if that helps you. EXAMPLES \u00b7 For who/whom are these boxes? (The boxes are for her) (whom) \u00b7 The girl who/whom went to Tampa. (She went to Tampa) (who) \u00b7 Who/whom were they after? (They were after him) (whom) \u00b7 I\u2019ll tell whoever/whomever wants to listen. (I\u2019ll tell him) (whomever) \u00b7 Whoever/whomever parks here will be ticketed. (He parks) (whoever) ",
