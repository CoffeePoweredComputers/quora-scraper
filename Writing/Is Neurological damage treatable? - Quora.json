            "answer_text": "Degenerative neurological disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) announce themselves with tremors or tingles, with muscle weakness or tightness, with problems ranging from swallowing to even seeing. While all three are incurable, promising research advances have been made in their treatment. It is also true that in the cases of Parkinson\u2019s and MS, patients\u2019 quality of life can be greatly enhanced if the proper care is administered. That is the goal of \u201cMinds in Motion,\u201d The Allure Group\u2019s neurological rehab program. A 28-bed specialized unit based in the King David Center in Brooklyn, it is designed to aid patients dealing with not only the above maladies but also those who have suffered strokes.  It is supervised by Dr. Miran Salgado, who with his staff of specially trained therapists helps patients through the use of advanced rehab equipment and techniques. Another part of the program is an ongoing lecture series called \u201cThe Vanguard Series,\u201d which is available to staff, patients, families, and the community at large. These talks provide information about Minds in Motion. The importance of such programs cannot be overstated. About 1 million Americans are living with Parkinson\u2019s, making it the second-most common neurological disorder, after Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Some 60,000 are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s each year. The numbers for MS and ALS, while not quite as great, are no less sobering. Some 400,000 Americans suffer from MS, with 10,000 new cases being revealed each year. And some 20,000 are afflicted with ALS -- also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease, after the late, legendary New York Yankee who died from the disorder in 1939. About 6,000 new cases emerge each year. MS is more common among those between the ages of 20 and 50, while Parkinson\u2019s and ALS tend to afflict older Americans -- those between 40 and 70 in the latter case, those over 60 in the former. Donations to ALS research as a result of the Ice Bucket Challenge two years ago led to the discovery in 2016 of the NEK-1 gene, regarded as one of the most common genes in the development of ALS. That in turn resulted in the creation of the drug Edaravone, which is awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval. There have also been advances in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s and MS. One notable innovation in the Parkinson\u2019s field involves deep-brain stimulation (DBS) through the use of implants such as the Brio Neurostimulation System. Stem cell therapy -- i.e., any treatment that targets the types of cells that differentiate into many different specialized cells in our bodies -- has shown itself to be a promising method for treating MS, in that those cells slow the disease and repair damage to the central nervous system.

            "answer_text": "It entirely depends on the disorder, the client, and whoever is treating it. One way, the way many of us visualize therapy, is cognitive-behavioral. That is, a trained therapist will identify the problem, discuss it, and try to influence your behavior so that the problem can either be coped with or extinguished. This is very effective with some, not at all with others. Another, rather more controversial way is through medication. Now, I could argue either side here\u2014it does get a bad rap where it shouldn\u2019t, but many medications are wholly overprescribed in the United States, particularly for ADHD. There\u2019s also the question of whether medication actually helps, or if it causes more problems than it solves. This largely comes down to the client and which side effects they manifest. Generally, medication is a powerful tool, but almost always used in conjunction with cognitive-behavioral therapy for maximum efficacy. The third, which is hardly used anymore, is neurosurgery. This also gets a bad rap as a result of the lobotomy craze half a century ago, but neurosurgery is utterly necessary in some cases, notably with extreme epilepsy. More than anything else, this is a last resort, though when done on young, developing brains, their natural plasticity (in which a dysfunctional bit of our brain will essentially be recreated in an existing functional area) can make recovery much, much easier and less debilitating in the long run. There is also electroconvulsive therapy, which is actually quite effective in treating extreme depression. However, I don\u2019t think people are very open to the idea, and they make assumptions about it. Anyway, it\u2019s being largely replaced by transcranial magnetic stimulation, which stimulates areas of the brain non-invasively (essentially, from the outside) and may be used to treat more disorders in the future. Lastly, there is biofeedback, which is a pretty wide term for a number of different therapies. Two of the biggest forms of this are peripheral biofeedback and neurofeedback. The former monitors your breathing, heart rate, finger temperature, and muscle tension through a variety of non-invasive equipment. Then, you are taught how to keep your temperature high, heart rate low, and muscles relaxed by breathing slowly\u2014in my experience, down to about six breaths per minute. The latter is a bit more serious, hooking up an electroencephalogram (which measures brainwaves) and essentially conditioning your brain to prefer a certain frequency of brainwave over another. Anyway, that\u2019s all I can recall. Apologies for the lack of sources, but if anyone has corrections, feel free to inform me and I\u2019ll fix whatever I got wrong. Pretty broad question, but I tried to do what I could with it. Hope this helps. ",
