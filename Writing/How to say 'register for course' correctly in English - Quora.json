            "answer_text": "You can make that statement in a number of ways. As a general rule of thumb, American English uses class instead of course in nearly every way. Course is usual reserved for its other connotation meaning route, track, path, way or as a verb in the same sense of fixed direction. I registered for ____(name of the course)____.I am registering for three courses this term.The present tense of register is used as a simple or bare predicate at the end of a clause with only the verb phrase.

            "answer_text": "\"I enrolled in the course\" is a good choice. It's absolutely explicit that you have ensured your name is on the list of people who will be taking the course (the \"roll\").  \"I registered for the course\" means you have submitted your name, and it's on some sort of list. Depending on context that could be the list of students who have been approved to take the course, but it could also be perhaps just a waiting list. \"I enlisted in the course\" is rather too military. However a professor could enlist students in a course. ",
