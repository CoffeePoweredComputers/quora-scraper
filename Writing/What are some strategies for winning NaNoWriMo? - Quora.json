Do whatever you need to do to turn off your internal editor. \"I don't think this whole chapter about the ill-fitting blouse is going to be\u2014\" It's fine. \"But this isn't really period-appropriate dialog for\u2014\" No one cares, at least in the moment. \"Karen's only a bit character, so umpteen hundred words about how adorable her puppy is seems\u2014\" Throw it in. Editing is for December You to worry about. \"Banging out enough words\" is the issue of the day. Type everything! Max that word count! Cross that 50K threshold, and hold your hands high! You will have an Actual Story put to paper! Everything else? Repeat everyone's favorite six-word mantra: \"We'll fix it in post-production.\" Figure out what works best for you when it comes to that... uh, out-word-banging. Maybe you prefer to be in a busy coffee shop, where you can people-watch for inspiration. Maybe you prefer to be in someone's living room, having \"I bet I can write more words than you in the next 20 minutes!\" competitive sprints. Maybe you prefer to have headphones on, blaring crazy-loud electronica, where the speed of the beat matches the speed of your fingertips. Maybe you prefer sitting in a dark and cold room, consuming precisely one amber ale per hour, trying to say in the \"tipsy enough to lack concerns, sober enough to continue operating a keyboard\" zone. Experiment! Whatever works for you. I know some years, I divvied my novel into 30 chapter titles ahead of time. \"That way, I have a vague outline of sorts, and know I should switch to the next chapter heading every 1700 words or so!\" At least one person thought that was constrictive madness, the dumbest idea in the world... while bringing a literal physical typewriter to parties, and transcribing whatever they pecked out onto their laptop the next day. So yeah. Your optimal writing process might be much different than mine. Just please don't get discouraged. \"But I'm so many words behind!\" I once did the whole second half of my novel in three hatefully long days - word counts: 5K, 8K, 12K! - starting on November 28. You can type one hell of a lot if you've got a bee in your bonnet about matters. \"But now I'm stuck on the boring scene!\" Then skip past it! \"Madison and Tyler break up blah blah everyone is sad like you'd expect. Tyler moves to Denver and leaves some bitchy emails but whatever. Now to Amazing Riverfront Hotel, which I can gush about for pages, where thousands of words of Madison canoodling is happening....\" \"But halfway in, I realized my story sucks!\" Have everyone just keel over dead and start writing about something else. It's not like you have to present this document to the queen or something. Nobody but you will know that your rag-tag buddy comedy started as a forlorn tale of love lost. You will become part of a long legacy of cool things coming out of unconventional origins. I hope some aspect of the above helped! Just keep typing, yo. You'll get there! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve no idea what will work for you, but here are some of the things I\u2019ve done. Reverse NaNo. This is where you start off with a large target for words written on the first day and it gradually reduces over the month until on the last day you have to write one word. \u201cEnd\u201d presumably. This has worked for me for two or three years. Disadvantages: you may run out of plot at around day 20. This matters only if you\u2019re after that badge for updating your word count for 30 days running. I\u2019m a pot-hunter, bite me! This year I\u2019ve done what one of the other responders said and I have 32 chapters outlined. So if I do one a day and they are all 1667 words or more, I will get the 50k words down. Working so far, in fact I\u2019m a day ahead in terms of words, so if I have a rough day for any reason, I\u2019m there. Talking of outlining, I can\u2019t work without an outline. If you\u2019re a dyed-in-the-wool pantser that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019ve found I need to know roughly where I\u2019m going and how I can get there. Of course if you do deviate from the outline the Planner Police won\u2019t actually come knocking on your door. You just rejig the outline a bit. About writing every single day - that\u2019s obviously the ideal, but we\u2019re talking about real life here. There may come a day when there\u2019s a family emergency, or you catch the \u2018flu, or something. If you\u2019ve got a few words in hand you can take a day off! Preferably just the one, but take what you need. Switching off the Inner Editor is standard advice - and good advice. However this year I\u2019ve found a couple of places where I made a mistake or changed my mind or forgot something important I was going to include. So I did go back to chang a few things - but I didn\u2019t delete. I used Strikethrough and put the new words in highlight. That way they still count. But generally if it\u2019s just minor editing make a note of it and leave it till January. I\u2019ve always found write-ins to be good. Unfortunately here in the arse-end of Wales us writers are not thick enough on the ground for that to work too well. But if you can get to one, try it out. Basically, try things out and see what works for you, then do it some more. ",
