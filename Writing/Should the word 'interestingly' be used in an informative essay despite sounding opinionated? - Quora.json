I\u2019m trying to think of a good reason to use \"interestingly\" in an informative essay, and I can\u2019t think of anything that wouldn\u2019t be better re-worded. If you\u2019re going for something along the lines of, \u2018interestingly though,\u2019 in order to \u2018inform\u2019 a reader about something, then do avoid it. That\u2019s known as throat clearing. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no real reason to ever use it, tho\u2014just \u2019cause i can\u2019t think of a reason to. ",

You had to do research, you found an interesting fact, you want to share it. \u2018interestingly\u2019, to me, sounds as if you enjoyed your research and that you also learned something. Makes you sound human. ",
