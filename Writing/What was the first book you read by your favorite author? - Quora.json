            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really have a Favourite Author! I have read many Books across the years. However in April of 1979 all this was to change due to some type of \u201cMental Trauma\u201d and so did my reading, more or less. I should stress at this point that this only really applied to Works of Fiction and not those of Non Fiction. During the many years I was able to read, in particular I had favoured the Writings of Arthur C Clarke who Wrote Science Fantasy Novels which could be based on Scientific Truths. Books such as 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, DEEP RANGE and A FALL OF MOONDUST I read while still attending College and then of course there were other Books such as Muriel Sparks THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE and E. A. Poe\u2019s TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION. I also read DRACULA by Bram Stoker, whom incidentally also wrote THE JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS. A Tale about the Discovery of the Lost Tomb of an Ancient Egyptian Princess who was also something of a Darke Sorceress. When her lid of her Sarcophagus was raised and her Inner Coffin opened, her body was found to be perfectly preserved as though she had only died hours earlier except for one curious point. Her left hand had been severed at the wrist and was still slowly oozing blood; her hand however was nowhere to be seen! The Princess whom was very beautiful also appeared to be in a state of suspended animation. During the 1970\u2019s Stoker\u2019s Book was turned into a Movie as part of a \u201cHammer Films Production\u201d THE JEWEL OF THE SEVEN STARS. Another Author whom comes to mind was also one of the Fantasy Fiction genre and he is Thomas Burnett Swan. The first of his Books THE DAY OF THE MINOTAUR I read when I was aged about 14. The setting for this wonderful Tale is Ancient Crete and concerns a Brother and Sister who\u2019s Names I forget but I do know that they were gifted in some special way. Their Story is related by the Discovery of an Ancient Scroll and Ring which were Lost and Hidden away in a Cave for many Centuries. If I had to make an educated guess as opposed to remembering precisely, this would be that both Sister and Brother were of the Elven Race whom co-existed alongside the Human population of their Time. What is interesting is the fact that several known Locations on the Island of Crete are alluded to. \u00a7 Lucie Lou Snowfall \u00a7 / 2019.  ",

            "answer_text": "I have a few \u2018favorite\u2019 authors, so bear with me. Ken Kesey wrote One Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest. I love that book, to the point I refuse to watch the movie, even though I am a big Jack Nicholson fan. That was the first book I read by Kesey. When I read Sometimes a Great Notion, also by Kesey, I realized I had found the Great American Novel all my English teachers had been searching for. For years I thought my favorite Science Fiction book was The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein. The first book by him I ever read was Have Spacesuit Will Travel. Then I read Heavy Time by C J Cherryh and now I\u2019m not sure which is my favorite. The first Cherryh book I read was The Pride of Chanur. My favorite biography is Truman by David McCullough. The first book of his I read was The Johnstown Flood. History: The Coldest Winter by David Halberstam. The first book of his I read was The Best and the Brightest. His book The Fifties was also a revelation. Mystery: The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett. The first book of his I read was Red Harvest. I guess I\u2019d better stop. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be disappointed with anything you find by any of these authors. I could write you lists of my second and third favorite authors, too. Enjoy! ",
