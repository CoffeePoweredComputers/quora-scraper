            "answer_text": "Every year, I have a few students with interesting names. The ones I find most interesting are the students named after anime characters. Every couple of years I have an Atom (\u30a2\u30c8\u30e0) or a Leo (\u30ec\u30aa), the first named after the character that Americans know as Astro Boy, and the latter named after the character a few older Americans remember as Kimba the White Lion (which Disney shamelessly ripped off for The Lion King). I always wonder why their parents chose those names for their kids.  Mighty Atom  Jungle Emperor Leo I haven\u2019t really encountered more recent ones in my classes, but of course many students have names that match those of anime characters who have more usual Japanese names. But I can\u2019t say whether their parents were influenced by anime in choosing those names. ",

            "answer_text": "Some Japanese celebrities have unique names in my opinion. Offhand, I can think of Kanjiya Shihori (\u8cab\u5730\u8c37\u3057\u307b\u308a) [1] and Arata Mackenyu (\u65b0\u7530 \u771f\u5263\u4f51)[2]. I recalled on a talk show, Kanjiya Shihori mentioned that her family name (Kanjiya) is so rare, there's only a few families with the same family name. And Mackenyu just sounds strange to me. I initially thought it was a western name written in katakana so I was surprised to find out it actually has kanji for it. Footnotes[1] Shihori Kanjiya - Wikipedia[2] Mackenyu - Wikipedia",
