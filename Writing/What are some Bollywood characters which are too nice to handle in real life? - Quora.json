            "answer_text": "Some Bollywood characters are taken from real life and many of the on-screen characters are fine works of imagination. But many of them is that we would actually bump into? Nobody is perfect but some Bollywood characters were so much beyond perfection that we secretly wished they would be humans. 1 - Vivek in Hum Saath Saath Hain If there has been a beta that every Indian mother would pray for, it\u2019s Vivek from \u201cHum Saath Saath Hain\u201d.   2 - Arohi in Ashiqui 2 Though every guy would secretly wish for a girlfriend like Arohi in Ashiqui 2, who accepts their flaws even if it means dying in the pool of alcohol, but in reality, nobody has that sort of tolerance.   3 - Vanraj in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam Love is really blind and love only seeks the happiness of the other. You can see a glimpse of this ethereal love when Ajay Devgn (Vanraj) takes a pledge to unite Nandini with her love, Sameer.   4 - Rawal Ratan Singh in Padmaavat  Even Khilji was amazed at Rawal Ratan Singh\u2019s goodness and so are we.  5 - Raju in Bandhan Do you remember the Salman as the most obedient and affectionate brother in law in the world? The character of Salman as Raju was one from a utopian world where someone\u2019s loyalty towards his sister\u2019s husband surpasses real life.   6 - Poonam in Vivah The extent of insult and hatred that Poonam (Amrita Rao) faces due to her Chachi would make anyone weep for her. At her wedding, Poonam chooses to put her cousin first and rest is all history.   7 - Raju in Beta A dream son Raju in Beta, another son that every Indian mother would secretly hope for. The love and trust endowed in his mother surpass all, even his newlywed wife (Madhuri Dixit), to the extent of being exploited in the hands of his own mother.   8 - Mastani in Bajirao Mastani  The love and dedication to her beloved, embedded in the character of Mastani. She endures all the insults, lewd judgments, and a number of attacks and tells her son to be exactly like her father once she is a captive. ",
