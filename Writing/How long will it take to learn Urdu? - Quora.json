            "answer_text": "It all depends on how much time you can spare daily and wether you want only spoken Urdu or the written language. Spoken Urdu is pretty easy to catch up. Maybe 2 to 3 months. There are a couple of online tutorials which help you learn on the go.  For writing Urdu, Karnataka Urdu Academy located next to town hall in Bangalore conducts regular free classes for working class people. You can check with them atwww.karnatakaurduacademy.org ",
