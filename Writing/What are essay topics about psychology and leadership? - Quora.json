I'll give you short advice, but don't forget you always can use special services that would help a lot (this one for example https://123writings.com/homework-help/computer-science). So, from my research I've found next interesting topics: - what are personal characteristics for a real leader; - new approaches to defining a leader; - contemporary methods of a psychology of leadership; - how to detect positive and negative consequences of leaders and followers interactions. I guess it would be enough and topic I've proposed will definitely come in handy. Hit me up if you need more of them. Good luck. ",
