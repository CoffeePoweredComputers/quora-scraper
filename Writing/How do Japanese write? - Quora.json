            "answer_text": "I'm writing this late at night\u2026 so I'll make it concise. There are three scripts used by japanese in their writing. The first one is hiragana. It has around 40 characters with a different diction for each.  The second is katakana. It has a similar diction to the corresponding hiragana and had the same no. of alphabets but it is mainly used for foreign words or names.  The final and most difficult yet common script is kanji. It is complex characters derived from Chinese where each of them represent an abstract meaning or object. The worst part is there are over 2000 characters and you have to memorize it in various ways as a single kanji character joined with another kanji can be read in different ways depending on the context and sentence. The picture below shows some of them.  The japanese use all three together without spaces. Kanji is necessary as it acts as a visual cue to enable fast reading much like how we understand a word just by the starting and ending letter while reading English. All in all, except for kanji everything else is quite logical.
