            "answer_text": "Someone anonymous's answer to How can I write a letter? has covered the professional letters you might want to write very well. What if you want to write a personal letter to someone that they can hold and cherish as something meaningful from you? I have saved every letter that people have written in their own hand and sent to me.  One of my friends still sends me handwritten letters. It is okay if you do not know how to write cursive, which apparently isn't being taught anymore in US schools. In the upper left corner of the writing paper, he puts the city from which he is writing (he has traveled a lot) and the date. This is a great practice for historical purposes when you look over the detritus of your life later on.  Sometimes he will include a simple line drawing that is relevant to where he's at, either physically or mentally. It's okay if you're not as talented as this guy. He doesn't think he's talented -- he is just doing what he likes to do. That's what you should do, too.  If you don't have \"talent\" you can always go to the craft store and find tons of fun stickers or rubber stamps to decorate your paper in a way that reflects your personality and mood. You can even find paper-making kits at craft stores and make your own stationary out of your junk mail and write your letters on that. You'll have to experiment with writing tools on the recycled paper, though, as it can be very porous and some ink will bleed like crazy. Some people like to add scents to their papers. Don't do this unless you know the person likes it. Scents make some sensitive people ill. The mail handlers might not appreciate them, either. I have cold-written my letters without drafting anything first. It keeps things fresh and real, but if you're not comfortable with that, make a draft and then copy it onto your nice paper. Whenever I screw up, I just black out the words and keep going. I don't use pencil to write letters because the graphite rubs off and fades with time.  For subject matter, I try to stick to an overview of what has happened in my life since the friend last saw me and not get into too may details if I haven't seen or written to the friend in a long time. I try to refer to a memory as a touchstone for our friendship. Thanks for your A2A. Letter writing to friends is a great habit to cultivate. ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of letter do you want to write? What\u2019s the purpose, and who is your reader? Writing a letter demands the same thinking process as everything else you write for your work. Define your goal, then closely consider the person or group you want to communicate with. Every letter\u2014like every e-mail or speech or resume or blog or performance review\u2014is an \u201cask.\u201d Think: What result do I want? And why should the reader give that to me? That requires you to take the other person\u2019s viewpoint and see the request through their eyes. If it\u2019s someone you know, you already own a lot of information about what motivates them, their priorities, values and hot buttons. Draw on your intuition, which is based on experience. If you\u2019re writing to a stranger, make an educated guess based on their position and role. A CFO, for example, cares about different things than the head of IT or HR or PR does. Once you define goal and audience, it\u2019s easy to figure out your best content to win the \u201cask.\u201d Make a list, shuffle it into a logical order. Then write a draft, usually starting with the reason you\u2019re writing, followed by the most important point that connects what you want with your audience. Proceed to your other points and say just enough to answer the question: Why should the reader agree? Would I? Then review your content\u2014too much? Too little? Anything missing? And edit your language so it is simple and clear. End politely and circle back to repeat what you want, or the next step. As far as good formatting goes, there\u2019s a ton of examples online that show you how to arrange a formal letter. Important to remember: These days, a letter does not necessarily mean a message delivered by the post office. When you write an e-mail that matters to you a lot, and/or it\u2019s critical that you be perceived as capable and professional, think of it as a letter. For example, an e-mail introducing your resume for a job application, or presenting a proposal, is a letter! A response to a customer compaint is a letter! So is a networking message that asks for a favor of any kind, These messages and many more demand your best thinking and writing skills. A careless cover letter will probably cut you out of the running. A sloppy inconsiderate e-mail loses you a customer\u2014or maybe hundreds of them\u2014or an important opportunity. I receive a number of \u201chow do I write\u201d requests via Quora, and am amazed at how many of them say \u201chow do I write a letter to ask\u2026\u201d Obviously, contrary to popular assumption, the digital revolution has not killed letters. They adapt and survive. And it's interesting that a physical letter-writing revival may be under way because unlike digital media, we can control distribution so much better. It\u2019s a million times more likely to find your e-mail or tweet or social media message amusing or angering people all over the world. Letters are private, unless you have really bad luck with the person youre writing to. And of course a letter is a much more personal way to communicate. Smart businesspeople use letters to promote relationships and be remembered. ",

            "answer_text": "Addison Hughes 123 ABC Street Greencastle, IN 99999 3/1/2018 Quora Reader WWW Quora Blvd Quora, USA 17623 Dear Quora Reader, So you want to write a formal letter? Good for you! This Guide will help you to construct a logical, well-built letter. There are six main parts to the letter. After I have finished the letter, I will put a template for reference at the bottom. The first main part of the letter is a block of text stating your name, address, and the date the letter was sent. This is important especially if you are expecting a response sooner rather than later! The second part is a similar block of text naming the person you are sending the letter to and their address. While not necessary, this part makes it all look more professional, so I would urge you to do that. The third part is the salutation, a formal greeting to your reader. In a standard letter, it is the \u201cDear ______\u201d section. The fourth part is the body. This is the part that contains most of the information contained in the letter. In this sample letter, the last three paragraphs of text from \u201cso\u201d until now is the body. Another optional part is the last paragraph. In this paragraph, you will simply end your letter on a good note, which can really help to make a good impression. This is the last part of the letter before the sign off, where you just leave a short kind note, followed by a reiteration of your name. Hopefully with this sample and the template at the bottom of this answer, you will be well on your way to writing a good letter! Happy writing!

However\u2014 If you\u2019re writing an email at work, you can bend the principles. The most important thing to remember in writing an email (or anything) is the audience.

            "answer_text": "Chimpanzees are quite adept at writing letters with their feet as well as their hands, though they are not always sure what to put in them. Thus, it depends who you are writing the letter to. Generally speaking, you write your name and address in the top right hand corner and the recipient\u2019s name and address in the top left hand corner, though if you are posting the letter in an envelope, the window is normally low down so you might need to position the recipient\u2019s details lower than your own, otherwise the postman wont be able to see it. A way round this is to fold the paper appropriately, unless of course you are using a large envelope Letters normally begin with dear Sir or dear Madam, and will consequently end with Yours faithfully, but if you specify the person\u2019s name, you end the letter with Yours sincerely. As Johan Vanderjagt has correctly pointed out, it is easier to write a letter by using a pen or a pencil held in your dominant hand. This also applies to people who live in the UK and the USA, though if you are younger than say 6, this might be difficult as they may not yet have mastered the necessary skills. People often use computers when writing letters and they do this by hitting keys on a keyboard, or a keypad if they\u2019re using a smart phone or tablet. Some people are quite good at using their fingers and thumbs, though I personally can only use the long finger of my left hand for some strange reason, but it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. ",

I\u2019ll go with formal. I would begin writing with the address of myself with \u201cFrom,\u201d in beginning and after my name,address and other necessary details. I would leave a line in between and go for another line with right alignment for the receiver\u2019s address by starting with \u201cTo,\u201d. After that, we\u2019ll write subject in center alignment, we\u2019ll go with writing the letter. To make it paragraph, leave space of two lines before you begin.

Now we\u2019ll go to last paragraph in which we\u2019ll write that if we need/request/process our stuff in urgency, or whatever formally you could write.

I hope you\u2019re busy with your girlfriend and you haven\u2019t forgetten me after you\u2019ve settled down on Mars.\u201d Note :- I\u2019m not any expert but I just write random stuffs on my blogs whenever in mood, haha.

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on if it\u2019s a business letter, a complaint letter, a debate letter, or one to a close friend or relative - and even within those parameters your attitude would be different toward every person you write to. In anything but letters to friends and family, you\u2019d probably include their address and a formal or loosely formal address above the salutation. Okay. Family and friend letters don\u2019t necessarily need those elements, but the date and a salutation that\u2019s meaningful between the two of you: Hi Mom; Hey Dude; What\u2019s going on, buddy? - as I say, personal, intimate, etc. Next, in the more formal letter, keep it pretty darn formal, depending on the nature of your topic. You might get a little humorous, if it\u2019s pertinent, or miffed, angry, elated, whatever you want to convey. It can be staunchly business, straight-laced, or even light-hearted. Any kind of letter: it all depends. Too many variables to nail down. Once finished, follow similar suggestions. Sign off with your full and formal name for straight-laced business, then first names, nicknames, secret names, and so on for an totally informal sign-off. Letters and their rules are a wide, wide range of this and that. Go by how you want to present yourself to the receiver - dead serious or satirical or loving or - okay, you probably get my drift. Happy letter writing. Be happy. ",

Avoid beating around the bush - and excess verbiage. There\u2019s no need to be overly formal in business letters - one can be both polite and informal at the same time. Before starting on your letter, it might be a good idea to have a checklist of points you want to cover in your missive. ",

Some of them are rather quaint, written and published decades if not centuries ago, but they can usually be brushed up a bit and at least they may give you a few ideas. They were very popular in earlier times and people like Samuel Richardson grew rich on them. He was the author of the rightly scandalous \u201cClarissa\u201d, which told of the downfall of a decent young woman a the hands of a rake named Lovelace. (\u201cClarissa\u201d is what is known as an epistolary novel, BTW.) Modern equivalents, if there are such things, are unlikely to to offer hints on seduction or worse! Alternatively, there might be some evening classes you could attend, or you could even look around for a private tutor. Practice make perfect too, you know. ",

If you ARE referring to writing business letters, there are a lot of books available that will give you good advice.

Business letters nowadays are very short and to the point and very specific. ",
