            "answer_text": "I have very little direct experience of the top journals, and what little I have is from long ago. We are talking about 80\u201390% rejection rates. In the normal course of events, your paper will be dealt with by an associate editor. This may lead to a \u201cdesk\u201d rejection, because even without sending it out to review, they can see either obvious scientific flaws or, more likely, they think the paper is just not interesting enough to sully the pages of their journal. At this stage, perfectly reliable science may be kicked out. Typically, those that survive this scrutiny will be sent to at least three reviewers, sometimes more. My impression is that just one adverse review will be reason enough to reject. The editors are basically trying to winnow out a vast excess of submissions over what can be accepted in a fairly mechanical way. They may miss some gems, but they will still have enough good stuff to publish. By contrast, the journals for which I am an author, reviewer and associate editor usually send to two reviewers. The editor will pay attention to reviewer\u2019s comments, and may tell an author to disregard some comments., If you get an egregiously offensive review, you can argue back with some chance of success if you have a good case. A noble editor may take the time to contact you if there are obvious mistakes before they send it out for review, and they may help linguistically (but do not count on it). You are likely to get constructive feedback, even if the paper is rejected. Desk rejections are rare, and you are more likely to get an opportunity to revise in the light of criticism. This situation arises because of the devotion of bosses and pen-pushers to metrics, and in particular to the Citation index of the journal in determining contracts, tenure and promotion. Hence most feel obliged to submit to a high ranking journal, even when the a priori chance of success is 10% or less. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost all scientific journals use peer review, in which a manuscript is sent to supposedly objective researchers in the same field for evaluation. Typically, a journal editorial board is organized with one or more main editors and a stable of associate editors who handle the review of the manuscripts. The manuscript is evaluated by the associate editor for suitability for the journal and usually the manuscript passes this hurdle and is sent out for review. Several reviewers read the manuscript and offer their opinions on whether the science is sound and what, if any, improvements are needed. The manuscript can be rejected (not worth publishing) at this stage because of bad reviews. The percentage of rejection depends on journal with top journals rejecting a high percentage of submissions and lesser impact journals being more accommodating to revisions. The top journals simply can\u2019t publish all of the submitted manuscripts and if they are a high impact journal, they are looking for papers with \u201csizzle\u201d that will be high impact papers.
