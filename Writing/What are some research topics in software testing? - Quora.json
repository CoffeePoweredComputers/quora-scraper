            "answer_text": "From ICSE \u201817\u2019s program, it\u2019s possible to see that some of the research topics in software testing are: - Mutation testing (when the system is changed to check whether the tests would detect the mutation) - Metamorphic testing (when the \u201coracle\u201d or expected correct behaviour is not known a priori but some relations of the inputs and the expected outputs are known) - Automated testing techniques (automated test execution, automated test generation, automated prioritization, \u2026) - Within the area of automated test generation there are issues related to coverage, randomness, sampling, etc.. - Testing in the presence of variability (e.g. multiple configuration options) - Testing in the industry (large scale, dealing with continuous integration). And many more! If you are starting, you can check the program of different software engineering conferences (Software Engineering Conferences (Statistics)). This will illustrate some of the open questions current researches are addressing, or from industrial papers, some of challenges the industry faces. You may also find senior researchers near you. ",
