            "answer_text": "I recently happened to read the girl in the room no 105 to check and see if Mr Bhagats books ( his writing) have at least marginally improved in quality at all\u2026\u2026no surprises as usual \u2026Mr lovable authors books need to be unloved now ! Sub standard writing with cuss words and expletives in Hindi don't make anyone a lovable writer or an adorable author. Literary merit is a far fetched idea for Mr lovable. If One Indian girl was pathetic in the way it treated the protagonist the latest one is least convincing but seems ok in bits and pieces. In my view there's usually a below par love or infatuation angle peppered with abuses and a very pedestrian view of our culture or cultural differences which has never had me in splits\u2026to be honest I think CB needs to stop writing college romances and invest his time in unraveling slightly better topics which can evince more interest in the readers still keeping his Mr lovable author tag intact ! As soon as you start flipping the pages you easily can guess the plot because they are no brainers and I am highly amused when he treats teenagers or college students as only pleasure seeking impulsive dimwits\u2026..there are no details to know or explore further and discussion if at all will happen for not more than 15 minutes\u2026..I just read that trash whose name I can't recollect is what my friend remarked ! I am not taking a moral high ground here but we expect much better stuff from.CB. There are many who write strictly romance and that's their genre but it's not replete with abuses and perpetuating the notion that females are meant to be objects of desire alone and just shed their inhibitions at the drop of a hat. Many writings entertain but not titillate throughout\u2026\u2026no one is asking for a history manual or preachy self help journals but a very ordinary infatuation plot along with expletives in vernacular and mention of porn might not be palatable to many and is certainly no where near a damn well written book. I would well join a readers don't digest club to sift out books like these from.more meaningful ones. ",
