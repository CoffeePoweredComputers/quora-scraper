            "answer_text": "Hell yea it is. There\u2019s nothing about poetry that isn\u2019t creative. In fact, I would venture to say that poetry is THE creative writing format. Each person writes poetry differently, even if they\u2019re imitating a style. Poetry doesn\u2019t just incorporate words and story structure like short stories do, poetry can bring emotions and smart usage of analogies to the table. It\u2019s brilliant and beautiful because it\u2019s from the heart, even when it\u2019s based off of a prompt given by a teacher or something. That\u2019s my two cents\u2026 ",
