So let me give few examples\u2026This may not be the best but impromptu this what comes to my mind now... :As I leaf through the pages of my childhood, I find few lines written about my crazy infatuation.... : Once upon a time there lived a man who was in his late 30s\u2026every day he took the same route back home from his office.That evening was not the usual one... It was raining cats and dogs and the gentleman slowly drove down the lane enjoying the radio.Suddenly, he was stopped by three men covered from top to bottom... They pulled him out of his seat and rest what happened is history... The gentleman is now in his 40s and he is standing right in front of you..... These examples may not be the best as it came impromptu... Make the start with a pull Create suspense Pull your audience with your modulation and eye contact Keep unfolding the secrets slowly and with brilliance Never use fancy English and be very simple.. A good speaker always looks at simplicity .. I can go on and on ",
