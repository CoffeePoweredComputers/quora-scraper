            "answer_text": "Sit down and write it. If you\u2019re a planner, outline the story, then write it. If you\u2019re not that together, just start writing. You\u2019ve read books (I hope, if you are an aspiring writer); you know what you like. One of two things will happen: Either you\u2019ll write a few pages, or a few chapters, and realize you don\u2019t love writing for its own sake, or You\u2019ll finish your first novel. Once again, one of two things will happen. You\u2019ll read it over (after a month or so) and say, \u201cWow, this is bad. I wonder how I can fix it\u2026\u201d You might have a friend with good literary taste read it to check for problems. Don\u2019t be thin-skinned when he/she tells you what they are. Think about any criticism you get and try to figure out if it\u2019s right. Or else you\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m never doing this again.\u201d You can also ease into writing by starting with a short story or two before you leap into writing your first novel. Be advised: everyone\u2019s first novel is bad. (What, everyone\u2019s? Well, almost everyone\u2019s. The chances are you will not be one of the very few whose first novel is great. ). The thing is, you get better with practice\u2026unless you don\u2019t. You will not earn a million dollars from writing. Probably. Some, probably a lot, of the criticism your writing will receive is deserved. Learn how to fix the problems. Keep writing if you love it. If you don\u2019t, take up something you do love doing. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello dear Greg Scott With all my heart, I hope that you will become a famous writer, and that your writing will be in goodness, because evil has multiplied and has become everywhere and turned our lives into hell. Yes my friend Greg Scott I hope that you do so and write to the people a beautiful story or novel that restores to the people the hope that the world is still fine and that there are good and kind people who wish good for all. Because all that we read or see in movies is glorification of the bad guys, killers and thugs of criminal gangs and we see them as the hero who does what he wants and the police cannot stop them because they are stronger than the police We are bored when we see corrupt officers who don't care about the death of women and children because these criminal gangs give them money to do their pernicious work. Well my friend Greg Scott When you go to a job, you wear your most beautiful clothes and speak wonderfully. Likewise, when you go to your girlfriend\u2019s family\u2019s house to ask for marriage in order to make a great impression on them, you must do so with your first book to be successful. I wish you my friend and that your book is translated into Arabic so that I can read it With all my heart, I wish you success ",

            "answer_text": "In my case, I started with a photo of when I was eight. And I never liked it. I probably would have burned it but my then girlfriend (now wife), told me not to. One photo was the inspiration to two books. Inspiration comes from all around and most times when you least expect it. My third book is very different. It's historical. That means I've spent almost five years in research and collection. It spans over 70 years. The inspiration is there but not all the facts I require. Be open and embrace the work and grind that it's going to take. Writing ain't an easy job. ",

Don\u2019t write five or ten pages or your first chapter\u2026and then go back and read them and decide you have to make changes. You don\u2019t not yet. Because that means you\u2019ll end up doing it again. Any writer will tell you that you have to write every single day, and some days it might be good, others not so good, but you need to have a fair amount of days behind you to understand what your work looks like.

I didn\u2019t do research. Grab the reader by the throat with the first word (no, no; don\u2019t do that. That\u2019s what made me not read Delirium). Get the grip of the way stories flow. Grab a book and read. Don\u2019t be lazy; don\u2019t be crazy. Just research\u2026 Oh, did you think I was going to say write? No. That\u2019s why there are so many horribly written books in the world. Just research. And research, and research, and research. For a day. Then, next day, if at all you\u2019ve felt like the research was enough, STOP and get to work. It\u2019s pretty simple. ",
