            "answer_text": "I write all the time, but until I read your question, it never occurred to me that there was such a thing as a journal app. In journaling, I am an advocate of writing long-hand because it adds a personal touch that programs and apps can\u2019t. Despite that, I recognize that in today\u2019s society this is not a popular suggestion, so here is my take: Forget the app. Apps tend to be limited. Use a full-featured word processor. There is nothing I can see that a journaling app does that you can\u2019t do in Word or InDesign. They will automatically date your entry, add any personalization you can come up with, and they are everywhere. Also, you likely already have one of them or an equivalent. InDesign is harder to learn, but has more options. Also, it is less likely to completely re-format your work because you made a mistake. Microsoft Word, on the other hand is a good flexible choice that you can find everywhere. Word is also available as an app, making your journal accessible to any device, especially if you keep it in the cloud (password protected, of course). I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Not a fan of Apps for a journal. In my opinion, the best way to journal is to buy a notebook that speaks to you. Write with pen or pencil. In doing so, you're disconnecting from \u201cthe world\" via the computer/phone. The connection with the pen/pencil to paper is a feeling of release. The intimacy of the action opens you to better journaling. ",
