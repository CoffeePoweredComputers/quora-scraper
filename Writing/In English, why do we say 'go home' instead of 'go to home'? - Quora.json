            "answer_text": "In English, why do we say \"go home\" instead of \"go to home\"? To understand why, is to know the difference between the two nouns \u2014 house and home. A house is a physical building with an address one can go to. There is no misunderstanding where it is. Home is a state of mind \u2014 a feeling. One can live in a house for decades, but if there is no comfort or love there, it's not home. Home is different for everyone and varying in context. It can be our house, town, state, country, or planet. It can be where one was born, primarily raised, where one's family is, where one enjoys working, a central location, \"happy place\" (frame of mind), or as the song goes, \"wherever I hang my hat.\" Home is different for everyone and can change on a whim, because everyone has a different concept of home. Often when one is told to \"Go home,\" it doesn't even mean to go to one's house, it\u2019s just a directive to leave or leave alone. If one were to put an article in front of \"home\" to try to pinpoint it, that would be a reference to a specific institution, such as, a mental health facility, orphanage, or retirement care facility. Few elderly parents would like to hear, \"It's time to take Mom and Dad to a home.\" In baseball, home plate is both a physical location and goal, which is often just called home for short. During the game you might hear someone say either, \"throw to home\" or \"throw home,\" while you'll never hear someone say, \"throw to 2nd (base) or \"slide into 2nd,\" without a preposition. Though \"run home\" or \"throw home,\" could just be carryover from its use outside of baseball. Therefore, \"home\" can\u2019t follow the same construct as other physical locations. ",

            "answer_text": "In English, why do we say \"go home\" instead of \"go to home\"? I see it as quite an exception. I go to school, go to work, go to hospital, but go home not \"go to home\". What is so unique about \"home\"? In English, the word \"home\" can be both a noun and an adverb of place* (or location). In this example it is being used as an adverb of place, so it does not need the preposition \"to.\" Note: By mentally adding the suffix \"-ward\" to the word, you can see how it operates as an adverb, not a noun: e.g., \"I'm going home(ward).\" \u201cThe wind is blowing south(ward).\u201d Note that this is not a rule, but just a way of looking at it. * Adverbs of Place: \"Go home\" NOT \"Go to home\"http://www.englishcurrent.com/grammar/go-home-adverb-no-preposition/ With adverbs of place, we don\u2019t need the preposition (to/from/at/in, etc). We do not use prepositions before nouns when they are used as adverbs.\"Home\" can be either a noun or an adverb, as in the following examples. 1) I want to buy a home. Here, home is a noun. It is the object of the verb (buy). It is a noun just like house, dog, or car. 2) The man went home. Here, home is used as an adverb of place. Adverbs of place tell you where an action happened, happens, or will happen. For example, \u201cI jumped up. / The wind blows south. / The girl will turn around.\u201d Up/south/around tell you where you jumped, where the wind blows, and where the girl turned. ",
