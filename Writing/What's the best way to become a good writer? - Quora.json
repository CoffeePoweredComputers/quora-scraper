            "answer_text": "Obviously, there are the mechanics. As someone already posted, writers hate to see errors. This also brings up a solid truth about writing: you won\u2019t see your errors. The creative process is separated from the editing process (right brain/left brain) so don\u2019t try to edit while you write, but also have someone who can edit your papers. They don\u2019t need to do anything but circle areas that don\u2019t flow or catch them up for some reason. But learn to proofread and edit your work. Great writing comes out of editing, not first drafts. Get experiences. I know this sounds trite, and I\u2019m sorry for that. I\u2019ve been trying to write since I was 18 or 19 years old, and have never been able to stick with it each day. Now, at 49, I have a lot of experiences to draw on and have tons of adventures I can use in my writing. I\u2019m not saying you need to wait until later in life. I\u2019m somewhat introverted, so it took me time. Get out and experience what you want to write about. I have a good friend, who has written several books now, tell me how he bought a particular type of gun. A CZ75. It doesn\u2019t matter what type of gun, but the reason he purchased it is his main character uses this gun as his weapon of choice. The author, my friend, has never shot one before. So he can\u2019t describe the gun first hand. His experience will change that, and I know the next book will have a good section about the experience of handling and shooting a CZ75. And the last suggestion is one you probably already know. Write every single day. The only way you get good at anything is with focused practice. So you need to practice a lot and give yourself a lot of time. What have you done and become great at quickly? Good luck, and you will find that other writers are your best friends. ",

            "answer_text": "The path between a new writer and a good one looks nothing like an arrow; the maze forces all pen holders to retrace their steps from time to time. Let\u2019s think in terms of a point system. Say that a good writer has 100 writing points, and a beginning writer has 0 (most beginners would have at least a few points, but let\u2019s not ignore those at the back of the class; they may have the best view of the chalkboard). Those who have 0 points should not ask, \u201cWhat one thing can I do to gain 100 points?\u201d They should instead ask, \u201cWhat one hundred things can I do to gain 1 point each?\u201d Even without knowing the answer, their pondering that question will imitate the mindset of good writers. Writing has endless facets, all of which perhaps no one person could master. Now let\u2019s say that great writers have 200 writing points. Good writers who have 100 points now understand that they should ask, \u201cWhat ten big things can I do to gain 10 points each?\u201d And they may know the answer; they have done perhaps all of those things already, and they would now need only redo them. And redo. And redo. In this very imperfect points system, if you get ten times better at one thing, you\u2019ve gained 10 points. Below is a Lucky 7 List of things you can do to earn many points each. With repetition, of course. (You good to great writers might find the List a nice refresher course, but you might also learn a new trick in thing number 6 that I first heard about from the linguist, Anne Curzan [she\u2019s awesome, and I highly recommend her books]. . . . Oh, but watch our for thing number 2; that salesman doesn\u2019t have a crooked bow tie.) Read books on writing. I recommend Mastering the Craft of Writing by Stephen Wilbers. Study that book until you know it inside out. But you should read all of the best books on writing while understanding that they each have some weaker advice in certain places. Do not take their words as dogma; take them as advice for experimentation. And don\u2019t decide on any rules for your own writing until neither your heart nor head have any doubt that you are a good writer with enough experience to understand the consequences of such rules.Get into the readers\u2019 minds to realize that unclear language takes many forms, then painstakingly clean yours (but don\u2019t be afraid to experiment and take risks). Strangers cannot know the way you think, so they have no shorthand for understanding you; your pen must force them to understand. Kindly. The way their hearts force blood to flow through their veins. And because the phrase \u201ckindly overselling\u201d rarely fits with reality, don\u2019t oversell your readers without straightening out your bow tie and putting on the charm. But mostly, don\u2019t oversell them. That means make every word count. Keep the word count of your every statement as low as you can because your readers\u2019 time counts for as much as anything can. And do not repeat yourself. I repeat, do not repeat yourself. Unless you do so for rhetorical beauty. And remember that you can repeat something new. Yes, brand new. By using a word or phrase differently this time. Or by making an extended metaphor, which simulates repetition with reminders of the base metaphor. Keep adding reminders that do more than remind. If you can add actual repetition to your extended metaphor, all the better. But in prose writing, try and keep the meaning apparent for most of the metaphors you create; with extraordinarily rare exceptions, all good prose writing has one thing in common: clarity, clarity, clarity.Know that you must rewrite most every sentence. To quote Robert Graves, \u201cThere is no such thing as good writing. Only good rewriting.\u201d Develop an eye for finding weaknesses in language. Do not be satisfied with a sentence you\u2019re crafting until it forces you to.Rework the whole of the story you\u2019re telling (and you\u2019re telling a story in any kind of writing) until each of its parts complements all others. Knowing where your story is going helps you prevent it from contradicting itself. Vigorously outline your book, or essay, or whatever. And know that outlining your work will do the opposite of harm its spontaneity; improvisation improves with awareness. But remember to break this rule once in a while at least.Use no adverb unless it changes the meaning of your statement. (Loosening the knot of this rule will indeed unbind your writing hand. But don\u2019t cut the rope and risk injuring the hand it\u2019s tied to.) When did you fail?\u201d vs \u201cWhen did you fail romantically?\u201d The adverb \u201cromantically\u201d limits the latter question. Fine tuning your language helps readers hear it; sometimes, opening it up can help them see your overarching themes. Learn to recognize the infrequent occasions on which you should expand the meaning of a statement. But generally speaking, the pen works as a metaphor for itself: The finer its point, the less ink it uses. Yet sometimes the sharp tip can poke the reader. Speaking of which, did you miss the weaknesses present in the example questions? Both \u201cWhen did you fail?\u201d and \u201cWhen did you fail romantically?\u201d assume that the reader has failed. That assumption will likely hold true in either case, as all of your readers will be the imperfect creatures known as human beings. But, man\u2019s imperfection often prevents him from seeing his own failings; readers might not appreciate your assuming their ever having failed. Also, your youngest readers may never have failed romantically. And so, both of those questions may go too small for your readers to see their relevance. \u201cHave you ever failed?\u201d and \u201cHave you ever failed romantically?\u201d would be less assumptive alternatives. Still, an assumptive question can work when you know exactly why it will. Writing questions is an artform; trial and error will teach you vastly more about asking them than instruction will. The best advice I can give on the subject is this ironic mantra: Before presenting them to anyone else, ask yourself questions about your questions. And pay special attention to modifying words; questions are particularly prone to rogue adverbs. Just remember to use your adverbs conscientiously. (What would removing the adverb do to that last sentence?) \u201cHe sprinted quickly.\u201d That sentence made me ill to write it; \u201csprint\u201d means to run at full speed, and \u201cquickly\u201d means with speed. The sentence says this: \u201cHe ran at full speed with speed.\u201d Yuck! If the sprinter has already been established as a slow moving person who is now running faster than his normal speed, a sentence like this would talk better: \u201cHe sprinted with feet faster than his own.\u201d As you may have noticed, that sentence contains no adverb. An interesting way to call the man slow might be a sentence like this: \u201cHe sprinted slowly.\u201d It arguably has an oxymoron in it, but an oxymoron can help the magician do his craft. Or it can suffocate the rabbit inside the hat. Remember, practicing will make the trick perfect. Our trick-sentence technically says this: \u201cHe ran at full speed slowly.\u201d I would advise against such a statement in most cases. But if, for example, your readers already know that the sprinter has a bad knee, I would say go for the magic. Take a risk. The strange wording might work peculiarly well if his bad knee had a sad story behind it. Now your readers might feel sympathy for the man. Especially if he were running scared from something similar to what caused his injury. Even under these circumstances, you might choose a more traditional way of calling the man slow. And you get to, writer, because you are the chooser of your own words. But whatever choices you make, don\u2019t make them lazily. Truly, your gut instinct can lead to brave choices, but using your reflexes requires alertness. So write vigorously. With all your wit. Don\u2019t expect your readers to give you all of their attention if you don\u2019t give them all of yours. And lastly, the foremost point herein thing number 5 can be summed up with the greatest three words from Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style: \u201cOmit needless words.\u201dLearn and use the \u201cknown-new contract,\u201d which is a method for choosing a good subject for a new sentence. (The advice for this answer will ignore compound and complex sentences, and so it is not an extensive exploration of the known-new contract.) The known-new contract (KNC) has three methods: constant, derived, and chained. Each of them helps your readers follow what you\u2019re saying. Every full sentence has a subject and a predicate. The subject is what the sentence is about; the predicate says something about the subject. \u201cThe cat jumped.\u201d \u201cThe cat\u201d is the subject, and \u201cjumped\u201d is the predicate. But let\u2019s say that sentence followed this one: \u201cThe taller building was built before the shorter one.\u201d . . . Why on earth would the other sentence follow that one? Cats do not jump because a bigger building was built before a shorter one. Here is where the logic behind the KNC steps in. The constant method of the KNC is when the subject of one sentence becomes the subject of the next. \u201cThe cat jumped.\u201d For that to work as a new sentence (not the first in a paragraph) in the constant method, the subject of the previous sentence must also have been \u201cThe cat.\u201d Take these two sentences: \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. The cat jumped.\u201d This sequence of sentences works for the constant method of the KNC because the side-by-side sentences have a common subject. A pronoun to replace \u201cthe cat\u201d in the second sentence would also have qualified as a constant-method subject\u2014and it would have sounded better. Remember also that reordering your words rarely switches subject and predicate. \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. Five feet in the air she went!\u201d \u201cShe\u201d remains the subject despite much of the predicate coming first. And personally, I find that the reordering in this case made for a fun sequence of sentences. But you don\u2019t need to go talking like Yoda all the time. A good idea that is not. The derived method of the KNC is when the subject of the new sentence is a subset of the previous one. \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. Her back arched.\u201d \u201cHer back\u201d is a subset of the cat because it is part of her. \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. Her claws unsheathed.\u201d The claws are a subset of the cat; the sequence qualifies as the derived method of the KNC. (There is a trick that makes a subset out of almost anything, but to avoid overloading you, I\u2019ll save that cheat code for a future answer.) And the chained method of the KNC is when the subject of the new sentence is taken from the predicate of the previous one. \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. The cucumber was green and bumpy.\u201d Part of the previous sentence\u2019s predicate, \u201cthe \u201ccucumber,\u201d became the next sentence\u2019s subject. \u201cThe cat saw the cucumber. The cucumber stood its ground.\u201d Again, the new sentence\u2019s subject, \u201cthe cucumber,\u201d came from the previous one\u2019s predicate. Readers can easily follow writing that skillfully uses any of these three methods\u2014without having to reread. As stated, the advice on the KNC herein is basic. Because you should learn the basics first. But one more important thing, you can use any of the three methods for any new sentence. For instance, you can use the chained method for a sentence that follows one that used derived or constant method. You can use any method in tandem with either of the others. In fact, you probably should not use only one method for a long paragraph\u2014particularly not with chained method; the paragraph could end too far from where it started. But once in many blue moons, you might want your paragraph to run a marathon. In these cases, I would say go for it as long as you know what you\u2019re going for.Before choosing a verb, figure out which of the three types of verbs it should be: active, passive, or stative. (Just as I did in thing number 6, I use the often inaccurate term \u201csubject of a sentence\u201d herein number 7; I believe that this entire answer is more accessible for its use of that quasi-misnomer.) An active verb occurs when the subject of a sentence is the agent (or \u201cdoer\u201d) of its verb (yes, active verbs constitute the \u201cactive voice,\u201d but as the idea of \u201cvoice\u201d disregards stative verbs, choosing to class verbs into \u201ctypes\u201d instead of \u201cvoices\u201d creates less confusion). \u201cJohn threw the ball.\u201d \u201cJohn\u201d is the subject. \u201cThrew\u201d is the verb. John, the subject, was the one who did the throwing. And so, the verb is active. A passive verb occurs when the subject of a sentence is the object of its verb. \u201cThe ball was thrown by John.\u201d \u201cThe ball\u201d is the subject. \u201cThrown\u201d is the verb. But the ball, the subject, did not do the throwing, so it is not the agent of the verb; it was the thing that was thrown, so it is the object of the verb. And so, the verb is passive. And a stative verb occurs when the verb is not an action verb, but a state of being verb\u2014or rather, a form of \u201cbe.\u201d \u201cJohn is tall.\u201d John, the subject, isn\u2019t doing anything. The sentence has no action verb; it has the state of being verb \u201cis.\u201d And so, the verb is stative. (However, if we made the \u201cis\u201d a helping verb, the verb could become active or stative. \u201cJohn is growing tall.\u201d The \u201cis\u201d in that sentence works only as a helper for \u201cgrowing.\u201d And so, the verb of the sentence\u2014technically a verb phrase\u2014is active. When two verbs are right next to each other, they sometimes function as one unit.) If not used well, a stative verb can make a sentence dull. In place of the example sentence with the stative verb, I would suggest a \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d alternative with an active verb\u2014something like this: \u201cJohn hit his head on the top of the doorway.\u201d (Such a sentence implies that John is clumsy as well as tall. The \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d rule often results in added meaning. Also, it reminds you to prove things to your readers rather than preach to them. For instance, instead of telling the readers that your character is tough, you have him get shot in the leg, yet not fall down.) But you can make a stative verb exciting by having it express a bigger idea. \u201cShe is my happiness. And that is an understatement.\u201d Neither of those two sentences (and you certainly can start a sentence with \u201cand\u201d) make a boring statement. \u201cShe is the murderer of her children.\u201d Such a state of being has automatic intrigue. Make your state of being verbs big when you can. Remember, mindfully choose every verb. That means choose what you want it to accomplish. And sometimes, verbs can\u2019t accomplish much without help from the words around them. Such can be the case with passive verbs, also. You might have heard not to use the passive voice, but passive verbs, which are the only ingredient in the passive voice, do very well in several situations. For instance, they often shine when you want to illustrate victimization. \u201cTara was punched in the eye by a man three times her size.\u201d \u201cTara,\u201d the subject didn\u2019t do the punching, but that\u2019s the point; she didn\u2019t do anything to deserve what happened to her. Only the most insensitive writer would insinuate otherwise. And the passive verb keeps the attention on Tara\u2014not her assailant. You would certainly keep Tara as the subject if the man who punched her was an unknown person whom you wouldn\u2019t talk about again. But under some sets of circumstances, having the assailant be the subject of the sentence could be a better choice. Whenever your sentence has a victim\u2014or anything resembling one\u2014you have to ask whether the victim or the perpetrator should be the focus. Whichever you think the immediate focus should be should also be the subject of the sentence\u2014in the majority of circumstances. But remember to write clearly\u2014at all times\u2014and understand that the passive voice, when used injudiciously, can harm the clarity of your language. Here\u2019s a quote by Bertrand Russell to remind you to never sacrifice clarity: \u201cClarity above all.\u201d Finally, active verbs work best for most sentences; you want action. People like people who do things. People sometimes like victims, but they always like victims who pick themselves off the ground and do something about their situations; active verbs add vigor to your storytelling. Your instinct should be to use an active verb. And your mindful considerations\u2014of which there could be one or several\u2014will either confirm or reject that instinct.Thank you for reading.
