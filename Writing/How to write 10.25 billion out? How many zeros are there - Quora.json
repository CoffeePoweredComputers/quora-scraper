            "answer_text": "Referring to Paul Goffin's answer to How do you write 10.25 billion out? How many zeros are there?, the UK version is also called \u201clong scale\u201d as opposed to \u201cshort scale\u201d for the US version, and it is still used in many other countries (and their languages). <joke>So in these countries, this is another reason why the anglo-saxon financial system seems to have such huge amounts of money involved - they are \u201cinflating\u201d their numbers by a factor of 1000 or even a million\u2026</joke> A more detailed explanation of the difference between the scales is that the long scale uses the suffix \u201c-iard\u201d for every number that can be written as 1000 of the corresponding \u201c-ion\u201d amount. E.g. 1000 millions = 1 milliard (1 billion on the short scale) and thus 1 million millions = 1 billion (1 trillion on the short scale). So, the other answers correctly mention the number of 8 zeroes on the short scale: 10.25 billion = 10,250,000,000 On the long scale, the answer would be 11 zeroes: 10,25 billions = 10 250 000 000 000 Now, a final twist: you probably already noticed that I wrote the numbers slightly differently, and also that I wrote \u201cbillions\u201d instead of \u201cbillion\u201d. The countries using the long scale also use different notation, with a comma as the unit indicator instead of a period, and usually adding a plural \u201cs\u201d. So we can actually infer which scale should be used from the way the number is written. Hence, since the question asks for the number of zeroes in \u201c10.25 billion\u201d and not \u201c10,25 billions\u201d, we can infer that the correct answer is indeed 8 zeroes and not 11, since the notation tells us that we should evaluate the value of the \u201cword expression\u201d for this number using the short scale.

            "answer_text": "Historically, there have been two 'billions'.  The US one, 10^9 and the UK one 10^12.  (The UK one was a \"million million\".) The UK gave up on this decades ago as the normal international finance usage was the US 10^9 one and \"billion\" is only really used in finance. (Though if you ask the question there's always some Smart Alec who asks \"is that a US billion or a UK one?\") For everything else, we use the SI prefixes Giga, Tera, etc. So 7 zeros as the others have said.
