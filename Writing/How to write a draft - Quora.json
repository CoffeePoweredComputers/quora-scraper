            "answer_text": "At high speed\u2014as fast as you can, with no regard for spelling, punctuation or grammar and little regard for wording, sentence structure and paragraphing. Don\u2019t let the urge to correct yourself interfere. This is a sprint and any way you can get to your final destination is fine. Your goal: get it all down on paper. Don\u2019t back up, don\u2019t hesitate, don\u2019t constantly correct yourself. Just write. Everything you can think of. Once you have your rough draft on paper, start fixing your mistakes and expanding your ideas. The result will be your first re-write. Now do it again. Re-write your first re-write. If you\u2019ve been industrious and honest with yourself, if yo haven\u2019t let perfectionist impulses sabotage you, you will be ready to start polishing. ",
