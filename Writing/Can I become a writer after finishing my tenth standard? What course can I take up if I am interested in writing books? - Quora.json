            "answer_text": "Here is my view dear, I never taken up any course to labelled as a professional writer. And belive me no great writer in the history has became a writer by completing some highly successful courses at Ivy league colleges. What makes you a successful writer? It's your artistic view towards the content which you want to put across as a writing that matters the most. In simple terms, first believe your instinct and the motive behind your writing. And in the earlier answers mentioned here they suggested about first completing your studies and going ahead with your writing career. With the personal experience that's the worst option, If you are really into writing venture into the world of writing by reading and writing a lot from now itself. See that's a good suggestion that your knowledge will improve with the studies and then you can go ahead with the writing career but, in that way there are lot of chances that your passion will be drained out with the responsibilities you will face ahead, if you are a middle or lower middle class person. So, as a person who experienced that life, I suggest that you keep a track of your writing along with your studies, don't post-pone it. And to be a professional writer you need experience, not that experience which comes through working for some renowned magazines or something like that but, which comes through experiencing the life, which eventually you'll get at certain age. Until then keep polishing your writing skills and increase your vocabulary and knowledge about the language in which you want to become a writer. Start writing from now, believe me I have started writing things from the age that I can write sentences, may be at 8 or 9. And by 10th class I was able to write pages of poetry on everything that excites me. ( In my mother tongue of course) and I always been the top at any essay writings. So, there is no age restriction for writing, start doing the thing which you love right now and don't wish for the sudden success. Remember when you know the worst then only you become the great. Finally : There is nothing like you can become a writer if and only if you take up the literature as your study. No, look around there are Engineers, scientists, musicians and lot more who spontaneously excelled at writing career so, it's your call you can become both a writer and something else that you want in parallel. Best wishes for your future!! ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can but I suggest you complete your 12th boards and then undergraduate studies. If you're really interested in writing books, you can even go on to do your Masters in English to gain more control over the language. Maybe even go for a PhD! And you can start your writing career right from the time you get some free time during your undergrad studies. As you study more, your language and writing will mature, and all in all, higher education always helps in any line of work. You've just completed your 10th boards, so chill with your friends and family. If you're already in writing, open up a blog and share your flair online. But don't pick a profession at this age. Complete your studies at least to the Bachelors degree level and then go for a full time career. Plus you haven't even enjoyed wild college days yet.. Don't you miss that! On a more serious note, if you think starting a career now will help you become financially independent, I suggest you start small with freelancing websites and go from there. As you grow as a freelancer, bid for bigger projects while still pursuing your education. Let me know if I can help :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi and thanks for the A2A. If you feel you are a strong writer at present, you can quit your current education. Remember, do this only if you\u2019re sure. You have actually posted this at a great time in your life- after class 10 comes the first crossroads in our education system- science, commerce or arts. I would recommend you take up any and every extra-curricular activity related to writing- blogging, technical writing, content writing, fiction writing, non-fiction writing, etc while taking up arts in school. You can be a brilliant student in all subjects or just literature, that is up to you (hint: an overall good score helps your chances in a better grad college). By the time your class 12 is done, you will have an established blog, and will have hopefully found your niche in writing. After the results, you can go for journalism if you feel that\u2019s your thing. Or you can do a B.A. followed by a M.A. in English Literature. Or you can explore tens of thousands of things that are present. I don\u2019t think you need those \u201ccourses\u201d like for a computer language or foreign language. After all, you are interested in writing. Good Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You certainly can. There are so many natural-born writers in this world who never went to college. Like Truman Capote, Mark Twain, HG Wells, Jack London, Charles Dickens. All the same, it makes a lot of sense to attend college and complete at least a master\u2019s degree in one of the following areas: Media, mass communication, film studies, English literature, public relations, etc. Also suggest that you do certificate courses in creative writing, photography, videography, film appreciation, Photoshop, etc. ",
