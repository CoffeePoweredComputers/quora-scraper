            "answer_text": "There are two ways to write the value represented by the English words \u201cOne Billion\u201d using decimal numeric notation Short billion is one thousand million: 1,000,000,000 Long billion is one million million: 1,000,000,000,000 Currently the default is the Short Billion which has a value of 1000 million The others in the series use the same multipliers Short = 1000 times the next smaller (Short) Trillion is one thousand billion Long = 1,000,000 times the next smaller Long Trillion is one million times one long billion US commonly uses the Short numbers so this form is also known as American UK commonly used the Long numbers so this form is also known as British When Long scale is wanted, the -ion ending can be changed to -ard to explicitly state long scale is being used million and milliard are both 10^9 billion and billiard are 10^12 and 10^15 respectively trillion and trilliard are 10^15 and 10^21 respectively When translating these words into numbers in old documents pay attention to the date written and dialect the writer spoke. Customary usage can and has changed many times. Whether the word ending in -ion means the long or short scale is dependent on the customary usage of the writer/speaker unless overridden by circumstance. Example: A Brit at a time when long was customary in UK addressing an American. The Brit is likely to choose to use short scale to avoid a misunderstanding \u2026 which can happen anyway if the American remembers that long is the British default . (Note: UK changed usage and short is now the British default) Long and short scales - Wikipedia ",

So I wrote a one and then added a space. Then I used a six for the letter bee. Then I used a one with a little zero over it for the letter i. Then two ones for the els. Another one with a zero for the i. Then a zero for the o. An finally, the hardest part, a one and a seven squished together like an en. There is some Latex formatting so that it all looks like the intended word. The final letter could be replaced with the Greek number eta.
