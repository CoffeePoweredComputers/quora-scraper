            "answer_text": "I'm going to give the same high-level answer I would give to the question of whether MBA programs are worthwhile: it depends.  It depends upon the program, and, perhaps more importantly, it depends upon you and what you're like.  (Before I get going, let me recommend Tom Kealey's blog and book for those who are seriously interested in an MFA: http://creative-writing-mfa-handbook.blogspot.com/).  \r  Essentially, the decision boils down to this: taking two to three years out of the traditional workforce entails an opportunity cost, so is what you get in return worthwhile?  And, very importantly (in my opinion), can you do this for free or close to free?  I don't think it makes sense to go into debt to attend an MFA program under any circumstances.  Whereas you have to get a medical degree to be a doctor, you do not have to get an MFA to be a writer.  And even though it's technically a \"terminal degree,\" it's not easy for someone with just an MFA to get a tenure-track professor job -- you need publications and/or a PhD (which are increasingly offered in this field) -- so it's not a ticket into a cushy career.  You would have better luck getting a faculty job if you lacked an MFA but wrote a couple of good books.\r  So the question is: can you do the things that an MFA might do for you on your own?  Some people can; some people can't (or don't feel like it).\r  Here are the categories that I think are relevant when considering whether an MFA is worthwhile:\r  Time to write/finding a community.  The biggest thing that an MFA program can give you is time to write (but beware that some programs/packages will involve lots of teaching/grading, which takes up lots of time, often uses the same part of your brain as writing does, and drains you).  But assuming you can get more time to write than you have now, in your normal job, it may be worthwhile.  You could probably go back to your old career later if you want to; you'll just sacrifice those two years of earnings/advancement.   \r  And, somewhat more intangibly, being in a community of writers and in a place where writing is valued is intellectually stimulating and motivating.  Unless your program is all back-stabby and vicious -- so avoid those.  In Iowa City, it was perfectly acceptable to tell someone who asked what you did that you were working on your novel -- similar to the way in Silicon Valley, it's perfectly acceptable to say you're working on a startup based out of your garage/Starbucks.   \r  You also may find your \"ideal reader\" -- the person who is your great first audience for anything you write, the person who gets what you're trying to do and can give you the right feedback.  You could probably also find this in your local continuing studies program, even if it meant enduring some bad writers in order to connect with some good ones.\r  Structure.  Good MFA programs take very different forms.  Some have few requirements other than writing and showing up at workshop once a week (e.g., Iowa). Others require more academic rigor in addition to your writing endeavors (e.g., Houston).  Some are teeny (e.g., Cornell, with four students per year), while others are relatively large (e.g., Iowa, with 50 students per year).  \r  Some let you \"double-major\" in a range of disciplines, like fiction and screenwriting (e.g., Texas), whereas others have little interaction outside of your main focus area.   Some have more money than others, which can translate into different requirements (or lack of requirements) on your part in terms of teaching, grading, etc.  This sounds trite, but different programs will appeal to different people.\r  Reputation.  Another key thing to consider is reputation, since this may, on the margin, help you gain the attention of publications and agents.  Agents do also come through many of the top-ranked programs, as do interesting guest lecturers, readers, and the like.  \r  But ultimately your success will depend upon your ability to continually produce good work while submitting it to journals and agents, a process that is really all about legwork and organization.  The real tipping point in a writer's career is not just graduating from a well-regarded MFA program; it's when he/she finally gets that first sufficiently impressive publication credit that it becomes easier to get the attention of other journals, as well as agents and editors.\r   Now I will provide some very specific suggestions, based upon my own experience.  Take with a grain of salt. \r  Don't go straight from college. I don't think anyone should go to any graduate school (except, like, to Oxford for your Rhodes Scholarship) straight from college, but this holds especially true for writers.  Recent undergrads are accustomed to the structure of college, and one thing you really need to get out of your MFA program is the ability to manage time well, be disciplined in an unstructured environment, and to be productive as a result of your own motivation.  I think people who have been in the \"real world\" a while tend to appreciate the interlude of an MFA program and manage to get more work done.\r  Look for programs where the faculty and students exhibit a variety of aesthetics.  Not physically -- I mean look for places where the faculty like a variety of kinds of writing, and where the students likewise write differently. This will help you avoid the curse of having to write \"MFA stories\" -- those quiet tales that hinge upon a glance over a coffee cup and that end with someone looking out the window for a long, long time.  Even programs that don't promote these kinds of stories can be unhelpful if there's only one \"approved\" style -- everyone just ends up writing to that style.  Bigger programs will tend to have more diversity of styles, as well as more visiting faculty to shake things up.  Iowa, Michigan, and Texas probably all do well on this parameter.\r  Develop some other skill.  Trust me: you do not want to end up trying to write from 10pm to 1am after a day of teaching four composition classes as an adjunct professor at your local community college.  It's slave labor, and it will drain you of any motivation to write.  Getting a Library Sciences degree is popular today among the MFA grads for good reason -- it's an interesting, flexible job that doesn't use the \"writing muscles\" in your brain. Or you could be like Akhil Sharma, and be a banker by day and writer by night. \r  Don't spend all of your time drinking.  For God's sake, the successful drunk writers were successful in spite of being drunks, not because they were drunks!\r  Don't get wrapped up in any sort of favoritism/hierarchy.  Most programs have fellowships or teaching positions that are perceived as \"better\" than others, and it's easy to expend a great deal of emotional energy worrying about this stuff.  Ultimately, these are not great predictors of who actually goes out there and gets books published.\r  In closing, I'll summarize my background so you know where I am coming from.  I started my MFA when I was 30 and already had an MBA and some OK work experience, so I had that to fall back upon.  I loved living in Iowa City and made some fantastic friends there, people who are terrific writers and very professional critics (ie, it wasn't a vicious environment at all).  I was able to be extremely productive, if not particularly successful at completion or revision.  I had professors who loved my work and (Pulitzer-Prize-winning) professors who hated my work, which was a very useful experience.  The University of Iowa health insurance was outstanding.  It's pricy to live in San Francisco, so I am back in the world of finance but hope to get back to writing on the side. ",

            "answer_text": "This is not a clear cut yes or a no, but a big depends. I have some thoughts on the matter which may help you. An MFA in creative writing will give you a setting in which you will learn how to hone your craft as a writer. In a good program, you will learn to read like a story/poem architect. You will try to deconstruct what you read and figure out what works, and why. Next, you will try to apply that in your own work. You will also, of course, learn how to critique your own work, through being in workshops and being exposed to constructive criticism from other established and aspiring writers. All of this you will have to learn to parse through and take what matters and throw away the rest. Later you can apply the same skill to your own criticism of your own work. An MFA program will not magically connect you to the publishing world or guarantee that you publish your work anytime in the foreseeable future. You may or may not get lucky, but it is not like an MBA that is all about the connections, or whatever people drop USD 200K for. Speaking of money, that\u2019s the biggest factor here. Do you have to go in debt for it? Please don\u2019t! It\u2019s not worth that burden! Do you have to drop a big chunk of your life savings? Again, please don\u2019t! Think long and hard before you do that. It used to be that an MFA meant that you can teach writing at university level and therefore there was some kind of ROI that was worth it. These days, there are so many MFA graduates in North America that it won\u2019t mean much in terms of being able to get well-paying teaching jobs. Also, I don\u2019t think acclaimed published novelists or poets get turned away from universities because they don\u2019t have an MFA. So, that brings me to my next question: did you get a scholarship or a partial scholarship that you can supplement with part time work? Great, read on\u2026 Timing: Go when you have a project you are super invested in that you would like to turn into a book. When you\u2019ve got some life experience under your belt. Because then, the two years you spend in an MFA program can help you give birth to this book, they can push it into the world. When I did my MFA degree, I went immediately after I graduated from university. I lacked a lot of understanding of myself and my aspirations as a writer. I\u2019m not saying I did not benefit from the program, or learn how to become a better reader/writer. However, I would never consider publishing the collection of short stories that I worked on while I was there. I read them now and cringe. It was much too soon. Ultimately, if you want to be a writer, you can find other ways to work on your craft. Think of an MFA program as a luxury rather than a prerequisite. A treat. An extended writers\u2019 residency program, of which there are so many, and I bet you a lot of them are as good as most MFA programs in helping you advance your writing, at a fraction of the cost. Good luck to you, and I hope this helps! ",

After attending summer conferences at Tin House and Iowa, I've been exposed to MFA recipients from many programs and frankly, the abilities of these writers scan the spectrum from lazy to lovely, just like the rest of us non-MFA writers. But, there's a good deal of buzz on the web these days about how MFA programs will not prepare authors for novel writing, and fair enough, because really, what can? http://pamparker.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/the-marathon-metaphor-for-some-things-the-only-answer-is-to-work-through-it/ ",
