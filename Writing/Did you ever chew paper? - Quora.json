            "answer_text": "I don't know you will believe it or not I had the habit of eating paper means swallowing too. It's all started when I was in my 8th grade at the age of 13 I don't know how I started eating paper but it continued for one and half years. I ate only pure white papers ,no news papers, no posters, not colored one ,not written or used one just fresh and new white papers. Sometime I feel how it all happened but it is funny and make me laugh every time I remember it. Physically nothing happened because of it (thank god), How I stopped eating paper is funnier than that :- I was not very curious person that time to know about how the paper was manufactured, but some how fortunately I seen it on TV. I was like what the hell, I have seen how the wood is chopped into small pieces and boiled till it can made as cream like semisolid state and they added so many harmful chemical to give white colour (actually I was chewing right at the moment of watching that). I don't know exactly what happened with in a minute after seeing the chemical they were mixed I ran away and vomited everything (even the food I ate) I don't even know how my body reacted that fast but that was the last day I ate paper from the next day onwards when ever I think of eating paper all the things happened came as a picture  ",

But 60 years back, I had a strange habit of making straw from newspaper to drink coffee. Then didn't know the dangers of ingesting lead in the printing ink. Thankfully I stopped it after a few months when I came to know why my coffee tasted different!. ",
