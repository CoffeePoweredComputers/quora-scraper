            "answer_text": "I believe that any homeless I have encountered who admit to being so are for real. Why? One reason being, anyone who ever asked me for money did not appear homeless, or did not claim to be homeless. No one on the street ever gave me a sad story about being e.g., a homeless disabled Vietnam veteran or a woman escaping from an abusive relationship and asked for anything (other than more of the food I was serving). In Hawaii, one can keep reasonably clean and presentable showering at the beach or cleaning and grooming oneself in a public bathroom. I\u2019ve seen it done. Certain beaches or public parks may look like below, with homeless being the number one complaint of tourists. As Waikiki moves homeless out of tourist zones, some fear perpetual displacement - The Guardian Aloha and Welcome to Paradise. Unless You\u2019re Homeless. - The New York Times Homelessness in Waikiki - Hawaii Business  Unseen by the public, homeless in Hawaii may live like this:  What do they gain by pretending? Professional panhandlers on the mainland I read about who hang out in highly trafficked areas like outside Walmart or along highway onramps who can collect more than a working wage, and go to their homes at the end of the day in new SUVs? Don\u2019t know any. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever seen any. A few months ago, I was walking out of Walmart with my daughter, and a caucasian man walked up to the trash can at the entrance, fished a box lunch out of the trash and started eating the leftovers without even making eye contact. I gave him some money and suggested he buy something inside. My daughter asked if I knew him. \u201cNo,\u201d I replied. \u201cRich\u201d homeless in Hawaii, like people with jobs who can\u2019t afford $3,000 a month rent or $600,000 houses, live like this: Ford E-150 Van runs and drives, mechanics special - $400  The most expensive places to live in America - CNBC Hawaii: Average home price: $1,044,462",

            "answer_text": "To truly understand how vulnerable you feel when you\u2019re homeless I suggest trying it. Leave your wallet, and cell phone inside your house. You will need to bring with you $5 in change. Put it in your pocket. (I would suggest not bringing any money so you can experience the humiliation of begging first hand. If you do need to panhandle/beg for money, make sure once this little experiment is over you give that money back to someone who is really homeless.) Don\u2019t eat breakfast. Don\u2019t shower. Don\u2019t brush your hair, teeth, or put on deodorant. Just walk out the front door, and keep walking for a bit. Don\u2019t go anywhere too dangerous but also don\u2019t walk around your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d. Find a park, sit down. It should be lunch time, and you\u2019re hungry. Figure it out. Enjoy the day. You have no worries to speak of. Maybe go to the library. Use the internet. It\u2019s dinner time. And probably getting a little dark. You\u2019ll need to find a place to sleep. Shelters are not a good place. If you think they are then prior to this experiment, go talk to someone at the local shelter, explain what you\u2019re doing, and that you don\u2019t want to take resources from those who need it but would like to experience the intake process as a homeless person would. They may or may not accommodate your request. Otherwise - find blankets. Boxes. ANYTHING you can to provide shelter and to make you as invisible as possible. Also find a place to sleep. Abandoned store fronts. Alleys. Behind your neighbors garage. Sleep. Do it all again the next day, but this time you\u2019ll have even less money. And you\u2019ll have to hide your sleeping blankets/shelter, carry it with you, or discard it and hope you can find something better later. Now you will have an idea of how vulnerable homelessness feels. What you will not have is the feeling of utter despair and hopelessness that begins long before someone becomes homeless. The mountain of debt, stress of losing income, traumatic life event or whatever it is that causes someone to become homeless is exhausting. It deflates your self-worth, leaves you feeling that nothing you can do will help you out of the situation your in. All that happens before you actually become homeless. Your \u201cexperience\u201d will give you some idea of how vulnerable it feels to actually be homeless, you will not have that dark cloud hanging over you. You\u2019ll also know there\u2019s a home to go back to. ",

Almost everywhere, homeless people are vulnerable in many ways because they have no shelters to go to, to live and survive. The streets are the survivor way to make day by day living. But, what I learned so much about Las Vegas, Nevada is that homeless people are vulnerable and invisible at the same time and I will show you how that is. Living in the Hidden Tunnels of Las Vegas. Many new homeless people in Las Vegas do not know that this place exist. Only the locals know and understand this place. It is the Dark and Underground World of Homeless Lifestyle in Las Vegas.  Welcome to the Real World of Homeless Lifestyle in Las Vegas, Nevada inside the Tunnels of beneath Strip of Las Vegas.  The homeless lifestyle inside the many tunnels of underneath of the STRIP of Las Vegas.  Las Vegas Homeless people are invisible in many ways like James Bond 007. Visible in one moment and then disappear in minutes. That is the homeless lifestyle in Las Vegas, Nevada. I lived it personally because I was homeless at one time in my life in Las Vegas.",
