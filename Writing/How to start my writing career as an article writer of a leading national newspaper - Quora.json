            "answer_text": "Hi! I guess the person who has asked this question wants to be a journalist. Who else would write articles for a leading daily? Well, there are three things a journalist needs -- writing skills, news sense and common sense. If you have these, you may start applying to media houses. While you do not need a degree in journalism to become a journalist, it will not hurt to have one. A journalism course can instill news sense in you and help clean up your writing. Also, journalism schools offer internships with media houses. I know of many who have landed jobs with big newspapers or channels after interning with them for a while.  All you need to do during an internship is work like you are an employee of the organization. Be of help and fit in -- they'll hire you. It could also be that this question has been asked by someone aspiring to be a columnist. Well, it is only after years of reporting or editing that one can hope to be a columnist. Or maybe you should do something so spectacular that newspapers would want you to have a column with them. ",
