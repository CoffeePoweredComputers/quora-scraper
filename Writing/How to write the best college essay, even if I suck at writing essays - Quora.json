            "answer_text": "Easy - DO NOT USE complex words. Aim for less passive voice and adverbs. Break your text into small paragraphs (each paragraph should describe an idea). Shorten your sentences (on average 14\u201316 words is the best per sentence). Also, here is a list of words and phrases to avoid in you writing. Avoid these words: a bitabove-listedbefore-mentionedlikesort ofis sort ofkind ofis kind ofrathersomewhatpretty muchprettyin a sensequitereallyyeahit seems likeseems likeit seems thatbecause ofanywaymaybeperhapsoveralleveryone knowsof coursevast majorityvast minorityany and allanywaysanywheresthe fact of the matterwhen it comes toplease be advisedat all timesend runspoint menrookiesstand-offUse less expressions that weaken your sentence. Do not doubt your writing. You can hedge in real life but not when you are writing. For example, use less of: I am of the opinion that (just say your opinion)I am tempted to saywe are tempted to saydue to the notion thatbecause of the idea thatI considerI believe that (we know what you believe, we read it)I believeI feel thatI am feeling (just describe your feelings)I mean thatI thinkwe think (say what you think)we feelwe mightwe believewe believe thatI wonderI might add (just add what you want)it goes without sayinglike I saidlike I was saying (we know what you said)like I previously stated (if we read it, we know what you stated)like we discussedhere\u2019s the thingthe thing isHere is an example: I believe we should all vote for Jimmy to become our class president.We should all vote for Jimmy to become our class president.Second sentence seems more bold and clear on what must be done. This way, it is easier for the reader to understand your idea. Also, there are tools for that. For example, you can use Shosho - Write More. Better. which identifies adverbs, complex words for you. Even if you suck at writing an essay :) (sorry for shamelss ad) ",

            "answer_text": "Your first step is research and well in advance. If your college essay is due in a month, it is best to start researching about what you are going to write right away. Pester your favorite teachers or your peers who you trust for their judgement to give feedback. Structure your essay into three parts: introduction, main body (divided into two) and conclusion. The introduction should contain the topic and why do you choose to write about it. The main body should contain facts, references, empirical data (if need be) and the crux of the argument and discussion. The conclusion should contain what you think about the whole subject and what you take away from it. Scour the internet for PDF copies if you don't have the time to go to the library but I will end with: DO YOUR RESEARCH. ",
