            "answer_text": "For some people Blogs are personal and for some, it's just another source of income or to say a side hustle and for some its a medium for promoting their current business. The scenarios mentioned above gives you just an ample amount of motivation to get down at your system and bring out the ideas within you in the form of words. This leads to the question which is, why do you want to write a blog? If it is pure passion, then you already know what to write about. You probably know your niche. You just need to develop a style which suits your viewers and which you will definitely get to know about once you start writing. Read blogs on that particular niche and you will just get a hang of it. Secondly, if it is for monetary gain, you need to pick up the niches which will easily sync with your viewers. Like some hot topic with a little bit of twist and interesting anecdotes can easily become a rage amongst your viewers. Use these topics as bate and you can get viewers and easily monetise your blog and keep it as a side hustle. The above style can also bring in money but according to me, it can take a bit of time if people do not respond much to what you want to write about but ultimately it depends on your consistency of content and how well you shape up according to the circumstances. Lastly, comes the part when blogs are used as a part of a company\u2019s digital marketing campaign wherein teams delve into SEOs and analytics which helps them to propel their brand on the Internet. Thus, there are many aspects of BLOGGING, a term which is synonymous with almost every brand\u2019s marketing campaigns and also rightly reverberates with people who want to showcase their thought process in the form of words and who are allowed to vent out what they have within them on this amazing piece of socializing platform, which is the Internet. Remember a journey is best achieved only when it is started, and blogging is such a journey which will take you through numerous ups and downs but you can only let your \u201cwords do the talking\u201d. Best of Luck. Happy Writing. ",

            "answer_text": "What do you know about? What are your interests? What do you have actual expertise in? Anyone can write a blog on anything. It doesn't matter. If you enjoy it, write about it and don't worry about readers or success or what will get most views. Put it this way, I believe it is a false economy to try to blog to a specific audience. If you are not truly interested in the topic - absolutely passionate about it - and have a knowledge of it that is more than merely stuff you read on other blogs (or are prepared to do serious research) then you will come across as false and not get the views you want. If, however, you write for you, the blog you want to write, it will be a lot better written and likely score higher in views. Now you can look at topics within your areas of interest that may end up trending and aim your posts at that. For example, if you wanted to talk about geek stuff you might at the moment look at the fact Iron Fist has just come out, that American Gods is being made as a TV series, that the next series of Doctor Who will have a new Doctor and a new showrunner (and there is huge debate over the possibility of a black or female Doctor) and so on. I generally keep my ear to the ground - keep tabs on Facebook, Twitter and so on with relevant people in the industry followed, look at forums in the area and articles released by companies and use them to work out what is popular/likely to be popular that intersects with my own interests. I once based a whole blog post on a silly internet meme and it became one of my most popular article ever... [If you want to check it out, here is a link https://dalascelles.co.uk/2012/06/15/the-avengers-uk-crossover-universes/ ] I will also say talk about yourself. You are the unique selling point of your blog. When people read it they want to see what you think not generic opinions or info they can get from a hundred other places. ",
