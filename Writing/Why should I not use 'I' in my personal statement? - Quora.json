In fact, it would be very difficult to write a personal statement without using \u201cI.\u201d Furthermore, a few years ago students were taught never to use \u201cI\u201d in an essay, but in the last two decades, the rules have changed. In today\u2019s world, the use of the personal voice is perfectly acceptable in an essay. Look at essays in THE NEW YORKER or the ATLANTIC and you will find lots of examples of personal voice in the essays. ",
