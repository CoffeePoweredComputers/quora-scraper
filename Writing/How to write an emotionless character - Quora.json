            "answer_text": "Emotionless?? Literally emotionless? Well. Write a character that \u201cis\u201d a computer, or thinks like one. Does this \u201cemotionless\u201d character of yours even pretend to have emotions? Or is it like some totally stoic Vulcan. This has been done relatively often. Just think of the tropes and build from there. The character needs another source of motivation, as typically emotions provide motivation for action/inaction. That is one reason that I suggested a \u201ccomputer\u201d (i. e. the character is motivated by its programming): so, they may be the sort who is concerned with doing things in the most efficient way\u2026 the potential emotional harm to others may not even be considered (unless knowledge of typical/predictable causes of emotional harm were part of the programming, in addition to that directive superseding the \u201cefficiency\u201d one). \u2026 I need to know more about your world building in general to really answer this, specifically, the \u201cemotionlessness\u201d. Are they truly emotionless? Are they merely emotionally \u201cmuted\u201d? Were they always \u201cemotionless\u201d? Is there some biological acquired reason for the \u201cemotionlessness\u201d? Are they human or something else where that \u201cemotionlessness\u201d is more typical of their kind? ETC. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends a lot on the specifics of the character, of course, and how they are emotionless (because, as it turns out, there are a lot of different ways such a broad character trait can manifest). First of all, are you trying to represent a real disorder/group of people (psychopathy, for instance)? If that is the case, you should definitely research the disorder in question, preferably through first-person accounts. You can find a lot on Quora, actually, although it is all rather untrustworthy, so if you use it as a resource, make sure you look at more trustworthy sources too. Try to find scientific studies, they can help you determine the accuracy of any personal stories you find. If that is not the case, you have a lot more room to play around. I would suggest establishing the \u2018rules\u2019 of this character\u2019s emotionlessness first. Why are they emotionless? Were they just born like this, or was it trauma of some sort, or a disease, or suspicious brain surgery? Is this type of emotionlessness common in their world, or very unusual? Have they always been emotionlessness? If not, work out the specifics of how they became so. If they have always been emotionless, what was their childhood like? How exactly does their emotionlessness function in the present? Are they completely emotionless, or are their emotions just muted, making them essentially so? Can they understand other people\u2019s emotions at all, or are they really confused by them? Do they fake emotions? Why? How good are they at it? What do other characters think of them when they first meet? What about when they get to know the character better? Figure out the details, and stick to them. It\u2019ll make the character seem more realistic. Of course, you don\u2019t have to reveal all of this at once. A character that hides their emotionlessness could be very interesting. I don\u2019t want to tell you what you \u2018should\u2019 do do in terms of answering these questions, but I will point out one thing: the character\u2019s ability to understand other people\u2019s emotions is probably going to be very important to their outward personality. If they can understand other people relatively well, then they will probably have a much easier time hiding their differences, and could certainly be quite manipulative. If they can\u2019t understand others\u2019 emotions, then they will probably be more obviously \u2018different\u2019, and may become very asocial (as they don\u2019t get lonely). They probably couldn\u2019t manipulate others, at least not without a lot of practice. Society as a whole could seem completely nonsensical to them, depending on where you want to go with the character. They will definitely have clear disadvantages from their emotionlessness, while a character able to understand other\u2019s emotions will not. I, personally, find the second option much more interesting. If it\u2019s helpful, here\u2019s an example of an emotionless character I am writing for a webcomic, who is definitely a little unusual as emotionless characters go: Boy is a kid, around 12 years old, who was born completely emotionless. In the present moment of the comic, he seems pretty expressive, if a little odd. He explains that he is \u2018a good actor\u2019, a skill that he has worked on for years, as he doesn\u2019t understand other peoples\u2019 emotions intuitively (the second option above), but has studied them to the best of his ability. Living a relatively \u2018normal\u2019 life surrounded by people, he has plenty of reference material. His younger self, who will show up in flashbacks eventually, makes no facial expressions and is more clearly emotionless, as he had not learned to hide it completely. Boy has one \u2018friend\u2019, who he interacts with because he finds them interesting: a very emotional robot named Bot. When the two first met, Boy wanted to \u2018fix\u2019 Bot by removing his emotions, but he eventually figured out that they have value to Bot, value that he can\u2019t understand because he has no emotions himself. As for his motivation for living a \u2018normal\u2019 life, Boy is a very curious person (is that an emotion? I\u2019m never sure.). He wants to go to school and learn all he can, and, as he is a kid, the only way that will happen is if he comes off as \u2018normal-ish\u2019 himself. Interestingly, Boy also thinks that he would prefer to have emotions if he could, due to this curiosity, as he is essentially missing a very large portion of the \u2018normal human experience\u2019.
