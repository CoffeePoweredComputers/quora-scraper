            "answer_text": "Hey Santosh, I gather you're looking for an option to change the \"Colour Theme\", which is available in many code editors like this example from Visual Studio Code:  If that's the case, then I've got some bad news and something else resembling good news  VBA\u2019s Visual Basic Editor (a.k.a. the VBE) doesn\u2019t have a theme option. But it does have some (basic) capability to change the colours of the module and code within a module. Here\u2019s a (rather ugly) example . . .  So, if you really, really want to go to the dark side with the VBE, try this . . . In the VBE from the Tools menu choose Options. From the Options screen that appears (below) select the Editor Format tab.  You\u2019ll need to select the Code Colors one at a time and change the Foreground, Background and Indicator colour for each code colour. A little tedious, I know, and you\u2019ll probably need to experiment a little to get the \u201clook\u201d you\u2019re after. I\u2019m not aware of any means to automate this or save (and reapply) the settings. I prefer to stick to the default colours. Anyway, happy VBA coding on the dark side  All the best, Marcus My Excel Genius ",
