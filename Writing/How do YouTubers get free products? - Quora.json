            "answer_text": "YouTubers that you see getting free products or hefty discounts on products are what we call influencers. Basically a company, for example NanoLeaf LED lights, sees that this person regularly gets half a million views on each of their videos and they have lets say, 50,000 subscribers, Nanoleaf will give them a set of their awesome lights for free in return for that YouTuber essentially advertising for them. They mention it in their video, add a link in the description and now half a million people have seen Nanoleaf\u2019s product and they have a direct link to purchase. Nanoleaf now makes X amount of sales and the YouTuber gets an awesome set of lights for free. It\u2019s advertising at its core. ",
