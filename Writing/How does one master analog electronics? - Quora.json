            "answer_text": "Listen, I have some advice that you might find hard to digest, but here it goes: Open the window, take your Boylestad and Milliman-Halkias, and toss them out. The problem with the Analog Syllabus of today is that it goes in reverse order, starting from diodes and junctions, and ending at Operational Amplifiers. It's like starting with Shakespear and ending with ABCD. Look carefully at the book in the image below:  This book is Microelectronic Circuits, by Sedra and Smith. If you truly wish to learn Analog, this shall be your holy book for the next six month. Start with Op Amps. If possible, master 2-port networks from a good Network Theory book even before that. Then, proceed to MOSFET, and then eventually make your way first to diode and then to BJT. I would also advice you to read first two pages of the chapter on BJT from the book on Electron Devices by Streetman and Banerjee. Follow this course of action, and you will do well. ",
