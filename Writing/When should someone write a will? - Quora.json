            "answer_text": "When drafting a will, these are the most important considerations: Consumer Reports surveyed the leading online software providers of will and estate planning documents and came to one conclusion: While such services are better than trying to draft such documents alone without legal training, they leave a lot to be desired for anyone who doesn\u2019t intend to leave their entire estate to their spouse. In some cases, the language in these online documents could end up leading to an \u201cunintended result,\u201d a euphemism for an estate planning nightmare. Among the issues, Consumer Reports found are documents not applicable to the testator\u2019s \u2013 the person creating the will \u2013 jurisdiction. Sometimes, online documents are outdated or just plain incorrect. Every state has a standard form for estate planning documents such as power of attorney. The downloaded online form may not compare with the standard form, and county clerks may not accept it. It is also important to check the fine print in the online document agreement since the disclaimer states that the companies do not warrant that such documents meet the user\u2019s requirements or that they are accurate. That is not an issue a testator will encounter when visiting a lawyer to draw up a will. The online company\u2019s agreement usually includes another clause in its fine print, and that is the resolution of any disputes by either arbitration or small claims court \u2013 not a regular courtroom. Even if the company has created a lot of bad, error-prone documents, users sign away their rights to a class-action lawsuit. ",

            "answer_text": "When you reach the age of majority (in many places 18 years of age) or are otherwise considered legally independent you can write a will. It\u2019s a good idea to work with an attorney experienced in estate planning early on to produce a will to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes in case of your passing. If you haven\u2019t accumulated much in your youth this may be less important than later in life when you begin to reap the rewards of life\u2019s successes at work and/or in starting a family. It is still a very valuable consideration at any age, though. An individual isn\u2019t stuck with the will they create. One can work with their legal councel to amend their will as situations and relationships change. It\u2019s not unwise to amend a will every so many years if need be. Another thing to consider would be advance directive in case you become ill and are unable to make decisions. An advance directive or \u201cliving will\u201d is created ahead of time to specify what actions are to be taken for an individual\u2019s health should they become unable to make such decisions do to their condition. This is especially important if you have a preexisting condition or have a prominent history of hereditary illness within the family. ",
