Write about them, and share. What are you passionate about? Why? Write about that, and share. Do you want to be a force for good in the world? Why? Write about that, and share. Blogging/writing/any pursuit we take on isn\u2019t about getting famous or making a ton of money. It\u2019s not about SEO or \u2018likes\u2019 or being perfect, or being an \u2018influencer\u2019. (Yuck!) It\u2019s about being an active, engaged person in the world. In YOUR world. It\u2019s about being the best YOU you can be. It\u2019s your way of having a voice. Use it! ",

But the problem is Now it do not work like this anymore you have to write the article the that people search for. So my suggestion is go to some keyword cheker tool ( prefer ahref if you can afford ). Stick to particular micro-niche keyword and write articles on them only. Micro Niche blogging is more succesful and easy to rank. ",
