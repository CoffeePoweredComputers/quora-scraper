            "answer_text": "I'm no expert here, but if you're concerned about being found by the search engines I believe you shouldn't repost old posts at all ... something connected with the search engines only registering the first appearance, and if it shows up again it's not considered original material. (Please correct me if I'm wrong here!) I have a WordPress site and according to the kind lady who drives it for me, creating a workable archive/index of posts via WP isn't really an option. However, being the devious old goat that I am, I have managed to create a list of articles/posts on my site, grouped together under category headings. It was quite a long, tedious job to set it all up but now it's easy to update. This way readers can find your older material very easily and quickly.  You can check out how I've done it here: http://howtowritebetter.net/articles-list/ Hope that helps a bit! Suze ",

            "answer_text": "Content Maintenance: How to Ensure That Your Old Blog Posts Remain Evergreen  Hey! Here are some good tips on how you can repromote your old contents and how to keep traffic coming despite the time has passed: *Always deal with your technical issues such as regular website maintenance and fixing broken links to your contents and product links. One way of making your site SEO-friendly is making sure your plugins are working fine, and by fine, they load at a good rate when they click on your contents. *Give your old contents a new makeover. I am not saying you write from scratch but give them a new angle or light that will make readers think \"Whoa, why haven't I thought of this before?\". Revamping popular posts always brings good traffic. *Avoid old and popular posts from falling out of grace by ramping up their relevance when it comes to the current topics and trends by updating new information and data.

However, I think it can be helpful to take an old blog subject matter and rewrite and rework the content.
