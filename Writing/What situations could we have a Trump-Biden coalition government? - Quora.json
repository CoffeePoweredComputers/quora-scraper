            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no such thing as a coalition under the American system of government, you can only have those in parliamentary democracies, like Britain, Canada or Italy. And even then, they usually only happen in parliamentary democracies with some system of proportional representation, where no one party can get enough votes to form a government. So think of places like Israel, Italy and Belgium, where a bunch of small parties will join a coalition led by a bigger party, so they can govern together. It almost never happens in places like Canada or Australia. Presidential republics like the USA can only have one President at a time, there\u2019s no provision for two. And since the US House and Senate have independent voting (in theory, anyhow), there\u2019s no such thing as permanent coalitions there either. Basically different voting blocs form around every proposed law, which is totally different from how a parliament works. ",

Has he ever, in his life and in his Presidency, worked with any other person? It\u2019s Donald\u2019s way or the highway. Look at the LONG list of best people that have been kicked out, usually by tweet. He clearly doesn\u2019t do coalition. ",
