            "answer_text": "Having done programming myself, and originally wanting to go into systems analysis when I started off in comp sci as an undergrad, I understand very well the importance of being detailed, focused, and making sure your code is accurate. And some places, even individual software programmers themselves, have their own style or way of coding. So there is an \u201cart\u201d to it to some degree. Now the quick and easy way for you to get this across is a bulleted statement that says you conduct an extensive or extremely detailed review or analysis of other people\u2019s code for accuracy and proper structure. And if you\u2019re doing programming yourself, you could broaden the statement to saying you do this for your own coding as well as other people\u2019s. And yes, if you prefer, you could make them two separate bulleted statements. FYI, about 3 weeks ago, I was talking to somebody who was learning Python. She couldn\u2019t get the program to run and was really scratching her head trying to figure it out. When I looked at it, I saw the wrong punctuation mark being used in a certain spot. That one little thing is what threw off the compiler and prevent the program from running! So an extremely detailed and focused eye is definitely necessary with software development. ",

            "answer_text": "You express it by saying it :) What you are asking is really, \"is it OK to say, 'thorough, detailed code reviewer' on my resume?\" And of course it is! If it's true, that is. Don't ever put anything on your resume that is either untrue or that you do not want to be asked about - it will make your life infinitely harder. Presuming, though, that your claim of being a detailed reviewer is correct, it's exactly the type of verbiage I want to see for folks I'm going to hire into a reviewer- and/or QA-type position. ",
