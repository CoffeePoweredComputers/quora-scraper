            "answer_text": "Even if the dissertation involves developing software, you have to have some type of framework. Did you do a literature review, for example? Usually dissertations of any kind have an introduction (overview), literature review (state of the art), methodology (how you're going to do this), finding (what you did) and Results (or discussion, or recommendations, or some combination thereof).  Caveat: Your school may vary. There's a methodology model that is really useful for writing disserations. It was developed by Saunders and his cohorts, originally appearing in an older book but explained concisely in Saunders and Tosey (2013), linked below. The model walks you through every part of the methodology that needs defined. Part of the information the school will require, but some of it (the philosophy, for example) will be useful to you as the reseacher. Each of the layers (they consider research to be link an 'onion') can stand as a subheading in your paper.  I'm linking the article, if you have any other questions, feel free to message me. (By the way, if you haven't joined Academia.edu - Share research it is free and it is a really helpful site in terms of the available reserach and the chance to 'talk' with others.  https://www.academia.edu/4107831/The_Layers_of_Research_Design ",

            "answer_text": " A thesis is a hypothesis or conjecture.A PhD dissertation is a lengthy, formal document that argues in defenseof a particular thesis. (So many people use the term ``thesis'' to referto the document that a current dictionary now includes it as the thirdmeaning of ``thesis'').Two important adjectives used to describe a dissertation are ``original''and ``substantial.''  The research performed to support a thesis mustbe both, and the dissertation must show it to be so.  In particular,a dissertation highlights original contributions.The scientific method means starting with a hypothesis and thencollecting evidence to support or deny it.  Before one can write adissertation defending a particular thesis, one must collect evidencethat supports it.  Thus, the most difficult aspect of writing adissertation consists of organizing the evidence and associateddiscussions into a coherent form.The essence of a dissertation is critical thinking, not experimentaldata.  Analysis and concepts form the heart of the work.A dissertation concentrates on principles: it states the lessons learned,and not merely the facts behind them.In general, every statement in a dissertation must be supported eitherby a reference to published scientific literature or by original work.Moreover, a dissertation does not repeat the details of critical thinkingand analysis found in published sources; it uses the results as fact andrefers the reader to the source for further details.Each sentence in a dissertation must be complete and correct in agrammatical sense.  Moreover, a dissertation must satisfy the stringentrules of formal grammar (e.g., no contractions, no colloquialisms, noslurs, no undefined technical jargon, no hidden jokes, and no slang,even when such terms or phrases are in common use in the spokenlanguage).  Indeed, the writing in a dissertaton must be crystal clear.Shades of meaning matter; the terminology and prose must make finedistinctions.  The words must convey exactly the meaning intended,nothing more and nothing less.Each statement in a dissertation must be correct and defensible in alogical and scientific sense.  Moreover, the discussions in adissertation must satisfy the most stringent rules of logic applied tomathematics and science.",
