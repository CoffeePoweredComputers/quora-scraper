            "answer_text": "You can write any way that you choose, of course. Write what you want to see when you read. Write a story that you\u2019ll have fun with. I can only tell you the kinds of superhero romances that i adore. Here are a few things I love to see in superhero romance: Independent adults with agency who come together as they attempt to gain their own goals. That is\u2014the woman (it\u2019s generally the woman) ain\u2019t \u2018looking for love\u2019 and that\u2019s her whole agency. I want to see a woman who has her own life, her own goals, her own strengths. She\u2019s not just \u2018wishing for a man.\u2019 A meeting of equals. In my favorite UF, SF, and superhero romances, the FMC is the social, intellectual, and physical equal of the MMC. It\u2019s the Superman/Wonder Woman thing. Ant Man/Wasp. You noticed that Iron Man/Pepper Pots was so anemic a relationship that you barely saw her\u2014it wouldn\u2019t work as a Romance at all, imho. Right at the end of her movie run, she finally got some powers of her own (cool dragon powers!) and i was all \u2018yeah! Can\u2019t wait to see her again!\u2019 but they didn\u2019t even bother to have her in the next couple of movies. \u2019Cause apparently, she was just supposed to be a low background noise just to prove he wasn\u2019t celibate? And the men, for me, should be emotionally equal to the women. There\u2019s nothing I believe (and enjoy) less than a Frat Boy/male slut who suddenly, unbelievably, is ready to be faithful to one woman just \u2018cause. I just don\u2019t believe their HEA\u2014i\u2019m waiting for him to find the next young thing and cheat on the FMC. A substantial non-romance goal that they wind up working together toward. You may have noticed that many F/SFs have secondary romance elements\u2014they add depth and breadth to the FMC\u2019s character arcs. In the same way, a substantial secondary mystery or thriller, etc goal that our two MCs must solve/fix is, imho, essential to a good Romance plot. This is especially true in superhero romance\u2014in fact, i\u2019d say that the other goal (besides them getting together) should be equal to the Romance in order to make good, interesting use of their powers.

            "answer_text": "How can I write a superhero romance? Perhaps you have done this already, but for the benefit of others reading this, I ask that aspiring writers of a certain genre immerse themselves in that particular genre. In order to be able to write romance, you need to study the genre and identify what draws the readers to it. In the case of romance (in my opinion as both reader and writer of it) it is the meeting of two people, both of whom flawed and on the verge of change, one that they don\u2019t necessarily want to go through. It is due to the other person that each character will eventually go through these changes, because they care about each other more than their comfort or laziness or whatever.  This is the crux of the matter, the essence of every basic story: characters going through changes and emerging better persons in the end. As a superhero, you put innocent lives above your flaw (fear of changes, selfishness, etc); as a romance character, you put your love interest above your flaw. In a romance story with superhero character(s), flaws are still crucial. Maybe your superhero is someone like Hulk (the Marvel movie version) who thinks his power does not suit a domestic life, which he imagines the Black Widow wants. The story is then about him realizing (and/or Black Widow showing him) that a relationship does not have to be a domestic, traditional life, but more about two different people sharing unusual lives.  There is always a downside to power, superpower or not. This downside might jeopardize the life of a loved one, might create a less than ideal romantic relationship, or might prompt your character to undergo change he/she does not want to go through. It is the untangling oneself from this while struggling with selfishness and selflessness that comes from falling in love with someone that has always drawn readers of romance. The more unwilling your character to undergo change (think macho, alpha male hero who eventually change into a more vulnerable person for the sake of the heroine) the stronger the draw. Which is why some of the best selling romance novels have what I\u2019d call exaggerated heroes: billionaires, super tough bikers, hardened secret agents or soldiers, vampires, etc. It looks a bit complicated but then again, what isn\u2019t? Good luck! Thank you for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Think about how you would write a romance between two spies, or two firefighters or two SWAT team members. If one or both of them is a teenager, but of the age of consent or keeping it nonsexual, how would you write a romance between a teenager and an older figure or two teens? The pressures that Super Heroes are under aren\u2019t that much different from regular high pressure jobs with high stakes. Two spies cannot reveal their backgrounds to one another. It could be disastrous if they did. Super Heroes won\u2019t chance revealing their secret identities until they trust each other. Two firefighters/SWAT have to deal with the fact that on any given day one of them could die in the line of duty. It causes them to worry, and even to flub their own job duties because of worry at times. If one of them is not an adult it adds tension to the story regardless of whether they are a super hero or not. If both of them are not adults then the arguments and interaction will likely be more petty and emotion fueled with less start up. I\u2019m not saying adults don\u2019t fight about petty things, they do, but they bottle it up longer than teens do and acting on their frustrations is less likely to be hormone fueled. The best romances on screen or on the page are always real romances between real people. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are Batman and Catwoman, Han Solo and Princess Leia or any other pop culture power couple. Pick your stakes and conflicts like normal, then add in the complexities of their lives. ",

            "answer_text": "Use your imagination and creativity to create what you want. But most authors use the general format in creating any type of story, whether romance or adventure. Character creation and developmentPlot:IntroRising Action(s)Conflict/Climax (no pun intended)Falling Action(s)Resolution/OutroFor the Conflict/Climax, authors usually use some sort of intense and emotional act like cheating or \u201cmadly in love\u201d cliches.Of course, it is up to YOU on how you want to create your story. What I\u2019ve rarely seen done, but it works, is doing the reverse plot format. By starting in the middle of the story as your intro, and slowly climbing to the climax, then drop into resolution. OR start with the resolution as a character\u2019s idea, then drop into the rising actions, climax, and falling actions; then finally refer back to the start of the story. Hope this helps! Good luck!

            "answer_text": "How do you write a western romance? You write a romance, and set it in some part of the frontier west of the Mississippi, after the Civil War but before the turn of the 20th Century. How do you write a military romance? You write a romance and make one of the principles a soldier. How to write romantic suspense? You write an romance and overlay a mystery/crime plot. How do you write a Regency romance? You write a romance and set it during the Regency era. In other words, if you want to write a romance that incorporates elements of another fictional genre, you simply incorporate those elements into your romance. Sounds ridiculously simple, but that\u2019s what it comes down to. So, to write a super-hero romance, you write a romance, and make one of the principles a super-hero. Here\u2019re a few ideas: Spunky girl reporter is in love with two guys. Her co-worker. And the city\u2019s local super-hero. Meanwhile, the super-hero, who, in his civilian ID is the reporter\u2019s co-worker, loves her right back, but chafes at being his own rival. A beautiful professional thief is, of all things, romantically obsessed with her city\u2019s local super-hero, one of those dark, mysterious, night-time avengers, who doesn\u2019t really have any super-powers, but likes to hang around the worst parts of town playing nocturnal detective. He\u2019s got feelings for her, too. How do they get past the fact that they\u2019re on opposite sides of the fence? A military officer is grievously injured while testing a new piece of equipment. The government replaces all his lost or permanently damaged parts with cybernetic prosthesis, spending six million dollars to rebuild him. Unable to pay the medical bill, he agrees to work it off by fighting America\u2019s enemies at home and abroard. Some years later, he falls in love, but, in a tragic coincidence, she, too is grievously injured in an accident. He pulls strings to give her the same kind of second chance, but, when she comes out of the operation, she doesn\u2019t remember him, or their love. How can he gain her feelings again? Do those sound familiar? Then it should be clear that writing a romance with a super-hero element, or a super-hero story with a romantic element, should be possible. ",

That\u2019s the key to popularity, in my opinion. So what I think you should do first is write the romance first. How do they first meet? Is it love at first sight? What do they like about each other? How old are they? What happens to mess it up? How do they reconcile?  Now add superpowers; how did they get them? Did they get them together or separately? What are they? How do they work?  Who\u2019s the Big Bad? Did the heroes create the Big Bad somehow? What is the evil plot? Does the big bad even know about them or their romance? Are they targeting your heroes through it?  And now, with everything you\u2019ve established, how do our heroes win? ",
