Especially when it comes to unintentional stereotyping. My issue is though that if people can only write what they know, then a majority of stories will only feature writers doing writer things. No more sci-fi, horror or cop stories. Write what you want to write, as long as you don't offend to many people; as you'll always find someone to be offended. ",
