            "answer_text": "Hmmm. First off, Granny is a term for a grandmother, which is feminine \u2014 thus, her instead of his. Gender reflects the Grandparent who is looking and possessing the memories, not the subject of the memories. Next, It\u2019s a bid strangely structured structured. Instead of \u201cmilitary plane\u201d consider the word \u201cbomber\u201d, which makes the statement that it was a bomb who killed the subject unnecessary: \u201cLooking at the bomber, Granny/Gramps remembered her/his husband, who had been killed by a similar aircraft.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Looking at the military plane, Granny remembered his husband, who has been killed by a bomb of a similar aircraft. Is this sentence correct? \"Looking at the military plane\" is a participial phrase. No. The sentence is not correct. Looking at the military plane - We would normally say warplane and it wouldn\u2019t be looking it would be seeing. Granny remembered his husband - A Granny is normally a female parent of one of your parents. As such, it is doubtful that granny, being male, would have had a husband (same sex marriage being a fairly recent thing). It would not be capitalised as it is not a personal name. who has been killed by a bomb of a similar aircraft - If granny had been close enough to identify the aircraft that dropped the bomb that killed his/her husband, it is very doubtful whether granny would be alive to remember it. As a correction I would say, \u201cSeeing the warplane was a painful reminder for granny that her husband had been killed in an air raid\u201d. ",
