            "answer_text": "As someone else said, a good place to start is with the blogs you already know and love. Plus, you\u2019re already familiar with their writing style and their content. First thing to do is to check to see whether they have a guest blogging guidelines/write for us page; if they don\u2019t, look at their contact page, as some blogs will mention on there whether they accept guest posts or not. If you find such information on their blog, then that\u2019s great; if you don\u2019t find anything related to guest blogging, don\u2019t worry, you can still pitch your ideas. Ideally, try to engage on their blog for a bit by sharing their content on social media and by leaving thoughtful comments on their blog posts. Finally, if they have any guidelines, use them for when you write your pitch to them, and if they don\u2019t, simply: \u00b7 talk about the fact that you are a fan of their blog \u00b7 explain why you\u2019d be a good choice for a guest post \u00b7 give them links to some good blog posts you\u2019ve written in the past \u00b7 and don\u2019t forget to also pitch them your guest post idea \u2013 or, it might be better to give them more ideas, just so they have a better choice. Once you\u2019re done pitching your favourite blogs, there are plenty of lists online with websites that accept guest posts, like my list of quality blogs that accept guest posts. There are over 400 blogs in there and they are split into 20 different categories, like for e.g., marketing, technology, web design, finance, books and writing, health and fitness and more. Apart from that, you can also use Google to search for guest blogging opportunities. Simply search for: \u00b7 \u201cblog topic\u201d + blog + guest blog \u00b7 \u201cblog topic\u201d + blog + write for us \u00b7 \u201cblog topic\u201d + blog + guest blog guidelines \u00b7 \u201cblog topic\u201d + blog + submit a story To give you an example, when searching for travel blogs, search for: \u201ctraveling blog write for us/guest blog guidelines\u201d. It\u2019s easy and quick \u2013 but, make sure that the blog is active and that the quality of their content is good enough. Hope that helps! ",
