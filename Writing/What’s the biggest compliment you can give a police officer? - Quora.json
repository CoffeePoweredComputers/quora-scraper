            "answer_text": "Hands down the biggest compliment you can give is to let the officer\u2019s supervisor know that you appreciated whatever the officer did, (the best way is a written note to the chief executive). Why? because police officers rarely are ever thanked or told that they did a great job. If Martians came to earth and reviewed an average sheriff\u2019s office or police department\u2019s personnel files, they would think that the law enforcement agencies hire the worst of the very worst. Why? Agencies rarely commend, (if you do good - you are doing your job. If you do something less, it is unexpected and is well documented - in your file). I can count the number of times on my hand the times that any officer I have worked with has received any type of commendation. Law enforcement agencies inspire through negative reinforcement. Let me put it another way, when is the last time that you spoke with the chef about the great meal you had, or spoke with a manager about great service you received? Probably rarely - or never. Humans are hardwired to complain and not praise. So, you want to make someone\u2019s day, let their supervisor know. All the supervisor hears is grossly negative, so you will stick out in the crowd. Funny story, I was travelling from the Midwest to the deep south for a wedding several years ago and as big fool, I tried to stretch my fuel, not realizing how rural the rural Illinois Interstate system is. An Illinois trooper arrived, gave me free fuel from his gas can and was super friendly. I asked for his supervisor\u2019s name. He knew what I was trying to do and begged me not to. He told me that he and his lieutenant could not stand to be in the same room with each other. A compliment would mean that he would need to be called into the central office, which he and the lieutenant were desperate to avoid at all costs. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cGood job. Well done.\u201d The officer looked at me with surprise, as if I was crazy. This was Berkeley, 1995 or so\u2014 the steps of the International House Cafe. \u201cWhat?\u201d he sputtered out in confusion. \u201cYou guys handled it well. It\u2019s appreciated.\u201d I looked like a student, and he looked stunned. A few years later, the evening of September 11th, a BPD officer who I\u2019d just thanked, would say that Berkeley was the worst place in the country to be a Police Officer. \u201cLet me know if you guys have trouble with the review board. I\u2019ll back you up as a witness,\u201d I added, handing him a card. That night, the backstory was complex. It was a party night; a guy who was really big, and really psychotic, and who had a restraining order out due to stalking one of the women at the party, decided that showing up was a good idea. Her friends called the police. The crowd, however, not knowing what was going on, or the violence this guy had already done to her and others, simply noticed that the big, psychotic guy was hispanic. This being Berkeley, it had to be about race, right? A mob quicky formed; they started taunting the officers and calling them racists and whatnot; more BPD showed up; some young hippie-lib-stoners started pelting the cops with small stuff. A guy to the side threw a bottle \u2014 he missed, I and one of the female BPD officers started chasing him, jumped over the hedge on the stadium side at the same time, looked at each other once we were on our feet, figured he wasn\u2019t worth it and jumped back. The crowd was\u2014 three hundred people, half of them drunk, all of them on edge. Not easy to control, even with 20 officers. About six guys and gals got Andre the Giant out the auditorium doors, coaxed him down the stairs while parting the crowd, until there was a little space\u2014 and then in 30 seconds or so, rolled him up into the Xtra-XTRA-large white padded jacket. The crowd screamed: \u201cRacists! Racists!\u201d and some other slogans. The officers still managed to rotate the guy down gently, and get him to an ambulance, where some thorazine and trazdone were waiting. Saving me from considering the emergency kit I kept on the porch\u2014 about that time, I ran into the new lieutenant who was directing this whole shebang, and decided to offer a little gratitude. I certainly hope that\u2019s not the biggest compliment he was ever given\u2014 but it may have been the one that was the most surprising. If you\u2019re around the East Bay, though, and have the opportunity to thank an officer for doing a tough job in an area where most people have been taught that cops are the enemy, please take the opportunity.
