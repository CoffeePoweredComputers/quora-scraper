            "answer_text": "There is no single standard for writing comic book scripts.  There are two main types of styles and then within each there are varying levels of detail. The most traditional method is called Full Script.  A full script is much like the script for a movie/play/television show.  It breaks down each scene, providing necessary scene details and dialogue.  The script will often dictate the number of panels per page, because the writer has specific intentions on the pacing they want and the beats of each scene.  It will indicate the dialogue, so that the artist will make room in each panel for the appropriate sized speech bubbles.  It will specify the characters and their actions.  It might recommend camera angles. The other method is called a plot or the \"Marvel Method\".  It is called that because it was quite popular at Marvel Comics, particularly when Stan Lee was responsible for many of Marvel's major titles.  Stan didn't have time to write out full scripts for every comic.  Instead, what he would do is write a one page (or less) plot for the comic.  That plot would give the gist of the story, the characters involved and any important scenes or details that needed to be communicated up front.  Stan would then leave it up to the artist to make a lot of the decisions.  When the artist turned in their pages, Stan would then decide upon the dialogue that each character would say, and add it to the page, along with any narration caption boxes Stan felt were needed to explain a point that the artist hadn't visually explained. The reason there is so much range in the way comic book scripts are written is that there is a unique feature to the creation of comics - that is that the penciler (artist) is part of the creative process.  Depending on the individual, the penciler may want to utilize their own story-telling skills to make some of the decisions.  They may feel their creativity is being stifled if the script is overly directive.  The creation of a comic is a collaboration between the writer and artist.  While some writers might stick fast to a particular format for their scripts, other writers might adjust to the strengths and weaknesses of the artist with whom they are working. Alan Moore is known for being very detailed in his scripts.  Here is an example of his descriptions for a single panel:   That's just for the first panel in this picture:   Another writer might have just written: \"OVERHEAD SHOT: looking down on Rorschach (out of costume) as he walks down a rainy street.  Over a few panels, we zoom in on the Comedian's smiley badge.  There is a drop of blood on it.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026you\u2019re not giving me much to go on here so it really depends on what skills you have already. I guess the start is to have an idea and then either write a comic script or commission a writer to write a script for you\u2026.you will have to pay for a good writer, an amateur might do it for free, but it\u2019s unlikely to be a good script and your finished product will suffer. The next stage is to pay for a competent editor and make the changes suggested by him/her. Next you need to find a good artist - unless you can draw it yourself. Art is usually divided into 1) Pencils or Lines 2) Inks 3) Colours and 4) Letterists. Some \u2018pencillers\u2019 work digitally and produce what is commonly known as \u2018Lineart\u2019 which doesn\u2019t need inking because it looks like it\u2019s already inked. When you have an issue finished you find a printer to print it and then you sell it, either find a comic book store willing to stock it or take it to comic conventions or sell it online. You might consider a media advisor to help promote it, because there will be a lot of promotion involved. Typically an issue is 32 pages - art costs about $200 per page (all in) so be prepared to spent about $6.5K minus printing and promotion costs. The average sale price is $3.99 so you\u2019ll need to sell about 3,000 copies before you start making any profit. I did a straw poll of independent comic creators of the average sales of their comics - it\u2019s about 100 copies. The above is kind of the worst case scenario, now I\u2019ll describe what many of us do: We write and draw a comic we want to write and draw and then we put it online for others to enjoy - webtoons, comixology, Instagram etc\u2026there are lots of places you can just post your comic for free. If you get lucky and people like it you can monetise it with a Paypal donate button or a Patreon Campaign.  ",
