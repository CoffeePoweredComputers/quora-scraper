            "answer_text": "Hello First of all thank you for your question.I will Try to help you as much as possible,so here is my point on effective blog content in 2020. This tip is not just for content writers but bloggers and all other content creators as well. The thumb rule of content creation is uniqueness.And by uniqueness, I do not mean plagiarism-free content. When I say uniqueness, I am strictly referring to the originality of the idea that you're creating content about. While writing an article, be careful choosing words. I\u2019ve seen most of the writers committing this mistake. They\u2019ll go straight to Google, search for the synonym and replace it with the word. Their purpose of doing this could either be to avoid plagiarism or come up with a new idea. In both ways, it\u2019s very important to know whether the word would fit contextually or not. Here is a 5 Valuable tips for you. 1.

Write unique content for search engines as well as the visitors. Basically, this content should don\u2019t appear elsewhere on the web. 2. Relevant: Your content should be on-topic to the search engines and the visitor\u2019s query and intent. Let\u2019s assume you are on-topic to the query. You used the key phrases in the title, paragraphs and description. But you failed to understand the searcher\u2019s intent. The visitors will be more likely to close your page just after visiting. So you have to pay attention to the query for robots. And you must have to understand and fulfil the intent of humans. 3. Helpful: The content should resolve the searcher\u2019s query in a useful, efficient manner. The king content has to produce the whole things that exactly the visitor wants. 4. Uniquely Valuable: You need to provide some information that unavailable or hard to get elsewhere. 5. UX: User experience mattered. That means anyone can consume your content in any devices smoothly like mobiles, desktops and tablets\u2026..Read More ",
