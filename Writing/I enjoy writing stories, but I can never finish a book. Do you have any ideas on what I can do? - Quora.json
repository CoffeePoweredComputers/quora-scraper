            "answer_text": "How unfinished are we talking? Halfway? All but the last 2 or 3 chapters? Writing a book is a big undertaking, so congratulate yourself on what you've done already. There are a number of things that prevent following through to the end. Sometimes it is motivation, sometimes it is the absence of discipline, and other times you find you have written yourself into a corner or just come up blank on how to finish. So, with those in mind, here are some options, especially given your focus in details that you have good plot ideas, but that you \u201cmove too fast,\u201d which you hold responsible for not finishing. If \u201cseat of the pants\u201d writing is what you are doing, switch to outlining. That keeps you from \u201cmoving too fast\u201d and underdevelopment of both plot and characters. Plus, you can see your options for the ending.Take a book you have started and apply #1 to it. Can you flesh out what you have written so that it gives you a better idea of the ending? What are your options for an ending? Write a short description of each, pick the one you like best, and flesh it out.Have a regular time to write and stick to it. Some days, allot that to the book. Other days, you may need that time to do practice writing that recharges your thoughts, or plays around with the book project. What if he does this instead? What if she is really this instead of that?You may find that a full-length book is really more material than you can squeeze out of yourself on a particular topic or plot. Try doing a short story or a novella instead.Get some feedback (friends, family, a writers\u2019 group. The problem may be that in \u201cmoving too fast,\u201d you aren't developing your action or characters enough to carry the book in your own mind, let alone on paper. See #2 above.Refresh your creative well. If you have sucked it dry with \u201cmoving too fast,\u201d replenish it with new reading, new people, new places, new experiences. You could even do this by \u201ctaking your characters along,\u201d asking them what they think of these things you are seeing, smelling, hearing, touching, tasting, and learning. How would they feel about them? How would they react or behave?Writing a book is as much an adventure for you as it is for your characters and your readers. Make the process your friend and have fun with it so that experience comes out in your writing. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Practice the art of short fiction, or even look into novella length writing. Learn to condense your grand ideas and what would be a long plot into significant moments with just enough connectors to drive those important parts home. Much like revising writing, where the writer should probably know more of the scene and working plot than is written for the readers to enjoy, a novella\u2019s or short story\u2019s plot can have all the workings of a grand, epic plot, but condensed into moments of impact. Give enough detail to make your ideas hit home.  Unpopular opinion time: I find short fiction to be a great genre for noteworthy stories, but also one filled with authors who think taking a small idea and drawing it out is the point. Compare \u2018I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\u2019 by Harlan Ellison to \u2018The Old Man and the Sea\u2019 by Ernest Hemingway. Again, this is just opinion, but my biggest complaint with Old Man was that it felt like it could have been parred down to a leaner machine and had the same ideas and been better for it. J.R.R. Martin novels felt like a quicker read just because trudging through Old Man was like swimming through molasses. No Mouth, on the other hand, has a font of hidden world building and depth that could have been fun to know, might have made a great long story, but it was carefully boiled down into a quick, one-two punch of futuristic horror and societal commentary that made a statement. It was shorter than Old Man, but I feel there is more weight to it. And that\u2019s where short fiction shines. It is like looking into a well, seeing the surface water and enjoying it, then peering in and wondering just how far down it goes. You know there\u2019s a bottom somewhere, but you sure aren\u2019t going to get to it, and you\u2019re not sure you need to. ",
