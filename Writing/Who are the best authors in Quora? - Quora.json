            "answer_text": "Quora has an overwhelmingly large range of topics, people, interests, etc., so any attempt to comprehensively cover all of the top writers is hopeless. Here\u2019s mine. Hilarious insight on just about anything This category includes some genuinely funny writers whose topics are all over the board; they write about pretty much everything. Some of my favorite answers from these writers poke fun at the more odd and bizarre questions. Or better yet, their parodies of trolls and nonsensical questions. Dan Holliday has made me laugh to myself in a public place multiples times. Sometimes I\u2019ll legitimately cry with laughter. This guy is unshakably honest and blunt; you never have to question what his true thoughts are. But don\u2019t let his hilarity fool you. He\u2019s very intelligent, and well-read in many topics, including science, religion, and politics.Andrew Weill is unquestionably the king of trolling the troll. Fueled with very subtle sarcasm that plays along with the asker, Andrew strikes the foul troll with a witty punch that displays the absurd implications of the trolling question. In addition to his cleverness, Andrew also consistently displays a good, well-intentioned heart.Franklin Veaux is concise, direct, and charismatic. He answers a lot of questions from the relationships category. Amongst his answers, you\u2019ll see everything from spot-on, mature advice to ruthlessly funny spoofing of bizarre questions like \u201cShould I control my girlfriend more?\u201dHabib Fanny\u2019s answers are often quirky, with a certain off-colored kind of humor that is rare on Quora. What I most like about Habib\u2019s style is that he is extremely objective, and he refrains from political correctness. In other words, if there\u2019s an ugly truth in which he believes, he\u2019ll point it out proudly. This also means that he can debate opponents cogently.Controversial (Religion & Politics) We all love some controversy. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Many of the other writers in this list are often controversial. But when it comes to these writers, I feel as though they almost actively seek out controversy. And I mean that in an intellectual and passionate way, not in an attention-seeking trolly way. Both Dale Thomas (\u30c8\u30fc\u30de\u30b9 \u30c7\u30fc\u30eb) and Christian Winter are both incredibly out-spoken, analytical writers with scientific backgrounds. Their thoughts on a number of emotionally charged topics like science vs. religion, religious fundamentalism, atheism, etc. are articulated in a way that is astoundingly concise, and logically compelling. Regardless of your religious attitude, you should check them out. When it comes to politics, don\u2019t let the claims that Quora is equally politically represented fool you. It\u2019s not. There\u2019s absolutely a dominant liberal bias, and I say that as a left-leaning independent. As much as I enjoy reading content from the very-well represented liberal top writers, I love to hear both sides of any argument, as well as honest, respectful debates. So I actively sought out conservative writers. The two which most clearly come to mind are Matthew Bates and Jon Davis. Both of whom are articulate writers who are knowledgable on politics and capable of making highly persuasive, cogent arguments. Do I agree with them all of the time? No. But I know that their hearts are in the right place. Besides, how boring would life be if we only listened to people we agree with? Advice and Stories I\u2019ll keep this section short and sweet. Here we have writers who provide a lot of helpful advice to users and also share some engaging personal stories. Kate Scott fits this niche with an additional talent for self-parody and humility that is refreshing and admirable. Gayle Laakmann McDowell\u2019s expertise and impressive background in technology provides her compassionate advice with a sense of pragmatism and wisdom that is pretty damn cool. User-10928822921880324707 is a more controversial advice-giver\u2014and one who fits in pretty much every category in this answer. You can tell that his advice comes straight from the heart, and a lot of his content is deeply bold and spot-on. Math I know that this is more of a niche topic, but math is one of my favorite topics to read about on Quora, so I have to include this topic. Since I\u2019ve already written an answer regarding some top math writers, I\u2019ll post this link to a more detailed answer of mine on this topic: Calvin John's answer to Which math expert on Quora is the best at math?. But to summarize, \u200eAlon Amit (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea)\u200e, Senia Sheydvasser, and Conner Davis are all genius writers who show the beauty behind math. More specifically, they show that math isn\u2019t arithmetic and solving equations; it\u2019s discovering deep, often profound relationships between structures and patterns. Everyone should follow these guys. If I had read some of their stuff before college, I would\u2019ve known that I actually loved math before I spent almost two decades hating it, and three years of college in the wrong major. Bear in mind that they answer other questions too. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many genuine writers on Quora who write honest answers and who express views in a realistic manner. I can't mention their name because the list will be too long. Also, it would be a mistake from my side, If I forget to mention the names of few such writers in the list. I prefer to answer this question on general basis, rather than pointing few people.  So, I would like to tell that there are many talented writers, whom I consider as source of my inspiration. Few turned out to be my : Advisors.Well wishers.Brothers and sisters.Friends. Though many people don't write answers regularly , they always stood by me when I felt low. I am very glad to say that all these people are my favorite Quorans. ",
