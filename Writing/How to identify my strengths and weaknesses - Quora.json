            "answer_text": "1. First, create two lists Before you use any outside sources to help identify your strengths and weaknesses, I\u2019d recommend that you spend about 30 minutes alone creating two lists. Your first list is going to be centered on your business or entrepreneurship goals. Call it something like, \u201cSkills Needed to Succeed.\u201d Don\u2019t worry about whether you\u2019ve thought of every possible skill required for your business to succeed. This is meant to be an overview, and is fairly general. Depending on your business, it might list things like, \u201can understanding of the market,\u201d \u201cbusiness development,\u201d \u201cwebsite development,\u201d or \u201cproduct expertise.\u201d Once you\u2019ve completed your list, highlight the skills that you already have, and put a star next to the ones you think you\u2019ll need to develop. Then, set this list aside\u2014you\u2019ll come back to it later. The next list you\u2019re going to create requires you to be completely honest about yourself. You can create two columns, one called \u201cStrengths\u201d and the other called \u201cWeaknesses.\u201d Depending on your personality, you\u2019ll find one of these columns a lot easier to fill out. I can only encourage you by suggesting that you do your best to be objective. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over what you think are major flaws, and don\u2019t overestimate how great your strengths are. Just write them down, and move on. You also don\u2019t need to have a comprehensive list of 100 strengths and weaknesses. If you\u2019ve included more than 10-15 items in each column, then you\u2019re probably starting to focus too much on strengths and weaknesses that aren\u2019t that significant. Examples of what you might add to this list range from aspects of your character, like \u201ccalm under pressure\u201d or \u201cachievement-driven,\u201d to technical skills you may have, like \u201cHTML expertise\u201d or \u201cproject management experience.\u201d The purpose of this list will be to start off with some general ideas that you have about yourself, and then get input from other sources to help you refine your list. To help you think about what to include in your strengths and weaknesses, try asking yourself questions like: What am I good at?What have others complimented me about?What have others had to help me with on more than one occasion?Which projects and tasks seem to drain my energy?Which projects have I spent hours on without getting tired?What are my hobbies, and why do I like doing them?After you\u2019ve spent some time honestly assessing your strengths and weaknesses, it\u2019s time to get input from those closest to you: a significant other, your mentor, close friends, or family members. 2. Talk to people you trust The problem with using a list of strengths and weaknesses that only you\u2019ve completed is that you have a biased opinion of yourself. Most people think too highly of themselves, or too little of themselves. If you\u2019re like me, then you somehow manage to do both at the same time. We all need some kind of \u201csounding board\u201d to help us gain clarity and get closer to the truth about ourselves. That\u2019s where other people come in handy. Try thinking of three to five people whose opinions you trust, and who have had the chance to live or work with you for an extended period of time. You want people who have observed your behavior and character in a number of different situations. For most people, that group will include a significant other, perhaps a mentor or advisor, a best friend, one or more siblings, or your parent(s). The length of your relationships isn\u2019t the only thing to consider. The most important thing is whether or not you value or trust their opinion of you. Some friends and family members will be too biased\u2014they either think everything you do is amazing, or their opinions have been hurtful and destructive in the past. Carefully select people who have a good track record of being balanced and helpful, even when they\u2019ve needed to tell you something that you didn\u2019t want to hear. Once you\u2019ve got a group of people selected, reach out to them. You can go out to coffee with each of them, or simply send an email with some questions and ask for their honest feedback. When you reach out to them, make sure you give some context as to why you\u2019re asking for their opinion. Tell them that you want to start a business, and that in order to be successful, you\u2019re trying to take stock of your strengths and weaknesses. Ask them what it is about you that they think will contribute to your success. Then, ask them to tell you the weaknesses you have that may cause you to fail. As you receive feedback, start adding more details to your two lists. You\u2019ll start to see that some of the strengths and weaknesses you listed are confirmed by those you trust, while others that you listed aren\u2019t as significant to the people who have spent time with you. Refine your lists. 3. Take a personality test In addition to the time you\u2019ve spent thinking about yourself and the opinions you\u2019ve gathered from others, personality tests are another useful resource to help you identify strengths and weaknesses. 4. Try new things One problem with identifying strengths and weaknesses comes when you have a lack of experience. In some cases, you might look at your list of weaknesses and notice that it mostly boils down to \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never tried.\u201d For instance, how do you know if you have an athletic or artistic ability if you\u2019ve never tried to do something athletic or artistic? I\u2019m a big believer in pushing yourself to grow by doing things you\u2019ve never done before. To be honest, if you\u2019re reluctant to try new things, then here\u2019s your instant personality test result: don\u2019t be an entrepreneur. Evaluating your lists Now that you\u2019ve spent some time identifying your strengths and weaknesses, you can evaluate which ones need some additional attention from you. Some of your strengths represent the absolute best you have to offer right now. Other strengths may need to be further developed before they can be used to their fullest potential. Finally, some strengths likely won\u2019t be integral to your success. In your \u201cweaknesses\u201d column, some weaknesses will be glaring. You will need to address them and improve upon them before you\u2019ll be able to succeed. Other weaknesses, like some of your strengths, may simply be irrelevant to your overall business objectives. Finally, some weaknesses may be important, but maybe you\u2019re not the one to overcome them. In order to understand what I mean, we need to talk about opportunity cost. ",

            "answer_text": "I found really great article about how you can identify your strengths and weaknesses.  So here you have it. First thing, you need to understand is your abilities 1. Appreciate your effort. You should take a good look at where you are already strong and where you could stand some improvement. Give your awesome self a pat on the back and remember that you are an amazing person. 2. Write down what you do. Spend some time ( a few days or week) writing down all of the activities you do throughou  a day. Rate them from one to five, depending upon how much you enjoy doing or participating in them. 3. Think about your values. Sometimes, it can be difficult to identify our strengths and weaknesses because we haven't taken the time to clarify our core values.  Here are some great questions to ask yourself: Think about a few people you respect. What do you admire about them? What traits do they possess that you value? How do you see these in your own life? Imagine you could change one thing about your community. What would it be?Why? What do you think that shows about what's most important to you? Remember a moment in your life where you felt very satisfied or fulfilled. What was that moment? What happened? Who were you with? Why did you feel that way? Imagine that your house is on fire (but all pets and people are safe) and you can save just 3 objects. What would you save, and why? 4. Examine your responses for themes and patterns. Once you've reflected on your values, examine the responses for things that may repeat. For example, perhaps you admire Bill Gates and Richard Branson for their entrepreneurial spirit and creativity. This suggests that you may value Ambition, Competition, and Ingenuity.  5. Determine whether your life aligns with your values. Sometimes, we may feel like we have a weakness in a particular area when our lives don't align with our core values, for whatever reason.  For example, perhaps you value Ambition and Competition, but you feel stuck at a dead-end job where you're never challenged or given an opportunity to prove yourself. You might feel that you have a weakness in this area because your life isn't currently aligned with what's very important to you. 6. Consider situational meanings. Think about what constitute strengths or weaknesses relative to the social conventions or customs withinyour local context. Knowing how these differ depending on where you live canhelp you determine what might be seen as a strength or weakness in thatparticular geographic location.  For example, if you live in a  area where everyone works with their hands, the members of this community will likely value attributes related to physical labor and working long hours during the day. If you happen to live in a large city, however, these attributes might not appear as important, unless you happen to work some other manual labor job. So to understand your abilities you need to : appreciate your effort, write down what you do, think about your value, Examine your responses for themes and patterns,  Determine whether your life aligns with your values and Consider situational meanings. Second thing, you need perform a reflective best self exercise 1. Find people to ask. To help you figure out what your strengths and weaknesses are, you can do a Reflective Best Self (RBS) exercise. This helps you figure out what others think about you in order to help you find yourstrengths. To start, think of people in every aspect of your life. 2. Ask for feedback. Once you've chosen your candidate, send them ane-mail asking them about your strengths. Ask them to give you particular instances where they saw you use these strengths. Make sure to mention that these strengths can be skill-based or personality -based. Both kinds of responses are important. 3. Look for commonalities. Once you receive all the results,you need to look for things that are similar in them. Read through each response and think about what it means. Try to pull out what traits each person is pointing, and read the specific instance to see if any other traits arise. After you interpret them all, compare them to one another and find similar traits that many people mention. 4. Make a self-portrait. Once you have all the results, write a self-portrait analysis of your strengths. Make sure to incorporate all the different aspects that people pinpointed in their discussion of you and any traits you brought out in your own analysis. It reminds you of the characteristics you use when you are at your best and can help lead your future actions on how to strive touse them more.  To perform a reflective self exercise you need to : Find people to ask,  Ask for feedback, Look for commonalities and Make a self-portrait. Third thing, you need to list is your actions 1. Write about your actions. Consider how you respond in certain situations that require action, thought, and insight.  The reason for doing this is that the spontaneous reactions tell you a lot about how you react in both ordinary and intense situations. You can write them down to help you decipher your actions and abilities.   2. Think of a challenging situation in which something bad happened. Perhaps it's being in a car crash or a child suddenly dashing out in front of your car while you slam on your brakes. How did you react when confronted with the spontaneous situation? Did you clam up and retreat or did you meet the challenge head on, assembling tools and resources to address the situation? If you took control and acted as a leader, you probably feel that courage and being able to handle these situations is a strength. If you reacted by crying uncontrollably, feeling helpless or lashing out at others, staying inself-control during a challenging situation might be a weakness.   Make sure to consider things from several angles.  3. Find a less challenging situation. Think about a time when you faced a hard decision but one that wasn't so life and death. For example, how do you react when you enter a crowded room? Do you want to engage everyone you meet there or do you want to find a quiet corner away from the noise and connect with just one person? 4. Consider times you faced a difficult personal situation. Think of a timewhen you've been put on the spot and had to react immediately. How quickly did you learn and adapt to new situations? Are you a fast thinker, rattling off agreat comeback when a co-worker makes a snide remark? Or do you tend to absorb, think, and then react in those situations? Remember that any strength you might have developed can sometimes have tradeoffs. If you spend most of your life alone reading and writing, for example, you might not be as apt at small talk as other people, but you will probably have a knack for finding the plot of a book and discussing deep topics with others. You also may grown up with younger siblings, which means you maybe compassionate, patient, and good at diffusing situations. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the world needs many different people with different types of strengths and interests in order to be as diverse as it is. You don\u2019t necessarily need to be good at everything, just at what you consider important for yourself. To know your actions: Write them down, Think of a challenging situation in which something bad happened, Find a less challenging situation and Consider times you faced a difficult personal situation. Fourth thing, you need to list is your desires 1. Ask yourself about your desires. Your desires say a lot about you, even if you've been spending a lot of time denying them. Consider why you want to complete those activities or goals and what it will take toreach them.  Many people fall into the trap of doing what their families want and becoming a doctor or lawyer when they'd rather have been a ballet dancer or a mountain trekker instead. Ask yourself, \"What are my desires in life?\" Whether you're applying for your first job or have just settled into retirement, you should always have goals and yearnings in life. Determine what drives you and what makes you happy. 2. Decide what you enjoy. Begin to ask yourself about the things you most enjoy in life. Write down the answers to the question,\"What types of activities do I find satisfying or appealing?\" For some people, sitting by the fire with their Labrador Retriever by their side sis extremely satisfying. For others, they\u2019d rather be rock climbing or taking aroad trip. 3. Consider what motivates you. Along with your desires, you need to decide what keeps you motivated in life. Write down your answers to the question, \"When do I feel energized and motivated?\"Consider times in your life when you feel ready to take the world on by storm or inspired to go to the next level. The areas that inspire and motivate you are typically where you are strongest. To know about your desires: Ask yourself about them, Decide what you enjoy, Consider what motivates you. Fifth thing: Assessing Your Strengths and Weaknesses 1. Rethink your weaknesses. \"Weakness\" isn't the most helpful way to think about areas for development. In reality, people really aren\u2019t weak, even though we might really feel or think this way at times. However, most people feel that they could be stronger in certain areas in their lives, their skill sets, and other areas. Since they feel they are not as strong in those areas, it\u2019s common to assign the opposite to describe when we feel we need to work on an area to feel stronger and competent. Instead of focusing on \"weakness,\" which has a negative feel to it, think about your areas for growth or improvement - this keeps you focused on the future and what you can do to get better. Weaknesses could be conceived as something about yourself that you either have the power to improve, in so far as they are at all related to your desires, or are perhaps simply not relevant to your desires or goals in life whatsoever. Acknowledging either one is acceptable. Weaknesses are not permanent aspects of ourselves, but instead are changeable aspects of how we do things so we can become even more excellent. 2. Identify your areas for growth. Areas in which you can develop might be related to anything, including certain professional or social skills or poor self-restraint with food. You could also simply refer to an inability to catch a baseball or perform math equations quickly. Often times, areas forgrowth are framed in terms of \"learning lessons from life\" and notrepeating mistakes. Other times, it's about making the effort to overcome alack of skills you perceive in yourself. 3. Focus on your strengths. Some might consider focusing on personal weaknesses at all as waste of time, or even a mis-framing of the issues. Instead, focus primarily on your strengths and try to cultivate these whenever possible.  For example, if you want to work on becoming more assertive, first start with what assertiveness skills you feel you\u2019re already doing. Maybe you have trouble saying no, but instead you have the ability to state your intentions in a way where your intention is understood and you can spare the feelings of the person.  4. Write down your strengths and weaknesses. Once you assess all you've written down about your actions and desires, it's time to focus on what you think your strengths and weaknesses are. Using the lists from other people you got earlier and that you have learned about yourself through the other exercises, write down areas of your work and life that you think are your strong and weak areas. Focus on how you currently see your own strengths and weaknesses based on what you're doing in your life right now, both personal and professional, rather than looking to the past or to your desires. 5. Compare the lists against one another. Did they match up and did you findany surprises? Did you think you were strong in one area but in your actions list that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case? This type of mismatch occurs when you're telling yourself you're one way, but a challenging situation displays your real character instead. 6. Consider any surprises or mismatches. Look at the different lists you'vemade. Look for any surprises or places that don't match up. Reflect on why you think that some of the qualities and weaknesses you've spotted have turned outto be different. Is it possible that you think you enjoy certain things or that you're motivated by certain things, but in actuality you can't or you aren\u2019t? These lists will help you see that. Focus on those areas that differ and try to identify situations that address the area. For example, did you write that you aspire to become asinger, but on your lists of believed strengths, you said that you were good atscience or medicine? While a singing doctor might be a novelty, the two professions differ considerably. Figure out which area really motivates you inthe long-term. 7. Ask the opinions of friends or family. Have a close friend or family member provide you with constructive feedback. Although self examination can lead you to a few answers, getting an outside opinion will help you either solidify your observations or can shatter a few illusions as well. Learning how to receive constructive feedback from others is essential to being part of acommunity. It is important not to get defensive, or take it as a personal attack, simply because someone suggests an area of improvement. Learning toincorporate constructive feedback from others into your everyday life can be astrength in itself. If you don't think that a family member can be honest, choose someone who will give you the truth and not sugar coat or gloss over your weaknesses. Findan external, neutral person, preferably a peer or a mentor, to give you honest, constructive feedback. 8. Reflect on your findings. After you assess your strengths and weaknesses, spend some time to reflect and determine how you feel about what you found. Decide if you need or want to work on any of your weaknesses and contemplate what you will need to do to attack or change these weaknesses. Enlist in a class or find activities that will address your weaknesses. For example, if you find that you become a deer in headlights when confronted with a spontaneous situation, put yourself in situations where spontaneity occurs. Examples including joining a community theater, participating on a sports team, or doing karaoke at the bar. 9. Reject perfectionism. Take care not to become hung up on your weaknesses. This pattern can quickly fall into the nonconstructive patternof perfectionism, which can actually hold you back from success. It\u2019s better to begin with what you do well for a given skill set, then find several details to enhance those skills and slowly improve over time.   For example, you want to improve your communication skills. After someself-reflection, you decide you are actually a pretty good listener, which is your strength. However, you clam up when it\u2019s your turn to speak, which is your weakness. You decide you want to be more verbal, so you work on interjecting maybe a sentence or two within the conversation at small pauses. 10. Don't deny important moments in your life. Everyone hasthings in their life that they excel at. There are times when you do somethingyou've never done before, but it just clicks and you find that you're a total natural at it. This might be sport, art, creative pursuits, interacting with animals, or standing in for someone who is away and doing their job. Not everyone will experience the same amazing moments as you, but when you have them, work with it to enhance your life and reach your true potential.
