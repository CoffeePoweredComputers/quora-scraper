            "answer_text": "The Quora bot appears to have assumed this was about writing a privacy policy. But I suspect this was a question about writing policies of any type, probably because the question author has been tasked with writing a policy on a specific topic. Your first step is to see if there are policies already in place for the industry. Don\u2019t write what can be adopted almost verbatim. It helps to understand the general hierarchy of policies and related things. Policies are general rules designed to eliminate unwanted \u201cgray areas\u201d or \u201cwiggle room\u201d that will only create an opportunity for abuse and unequal treatment. Thus, a company may create a policy regarding paid vacations for workers: how eligible time off accrues during one\u2019s first year, then in later years, or for job levels or after X years of service. Policies keep companies from wading into specifics of individual cases, usually with items where one exception could lead to requests for many other exceptions and criticism for favoritism. Standards may accompany policies, and provide detailed measurements, quantities and values or descriptions of what measures compliance with policy. Procedures document how thinks should be done, in a manner consistent with policies and standards, specifically because the procedures assure controls can be implemented, assuring the process conforms to the policies and standards. The controls may be detective or preventive in nature. A policy should have a definition of its scope. Is the policy regarding employee recognition at the West Podunk plant, or is the policy corporate wide? A policy should not name people in the organization and should only use job or organization titles sparingly. The policy should be owned by an organization or job title, with a process defined for changing it, and reviewing it regularly. A policy should make sense even if the business changes: growth in markets and locations, sheer size, product and service offerings. The policy usually ought to follow applicable laws. The policy should stand on its own. A change over to different technologies and processes should not invalidate a good policy. A policy should not name a product or service brand name used by another company. The policy should not restrict the company from legal and ethical business activities without a valid underlying purpose. The policy should be something that can be implemented: the business can be changed and technologies already exist to reach compliance with the policy, even if specific area have a problem complying with the policy when it is first implemented.
