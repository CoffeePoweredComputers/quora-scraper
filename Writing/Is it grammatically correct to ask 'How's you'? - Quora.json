            "answer_text": "Is \"How's you?\" grammatically correct? No, it is not. The correct version, as of the year 2019, is \u201cHow are you.\u201d The reason for this is that the word \u201cyou\u201d is always grammatically treated as if it were a plural, even though the word \u201cyou\u201d in fact sometimes functions as plural and sometimes functions as singular. Many other languages have a unique second-person singular pronoun, different from the second-person plural pronoun, but NOT English, at least not in the year 2019. If you were to drop back a few centuries, you would find an English language in which the word \u201cyou\u201d always implied more than one person. In those days, the singular version was \u201cthou\u201d or \u201cthee,\u201d with \u201cthou\u201d being used as a subject and \u201cthee\u201d being used as an object. (Compare this to the use of \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d in the first person.) In those long-ago days, the correct version would have been \u201cHow are you?\u201d if addressing two or more people at once, but \u201cHow art thou?\u201d if addressing only one person. But in the year 2019, almost any use of the word \u201cthou\u201d is comically archaic. The exception is in religious language, because the highly venerated King James Version of the Bible is old enough to make extensive use of the word \u201cthou,\u201d and prayers and other religious orations and writings often follow the lead of the KJV.

            "answer_text": "Since \u2018is\u2019 is a form of the verb \u2018be\u2019, so to quote the great Chandler Bing: \u201cCould it be more wrong?\u201d :D I'm so glad somebody put up this query! Many thanks ! \u2018How\u2019s you?\u2019 is another one of pop culture\u2019s grammatical evils! As a grammar coach, it infuriates me inside (albeit I maintain a calm countenance on the surface :p) to have myself enquired after in such fashion! \u2018How\u2019s you?\u2019 is essentially the contraction for \u2018How is you ?\u2019 Stating the universally known here, that the pronoun \u2018you\u2019 never works with \u2018is\u2019, making the usage \u2018How\u2019s you?\u2019 absolutely wrong and invalid ! Whatever happened to good old \u2018How are you?\u2019 that's been around for as long as can be remembered ? \u2018You\u2019 as a pronoun in English is always given plural treatment. Hence the combinations of you with forms of be in the present and past tense are as follows : Present tense : You + are Past tense : You + were The forms \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018was\u2019 find no usage in conjunction with \u2018you\u2019 in legitimate grammar except for literature and motion pictures where the characters are deliberately made to use the combination in their speech to establish their rural or uneducated background.
