            "answer_text": "See example: Hi! My name is Tom. I\u2019m 16 and I live in Warsaw which is the capital of Poland. Actually I come from another city - Wroclaw, where I lived for eleven years, but five years ago, my dad decided to change his job, and we all moved to Warsaw. I have a sister \u2013 Maja. She is 18 and she had been to USA two years ago and now she studies law at the University of Warsaw. My dad works for a German company. My mom used to teatch at the University and now, she works as a computer analitist. I\u2019m interested in computer science, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers first appered in my life when I was seven. Then I had got my first computer. It was Commodore 64 and I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. I was playing it whenever I could. Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming. Now, I can already programue in Pascal, C++ and HTML. I have my own site on the internet and I have done many programues. I hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist. My favorite music band is QUEEN. I think it is the best group on the earth. Together with my sister, we are devoted Queen fans. We have all their albums, many video tapes, books, posters, gadgets and interviews. I love them, but I also like other groups like The Doors, The Baeatles, The Rolling Stones, some Polish rock groups and many others. Apart from that I\u2019m really fascinated by Scottisch bagpipe songs, and one of my favorite albums is the \u201eBraveheart\u201d soundtrack. I have always been good at sports. I like playing soccer, running and swimming (also SCUBA diving and diving). I have played in many sport tournaments (football cups, handball cups, races) in which together with my team, I have won many trophys. My favorite intelectual game is chess, but I have never played it professionaly. I love fantasy literature. I read fantasy books and magazines, watch fantasy films and play role playing games in which fantasy world is used as background. Once every two weeks, I meet with my friends and we play \u201eMiddle Earth\u201d. I\u2019m the master of the game and they are players. We play about five hours sesion. It\u2019s a lot of fun. \u201eMiddle Earth\u201d is a game based on Tolkien\u2019s books. I chose it, becouse I love everything that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote. He is my favorite writer, but I like other writers as well, for example Piers Anthony or Robert Jordan. My dream is to study computer science and to go to Japan. I love everything associated with this country. and I hope that in the future, I will learn Japanise. I want to go to Japan and stay there for a long time. I want to get a job there as a computer scientist. Now, I try to learn Japanise by myself. I already know some words and about sixty letters of their alfabeth. My parents promised me that if I learn German and English well, they will find me a Japanise teatcher. I hate spiders. When I see a spider (especialy when it\u2019s a big one) I feel so very small and the spider seems so huge. I don\u2019t feel scarred when I see a mouse, snake or any other animal and when I come across a spider I think: \u201eWhy is it not a mouse? Why do I always find spiders and not mise for example\u201d. This is terrible. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re one of the many who has difficulty writing about themselves, you can take the indirect approach. Ask yourself, \u2018What is something I\u2019m good at doing?\u2019,\u2019What are my goals and interests?\u2019 Perhaps you enjoy writing, or you\u2019ve always been there for your friends. Something that makes you proud, a trait, a story, or something you\u2019re working towards. Whatever topics you think of, keep them in mind. Now, describe to yourself what makes you good at those things, what made you proud? How far along are you in reaching your goal? What makes you excel at that? Answer those questions, and all you will need to do is put that into words. Start with an introduction of the essentials, just like you\u2019re introducing yourself to a new friend. As you continue, it\u2019s okay to delete sentences, and backtrack sometimes. After it\u2019s written, you can go back and edit it. If you\u2019re writing for a specific group, you may want to add something that relates you to that group in your introduction. For example, \u201cMy name is Isiah Anderson, I enjoy writing answers on Quora, and have for a few years now. I\u2019ve written about 150 Answers for questions, and I\u2019m looking forward to answering 150 more!\u201d (Shameless advertisement) Here is another example, \u201cHello, my name is Saiko L. Ge, this will be my fourth Psychology class! I\u2019ve always been interested in this subject so I\u2019m happy to be taking another class in pursuit of my dream: to become a psychologist.\u201d Relating your introduction to the group adds a sort of connection, consider if it\u2019s right for the piece you\u2019re writing. Now you can fill the paragraph in by answering the questions (or other questions you\u2019d ask yourself) and putting those answers into text. Be sure to edit it a few times, and perhaps have someone else take a look and critique what you\u2019ve written. I\u2019ll provide a (completely random) example below. \u201cHello, my name is Ellias Baker. I\u2019ve never been a part of a reading group like this before, but I\u2019m interested in joining and experiencing this with all of you! I\u2019ve just moved here from Central Ontario, Canada, where I worked as a chef. Cooking has been my passion since my father gave me my first recipe book as a kid. I moved here in hopes to better pursue my passion in culinary, and so far it\u2019s going great! I hope I can prepare something for all of you soon.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There are times when we can write about ourselves with perfect clarity yet then become aware that we don\u2019t want to represent ourselves flaws and all. So we upgrade the reality into the fantasy and expect ourselves to be comfortable with the tall tales we tell. So a good paragraph never reveals the revolting truths if any exist. An excellent paragraph or even a perfect paragraph could still not reveal us to whom it may concern. So we tend to write about ourselves in ways that others would hope to see us rather than as we know ourselves to be. The only real answer is to tell the truth that we are willing to tell and no more. A paragraph isn\u2019t meant to go on and on. Probably just a dozen sentences will do. So create a list of topics such as the usual statistics would require and develop from these standard answers. Go deeper into how you have developed from being a mere child into a mere adult. Then express the way that you chose to make yourself into a better you than ever achieved before. From school years to what? College or University or straight into a job? Did you earn enough to save money towards something special like a car or a house or getting married and starting a family? Or did you start your own business and invest in yourself and those you employed or worked with? Did you become IT savvy with computers and the Internet, smartphones, audio and video equipment? Did you help others to become better in some way, too? Did you have any spiritual or faith interests that helped you to be better or achieve more? And what about your creative abilities or skills? Did you write stories, songs or poems and get published? Did you learn how to play an instrument? Were you artistic enough to paint or write music? And what of your family throughout the years? Were there struggles and then blessings or blessings and then struggles? And how would you want to be remembered or forgotten? : IF you can edit your thoughts to the point that you are delighted with your paragraph then maybe, just maybe, that will suffice\u2026 It won\u2019t be like a CV such as I worked here, then here then here. It will be more like THANK GOD I MADE IT HERE\u2026 because every single day is a gift\u2026 ",

If the paragraph is for a class, then I usually ask myself, \u201cDoes the teacher want a literal description of me?\u201d Ex. my height, hair color, etc. \u201cDoes the teacher want my interests?\u201d Ex. my favorite song, color, animal, etc. \u201cDoes the teacher want my personality?\u201d Ex. Am I sassy, calm, collected, argumentative, etc. If the paragraph is for a job, then I usually say something along the lines of, \u201cI am a hard working, fun loving person who is generally optimistic and very energetic. I try my best to improve every day and try to take criticism as well as I can.\u201d etc. If the paragraph is for the cover of a book, like an \u201cAbout the Author,\u201d then I usually put something about my personal life. Ex. \u201cMadelyn Hammons has written x plays, x novels, x book series, x poems, etc.\u201d Replace x with any number, then go on to talk about the personal details. Ex. how many pets I own, how many people I depend on, my nuclear family, etc. If the paragraph is for myself, then I write down items I want to improve. Ex. My handwriting, my smile, my optimism, etc. Or I\u2019ll write items I want to do. Ex. bake a specific desert, go to this country, etc. Or I\u2019ll just write my goals. Ex. help someone every day, smile to someone new, listen to music for so long, finish this assignment, etc. As I said before, there are many approaches one could take when writing about themselves and it all just depends on what the writing is for. I hope this helped. ",

From that, people guess I\u2019m not mostly of standard-issue white-bread American heritage, although they rarely guess Nordic or Bosnian; I\u2019ve found that to be both liberating and burdensome, although not in equal measures. I\u2019m extroverted and bright, with a pale heart-shaped face, large dark eyes, and a superb knowledge of makeup. People who don\u2019t know that about me think I\u2019m younger than I am, and are sometimes surprised by the life advice I give on social media.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. What is the purpose of writing the good paragraph? If it is to write it to and for yourself, I\u2019d go inside and ask your inner self, shadow side, higher self what is admirable about you. If you are wanting to writing a good paragraph for a dating site, maybe ask yourself what you are wanting to attract and knowing you want the person to be authentic and like your authentic self - if that is the case. If it is for an interview, research the strengths and qualities needed and how your unique qualities and aspects serve and are a fit. If it is for marketing, see if you can step out of your own skin and imagine you are your best friend writing about you. This can help if you find it hard to write good things about yourself. Or, you can do what I did for my amazon author page and have someone who knows you really well do it for you. You might feel uncomfortable with what they say, especially if you were raised in a culture where you are not taught to say good things about yourself because it is \u2018showing off\u2019, yet if you allow logic some space, you\u2019ll find it is hard to argue with what they are saying, and especially if it is a friend who is intelligent, practical and doesn\u2019t exaggerate. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few ways: The more detailed and personal it is, the less it will sound like any person, and the more it will be \u201cgood\u201d.In terms of the way of writing, I suggest you imitate a writer whom you admire. For example, I admire Ernest Hemingway who wrote very short sentences but with very powerful verbs. My youngest daughter is really into Stephen King, reads him a lot, and can imitate his style effectively.In terms of length, the word paragraph has many meanings. If you write your paragraph in the form of a monologue, for example, it is traditional to keep it one paragraph no matter how long it is. Some plays have paragraphs that go on for several pages since only one person is talking. I tell my students to restrict themselves to a certain number of words. But if someone is asking for one paragraph, that usually means it should be fairly short (perhaps 300 words). As a result, stick to one central point or short anecdote about yourself.Have some fun. That doesn\u2019t mean try to be funny. For me that means be creative or unusual in some way. An example would be to use a lot of metaphors (\u201cI\u2019m a dark pencil in a set of crayons.\u201d) Another might be to use interjections (\u201clike\u201d or \u201cwanna\u201d) that sound like you, whether it be in your accent or your quirky way of phrasing things.",

My way would be to just start writing things about myself, without much self-censoring, just random highlights that come quickly to mind. When there\u2019s a page or so of these, see if there are some themes that unite the random thoughts, and collate them to form a readable paragraph. During the process, see if some written items trigger more of the same or remind you of something important that was missing, and add it. Keep in mind that the reason for writing the paragraph makes a difference in focus/main theme. A school assignment has a different purpose than a cover letter for a job, for example. Also, a paragraph is not enough to do a biography, so don\u2019t try. Starting with something significant to you, build the paragraph. These days, I would also save such a thing, for review next year, to see how/if my thoughts had changed. It\u2019s why some folks keep a diary. ",

I suggest to get a journal and write about what kind of attitude you have towards your family and friends. Write something like this: James: kind, friendly and a little bit aggressive. This will help you about your personality and feelings. Next, you should see what you like to do. For example, if you like to play soccer, you are energetic. If you like to study, you are smart. Your activities depend on your characteristic. Last but not least, ask people how they think you are. Their opinions will tell you how they think about you and you will be able to write about yourself in no time. ",
