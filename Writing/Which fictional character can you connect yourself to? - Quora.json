            "answer_text": "1.Elizabeth Benett   A dysfunctional family and confusing love life coupled with quick wit thereby making (sometimes) unfair judgments and biased opinions? Yup totally connect with that 2.Carl Anheuser- 2012   Talk about being misunderstood!Throughout the movie all he did was for the benefit of humanity and yet he was always everyone ended up hating.His cold and calculating mind did nothing wrong I mean look at the situations- The bloke is literally in charge of the giant operation to save the world, and all he does is get stick from the heroes about it. They tell him off for saving only the richest people and putting them on the mega-arks, when he offers the legitimate reasoning that they actually helped pay for the boat so they deserve their precious spaces, goddamnit. He\u2019s told off for not letting everyone know about the impending apocalypse, despite the fact it would cause nothing but panicking, violence and the slowing down of the rescue efforts. Finally, and most memorably, he doesn\u2019t want to risk the safety of the ark to save one insignificant family, which is surely only logical. Everything this man does, he does to save others. I remember watching the movie and wondering this is exactly what I would have done! 3..Draco Malfoy   No I am not a proud,sarcastic ,rude bully like him.But the part of him that loves his father dearly,the part which tries his best to make his father like and appreciate him, the part of him that just wants to make his father proud of him, I connect with that. 4.Magneto   Unlike Charles who had a relatively safe childhood, Erik grew up alone in a world where mutants were looked down upon. He did all he could to ensure that the mutant kind would never feel that way. He has done some terrible things but he did have a point. 5.Coyote   Man,he was just hungry!!! 6.Katniss Everdeen   Everyone relates to her.I think. . ",
