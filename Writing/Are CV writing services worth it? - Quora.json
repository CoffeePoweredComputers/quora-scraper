            "answer_text": "Maybe\u2026 but think about it\u2026 It\u2019s tempting to want to \u201coutsource\u201d the resume writing process to someone else. Writing well can be hard, and why not give it to someone else to do? Here are some things to consider\u2026 There\u2019s value in the process. While writing your own resume can be difficult, the process can pay many dividends. Figuring out what are the most important skills, abilities, accomplishments, and strengths to emphasize on a resume, and how to say them most effectively and concisely will help you articulate them better when you\u2019re networking and interviewing.Too often, people ramble on too much when they describe their background verbally to someone. And they often give too much detail on parts of their experience that aren\u2019t so applicable to what they want to seek. Thinking those things through thoroughly for a resume prepares you well for your verbal interactions as well!Beautiful vs. Effective. While there are certainly great resume writers out there, most of them consider themselves good writers but don\u2019t understand what makes an effective resume.They can write beautifully written paragraphs that make you sound quite impressive, and the resume looks beautifully formatted. However, paragraphs in resume are almost never read. Resumes are visually scanned, looking for key pieces of information. A beautifully written paragraph that isn\u2019t read has no value!An effective resume uses short-phrases and substantive sound-bites to help the reader digest a great deal of information in that scan. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t look as beautiful, or sound as mellifluous, but gets much better results!If the resume can be beautiful AND effective, terrific! However, if given a choice, I\u2019ll take effective over beautiful every time. There are SOME resume writers that achieve both, but very few. Someone that has a significant recruiting or talent acquisition background is more likely to \u201cget it\u201d. Someone that comes primarily from a writing background, but nothing that has trained them to the realities of the recruiting or job fair process on a daily basis is not likely to get it right.There is great value in creating an effective resume yourself. If you find you just can\u2019t do it though, be careful who you select to help you! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, CV writing service is like any other service that you get. It depends on how well organize you are yourself and if you really need it or not. You can either have it get done by yourself, which is amazing if you can take care of all the requirements of employers on your resume and also make sure that you stand out. However, if you are not confident, I would humbly suggest not to take risk since it is your career we are talking about. Saving a few bucks on something that you are not confident about may bite you back. On the contrary,if you think you can do a great job of improving CV to a professional level by yourself, go for it. Hope this helps answer your question. ",

However, having a cv writer rewrite your CV is just one of the many stages. I have found out that most people have their cv reviewed by professionals but still end up not having a clue of what is written on the cv. So use a professional cv writer if you must, but make sure it is a realistic representation of you are. ",
