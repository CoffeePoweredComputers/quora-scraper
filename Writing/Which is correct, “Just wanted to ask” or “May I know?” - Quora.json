            "answer_text": "Which is correct, \u201cJust wanted to ask\u201d or \u201cMay I know?\u201d People sometimes ask a question, then say, \u201cJust wanted to ask\u201d to indicate that they were only asking out of curiosity. More likely, though, they'll say, \u201cJust asking\u201d, in a mildly dismissive way. At other times someone might preface a question with \u201cI just wanted to ask, but\u2026\u201d, as a way of introducing the question. \u201cMay I know\u201d is not idiomatic. It is old-fashioned and formal. ",
