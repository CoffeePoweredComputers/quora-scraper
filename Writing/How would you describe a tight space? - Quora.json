            "answer_text": "If I'm being me: My shoulder blades were pressed against the back of the cupboard, my chin resting on my drawn-out knees. The cupboard door was shut and it was pitch black. Everything was pitch black\u2014the name of the game was hide-and-go-seek\u2026in-the-dark. I felt something brush against my hand and I stifled a scream as I flicked my hand. My hand hit the side of the cupboard and I flinched. The noise was deafening in the eerie stillness. A nervous laugh tried to escape my mouth, but my lips were pressed tightly together and I ended up snorting. I brushed my hair out of my face and recognized the sensation I had felt on my hand. I exhaled slowly. It had been my hair, not a spider. Then I froze. I was in the laundry room, the room notorious for beetles and spiders sneaking into. I nearly kicked open the cupboard door, or at least, I would have if every part of my body had not been squished together in the cramped darkness. Please God, don't let there be spiders in this cabinet. Please God, don't let- My prayer repeated over and over in my mind. Suddenly the cupboard door was flung open and a flashlight blinded me. I screamed as my dad yelled nonsense. He tagged me and bolted out of the room in search of other victims, leaving me to calm my racing heart. If I were claustrophobic: My pulse was steadily growing faster as the walls closed in on me. They were shrinking, weren't they? I couldn't tell. Everything felt like it was getting smaller. I stretched my arms out to check. That was a mistake. My hands pressed flat against the walls. Had they done this before? I can't remember\u2026Had I checked like this when I had first gotten on this elevator? My breaths started coming out short and fast. I wasn't getting enough air in my lungs. What if I suffocated in here? There aren't any windows\u2014just a door that would only open when it got to my floor. I still had four more floors to go. Oh gosh\u2026what if the elevator broke and I was stuck in here? How long would it take the firemen to get here? Surely I would suffocate before then\u2026 I swallowed and closed my eyes. \u201cThink of big, open spaces. Big, open spaces.\u201d I repeated the mantra, envisioning a large meadow with amber grass and wildflowers. I wasn't really trapped in a box; I was in a peaceful meadow. In my mind's eye, I was able to stretch out my arms and only hit fresh, oxygen-rich air. The bell dinged and I jumped, startled out of my reverie. I sighed in relief as the doors slid open. Grabbing my suitcase, I tried to appear casual as I stepped out of the hotel elevator. (AN: The first story is a true story. I actually did freak out \u2018cuz there might've been spiders, and my dad did jump-scare us kids whenever we played hide-and-seek-in-the-dark. Also, I'm not claustrophobic and wrote the second story on the spot, without doing research first. So\u2026it might not be accurate, I guess.) :) ",
