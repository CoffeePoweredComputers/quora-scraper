            "answer_text": "You probably won\u2019t be arrested, but you certainly could be expelled. This would probably require you to pay back any loans or scholarships. It will have a negative impact on your future education and career prospects. As an academic librarian I have seen my share of \u201cpurchased\u201d homework assignments. Most of them suck. Any student capable of doing C-Level work should be absolutely mortified about how stupid they are being made to look while paying for the privilege. Take a minute to think about why you want to cheat yourself of the opportunities to learn that you are giving up by doing this. The work that you struggle through in school helps you practice critical thinking, time management, self-control, communications skills, and other things that you will need to be able to do well in any job as an adult. If you want to waste your money, look like an idiot, and put your future at risk in several different ways you probably can. It\u2019s not a good idea, though. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s illegal, but it is academic dishonesty and you could be suspended (or even expelled in extremely serious cases) if you\u2019re caught. In most schools, you\u2019ll get a zero on the assignment if you\u2019re caught in the act of plagiarizing or any form of academic dishonesty. If you\u2019re struggling with the homework, I would suggest that you get help from a friend or from your teacher/professor. It would benefit you to understand the material yourself as that will allow you to be prepared for Quizzes, Tests, and Exams. You\u2019re only hurting yourself in the long run if you cheat. ",
