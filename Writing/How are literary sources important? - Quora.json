            "answer_text": "I\u2019m in fiction but i\u2019ll answer anyways. literary sources are important cause generally, you only have one point or linearity.your statements or prose must be an upgrade of what was previously said by someone else. most literary works are records and don\u2019t reach an overall conclusion.those records may be analysed and the author of that must stipulate his methods- which are from another source and the credibility of those methods have their own records which are also referenced, now you must reference in order so you don\u2019t confuse the person analysing the works. alan watts once said life/books are references of references about those references.
