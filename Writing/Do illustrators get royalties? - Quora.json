            "answer_text": "Depends- they could, it all depends on what they or their agent negotiate with the publisher, and agree. It depends on whether not they are a contracted employee or a freelance artist. Legally they do have copyright on their work. BUT- does the publisher value the work, deem it so good that it\u2019s worth giving the artist a share of ongoing profits ie royalties? Or a fixed one time buy out fee in advance? A publisher might well say - here\u2019s the deal, this is the one off fee -don\u2019t like it it? Well, there are plenty of others who will - take it or leave it. If the artist is a full time employee (as opposed to freelance) working for the publisher then the copyright automatically resides with the employer. Would add in some areas of the media industry a lot of people are slack about issuing contracts and paperwork, and tend to make deals verbally informally over handshakes. \u00a35k to do some drawings? Yeah - sure deal thanks mate. Now, unless the deal is In writing Specifying the terms, Actually clearly assigning the copyright IN ALL TERRITORIES, ACROSS ALL MEDIA TYPES The seller will retain copyright and could demand royalties. They could crawl out of the woodwork and hold the BUYER \u201cto ransom\u201d Whether buyer OR seller do the paperwork ! READ the terms and conditions I know it\u2019s boring and \u201cuncool\u201d Don\u2019t get offended \u201c but I thought we were friends don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d GET IT CONTRACTUALLY SPELT OUT !!!!!!! ( just as important for the BUYER too!!!!) ",

            "answer_text": "Illustrators occasionally get offered royalties but it's usually instead of a fee and in payment for a book or project that is highly unlikely to generate much money. It's usually an offer to get you to do the work for nothing in the vague hope of it being a success. I'd be skeptical about any offer of royalties unless it comes with a fee as well and is from a serious publisher. A friend who has a neat idea for a book isn't in that category. Any self publisher isn't in that category either. Royalty deals that are likely to be of any real financial value to the illustrator are quite rare, but they can be very good. ",

If so, then they would likely be salaried and not entitled to royalties; if the illustrator is independent or freelance, then royalties may be negotiated between the artist and the contractor per job.
