Searching for Common Japanese Surnames: Not knowing the scope of your story, and implications for comedy, drama, horror, suspense or other genres, these are some good web sites to peruse in order to come up with something perhaps pertinent to your story. Japanese names, as I\u2019m sure you realize, involve Chinese characters which have an underlying meaning for the name itself, and can potentially have a related context to your story, or somewhat fanciful. https://japantoday.com/category/features/lifestyle/the-10-most-common-surnames-in-japan-and-their-meanings Japan's top 100 most common family names | The Japan Times The following link gives some relationships to names and what they might indicate for a families historical connection to a trade, to a samurai family or anything in between. Japanese Last Names This next one is particularly nice because it gives a long list of family names and the meanings assigned to them. Japanese Surnames As for personal names, if you have your story set 20 to 30 years in the past, given names were more rigidly followed. From the last 20 to the present, there has been a trend to adopt names in katakana, indicating that they are not common names in Japanese since katakana is used primarily for foreign words and names, and in a few instances I\u2019ve seen foreign names adopted by a native Japanese family for an offspring, even writing it in Romaji, the western alphabet. You have a lot from which to choose.MJP ",

            "answer_text": "Names don\u2019t age well in Japan. Or perhaps I should say that personal names show their age. How old is the man in your story? I assume he is from Japan. Not a Japanese person born overseas?? Different types of names were popular let\u2019s say 80 years ago. But no one would use those names now. You could pick a name that\u2019s suitable for 80-year-old man but if you gave that to someone who is 25 in your story, it would be ridiculous. It would be like giving a 25 year old the name \u201cWilber\u201d. Here is a list of the top 200 most popular family names. Any one of these would be suitable as a \u201clast\u201d name - - you understand that Japanese family names come first, right?? \u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u306e\u540d\u5b57\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 Here is a list of the most popular personal names decade by decade for the last 100 years. So depending on how old your man is, you can pick the correct decade: \u540d\u524d\u306e\u6d41\u884c100\u5e74\u53f2\u3000\u6226\u524d\u306f\u300c\u6e05\u300d\u3001\u6226\u5f8c\u306f\u2026\uff5c\u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30e1\uff01\uff5cNIKKEI STYLE Unfortunately you\u2019re going to have to ask the help of a Japanese person to get the reading for these names as only the Chinese character is supplied in these lists. And you can not click on the character to copy it. But these lists are a great resource. If you decide on a selection and can\u2019t get any help with the reading contact me again and I will try to figure out what it is. And as a last resort, I could type the character and get someone in Japan to read it for me. Good luck! ",
