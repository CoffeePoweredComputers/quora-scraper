            "answer_text": "Robert Jordan built an incredible world, with an intriguing history, full of diverse characters, populations, terrains. Sometimes his books resemble travalogues so real does the landscape seem - even the passage of time for the various voyages/trips are realistic. Also, his overall story arc is interesting, including all the side stories and flashbacks to the past. HOWEVER!!! His characters never really evolve. We are TOLD they do, but we don\u2019t see it. There are some really ridiculous stupidities (the spanking - I\u2019m sorry????). The idea that powerful women who can wield magic would somehow ignore all known patterns of feminine group behavior and create a hierarchy based purely on who the most powerful magic user is? WTF, Jordan! That\u2019s ridiculous! Plus, Jordan\u2019s actual writing style isn\u2019t the best. I sped thru these books because I wanted very much to see what happened - ergo, great plot. I cared about the characters even tho they weren\u2019t exactly gaining much maturity. But when I went back to re-read, after knowing what would happen? Couldn\u2019t do it, sadly. I prefer Brandon Sanderson as a writer. When Robert Jordan died Sanderson was picked by Jordan\u2019s widow to finish the series, and so with Jordan\u2019s notes Sanderson did so. He\u2019s done a superb job of it and we therefor have Robert Jordan\u2019s complete vision intact :D Thank goodness! BTW, it\u2019s been picked up for a mini-series which I think could be amazing!

            "answer_text": "\u2026 Because the \u201cliterary world\u201d exists as a sop to the wounded pride of \u2018artistes\u2019 who never wrote anything anyone would want to read unless they were paid to do so. The Wheel of Time was so massively popular that, when Jordan finished the trilogy in the third book, the vast majority of his fans said \u201cLolwut? NO! Keep going, we\u2019ll tell you when you can stop!\u201d And, being a professional bestselling author rather than an artiste, he happily obliged\u2026for the rest of his life. From a literary perspective, this kinda ruined the structure of the story and significantly undermined one of the major themes, especially when a different author was brought in to write the final book. But that\u2019s okay. The original trilogy wasn\u2019t effete, but it was art. But the literary world isn\u2019t about art, it\u2019s about wounded pride about nobody wanting to read what they write.
