            "answer_text": "Assuming this is your first book ever being published, you will want to introduce yourself. Always make yourself known before the first sentence is over. State important and relevant information about you, such as your name or pen name, what you are (an author), what you write (genre or theme), how long you\u2019ve been writing (experience) and what you\u2019re promoting. Depending on the type of book you\u2019re publishing, match or convey the tone of your book in your invitation. If it\u2019s a mystery, add some cryptic things about your book or about the potential interests that your recipients would have. If it\u2019s a comedy, be funny. If it\u2019s an adventure, be jolly. Act as though you\u2019re writing a blurb about your blurb you made for the book, and the blurb is about either you, the audience\u2019s preparation for the book or the book itself. Good luck with your new book! ",

And look at your later from the other person\u2019s point of view, why should they give a damn about you and your book? What would make you as that person, set aside some time to come to a book launch? Everyone has the same mantra \u2018What\u2019s In It For Me,\u2019 find a way to make it worth their while and you\u2019ll have more people showing up ",
