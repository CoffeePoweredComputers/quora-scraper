            "answer_text": "I won\u2019t pretend that I\u2019m a top student, it\u2019s not something I would like to put a label on, but I\u2019m someone in her third year of B.A. who\u2019s improved her academic performance by a simple change of mindset (I promise, there are no inspirational quotes in this answer). I used to believe, although I was good at languages, that essays were just not my call. Oddly enough, I enjoyed creative writing (my grades were usually excellent in it) and I wasn\u2019t a bad student, it simply turned out that what I handed in always got somewhere above the passing grade and never truly stood out. Crossing the bridge between the first and second year of college, I realized a few things: I wasn\u2019t interested in what I was writing (the main issue). I mainly repeated what had been said in class, because essays were just homework to me. Now I have a different approach, I\u2019m not repeating, I\u2019m using. What we learn in class is just the basis on which you will build your thesis and your arguments. Take what has been taught to you into account, but show you\u2019ve got more than that. Do some research on your topic and look for elements which interest you and for a subject on which you would like to argument further. Don\u2019t stick to the class, it won\u2019t get you more than an average grade if your college is demanding.I didn\u2019t bother about vocabulary or grammar (in English at least). My knowledge of the language was quite beyond the writing skills I showed in my work. Now, you might believe you are using all your capacities, but you can always improve. If you are just getting a passing grade, I would say that your writing needs polishing as much as the content of your essay does. Think of more interesting phrasings and don\u2019t separate two things that can be said in a sentence (I see this all the time\u2026students write in four sentences what they could have expressed in one, just to add more words: Don\u2019t. The teacher cares more about your writing ability than about the number of words in your work.). If your topic is interesting enough (see above) and you know it well enough, the length won\u2019t be a problem for you. When you write a sentence that you don\u2019t feel entirely satisfied with it, don\u2019t leave it but change it to a better one. One sentence in a 2000 words essay might seem like a detail, but clumsiness and mistakes stand out. You know your capacities, but they have to show up in your essay as well.I correct some simple things. Use synonyms. They\u2019re your best friends in an essay. Polish the beginnings and ends of your paragraphs. Make sure you write \u201cI am\u201d and not \u201cI\u2019m\u201d (simple mistakes). Don\u2019t miss out on a good overall structure and be careful about the font, size and spacing you need to use. Think of a good title, it shouldn\u2019t be too large. It will also help you understand what your essay is about (it seems stupid but we sometimes realize afterwards that we don\u2019t actually know what is our common thread).I should spend more time researching than writing. When you start working on an essay, you shouldn\u2019t sit down and starting writing sentence by sentence, while looking at the book, the course and stuff you found on the internet. That\u2019s what you should do beforehand. Read, think and analyse. When you\u2019ve got a very good idea or phrasing that you know would be an excellent addition to your essay, write it down. But truly, you need to be able to sit down without any material and write. If you can do that, it means you\u2019re ready to go and can start writing and using the tools that are already familiar to you. (It\u2019s just a tip, you don\u2019t actually need to write everything from memory, just don\u2019t rely on your books exclusively).My essay is not in the hands of my quotations. I\u2019ve noticed this in my work but also in other people\u2019s. Quotations are not the basis of your arguments, your arguments are the main thing. Quotations are here only to illustrate them. They\u2019re not an escape route in case you have nothing to say. Example of average writing: \u201cIn Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, the main character Elizabeth has a talent for repartee. Quotation. She has wit and she shows intelligence.\u201d This could be an intro on what comes along later and it\u2019s not very bad, but as such, it\u2019s simplistically written, it has no arguments and the quotation is not even introduced but mainly here as an escape path. Example of better writing: \u201cIn Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice, the main character Elizabeth has quick wit and shows a talent for repartee which tends to destabilize Mr. Darcy. Quotation. Rest of the argument.\u201d It\u2019s still fairly simple, short and just the beginning of the argument but it\u2019s at least more than just stating the obvious; that Elizabeth has a talent for words, which we all know at that point.These are just my own suggestions, but I hope they can be useful to other people, as they have been to me. I saw very quickly a distinctive difference in the quality of my essays. ",

            "answer_text": "We pick something we are interested in. Even if we must write about a specific book, we pick an aspect of it that is interesting. If you can\u2019t do this, get interested in life and art.We come up with a clear idea, a thesis. An essay is not a book report. A book report just reports what is in the book, that is, it is just a summary. An essay or research paper makes a point that is credible, though it may be hard to defend. In a more free form essay, this may be a theme, not a thesis.We make sure the idea is new. We say something that has not been said before.Either before or after we write, we create an outline. We make sure that we introduce our topic, we lay out a logical argument, and we present a clear conclusion.If the essay includes research, we present positions that both agree and disagree with our own view, then connect the dots from other views to our own conclusions.If we do research, we make sure to cover everything relevant that has been published on the topic.We know how to find reliable sources, and we use them.We edit. We remove what is not relevant. We ensure that everything that is relevant is included. We make sure that the connection between each point and our own thesis is clear.We edit each paragraph, ensuring that the first or second sentence of the paragraph is a topic sentence, that the sentence order makes sense, and that each sentence is clear in meaning and grammatical.We proofread to correct spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and typos.We might also: read it aloud, to make sure it sounds good and is clear, and to catch more errors; allow a friend to read it for clarity, or to help with editing and proofreading.I\u2019ve been doing this for 40 years, since I learned how in high school. I am an author and teacher now, but I\u2019ll never stop being a student. There is always more to learn. This work is worth it, because writing this way doesn\u2019t just make a good paper. It makes the writer into a better person. As Francis Bacon put it in \u201cOf Studies\u201d: [Studies] perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need proyning, by study; and studies themselves, do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience.
