Until I read the summary of the plot and understood what it was about. Not a story of true love overcoming adversity or even making a bit of headway until succumbing to greater forces. Won\u2019t spoil it for anyone who still wants to see it, but it\u2019s not about those things at all. But the book it\u2019s based on, by Ian McEwan, is about as self-indulgent as a writer can get. \ud83d\udc4e  ",

( it was an R rating.)My friend and I traded books back and forth and we had read the book. It was scary. I was unervered because my mother thought we had seen a Disney film and then I had to cover that up when I was afraid to go to bed that night. No good deed goes unpunished. ",
