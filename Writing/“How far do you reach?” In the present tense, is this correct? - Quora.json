            "answer_text": "Hi! Your sentence, \u2018How far do you reach?\u2019 is grammatically correct if you are talking about a routine habit. If that is not the case, then, it is incorrect as you have placed a \u2018question mark\u2019 in the end. Also, \u2018How far do you reach\u2019 sounds futuristic and suggests that the speaker is looking forward to something (as in \u2018how far do you reach will be revealed only after the race is over\u2019). If you intend to ask someone how far they go- say for a walk, or something in similar context, then, the correct formation would be- \u201cHow far do you go?\u201d. You may also consider rephrasing it according to the context as follows: How long does it take to reach? (Simple Present using the auxiliary verb \u2018do\u2019)How far have you reached? (Present Perfect Tense)How far did you reach? (Past Tense)I hope it will help you! ",
