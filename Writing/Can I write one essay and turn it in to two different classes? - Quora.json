            "answer_text": "When I was in my doctoral program I was told to build synergies between my papers. Using this as my benchmark I would say you are short changing yourself UNLESS you make meaningful changes or tweaks to one of the two papers. Can you take an opposing view? Can you change the underlying assumptions inherent in your work? You are in school to grow and develop as a person, not to simply graduate. While you can turn in the same essay for two classes, how is doing that contributing to your intellectual development? Don't take the lazy way out, challenge yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "It may be fine with your teachers - but what is your school\u2019s self-plagiarism policy? At my high school, all of our assignments were run through a plagiarism checker. If I'd turned one paper in to a teacher, who ran the checker, and then the same paper in to another teacher, my paper would have been flagged as plagiarized. Even if it's okay with your teachers, I'd recommend looking into your school\u2019s policy. You'll find that often teachers don't get the last say in these matters. ",

This alone makes it a risky move for you. You would be well advised to be very sure you\u2019ve understood them correctly. At the university level, you may well find that this is prohibited entirely, regardless of what the professor says. ",

I would start a paper in one language and translate it into the others. It was a wonderful experience because I could see the nuances between these languages and how the attempt to say the same thing in each one could go a bit sideways. Of course, the slight deviations did not really matter. I had a fine paper to turn into each class. ",

Explore each in depth emphasizing one point of view as primary, and you\u2019ll be able to discuss it a lot better. ",
