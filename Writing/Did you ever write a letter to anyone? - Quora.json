            "answer_text": "When I was in 8th grade, I wrote a letter addressed to Obama and gave it to my English teacher to send it as she said she would. I wrote about the similarities in our backgrounds and how it makes me proud that someone like him made it to where he was and so on. I don\u2019t think my teacher sent it though because she always tried to criticize him and plus when I had asked her 8 years later she said she actually didn\u2019t to which I wasn\u2019t much surprised but kind of disgusted. But my views on Obama started to change when I heard he called the previous Ethiopian regime a democratically elected one. I do not entirely blame the guy but BUT it really really angered me considering the fact the on of the main reasons I came to the US was to get away from that regime. Obama would have done a lot better if he addressed the issue without any equivocation - the issue being that the regime was a blood-thirsty and conniving one (even more so than one might actually think) that took whatever means necessarily to wipe out in standard and uniform manner its actual or perceived adversaries - be they young, old, female, male, disabled, abled and et cetera .

            "answer_text": "Yes I write many letters. I went to a church camp a while ago, now I go every year. The camp counselors are not allowed to give out their numbers but I asked one for her address, now we\u2019re pen pals. Writing letters is quite enjoyable if you ask me. I also write letters to a lady at my church, we have a program called prayer angels, the youth pray for an adult and that adult prays for the youth. We\u2019re supposed to keep in touch but I don\u2019t really talk to adults because, well, it gives me anxiety. So I write to her, and she sometimes writes back. I enjoy writing letters honestly, and you may find this weird but licking the envelope to seal it is fun too. ~Aspen ",

I've written a letter to almost each and every person close to me. Sometimes I make little colorful origami envelopes in which I write letters for those very special to me. Those envelopes look exactly like these.  (Image Source: Origami Japan) The smile on their faces makes it worth every word. If someone is special to you, one of the best ways to express that is through a letter. Call me old-school but making it personal like that is really sweet. R aka Early Owl ",
