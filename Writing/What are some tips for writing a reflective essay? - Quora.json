Perhaps it doesn\u2019t cross our mind until and unless it\u2019s a major issue, but the process of learning does not stop for one single day. Well, that is how life goes. As a student, you may learn tonnes of interesting stuff every day, but how many of them are really leaving a mark on your mind?

Has that happened to you while writing an academic paper? Don\u2019t worry. No one is going to arrest you if your answer is no. But you must know there\u2019s something wrong with your approach if you have never had that kind of involvement in any of those projects.  In simpler words, reflective writing can be described as: The writer\u2019s response to experiences, events, new information or opinionsThe writer\u2019s response to thoughts and emotionsA process of thinking to explore one\u2019s learningA chance to obtain self-knowledgeAn opportunity to have a better understanding of what one has learntAn opportunity to improve writing skillsA way of understanding the underlying meaning of what is being taught.How Do You Write A Reflective Essay Or Assignment?
