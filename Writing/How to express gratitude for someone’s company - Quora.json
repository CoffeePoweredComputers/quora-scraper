I tell the person \u201cI appreciate you\u201c, \u201cI\u2019m grateful for you\", \u201cYou mean a lot to me\", or \u201cI enjoy being with you\u201d. Life is short. Tomorrow is never promised. All we have is the present. Take nothing for granted. If you care about someone and appreciate them, tell them now. It really is that simple. Sadly, some people are afraid to express their feelings. Don't let the opportunity pass you by. ",
