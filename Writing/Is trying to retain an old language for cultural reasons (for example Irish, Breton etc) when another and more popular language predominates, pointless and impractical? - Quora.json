            "answer_text": "\u201cIs trying to retain an old language for cultural reasons (for example Irish, Breton etc) when another and more popular language predominates, pointless and impractical?\u201d The short answer is \u2018no\u2019. Language is a major component of cultural identity, and retaining the language adds to the culture richness of any ethnic group. While I am glad that I am a native English speaker, since it has become the lingua franca of the internet and international relations, I firmly believe that every effort should be taken to keep languages like Breton, Choctaw, Irish, Navajo, and other marginalized languages alive. Should Icelander give up Icelandic because it only has about half a million speaker? Certainly not. The soul of every culture is expressed in its language. To lose the language is to lose much the culture. Do we really want to live in a dystopic world of homogenized human beings? That would definitely not be a good thing, Certainly, more languages will die as the world becomes more and more interconnected, but the more languages that we can retain only adds to the richness of the human experience.
