            "answer_text": "First things first. A ball pen which is light in color when bought, writes dark later due to the smoothness of the nib that was created out of writing for longer periods. So what we need for a pen to write dark is the nib of an old pen which writes dark and whose ink ran out. The next step is simple. Replace new pen nib with old pen nib. Voila! :D If u don't have a dark writing pen, go to any shop and exchange a new pen for the pen with the guy sitting behind counter. ;D It always writes dark. Sometimes if the new pen with old nib stops writing after few lines, it means that the old ink in the nib is finished and the new ink didn't reach the ball yet. So jerk the pen in downward motion few times, to force the ink to drop on to the ball. It will work again ! ",

            "answer_text": "A ballpoint pen will typically not write dark for one of two reasons: The ink just isn't dark by natureThis usually isn't the case, as ballpoints typically have pretty dark ink.Perhaps you can find a replacement cartridge that's darker.The ink is not flowing well (the pen has \u201cdried up\u201d)In this case, if there is still ink left in the pen, you may be able to get it flowing again.To do so, take the ballpoint cartridge out, and hold the metal tip over the edge for a few seconds, rotating it as you do.The heat from the flame should be enough to reconstitute the ink and get your ballpoint going again!I hope this helps! :) ",
