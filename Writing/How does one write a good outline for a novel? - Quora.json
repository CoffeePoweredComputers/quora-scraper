            "answer_text": "Several methods exist for coming up with an outline for a novel, and none of them is better or worse than any other.  Whatever works for you is the best way. Some writers begin by developing their characters on index cards; others start by identifying the climax and writing toward it; some do full-fledged outlines right off the bat, and another group simply writes whatever comes to mind without outlining at all. My approach is to write the entire rough draft first and outline it later.  The outline helps me reorganize the piece and see all kinds of problems that the full-blown draft obscures. The important thing, in my opinion, is to ensure that the outline does not get in the way of the creative flow of raw material.  That's why I do the rough draft first and outline it later rather than trying to anticipate where the writing will take me. http://slingingthebull.com/category/essays-on-the-art-and-craft-of-writing/ ",
