I know that many people imagine their time is so precious that they can\u2019t waste any (but don\u2019t mind wasting yours)\u2026 So \u201cyou\u201d becomes \u201cu\u201d and \u201clater\u201d amounts to \u201cl8r\u201d\u2026and how much time have you saved? While many prefer to skip subject pronouns how could discriminate between \u201c(I) have signed the contract(!)\u201d and \u201chave (you) signed the contract(?) ? Even if grammatical correctness is not your first priority proper punctuation can be really helpful as here: you really love her! or you really love her? It surely does make a difference, doesn\u2019t it? ",
