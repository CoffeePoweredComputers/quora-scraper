            "answer_text": "That\u2019s probably something you could learn in 15 minutes a day, every day for two or three months. Type things into Microsoft Word and set it to grammar check. Reference a grammar book such as Elements of Style to research more deeply the concepts you don\u2019t recognize. Typing things you typically think of would save you time because you are studying where you make the most mistakes. The employers are probably talking about industry/professional specific language. There are many and also with specific vocabulary. That\u2019s what is probably good to ask in advance what kind of written skills that they need (project management, computer networking, software engineering, business analysis, etc.) I went back to school for a few night school courses to solve that; I learned to write for systems analysis and design and I took it with me wherever I worked afterwards.
