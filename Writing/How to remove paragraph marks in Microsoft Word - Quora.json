            "answer_text": "From the answers already offered, you can see that ordinary text is just the starting point and that extra displays are available to you. Even so, a paragraph mark is showing a gap line between paragraph text and not all paragraphs will be in the same font and text size, so you may get different paragraph gap sizes, too. You may want to highlight the paragraph gap line and test it at different font sizes to confirm the reality is there, but not always remembered... should that be a factor in the adjustments of a whole page. You could adjust paragraph gap heights by adjusting the text size and style eg bold or bold and italic... so as to get a few lines available at the end of a page that otherwise may overlap to the following page, or adjust the header and footer settings, or the main title size, or the paragraph titles... I use WORDPAD and just for testing purposes, selected and highlighted 2 blank lines below a poem title, both being in Times New Roman and size 16 and in bold, yet when I selected the Format option, then font, to see that confirmed, I switched to size 28 and the line gaps immediately increased in height. So it may help you to be aware not only of text size, but that different fonts have different heights and widths for their character sets as well as for bold and italic on or off.  A further factor that could be considered, is whether you use A4 layouts or some other page setting and then whether you adjust the page width, so as to reduce the number of lines created on a page.  Just some things I consider now and then to save on printing costs...  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Do you want to get rid of it on the screen, or actually get rid of the paragraphs? There is an icon on the home tab, paragraph section, that looks like a backward P, which is the paragraph symbol. If you click it, it will show or hide the white space symbols like paragraphs, tabs, and space.  If you want to get rid of formatting attached to the paragraph, you can select the paragraph, go to the Styles section on the home tab, and click the drop down list: there is an option to clear formatting. If you want to get rid of actual paragraphs while keeping the line breaks, you can search for ^p (caret P - the caret is on the 6 key on most keyboards) and replace it with ^l (caret L). I\u2019ve had to do that for some documents. Not often, though. ",
