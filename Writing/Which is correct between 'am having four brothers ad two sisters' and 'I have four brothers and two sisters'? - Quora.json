If you in fact have 4 brothers and 2 sisters, then your statement is correct; if not, not. You can\u2019t tell whether a particular statement is correct simply by looking at the statement itself; you have to compare it to reality. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI have\u2026\u201d is correct. \u201cTo have\u201d in this sense is a Stative verb, so the present tense does actually tell about the present, and the present continuous tense is not normally used. By contrast, most English verbs are Dynamic verbs, the \u201cpresent tense\u201d is a misnomer and tells what often/usually/habitually happens, and to tell about the present you need the present continuous tense (\u201cI am doing\u2026\u201d).
