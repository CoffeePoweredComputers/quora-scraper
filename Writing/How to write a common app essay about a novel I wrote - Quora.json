            "answer_text": "That sounds like a fascinating topic for a common application essay, and one that I\u2019ve never seen before even though I have seen hundreds of common application essays. You could start out by having a scene from the novel, then tell them that this is a scene from your novel, and tell them the title. All novels come from imagination, but they also come from your experience. Since the common application essay is a true story about something you care about and what you have done about it, write a true story about why you wrote this particular novel and why you wrote a novel at all. What well known novel is your novel similar to? What category would you put it into? Historical fiction? Romance? Suspense? What authors do you admire?Who supported you? How did you pick the topic for the novel? What is your writing history? How did you set a schedule so that you would get it done? How long did it take you? What was your editing process like? How many times have you edited it? How many pages is it?What are your plans for publication? How does this relate to what you want to study in college? All these might be questions that you would want to answer in your college application essay. Remember, in the end your goal is to tell them a true story that will help them see you as a person who could contribute enthusiastically to their college and graduate. ",
