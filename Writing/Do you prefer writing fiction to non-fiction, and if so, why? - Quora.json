            "answer_text": "Fiction, definitely. Although I will admit, for all the fictional creative writing classes I\u2019ve taken while attending college, several of my short stories were inspired by non-fictional events which I then re-wrote and slightly edited for the purposes of storytelling. In many of my other stories, I will take real-life events and experiences and fictionalize them to be more entertaining, more suspenseful, or just more interesting in general. So while I may be writing something fiction, its inspiration gives it relevancy and believability for the reader to accept. I also feel like there\u2019s a kind of freedom that comes with writing fiction, as evidenced by the wide variety of genres (dystopian fiction, science fiction, fantasy fiction, etc.), although this can make writing more challenging. You have the freedom to do anything, be anyone, but the challenges are dictated by the universe you set the story in. For example, a fictional story that takes place in our reality still has to obey certain rules like physics (you can\u2019t have people jumping off buildings and not falling), the criminal law (someone who commits a high-profile crime will likely try to cover their tracks), and probability to be real (a seven-year-old becoming an instant billionaire by selling lemonade? Not likely), to name a few. Of course, there are thousands of other stories not set in our reality that don\u2019t have to obey these rules specifically, but the other ones created by the authors to ensure a sense of believability. While this does have the potential to lead to a plothole (because an author forgot to take a rule into account), it is sometimes the inevitable side effect of fictional writing, but often we as readers can suspend our belief to overlook these flaws because the majority of the story is successful and enjoyable. Non-fiction stories can certainly achieve the same entertainment that a fictional story can, but from a writing standpoint, the appeal of letting my imagination take over for those few fleeting moments while my fingers are barely able to keep up over a keyboard is perhaps the best escape from reality.

Within that story was something real I was relating to. I wrote a historical fiction piece about the shootings at Kent State University on May 4, 1970. Some will recall that horrific day when the United States National Guard opened fire on students protesting the war in Vietnam and the invasion of Cambodia. Four students were killed and nine were injured. I was thirteen years old at the time. It made an impact. When I fictionalized that story, I was there in my mind. I saw the violence, not on a television screen but in my mind and memory. Fiction which capitalizes on my own experiences and emotions is what makes me, the humble author, end the story with, \u201cWow.\u201d The Message: Historical Flash Fiction by cam ",

Or Damn, why it happened ?? Or godddd how lucky they were:) , a non fictional story won't shut your all these thoughts down like, whatever , it was just a story\u2026.",

            "answer_text": "I used to teach literature teenagers, and one of the most frustrating things was to hear them dismiss fiction as being \u201cnot real.\u201d The fact is, fiction\u2014genre fiction or general fiction\u2014is an attempt to give the human experience narrative. Whether the characters are fictional or not does not change the fact that they are \u201creal\u201d to our intellect and emotions as we are reading or writing them. And just because a story is dubbed \u201cnon-fiction\u201d doesn\u2019t mean a fictional narrative hasn\u2019t been superimposed on real events\u2014anybody who has ever heard a compulsive liar narrate a story in which she was right and the rest of the world was out to get her understands what I mean. Because fiction isn\u2019t \u201cdocumented fact\u201d it often gets a bad rap\u2014people like my students assume that it\u2019s easy to \u201cjust make stuff up\u201d and more difficult to \u201ctell it like it is.\u201d This is, in fact, the exact opposite of what\u2019s true. Building a world\u2014even a world in contemporary fiction requires a real use of intelligence and creativity. Again, look at your compulsive liar\u2014it would have been a lot harder for her to write a fictional romance in which someone NOT like her is the heroine than it is for her to talk about the time someone tried to screw her over at work. I\u2019ve written a lot about this\u2014here\u2019s one of my more recent guest blog posts: Genre Ripples by Amy Lane but I\u2019ve strayed from the question. Which one do I prefer? Fiction. Fiction to me is more real, more intellectually and emotionally engaging, and more fulfilling than nonfiction. I blog five nights a week and it\u2019s the easiest part of my writing regime. When I have extra time\u2014and extra creativity\u2014buzzing through my veins, I write fan fiction or ficlets of my own characters. That\u2019s not nearly so easy\u2014but I love it so much more because it takes a bigger part of my soul. ",

It's work. Hard work. And unless you put in the work, you have nothing. I don't know why we recognize non-fiction as work, but we have these lofty ideas about fiction, as if the muses must visit us and dictate stories in flashes of divine inspiration. You're never going to hear a newspaper or magazine writer claim she has writer\u2019s block, or that she's waiting for inspiration. Professionals can't afford to do that, and they know they'd get laughed out of the newsroom if they began talking about writing the way fiction writers do. Non-fiction also forces writers to develop research skills, study human nature, and really listen to the way people speak, which is crucial to writing believable dialog. ",

A small boy caught the figure of a heavy man thumping the ground while passing through... It was the pity that he wanted to see in the faces of the neighborhood, murmuring about how a good man like him could get injured, thought to consult him for any support at the sight of his injured hand...

Non fictional writings are generally the result of the experiences which cause other people to learn new social interactions, psychology and history etc. It expands the very minds of the people and make them more receptive to the natural world. It keeps them from flourishing in the fantasies and allows them to live in the real World. Non fictional stories exposes a person to the real World.

I love the DREAM, that makes me THINK and FEEL, ANALYZE, and question this LIFE. There\u2019s nothing like it in all the world. Fiction, for me, is a doorway to fantastic possibilities, the ultimate adventure. :-) ",
