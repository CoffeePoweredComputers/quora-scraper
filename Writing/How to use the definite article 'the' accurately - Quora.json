They might know because you mentioned it in the previous sentence, and now you are referring back to the same one: I met a man last week. The man grew up in the same town as me. The might know because it is universal: Look at the sun. They might know because it is modified to make it definite: I am looking for the jacket (that I left here yesterday).

They might know because it\u2019s unique by being superlative: the tallest man in my class; the largest country in the world; the first man on the moon.
