            "answer_text": "Great question! Shakespeare is, quite simply, the Wayne Gretzky of the writing rink. Lemme \u2018splain: During my graduate studies, my Shakespeare professor guided me through an independent study of the OTHER major writers during the Elizabethan Age (the period when Shakespeare lived and wrote). I was (and still am) a huge Shakespeare nut, so he suggested this exploration would deepen and broaden my appreciation for the Bard of Avon (one of old Willy\u2019s most common nicknames). Boy, was he right. I could walk you through the play-by-play (pun definitely intended) analysis we did of more than a dozen works by Marlowe, Jonson, Dekker, Kyd, Ford and others; I could lay out for you the historical, literary and religious resources from which they all drew inspiration; and I could provide you with comparisons of individual verses, images, themes and plots. -Or- I could just return to my Gretzky metaphor and share the conclusions I drew after that semester of study. Since this is Quora (where brevity is oft both the soul of wit and the mother of appreciation), I\u2019ll do the latter. Christopher Marlowe rivaled Shakespeare in \u201cplot\u201d \u2014 but his verse was weak. Ben Jonson wrote verse almost as gorgeous as Shakespeare\u2019s, but his plots were pretty flat. Now, these writers (and the others named above) were the literary equivalents of your typical NHL player. ALL of them great skaters. Many of them lightning fast. Many able to handle the puck with incredible precision. Many can read the defense like a comic book, and shoot with laser-like accuracy. But NONE of them had ALL of these talents rolled into one guy. Until Gretzky. Shakespeare is like that. My professor helped me see that in an incredibly talented league of literary skaters and scorers, there was one guy on the ice that was just playing an entirely different game. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually have a more outrageous claim. Shakespeare is not only the greatest literary artist to have ever written in the English language\u2014but the greatest who will ever do so. Here\u2019s why. He was working at a time when it was still possible (barely) for one mind to acquire a basic mastery of all areas of human knowledge. And so to write out of a full knowledge of history, science, manners, medicine, politics, war, literature, etc. Almost immediately after Shakespeare\u2019s time comes an era of knowledge inflation, and hence the necessity of specialization, when no one person\u2014no matter how great an intellect\u2014could know virtually everything that their society knew about such a wide variety of subjects, and hence to write in a way that was informed by the breadth of all knowledge. Shakespeare is a special case. After his time they tore down the great Colosseum of knowledge and replaced it with a bunch of small theaters. Shakespeare was the last and greatest to ever appear on the single stage. ",
