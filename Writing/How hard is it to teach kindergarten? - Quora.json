            "answer_text": "I have taught kindergarten for 20 years. I have watched lots of fellow teachers leave kindergarten for other grades. They often say, \u201ckindergarten is too much work\u201d or \u201cthe kids are too needy.\u201d Kindergarten is all about organization. There is so much prep. You cannot tell the kids to turn to page 154 in their textbook. There is no way. You have to tear page 154 out of each book (30 books). Often there is no textbook at all. You are responsible for finding curriculum to teach the standards. If you are having a bad day, you cannot let it show. You cannot give the kids busy work. You have to be smiling and cheerful all the time. It is hard when you are pmsing or sick. It is not uncommon to have students who have never held a pencil or students who cannot recognize their own name. It isn\u2019t uncommon to have students who cannot speak your language. They spend the whole year trying to learn and speak the language taught at school. One very difficult thing is telling unaware parents that their child is autistic or special ed. You are the first person to give bad news. Some parents are shocked and angry, \u201cHe is not autistic! He just learned I talk last year!\u201d Yes, that is another sign of autism. It is terrible to see parents turn down services because they refuse to admit their child has a disability. By 3rd grade, most parents have to admit there is a problem. I love kindergarten! It is a great grade! Be aware it is not all about learning shapes and coloring bears. In today\u2019s kindergarten, students are expected to leave reading. We teach nouns, verbs, adjectives and paragraph writing. To teach kindergarten, one must be very dedicated. You also need to spend a lot of money to get your classroom ready for all your students. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A It is hard. For many it will be their first time learning how to behave in a group, and you will be responsible to start teaching them academic basics from day one. If you have the heart and temperament to help these young people adjust and learn, it is also rewarding. Rewarding enough to make every bit of effort it requires a joy. When I first returned to regular school after running the alternative school, kindergarten in our city was still half day. There wasn\u2019t enough time between AM and PM groups for the teachers and their assistants to have lunch and a plan period. So both morning kindergarten rooms came to me for 20 minutes before leaving. The only place I had could put them was sitting in rows across the back of my room. And I was responsible to release them to their rides and know that each one actually went with an adult allowed to take them. Then the entire afternoon group would come to me for 20 minutes before their teachers would pick them up to go to their regular classes. It was a great year! We did stories and poetry. I introduced them to science and social studies. We learned and laughed together. Then I had the joy of watching them grow up each year and teaching them again before they moved on to middle school. It isn\u2019t easy. It is high quality, high reward work. ",
