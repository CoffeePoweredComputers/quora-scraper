            "answer_text": "I read the entire Rougon-Macquart series (minus Le Docteur Pascal, which I\u2019m cherishing as my last novel in the series). My favorites are Germinal, L\u2019Assommoir, Le Ventre de Paris, and La Bete Humaine. Germinal has one of the few likable main characters and has a dramatic and realistic story about striking mine workers; L\u2019Assommoir is a pretty grim book about the descent of a working class woman into poverty and alcoholism; Le Ventre de Paris has some lively descriptions of the food markets in Paris; and La Bete Humaine is like an early murder mystery with a pretty convincing portrait of a sociopath.
