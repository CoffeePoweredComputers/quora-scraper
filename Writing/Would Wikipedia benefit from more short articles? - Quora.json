            "answer_text": "In general, I'm okay with short articles. I have started a fair number. The constraints on notability derive mostly from the question of \"are there enough sources to actually write something interesting, useful and factually verifiable?\". Without sources to base the articles on, the reader shouldn't really trust that they are accurate. The more interesting part of the question is the suggestion that notability ought to be replaced by a \"at least 10 different people spend at least 30 seconds each reading an article last month\" test. Wikipedia editors try to not pay too much attention to the level of readership. This month, Justin Bieber's article has had about 172,000 views while the article on Socrates has had 136,000 views. The public's attention is fickle and fashion-driven and is a poor way to determine whether something is of lasting historical significance. There is a duty to help preserve knowledge that is important now so people in the future can see it too, rather than just tossing the article because it isn't popular. It is for this reason that notability tends to be driven more by sources rather than views. ",
