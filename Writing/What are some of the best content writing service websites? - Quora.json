            "answer_text": "What\u2019s your budget and your goals? This will dictate what type of website content writing service is best. If you\u2019re cheap, use a service that\u2019s inexpensive like Hirewriters, TextBroker or Crowd Content. I wouldn\u2019t have really high expectations for conversion though, as these sites only pay their writers $1 or so per post. You have to ask yourself what kind of professional writers can pay their own personal bills earning only a few dollars an hour in the United States. How much time did they spend writing your content? What\u2019s their expertise, really, if this is all they earn? How likely are they going to be to offer you a revision or any level of customer service? Companies in the mid-range like Triassic Media Group or Dang Designs offer something in the middle. Great content written by expert writers on highly functional websites. There aren\u2019t any promises about the millions of conversions you\u2019ll have or how you\u2019ll outrank everyone else on the planet, but the prices are more realistic. There\u2019s a focus on quality that outlasts any Google algorithm change. You\u2019ll get monthly content written just for your company and not maintain the cost of hassle of having to staff your own marketing department. It\u2019s cheaper and it works. There are more expensive options, of course, where you may pay tens of thousands of dollars a month to generate content, to check its performance and \u201cguarantee\u201d results. However, can anyone guarantee results. Sure, doing something will generate better results than doing nothing. But I\u2019m weary of those types of promises. Too many companies overspend on marketing/advertising and these services and get little in terms of actual results. They may get a spammy website or close their doors. I think creating a successful business requires more than just a SEO strategy or paying a high price for online marketing. It requires creating a highly credible website, developing a sales pipeline that works, ongoing content marketing/blogs and being visible in the community. There\u2019s a reason why so many unsuccessful businesses invest so much time in social media without getting a return, for instance. ",

            "answer_text": "The best content marketing agencies are capable of the following: 1. They are good at listening to a clients needs and goals. Content marketing is useful for many things including branding, building audiences, linkbuilding and organic search improvements, increasing social engagement, lead generation, and internal communications to name a few. A good content marketing agency will ask the right questions in order to determine how content can be used to best serve the goal or goals of the client. They will be proficient at creating content for each of these types of goals, and have a track record of success with others. A good content marketing agency will also be able to quickly and deeply understand the company hiring them. They must be able to quickly grok the industry, the target customer, the product or service. This all starts with good listening, and having processes in place that can properly introduce and on-board new clients.  2. Because most companies looking for a content marketing agency are looking for someone to create content that builds buzz, links, social engagement and ultimately improves organic search visibility, a good agency must be HIGHLY CREATIVE. They must intimately understand the elements of viral content, and be proficient at marrying the topical areas of the client with the topics and ideas that will resonate with the appropriate target audiences online. Successful content marketing agencies will consider themselves to be students of the Internet, and always seek to stay on top of the latest trends, not only in terms of what is being talked about, but the types of and locations of the content that is being shared most.  3. A great content marketing agency will have the ability to produce a wide array of content types on a wide array of topical areas. They will employ highly skilled graphic designers, animators, developers, journalists, data visualization experts, researchers, writers, and editors. They will be able to create more than just rehashed trite infographics. They will be able to actually create new value with their content. The content they create will be of a highly polished and professional nature, that will not only reflect positively on their clients brands, but be visually engaging for audiences.  4. They will be nimble. Running a very large content marketing agency generally leads to a significant decline in the quality of that agency. This is because high level success is often dependent on being able to move quickly. The Internet is incredibly fast-paced, and only agencies that can stay on top of the latest trends in both content ideas and execution types will be able to succeed.  5. They will be digital PR and online promotions experts. Great content isn't worth much if no one sees it. The best content marketing agencies have a proven track record of creating content that big publishers want to talk about. They have relationships with writers, bloggers, journalists, and editors, and know the best places to promote content from many different topical areas. They understand how to leverage publishers as well as social channels to help create a large amount of buzz in a short amount of time.  6. A great content marketing agency will have examples, examples, and more examples of past success. If an agency cant point to examples of high levels of past success, it should be a huge red flag.
