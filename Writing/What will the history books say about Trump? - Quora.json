            "answer_text": "History will likely care less about Trump than about the corruption that put him in power. This is less about Trump and what he did right (very little, in my opinion) as it is a tale about institutional corruption, establishment hubris, and massive, illegal collusion between several entities, and unimaginable incompetence. Basically, the rotten American political system fell apart in the face of populisim, because our politicians forgot this was a democracy (well, not really, but that\u2019s another matter). Over the course of the last year he humiliated several \u201cprominent\u201d republican politicians in the primary, devastated the republican party\u2019s establishment and captured the unrelenting attention of the media. While this was going on, the democratic party was going through a similar, although overtly less scandalous populist revolution with Bernie Sanders. Sanders, however, wasn\u2019t a reality TV show star, didn\u2019t say outrageous things and actually had policy ideas. The media largely ignored him, stopping only (after colluding with the DNC establishment and HRC campaign) to write disparaging articles about him. Still, he went from a non-entity to a popular political figure who stood in stark contrast to the dead-eyed Hillary Clinton with her well-rehearsed, robotic, meaningless platitudes that captured a staggering level of support from the democratic base. If only he had more time, less establishment interference and some of the millions (if not billions) of dollars worth of free air time that Trump got, who knows what might have happened? And that\u2019s the larger issue in this whole affair; the establishment, and corruption. Trump was seen as an outsider, not another phony politician. Americans on both sides were sick of the establishment, sick of the corruption, sick of trade deals, of globalism. The republicans, with their clown-car full of milquetoast candidates were incapable of stopping a populist coup in their party, especially when every major media company was incapable of not focusing on Trump\u2019s every move.  (Look! It\u2019s Trump\u2019s empty podium! Better cover all the nothing happening here, rather than any news!) There\u2019s more to that last bit, though - there are only a handful of media companies that control almost all of our news, and most of those companies supported Hillary Clinton. Trump getting air time and Bernie not getting it was no accident - Trump was actively propped up by the media, as it was assumed he would be an easier candidate to defeat than any of the establishment politicians, and Bernie\u2026 well, everywhere his message went, it found support. Clinton never could get the crowds that Bernie could (or that Trump could, for that matter), and that point was always downplayed by the media. Large live attendance doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll show up to the polls, right? Probably, but it does show off the energy around the politician, and Bernie and Trump had it, Hillary did not.  (Whatever else you say about Trump - his campaign had energy.) The media made Trump and hindered Bernie Sanders, but it took more than that to keep Hillary afloat. The DNC, the media, the HRC campaign and her Super PACs all colluded as well. This isn\u2019t a matter of speculation, it\u2019s a matter of public knowledge thanks to the Podesta emails. Manipulating the debate schedules, the primary voting schedules, feeding the media questions and articles, the scam that is the Superdelegate system (which were always recorded as Clinton\u2019s, despite the fact that they didn\u2019t vote until the convention, which artificially inflated her lead) to outright disenfranchising likely Sanders voters. Those are just the institutional actions taken against Bernie Sanders, however. What the Clinton campaign did in the open was just as bad (ignoring the fact that all they did behind the scenes was put into the harsh light of day thanks to Wikileaks). They alienated Bernie supporters - their base - in many ways during the primary. They call them \u201cBernie bros\u201d, outright sexists who \u201clive in their parent\u2019s basement\u201d who can\u2019t cope with the economy. The \u201cBernie bros\u201d line would become toxic very quickly, and linger a long time in debates between Sanders supporters and Clinton supporters, and it caused unnecessary division between the two side. Worse still, it poisoned the well. If all Bernie supporters were sexists, what was Trump? They cried wolf and played the sexism card too soon, and too often, so that when the Billy Bush tapes leaked, everybody was numb to it. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, charges of conservativism and racism were leveled against \u201cBernie bros\u201d, because of how Clinton earned massive support from the African American community. Obviously if you didn\u2019t agree with the voting will of non-whites, you\u2019re a racist. And just to show I am NOT making this up, as absurd as it seems, I\u2019ll post links (remember how many media outlets were outted as colluding with the DNC and HRC campaign as you read these, too - this was likely no accident): The Racist Side of Bernie Sanders Supporters Misogynistic And Racist Bernie Bros Are Harassing Female Reporters Bernie Bros: Enough of Your Sexism, Racism, Etc.! Bernie Bros Made Me Finally Recognize Misogyny in America  (It should also be pointed out that Hillary was not above playing the sexism \u201cbros\u201d card against Obama, too - apparently ANYBODY who dares support a candidate with a penis over one with a vagina is sexist\u2026 unless that bearer of two X Chromosomes happens to be Palin, or Fiorina or Bachmann, then it\u2019s fine.) Many democratic party loyalists sided with Clinton and were willing to throw any and all aspersions at the upstart supporters of Sanders. This was likely a huge boon for Trump and his supporters, and Trump, for his part, was wise enough to leverage Bernie\u2019s name during the general election to incite disillusioned and angry Sanders supporters. Even worse than that, though, Clinton and her cronies in the media and DNC attacked Bernie\u2019s policies. Americans wanted change, they wanted to strike back against corruption, they wanted better wages, they wanted protectionism, they wanted healthcare better than the ACA (whose rates were set to go up significantly this year - but that likely won\u2019t be an issue now, for obvious reasons). What was the response to this from Clinton and her aforementioned cronies? It\u2019s fairy dust. Nonviable. You liberals (said with appropriate contempt) just need to grow up. Stop wanting things, it\u2019s all about the banks, you need to embrace globalism and free trade and watch your wealth transfer to the top. This wasn\u2019t just an issue for spoiled lower middle class kids who wanted an easier ride - America is desperate for relief, for change, and after eight years of Obama\u2019s faux change, the hunger of the millennials (who are worse off now than they were a decade ago) has only intensified. The economic future of millions of Americans looks bleak, from college educated kids living in their parent\u2019s basements to the disenfranchised rust belt workers who have seen their jobs go overseas. The desperation was real, and the American voter was at large willing to make sweeping changes to get it. Calling policy that promised change fairy dust was, in hindsight, perhaps not the best thing to do, regardless of whether or not it was true.  (Even birds knew Bernie was the better choice.) And that brings us to the largest failure of establishment politicians - hubris. When asked by Rachel Maddow whether Clinton would adopt some of Sander\u2019s policies to alleviate the concerns of Sander\u2019s supporters, this was her response: \u201cWell Rachel, let's look where we are right now. I've got 10.4 million votes. I have 2.7 million more folks, real people, showing up to cast their vote, to express their opinion than Senator Sanders. I have a bigger lead in pledged delegates than Senator Obama when I ran against him in 2008 ever had over me. I am winning. And I'm winning because of what I stand for and what I've done (APPLAUSE) and what I stand for.\u201d FULL TRANSCRIPT: Hillary Clinton Says \"I'm Winning\" in an MSNBC Town Hall Tonight No, she\u2019s not going to answer for her corruption, she\u2019s not going to explain her Goldman Sach\u2019s speeches, no, she\u2019s not going to be more populist, no, she\u2019s not going to curtail corruption, no, she doesn\u2019t care that your jobs are vanishing, your wages are stagnant and that TPP is going to make things worse. The subtext of that is \u201cI\u2019m winning, I get everything, you get nothing, and you have to vote for me in the general election, because there\u2019s no other choice\u201d. This was all intensified when she picked Tim Kaine as her Vice President, somebody even further right than her, and she started courting (and subsequently gloating about the endorsements of) establishment republicans. What were progressives to think? If they wanted to vote republican, they would have. There\u2019s a saying around the internet that goes \u201cwhen a republican runs against a republican, the republican always wins\u201d. Hillary was surrounding herself with people that liberals had learned to hate (with good reason), and the reality was she abandoned her base.  (Perhaps ignoring Sanders supporters and courting neo-cons wasn\u2019t such a bright idea, in hindsight?) That hubris cost her the election. It\u2019s the same hubris that, after it was leaked that Schultz was conspiring against Bernie (she was the \u201cneutral\u201d chair of the DNC, mind you) Schultz stepped down in disgrace\u2026 and was immediately given an \u201chonorary\u201d position in Hillary\u2019s campaign. What message do you suppose this sent to Sanders supporters? Or to people who opposed what was by now appearing to be massive corruption in the DNC? Then Donna Brazile took over as DNC chair, and in the Podesta emails it was leaked that she, too, was feeding the HRC campaign questions for debates while working at CNN. Let\u2019s not also forget that the previous chair of the DNC was\u2026 Tim Kaine. I\u2019m not going so far as to say this was some giant conspiracy, you\u2019d expect members of the DNC to move from campaign staff to positions within the DNC, but the fact that two of them were caught colluding and favoring HRC, and another DNC chair was running as her VP is enough to seem quite scandalous.  (Debbie Wasserman Schultz should now rightfully be emblematic of establishment corruption.) But\u2026 this is getting out of hand, now, and I could probably go on forever. The DNC rigged the game (again, this is not a matter of debate - you can debate the effects or extent, but not the fact that there was collusion), swarmed behind Hillary Clinton, pushed her as their candidate\u2026 and they had come to this conclusion at a disgustingly early date. She was their candidate, and the pesky matter of getting her to be the voter\u2019s candidate was something of a secondary issue, an obstacle to overcome. She was their candidate, and they\u2019d do everything in their power to make the voters comply. She was the media\u2019s candidate, and they were willing to give absurd amounts of air time to Trump to get an ideal opponent, and take media attention away from inconvenient vestiges of the democratic process like Bernie Sanders. She was the bank\u2019s candidate, Wall Street\u2019s candidate. She was the establishment candidate. She stood for nothing. She had no message. But she was the chosen one. She was fated. It was her turn. Everybody in the establishment bubble knew it, and it was so obvious. Surely you\u2019re with her, too, right? No. The American people were not. At least, not to the degree they expected them to be. You can point fingers at Comey, how her scandals affect her, you can keep stomping your feet and complaining about a \u201cwhitelash\u201d and stupid millennials taking their ball and going home, or voting third party, but in my mind the real story is the DNC establishment and all those whom they worked with to achieve their chosen outcome - and failed.  (Guess she wasn\u2019t so fated, after all?) That\u2019s what the history books will say about Trump, hopefully. That he was the result of hubris, of incompetence, of a broken and corrupt political system. Hopefully those facts will precede any talks about what Trump actually does as president so future generations can see. And the Podesta Emails should be preserved forever, as fossils of establishment corruption, of how the system worked behind the scenes in our era. Trump himself is a clown, but he had a faux populist message, and this was an election where people wanted a populist. He benefited from one of the most epic political bungles in the history of the modern Democratic party. It\u2019s very likely that if our politicians actually had any clue what they were doing (and cared to win with a non-corrupt candidate at all) we\u2019d be talking about President Sander\u2019s crushing victory.  Ending Thoughts: We can go on about how Hillary won the popular vote and how bad the electoral college system is (something I agree with). The point is, however, that\u2019s not the game we play in America, and the establishment democratic machine knew it. She didn\u2019t have to win MORE votes, she had to win more states. It is, perhaps, revealing that Sanders won both Wisconsin and Michigan in the primary, which Hillary lost in the general. More registered democrats crossed over and voted for Trump than registered republican voters voted for Hillary. I happen to personally know one friend (a \u201cBernie bro\u201d) who is a registered democrat and voted for Trump out of disgust with the DNC. Anecdotal, but he\u2019s clearly not the only one. Trump did better with minorities than was expected, and Hillary did worse (noticeably worse than Obama). Trump also did better with women than he had any right to do. So much for sexism and racism being valid voting considerations, I suppose. People care more about corruption. Overall turnout was low, although third parties did no better this time around than they\u2019ve done before. Basically, every pollster, pundit and media hack was wrong. Full disclosure: I, too, was a \u201cBernie bro\u201d. I\u2019m a 31 year old who has no formal knowledge of politics, but I followed this election as best I could. These are my observations and opinions, but I\u2019m sure I made errors and over-statements, and outright admit my bias against the DNC establishment. If you\u2019re wondering, me, my girlfriend, and my friend\u2019s wife ( the friend who voted for Trump) all voted for Jill Stein. We live in Tennessee, though, so I don\u2019t want to hear \u201cyou cost Hillary the election!\u201d. Trump was winning this state no matter what, so I felt free to vote my conscience, and I did. I\u2019ve voted every time (4 for 4!) I could in my adult life, and have voted democrat every time\u2026 except this time. The real question I have going forward (besides just how bad a Trump presidency will be) is\u2026 did the Democratic party learn anything? Considering that Howard Dean is running for chair, and I\u2019ve heard speculation about Booker and Kaine being the new heads of the DNC, I must sadly conclude that no, they did not, and if left to their own devices, the democratic party establishment will do everything in their power to give us four more years of Trump. Enough opinions, though, hope you like my answer, or at least find it thought-provoking. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no political specialist, but honestly, do history books say a whole lot about any president aside from the really important ones? The other answers mention his nasty character and really just use this question as a soapbox, but history books tend to focus on what people did, rather than what they were like. Advanced Placement United States History 2096 will probably say something like \u201cDonald Trump was a Republican president who achieved his success by appealing to a very large ideological group of people called Conservatives who felt put-upon by how they were socially castigated and trivialized by celebrities and popular culture. He came from a wealthy family, had a very large business and had a TV show called The Apprentice before announicing his bid for presidency. Trump used the popular slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d To appeal to the poor and middle class who were frustrated with their lives and jobs and wanted hope for a better future. He defeated Democrat and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the wife of the former Democratic president Bill Clinton. With Republican control of the house and senate, he was able to rescind much of the social progressivism of the early 21st century, but his anti-free trade positions put him at odds with his fellow party members economically. He campaigned on the promise of building a large border wall with Mexico similar to other walls being built at the time in Israel, Calais and Norway, but was unable to garner support after finding out how prohibitively expensive its maintainence would be. Although he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Kanye West, his presidency was an important lesson for the American Left about being too aggressive in culturally suppressing Conservative ideas.\u201d Perhaps there might be a test question \u201cWho was the Republican president that in 2016 promised to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 and wanted to build a wall to stop illegal immigration? A. Hillary Clinton B. Donald Trump C. George H.W. Bush D. Joe Biden\u201d Even farther in the future, Trump will become one of those silly and kind of crazy stories that only historians know. There might be a Quora question in 3036 \u201cwhat are some mind-blowing facts about American politics?\u201d \u201cThere was once a president who was a billionaire businessman and TV show host, routinely committed acts of sexual harassment and insulted minority groups, but still somehow got elected.\u201d ",
