            "answer_text": "Hello! As an editor at TextRanch, I would be glad to answer your question. People use \u201cright?\u201d at the end of sentences to seek reassurance that the listener is agreeing with them or understanding the point that they are making. It is very often used when the speaker is explaining a concept or telling a story. Further, let me give you a few examples: That math test was really difficult, right? So I was on vacation last summer, right? There are only so many ways to make an omelette, right? Your dad is an engineer, right? You know the answer to the question, right? ",

These sounds, et. al., can become habitual, to the point people use them without realizing it. For some people, that means frequently ending their sentences with \u201cknow what I mean?\u201d even when they\u2019re not asking a question. The same could be the case for someone who frequently uses \u201cright\u201d at the end of their sentences. ",
