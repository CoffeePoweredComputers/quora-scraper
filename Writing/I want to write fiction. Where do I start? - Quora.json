            "answer_text": "1. Begin with tension Time and time once more you\u2019ll hear fiction writers and instructors tell you to begin with action. this can be blemished recommendation. Why? What smart is that the action if it isn\u2019t grounded in context that\u2019s necessary to the story or attracts you to the most character? It\u2019s higher to begin with tension, sort of a character falling short on obtaining one thing he wants\u2014can\u2019t save the lifetime of a beloved, can\u2019t beat a rival during a race, etc. 2. Know what your characters\u2019 desires are Interesting stories come back from characters who need one thing. Romeo and Juliet need one another. Harry Potter desires to beat Draco Malfoy and Slytherin in Quidditch. Hannah Baker desires the those who junction rectifier her to commit suicide know how they hurt her. Writing a fiction book needs that you just have compelling characters, and characters who have strong desires and needs are the foremost compelling kind there are. 3. Finish every chapter on a cliff Ok, you don\u2019t got to finish every chapter on an actual cliff, however you are doing have to be compelled to leave them with unreciprocated queries. This doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t answer queries throughout the book, it simply means that you would like to make new ones as you go on. Be inventive. Fiction is constructed on the curiosity of readers. If you don\u2019t spark their curiosity, what incentive do they need to begin following one? 4. Give your characters obstacles The obstacles are often as troublesome as you would like. However the key here is that they need to be able to overcome the obstacle notwithstanding what it is\u2014drug addiction, in love with an individual who\u2019s on the antagonist\u2019s side, etc. Fictional writing is strongest once characters face robust odds and still come back through within the finish. 5. Understand your audience Are you writing a fantasy novel? a criminal offense novel? Fiction genres are totally different and are told in several ways that, thus audiences of every have totally different expectations that you just have to be compelled to cowl. as an example, if you\u2019re writing crime fiction, you've got to reveal what happened early and pay the novel finding the crime. If you\u2019re writing a adventure story, your story is dedicated to characters making an attempt to prevent no matter it's from happening. ",

            "answer_text": "The most important thing you can possibly take to heart at this stage, is that every single writer writes a little differently. There\u2019s no one \u2018formula\u2019 for writing which is \u2018correct.\u2019 Some writers are \u2018plotters\u2019 who create an outline, and carefully compose each character, each plot detail, and how everything will come together, before they start writing. Some writers are \u2018pantsters\u2019 who start with just an idea, or just a character, and simply begin writing and let the story come out as it will (writing by the seat of their pants). And examples of both are on the bestseller lists; as well as every possible variation in between. What will certainly help you, and I dare say is actually essential, is that you must be a reader, first. Read, read, read - read in your genre (the type of fiction you\u2019re interested in - such as science fiction, fantasy, historical, etc) , and some outside of it. Reading packs your mind full of tropes, phrases, a natural understanding of literary grammar and spelling, a natural feel for how story arcs flow, and what makes a story successful. Of course, if you want to write fiction, chances are you\u2019re already an avid reader. Next, you need to be sure you have the basics down. You can acquire that by taking a creative writing class, and reading some books on writing. Just be sure to keep in mind that every individual writer has their own method (and most of them will tell you that it is \u2018how to write,\u2019 rather than \u2018how I write,\u2019 lol). The third ingredient is drive. You have to really want to do it, and have the self-discipline to follow through. You have to enjoy the process of writing, and enjoy the process of revising what you wrote, too. It\u2019s a lot of work; and there are a lot of writers. Lots of competition. You\u2019re more likely to win the lotto than you are to become the next Stephen King or J.K. Rowling. So, if you don\u2019t love it\u2026 don\u2019t bother. You\u2019re not likely to get rich at it. Or even make a living (don\u2019t quit your day job until the ink on the contract\u2019s dry). And by far the most difficult thing for most people to do, when they want to become a writer; START WRITING. Today. ",
