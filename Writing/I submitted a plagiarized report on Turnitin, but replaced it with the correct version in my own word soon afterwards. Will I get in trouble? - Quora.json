            "answer_text": "I\u2019m curious as to why you would do that, but maybe it was just curiosity? Best case scenario (most likely): Your teacher won\u2019t even notice. I don\u2019t notice when students resubmit essays. I only bother looking any closer when there is a high similarity count. Having graded thousands upon thousands of essays on Turitin.com, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever looked at an earlier submission. I just want to look at what a student turned in at the end. If I recall correctly, the site just overwrites your work when you resubmit. Next best case: I see that you\u2019ve resubmitted. How? I saw that you\u2019d already submitted early and wanted to see what was going on. I see that it was a high count. Before the paper is due, you submit an acceptable paper. Why bother talking to you about it? Well\u2026 maybe to let you know that I saw it. A warning. Truth be told, that\u2019s wasted effort. You\u2019ve already proved to me that you know about plagiarism by fixing the problem. Worst case scenario (well, nearly worst case): I\u2019m a hard-ass. I see that you turned in a plagiarized paper (same as above). I decide to make you an object lesson. \u201cHey! You turned in a plagiarized paper!\u201d Your answer would be something like, \u201cWell, I was playing with Turnitin to see how it worked. If we weren\u2019t allowed to do that, why would you leave the option for resubmission open?\u201d That should clam me up. I honestly don\u2019t think this is an issue. I am, however, glad that you decided to right your wrong. This is all assuming that you\u2019ve resubmitted it to Turnitin and not just handed the teacher a hard copy or emailed it. If the window on Turnitin closed, you\u2019re definitely in trouble. ",

            "answer_text": "I have confronted this a few times. To me it depends on the nature of the plagiarism. If you copied another classmate I would likely confront all parties and BEGIN with some harsh words. Depending on the response I might make a formal charge or I might drop both of you from the course or give you a very low grade on the paper\u2026both of you\u2026like I mentioned, it depends. If it was a past student, I would resort to the formal process in order to ensnare them as well if they haven\u2019t graduated yet. I detected something like this in one instance and couldn\u2019t identify the second party. In the end, the student who committed the infraction refused to give up the name and as far as I know they eventually exited without a degree. However, if you cut and past from an online report, I might merely lower your grade for failure to properly cite the source\u2026depends on how extensive the cut-and-paste job is for your report\u2026I might go hard on this as well. The thing that is wrong about this is that you even did it in the first place. From that point on, your work is suspect. That is, I would always wonder if what you wrote came from your own mind, or did you merely cleverly change the needed words to lower the similarity score? That you did it in the first place shows that you\u2019re willing to do it and have no hesitation in giving it a try. This is an indication of innate dishonesty. This may seem harsh but it is the way it is. Under this circumstance I would consider you to be a liar and a cheat. Let me be very clear: access to higher education is a privilege and if you cheat you deserve to be removed to make space for a more-deserving student. There is no substitute for you to consider ideas and course content and then to sincerely put your thoughts into your own words. Anything short of that, if I detect it, will cost you. ",
