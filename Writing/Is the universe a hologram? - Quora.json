            "answer_text": "Humans have ways of seeing things, or understanding things, in more different ways (PERSPECTIVES) than any other living thing we know of. Personally according to Uncertainty, objects/things/relationships take on a spectrum that is based on the size/volume of the system and the surface area of that system. The larger, more massive and dense systems are quite steady and stable (meaning that when perturbed they go back to their own center of gravity (cg, or locality)\u2014that\u2019s the particle end of the spectrum. But when we begin to observe the system in more than one datapoint, we get very small particles with great surface areas. A very large surface area of a system means that system will start to oscillate about their cg and then continue to energetically expand space. On that end of the behavioral spectrum of a system/object/relationship there are many opportunities to interact and for things to happen. So where does the behavior of a system cross-over from one regime (steady and stable) to another regime unsteady and unstable. What size does it have to be in order to be observably energetic (being more than one place at a time)? A hydrogen atom can be spread out into a larger volume than it might exist at absolute zero So now we get to the holographic part. In mathematics there is a way of optimally seeing a solution to an equation by a procedure called mapping. The perspective we take on a applied math problem may take the form of some sort of wave interference. So, since wave interference can condense a particle or possess an amplitude great enough to appear to exist, it can take on many forms. Many waves on the ocean surface can be seen to interfere with one another at high points and crests. This is called superposition. But there are experimental setups that can impose their own superpositions, their own mappings, and holograms are a way of mapping waves in such a way to produce outcomes. In the universe, Uncertainty constrains space and time behaviors to a spectrum of particle to wave. From fluid-fluid experiments in radial expansion produce a world where information can flow across boundaries only if wave-like relationships can grow in time through superposition. So, life (complex systems) emerge starting at relatively low frequencies like those seen in droplets (that unlike hydrogen and smaller energetic particles) do not oscillate outside their original bounds.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s clarify, the Holographic Principle does not state that the universe is an hologram. It says that the amount of information in a certain volume of 3D space can be encoded in a 2D surface which area equals the perimeter surface of the 3D volume. From this we can draw many hypothesis as to whether this has any physical relevance for our universe or not, but clearly that is not necessarily so. \u2018Encoding\u2019 by its own definition often means re-arranging the information in a different but equivalent form. And in many cases this may involve a reduction of dimensionality. The sound of an orchestra in a concert hall from a certain seat position in the venue is a 3D phenomenon, the vibration of air in the 3D space of the venue. But it can be recorded and encoded in a vinyl record, magnetic tapes, digital disks or other media. These are not 3D media, some are even non-dimensional, simply digital collections of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s in a solid state memory card, which can encode the sound information and, if you are again seated at that particular seat with your eyes closed and the encoded information is reproduced with enough fidelity, you will not be able to tell the difference from the real orchestra sound. Virtual Reality is probably the closest we have got to this subject, a complete 3D \u2018world\u2019 can be produced from dimensionless digital information of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s. And there is no doubt that it will eventually reach a level of realism which will make the rendering practically impossible to discern from a real 3D environment, especially when it will transcend the visual-only domain and interface with the brain to provide other sensory simulated experiences such as smell, taste, touch, feeling warm or cold etc etc. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is no if we use the standard physics models including Einstein\u2019 relativity, but it is quite compatible with aether theories. The complexities of the standard theories prevent the construction of a physical model as well as a virtual model of the universe.Many will dismiss outright the existence of aether by citing Michelson-Morley experiment and the vindicated Einstein\u2019s predictions. There are however possible flaws with the experiment and Einstein\u2019s equations can be derived from the aether theory with a much simpler physical model. The irreconcilability between relativity theory and quantum theory, the lack of a unified theory and the multitude of fundamental theories including the String Theory all point to the imperfect state of the current knowledge. The lack of significant achievements from applications of the current standard theories especially no space drive other than a thousand-year-old rocket ship also indicates the need to look at the aetheric approach in answering your question. The latest aether theory (Cosmos Spin Theory) uses a single model to describe many (but not all) phenomena. Its strength lies in its simplicity and the proportion of observed phenomena which can be explained by the theory without the need for exceptions (dark matter, dark energy, big bang for examples are exceptions to the standard laws of physics). The aether theory holds that all matters including lights exist inside an aether matrix crystal. Matters and light particles are different carriers of the same energy; hence E = mc2 (for matter) = hf (for light particles) with no distinction in the E itself. It may seem impossible, but the theory proposes that we are creatures of particles living and moving inside a solid crystal. Since ordinary particles and light particles are interchangeable, this model of the universe is by definition a hologram albeit a living hologram. ",

            "answer_text": "Some scientists (cosmologists) have suggested that there is something about our universe which resembles a holographic image in that the \u201cwhole\u201d is found in the parts. When we cut a hologram in half, the whole picture is still there but the signal amplitude (brightness) of the image is reduced by 50%. No one has seriously suggested the universe is a hologram, that is very different from saying the universe appears to resemble a holographic image in how the whole is reflected in the parts. For example, all of the four fundamental forces in the universe are represented in every atom, so there\u2019s a good example of the whole represented in the part. It isn\u2019t the least bit mystical although there are many folks who hear or read some description from scientists (figures of authority) and appropriate that language, make a few tweaks as needed, and present it to themselves and each other to support their mystical reality narratives. Not to be taken too seriously. ",

But on a philosophical scale, it could be that the entire universe we live in is a holograph or a simulation. Perhaps we could just be blocks of binary data engineered by higher level beings. Perhaps, we could all just be mices under inspection, unaware of the unbecomings of our existence, for the fact remains we will never truly be able to prove consciousness objectively and any attempts to do so will only prove to be futile But I digress to ask, does it really even matter? Would our emotions not be as stoic now as it were in a holograph? Wouldn\u2019t love and hate play out as equally well now, as they would in a \u2018real\u2019 world? If we are indeed in a holographic universe, why do we need to fear it? Thanks for the A@A. ",

            "answer_text": "The theory that reality, as we consciously experience it, is not real, goes back to the indigenous people who believed that we exist in a dream or illusion. In our current timeline, we refer to the our virtual reality experience as a matrix, grids, simulation and hologram. There are those trying to prove the hologram exists and others who are trying to break us out of it. Theories about reality being a simulation are increasing. It used to be difficult for me to find one good article, now they are manifesting along wth consciousness. Time is an illusion, therefore so is everything else. The universe is a consciousness hologram. Reality is projected illusion within the hologram. It is a virtual experiment created in linear time to study emotions. Our hologram is composed of grids created by a source consciousness brought into awareness by electromagnetic energy at the physical level. The hologram is created and linked through a web, or grid matrixes based on the patterns of Sacred Geometry. The hologram had a beginning and it has an end, as consciousness evolves in the alchemy of time. As the grids collapse, everything within the hologram will end as it Fades to Black. In media we find films, television shows, books, and games, based on the concept of reality as a hologram. or simulation Among the more easily recognized are The Matrix (Illusion), The Thirteenth Floor(Simulation), Inception (Dream), the Holodeck (Grids) in the TV series Star Trek, among others.

But, a more precise statement would be like two universes merging into one another, one blueprint overlaying the other. And it is not until certain codes are met that the solidification process starts. And it all happens unconsciously or without any conscious control. The consciousness cannot control it nor go outside of the formation. You are the conscious blueprint, the blueprint creates your consciousness. The only control you have is what you do inside the blueprint. You cannot control what you are, who you are, when you are, where you are, or why you are; you just become what the blueprint is. You can call the blueprint a hologram, but it is not a hologram until the merging is complete. There are two holograms, an Adam Hologram and an Eve Hologram. The components of each hologram are not different but they are virgin holograms. ",
