The most general answer is to brainstorm all your job, hobbies, interests, courses. The best advice I would offer is - list the things you BOUGHT this year. One of those items will give you a clue as to what you feel ENTHUSIASTIC about. And that is the clue to your DYNAMIC speech. What are you enthusiastic about? Doesn\u2019t matter whether it is geeky or not. People love to listen to people who are ENTHUSIASTIC about something. You then list WHY you are enthusiastic about that topic. Then arrange your ideas using one of the proven successful structures . . .bad-better-good, past-present-future etc.You\u2019ll find all these tips and more listed on www.speechbeginner.com.

            "answer_text": "You have to deliver a speech which means you will address the gathering present. It\u2019s more like a public talk and the key point is to attract the attention of the audience. No matter what the content is, you can always start a speech with Crack a joke and create interest. 2. Ask a question and involve the audience  3. Start with a wonderful quote.  4. Narrate a story and then draw conclusion.  Since speech is about yourself, you can start off by making fun of yourself (only if you are bold enough to laugh at yourself) or just start narrating a funny incident from your life(Can include your friends, the stupid stuff you did in the past etc.) and tell people what made you who you are today . So the main idea is to keep the audience entertained and make a space for yourself among others. ",
