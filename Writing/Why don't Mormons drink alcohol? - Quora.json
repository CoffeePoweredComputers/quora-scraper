            "answer_text": "This probably is one of the most fascinating bits of Strange Theology kicking around. It isn\u2019t just Mormons. Wesleyans and Low Anglicans adopted an anti-alcohol stance back in the 1700s. Supposedly Mohammed started things by banning booze. (Total aside: an Egyptian Cleric, who was an Academic historian and had done his best to trace the ruling back to original sources believed that Mohammed disliked distilled spirits and was fine with date wine and beer. I\u2019m no expert, but as far as I can tell there\u2019s no reference in the Koran, although the Hadith - the interpretations of his speech - is full of proscriptions. IF anybody can give me the Koranic reference against booze I\u2019d be grateful.) Yes Jesus and the disciples drank wine. What\u2019s more Jesus even went so far as to bootleg wine for a wedding party. (The Cana wedding story, John 21.) So not only did he drink it, he liked it and used it for celebration, most famously in the last supper. No it wasn\u2019t because water was bad for you. This is a nice story, Evangelicals and others tell themselves, but wine was a celebratory drink at the time. (Hence the wedding and the Last Supper.) Water was then and always will be the most widely consumed fluid. And yes it gave you Delhi Belly, and the trots, and sometimes killed you. So did most of living at that time. That was just background noise. At it\u2019s heart every religion from Catholicism to Islam to Mormonism is about self-denial. The holiest figures in the Catholic church are those who abjure normal life, including things like sex, and talking. People like Mother Teresa become saints so her indulgence in self-flagellation (also popular among some Shias) just make her a better person dammit, not some pervert. Islam has people fast. (Catholics and Jews are supposed to as well, but Mohammed wasn\u2019t letting a bunch of infidels outdo his flock. A whole month! Take that!) Wesley and others decided strong drink was bad for folks. (Note the recurrence of strong drink. Wesley and Martin Luther both loved a good pint.) Everyone knows about Hogarth\u2019s Gin Lane etching. What most people don\u2019t know is that it - like many of his morality paintings and drawings had an accompanying drawing called \u201cBeer Street,\u201d wherein productive folks lifted foamy pints and led healthy lives. The Mormons, rather like the Seventh Day Adventists and other mystic sects developing across the USA at that time (Shakers, Quakers, and an assortment of semi-socialist communes) decided to learn from Mohammed\u2019s fine example. They banned anything that was an intoxicant, including coffee and tea, which were staples of the time. The Adventists advised against red meat as well. (You think you\u2019re Holy! Take that!) So far, most people aren\u2019t widely engaging in abnegation, self-denial etc.. It is always a practice for the select few. But hey, if you\u2019re looking for sainthood, I know a shop that carries a fine line in flagellant accessories\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "If you look at the US at the time, drinking was often led to excess, even today. This was one of the things that concerned Joseph Smith that eventually led to the revelation we note know as, \u201cThe Word of Wisdom\u201d. It wasn't a commandment at the time, but people were promised better health if they followed it. It wasn't till around the mid 1900s that it became standard practice in the church. Even then, use of alcohol and tobacco was never used. Mormons used to have wine as part of the sacrament but switched to water when opponents tried poisoning members using that wine. Mormons don't drink alcoholic beverages because our bodies are important. We treat them as a gift from God and do not put anything harmful in them. We believe it's for our good health that we don't. While Jesus did drink wine, everyone did, it was still frowned upon to get drunk. I believe Proverbs talks about it. Water was also hard to come by in some places, so wine was often used as the drink of choice. The bible often condemns drunkenness so I highly doubt Christ ever drank to excess. If he did, someone didn't wrote it in or changed the text. Now before you start condemning Mormons for not drinking, try looking at it this way, you never have to worry about a Mormon getting drunk. You got your designated driver right there. ",
