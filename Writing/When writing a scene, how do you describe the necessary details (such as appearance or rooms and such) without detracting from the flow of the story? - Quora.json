            "answer_text": "#1. Start with what is necessary to understand the scene. If a character pulls something out of their desk at some point, then make it known or reasonably implied (i.e., setting scene in an office) that there is a desk present. #2. For descriptions that are more for the sake of atmosphere, you are most likely aiming to instill a feeling of how it is to be in the room. Therefore, it\u2019s usually best to let the character\u2019s interest guide your description. If the character was in your bedroom as a guest, what would be the first things they notice, and how would those things affect the character\u2019s impression of your room? Function #1 is the what\u2019s technically necessary for a scene to make sense. Function 2 is flavor. Figuring out which descriptions serve which function is a skill that gets more natural with practice. In regards to #1, you can often smooth it out, if not outright disguise it, with #2 so that it doesn\u2019t stand out as important until later on. (Describe what\u2019s technically necessary) Chekov walked into the room. On the wall hung Mr. Adams\u2019 rifle.(Describe how character sees room) Chekov walked into the room. He got the impression that Mr. Adams was a military type.Combine to: (Describe what\u2019s necessary, but through the lens of the character) Chekov walked into the room. He noted Mr. Adams\u2019 rifle on the wall; polished but marked with scars of battle.As ever, it\u2019s important to watch the pacing of events vs description. If the character is only in the room for 5 seconds, write what they would notice in that time; 1 to 3 items. If the character is in the room for 5 minutes, they are going to notice more things, and more detail is available. If you are going to spend 5 chapters in the same room, only then is an encyclopedic inventory in order. ",

            "answer_text": "That is a great question. You have to tip toe around descriptions of appearance and rooms, etc. when writing so as to not distract the reader\u2019s attention. As I am sure you have seen, some writers go so far with that kind of stuff that they have lost the reader altogether. So, you can use strong words that convey the scene, or descriptive phrases judiciously, and move on with the action or plot. It\u2019s a good idea to read back perhaps the entire scene, maybe even the chapter to see if you have gone overboard. I think that just by asking such a relevant question, you will probably be able to answer that for yourself. Great question - cryptic answer. ",
