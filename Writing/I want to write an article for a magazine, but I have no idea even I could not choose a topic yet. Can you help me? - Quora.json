            "answer_text": "They say write about what you know so, perhaps start there. what are your hobbies or pass times? Are you good at sport or a fan of a particular sport? But that\u2019s not to say you can\u2019t write about things you don\u2019t do or know little about but this will require more work research wise. The shelves - real and virtual, are stacked high with magazines on all manner of subjects. Of course, the popular titles will be flooded with items to publish so you might want to search out more obscure or less well known publications first. Go to your local stationary store or newsagents and get a feel for the magazine\u2019s on sale. Flick through and see what type of articles they publish. If you find a mag you like purchase it and head home.  Look at the style, how many words, use of language etc. Then try thinking outside the box and brainstorm everything and anything to do with the subject. Some stuff will be rubbish but in there hopefully will be a small gem you can begin to smooth out.  Check out the guidelines on their web page about article submissions and stick to them - they\u2019re there for a reason! ",

If you have enough dumb ideas, then maybe you will accidentally make a few good ones. ",
