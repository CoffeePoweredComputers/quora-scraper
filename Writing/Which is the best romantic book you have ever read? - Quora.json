            "answer_text": "10. Anne Stuart, Black IceWhy? There is no one better than Anne Stuart at the \u201cKiss or kill\u201d book, and Black Ice is the epitome of this delicate balance.  The Viscount Who Loved Me by Julia Quinn9. Julia Quinn, The Viscount Who Loved Me Why? Julia Quinn's books appear deceptively light, but always carry darker depths underneath the sparkle. And there is loads of sparkle\u2014Quinn excels at dialogue, and at making a historical setting seem approachable, peopled with characters you could imagine knowing at any period in time.8. J.D. Robb, Naked in DeathWhy? Before long-running series were the norm, J.D. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) began her In Death series, still going strong 30+ books later. The book is set in the near future, is a police procedural, and is also strongly romantic. The series' couple, Eve and Roarke, are the paradigm of a strongly-matched pair.  Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James7. E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey Why? This book by E.L. James converted millions of people into readers. For that alone it should be part of the romance canon. It is also one of the most striking direct examples of the obsessive, controlling hero who finds something unique\u2014something addictive\u2014in an otherwise normal woman.6. Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Ain't She SweetWhy? The heroine is that completely unlikeable, manipulative, gorgeous, most popular girl in high school\u2014laid completely low nearly a decade later, returning to her hometown and having to eat a lot of crow. She hasn't had a change of character, but her character changes through the course of the book, and the reader ends up rooting for her. A remarkable witty and gritty contemporary romance from Susan Elizabeth Phillips.  Flowers from the Storm by Laura Kinsale5. Laura Kinsale, Flowers from the Storm Why? This historical by Laura Kinsaletackles some very intricate and delicate subject matter, and ends up a tour de force, a book that includes a devout Quaker, a brain-damaged Duke, mathematical genius, and the vast and incredible power of love.4. J.R. Ward, Lover AwakenedWhy? J.R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood paranormal romance series is chock-full of over-the-top tortured vampire heroes, and the women who love them. Zsadist is the most (literally!) tortured hero of the BDB, and his journey to love is compelling, angsty, and utterly poignant.  Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie3. Jennifer Crusie, Bet Me Why? Jennifer Crusie's Bet Me has anoverweight heroine, a hero who is befuddled and entranced by her, loads of snarky wit, and a critically sexy donut scene.2. Lisa Kleypas, Dreaming of YouWhy? In Dreaming of You, Lisa Kleypascrafted one of the most memorable heroes ever, Derek Craven.Derek's rough upbringing, his ruthlessness, his need for his heroine, and his resultant emotional fragility is the epitome of the tough on the outside/gooey on the inside alpha male.  Lord of Scoundrels by Loretta Chase1. Loretta Chase, Lord of Scoundrels Why? Loretta Chase's Lord of Scoundrelsfrequently tops Best Romance Novels Ever lists, and so it needs no further justification for being tops here. But since we're here...its lummoxy hero, Sebastian Dain, gets felled handily by his heroine, Jessica, and she seems to recognize, almost immediately, what Dain is like on the inside (see that tough/gooey analogy above). Their courtship is sensual, witty, and delicious throughout, and doesn't shy away from difficult moments.10 Paranormal Romance Novels You Should Read:  This is not my list of the all-time best paranormal romances. These ten titles are the ones that have had significant influence on the subgenre and the ones every paranormal fan has read\u2014whether they loved it or hated it\u2014they\u2019re where our tropes come from and often epitomize what we expect from our paranormal love stories.10. Dark Prince by Christine FeehanWhy? Dark vs. Light. Apart the hero and heroine are broken, but together they are able to come alive.9. Bite Me If You Can by Lynsay SandsWhy? Lynsay Sands injects the fun in her paranormal romance. Bite Me If You Canhas the pairing of a newbie vampire and a much older Argeneau vamp. He\u2019s grumpy. She\u2019s independent. The journey is, of course, sexy, but also peppered with humor.  8. The Darkest Night by Gena ShowalterWhy? Love as a curse reigns in The Darkest Night. The will-they, won\u2019t-they and the \u2018we shouldn\u2019t\u2019 are what make this one worthy of the list. When sex with the one you love means destruction, it definitely ups the forbidden fruit game.7. Kiss of Midnight by Lara AdrianWhy? Lara Adrian knows how to craft an immortal protector. In Lucan we see a hero who does the borderline-stalker thing in a way that comes off as damn sexy. When he finally gives in to his need to be with this mortal woman, things get even better.  6.Pleasure Unbound by Larissa IoneWhy? When it comes to the best way to do enemies-to-lovers with heaps of angst in paranormal, look to Larissa Ione. Pleasure Unbound in particular leverages the element of immediate, undeniable attraction (sex right away) and then the constant struggle to not do it again (and failing, a lot).5. One Foot in the Grave by Jeaniene FrostWhy? All your paranormal romance-reading friends are going to talk about Chapter 32. They\u2019re going to say it knowingly. If you haven\u2019t read One Foot in the Grave you have no idea about the awesome vampire sex scene they\u2019re referencing. You want to know this. Promise.  4. Slave to Sensation by Nalini SinghWhy? You want to understand animalistic attraction? The Psy group tries to be stoic. The Changelings are all vibrant emotions. Now imagine when they get together and sparks ignite. Consider Slave to SensationShifter romance 101.3. Lothaire by Kresley ColeWhy? Any of Kresley Cole\u2019s Immortals After Dark books would be good picks, but what makes Lothaire special is Cole\u2019s ability to make a villain into a hero. Not just he\u2019s a bad guy who\u2019s redeemed, but a legitimate villain that has done horrible things\u2026 and still finds love. It\u2019s a remarkable feat and you can expect to have your stomach in emotional knots on this one.  2. Acheron by Sherrilyn KenyonWhy? He\u2019s a god. Literally. He has epic secrets and is trying to, you know, save the world. Acheron has managed to be this ruthless, badass leader and not give anything away. One woman can break that exterior. Their relationship and the war surrounding them makes for more than 700 pages of romance goodness.1. Lover Awakened by J.R. WardJ.R. Ward\u2019s Black Dagger Brotherhood books have become the archetype for so many romances, we could have selected just about any of her novels to make this list. She brings together a group of vampire warriors\u2014they\u2019re bigger, stronger and way more alpha than your average supernatural\u2014and lets each broody male find his mate. The big tough guy becomes a protective softie for the right lady.   So, why Lover Awakened? While it\u2019s my personal favorite, that\u2019s not the only reason I've put it at the top of the list. In the third BDB book we discover the most volatile and scary member of the Brotherhood, Zsadist, has a dark past and discover his capacity for love. He does anything and everything to keep his female safe, even if he thinks that means trying to hook her up with his brother instead. The journey is emotional and twisted and so heady that Zsadist and Bella\u2019s journey to a happily-ever-after is the dark version of a storybook romance. It\u2019s the guy from the wrong side of the tracks meeting the girl who\u2019s too good for him, and through her love everyone else realizing there\u2019s so much more to this guy. ",
