            "answer_text": "I applied practically every spinner on industry, and I can certainly validate that Spinner&Chief may be the present leading spinner in the marketplace. Spinner&Chief\u2019s got a considerable - and growing - desk of synonyms. But unlike a whole lot of spinners, it will go much beyond that. It takes a glance at the whole short content. It doesn\u2019t simply seek out terms - it analyzes them to comprehend their exact significance. And this shows that Spinner&Chief knows what you\u2019re wanting to say, and may rewrite your short content articles wisely. This approach is named Emulated Natural Language. And it\u2019s how Spinner&Chief can deliver a huge selection of human-quality articles again and again. Just envision for another, to be able to produce ten times the amount of posts that you could right now. Picture having the ability to run even more websites in less period. Think of the amount of more keywords you\u2019re rating for and just how much increased traffic you can own. ",
