The whole point in having one is so fans of your work can go there for info. Make yourself a nice personal page where you can blog about your writing projects, and maybe post short works, and worry about an official author site when you need one, ",

            "answer_text": "To answer that, let me tell you how I handled it. I have self-published one book so far. Instead of starting out of the gate with an author\u2019s site, I have a website dedicated solely to the book. (I thought an author site would look a bit lonely with just one book on it!) When I publish my next book, I will create the author site. But, that\u2019s just how I handled it. There\u2019s no wrong way to do it. If you want an author\u2019s site before you publish a novel, that\u2019s fine. Have you written any short stories or poems? You can put them on there. Do you know what your first novel will be about? Give some teasers. Introduce the main characters. Plus, you can start a blog to begin connecting with potential readers. If your story involves a character who is experiencing domestic abuse, for example, you can write about that. Is it set in medieval times? Write about castles you\u2019ve visited. You can find a lot to say that\u2019s connected to the setting or themes in your book. And, if you use your blog to build an email list, you have a ready-made group of fans eager to buy your book when it launches. ",
