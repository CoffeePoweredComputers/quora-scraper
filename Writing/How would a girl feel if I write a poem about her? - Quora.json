            "answer_text": "That\u2019s assuming you actually give it to her? Either way, I write poetry, some for publication some for me. Not every poem is meant to be delivered to the source of your desires. But every poem that\u2019s in your heart deserves to be written. I have three published books of poetry. Each one revolves around love, or angst or passion or pain. **The Love Fix** (https://goo.gl/JrTgwY)** **is a compilation of a few years of looking for love in all the wrong places. It was an insane time in my life that I wouldn\u2019t change for anything. It turned on a creative side of me that I\u2019d neglected for years. I wanted, no, I *needed a creative outlet for all those experiences *and the words flowed, and evolved from dreams and cafes all over the world. I loved that experience and the people in my life at the time. Others might have journaled, I wrote a free-flowing form of poetry. Did I ever show it to anyone that I wrote about? No. But it began in 2006, and MySpace was the social media venue for creatives at that time. 800 people read my poetry but did and mixed into to that mix were people for whom the poetry was written. How could someone not love a poem written about him/her? If it\u2019s a form of displaying love, it might make someone uncomfortable to receive it if the feelings are not returned. If it\u2019s a form of anger or angst\u2014I wrote a lot of that\u2014and I posted it but never specified who it was written for\u2026 So only you can decide if she will love it, hate it, or be uncomfortable. But if it\u2019s love, and she has feelings for you, it\u2019s a perfect way to express it. ",

            "answer_text": "Your relationship to the young lady in question is key to how she might feel about a poem written about her, it can be a slightly tricky situation. My suggestion would be is to keep it sweet and not too personal. However if the reason for your poem is personal she will probably appreciate knowing that you feel that way about her. I have written four poems about a girl that turned out to be my wife and they all have been written after we were married. The first two involved a breakup we had which was brought about by interference in our relationship, My Broken Heart; then when we got back together, My Butterfly Returns. She loved them both finding out how I was feeling at the time. Be honest and sincere, write from your heart and be ready to accept her critique. For your sake I hope she loves it. ",
