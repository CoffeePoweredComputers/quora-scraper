            "answer_text": "Many Japanese words are derived from Chinese (as are English words from Latin and Greek, etc.). Most of those words are written with Chinese characters (and, originally, all were). Many of them, although usually pronounced somewhat differently in Japanese than in Chinese, have very similar meanings to the original Chinese. When they appear in Japanese written documents, people literate in Chinese often can derive the gist of the Japanese meaning. On the other hand, many Chinese-derived Japanese words have meanings quite different from what the same kanji mean to Chinese. For example \u624b\u7d19 in Japanese means \u201cletter\u201d (as in missive) whereas in Chinese it means \u201ctoilet paper\u201d, and \u201c\u6c7d\u8eca\u201d in Japanese means \u201ctrain\u201d (pulled by a steam locomotive); in Chinese it means \u201cautomobile\u201d. Maybe a good analogy would be an English speaker reading a Spanish document. Because of the similarities in derivation between English and Spanish words\u2014even though pronunciations can be quite different\u2014the English speaker looking at the Spanish document could understand the meaning of many of its words. Similarly, a Japanese looking at a Chinese newspaper, for example, or a Chinese looking at a Japanese newspaper, would be able to understand the meaning of many of the words (in fact, just this morning, at breakfast in a Japanese hotel where most of the guests are Chinese, I saw a Chinese gentleman reading a Japanese newspaper in just this manner.) Where kanji being something of a written lingua franca in some Asian nations is concerned, many years ago I found myself stranded in a Taiwanese city, unable to speak a word of Chinese. So I took out a pad of paper and began asking questions by writing kanji in English word order and, showing these to Taiwanese, was able to communicate fairly well. (I had earlier learned, however, that Chinese sentence structure is similar to that of English.) ",

            "answer_text": "Chinese writing is made up of pictograms and ideograms, called Hanzi in Chinese, Kanji in Japanese.Japanese writing combines Kanji, which is normally used as the base of each word, since it has meaning associated with it, and one of two scripts, hiragana and katakana, for small connective words, and the endings of words that signify tense etc.The fundamental meaning of each Chinese character is normally identical in Chinese and Japanese writing, but the way they are combined in words is very different, as others have answered. So a Japanese person may not understand, or misunderstand, a chinese word, that is normally a combination of two or more characters.Japan borrowed Chinese characters to write their language, which is very different from Chinese. So, the pronunciation of Chinese characters is often quite different in Japan. Actually, in Japan most Chinese characters can have at least two pronunciations (On and Kun readings), and the On reading is often similar to the Chinese pronunciation (although of course there are many dialects of Chinese, each with different ways of pronouncing things).Finally, Chinese characters are very complicated. Taiwan and Hong Kong tend to use the original Hanzi, but both mainland China and Japan have simplified them. Unfortunately, they have simplified them in different ways. The mainland Chinese simplification tends to be even more simplified than the Japanese version. Which can make it even harder for Chinese and Japanese people to read each other\u2019s language.And very finally, there are a few new characters added every now and then. I remember being taught a handful of JApanese Kanji that were introduced in Japan, and have no Chinese root. One combines the radicals for mountain, up and down, to form a character meaning mountain pass. I think it is pronounced mine.And very, very finally, many well educated Japanese people (which is a high percentage) learn the Chinese classics. Although ancient chinese was a bit different from modern Chinese, that puts them in a good position to read modern Chinese.",
