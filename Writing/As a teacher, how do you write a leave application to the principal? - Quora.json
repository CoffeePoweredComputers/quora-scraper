Then tell the principal what dates you'll be leaving and the date you'll be back, If you will be coming back. You want to let him know you've given it a lot of thought and feel at this time you need too stimulate yourself and trying new things that would revive you. I don't. Think I'd go into specific details unless he asked. Depending on the situation you might want to ask him to keep the notice to himself until you had a chance to put some things in order. Thank him for all the support he\u2019s given you. I guess that's pretty much it. ",
