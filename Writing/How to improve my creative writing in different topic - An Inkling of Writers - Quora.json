            "answer_text": "It depends on what kind of writing you want to proceed with. For example, if you are talking about fictional creative writing, I would recommend reading a lot of fictional books. So even though you want to write crime fiction, read a thriller, romance, and even fantasy fiction. This will help you get ideas of how to write descriptions, dialogues, and include subplots in your book. Now, if you want to write short articles or blogs on different topics, read blogs on popular websites such as \u2018Yourstory\u2019 website. The key is to read. So everyone would suggest you to read a lot. But what to read? That depends on what you want to write. To sum up: Read a fictional book under all genres to write a fictional book. Read blogs to improve creative writing for blogging. Read the news to write the news. Read non-fiction to write non-fiction. I have read in a book that, if you want to get published on a certain platform, read each and every update on that platform. Ask yourself: What would you want to read? The answer to the question is what you end up writing. I hope this answers your question in some way or the other. If not, we can discuss more on this. Feel free to reach out. ",
