            "answer_text": "In writing any personal letter, \u201cThe medium is the message\u201d. Just by taking the time to write a letter to someone *says* that you miss them and are thinking of them. What you really say in the letter is almost irrelevant. Most any mom would *love* to get a letter from her child that just lists what he/she is doing for fun, is trying to make friends, anything they learned in class that sparks their interest, any clubs they joined or even great movies they saw. One trick I used: address the envelope first and put a stamp on it. Then start writing the letter, telling your everyday stuff, and that you miss your folks, then when you run out of stuff, sign off, \u201cGotta study. Take care.\u201d That way you don\u2019t quit and say, \u201cI\u2019ll finish it later\u201d, you stick it in the mail. Done. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in a similar experience last year. The best way to write a letter to someone you miss and love is to say just that in the letter. Tell her that you miss her, maybe something specific that you miss so she knows you're thinking of her. As well, include things from your day to day life: what you're eating, what you do with your friends, how you enjoy your classes, a funny anecdote if you have one. This way she will feel more involved with you, even though you aren't together at the moment. I hope this helps and I hope you have fun at boarding school! ",
