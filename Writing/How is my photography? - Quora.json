            "answer_text": "Its amazing you are learning photography. This pic is Average. But its your first time, so don\u2019t worry you will learn slowly. The key rule of photography is light. At the very first sight, I found problem with light in this pic. Second thing, as answered by someone that the object is deliberately placed to get a good background. But its okay to do experiment as you seem dedicated and excited. That\u2019s interesting. It would have been more attractive with bright background. If the flower color would have been bright then this background would be good. If you want to use this background for clicking pictures, zoom in and click picture covering more part of the flower. Try to take pictures by focusing from different angles. That will help you a lot. Do more experiments, you will do better, I am sure. So keep experimenting. Good luck. :) ",
