            "answer_text": "Look for a newspaper that accepts articles from people who are not on their staff (or freelancers). Because not all papers accept freelancers\u2019 articles.Check with the newspaper if they accept articles on topics you have chosen to write about.Read the paper, and see where and how articles similar to the one you have written are generally carried, and what their average wordage is. It will also give you an idea for which section you can submit your article.Find out from the newspaper to whom freelancers\u2019 articles should be submitted; and accordingly, submit it. Along with the article, submit photographs and their captions. Your name, address and phone number are essential.Alternatively, if possible, you can meet the person in charge of such articles in that paper, and discuss the article you would like to submit. If they are ready to meet you and discuss, then you can probably tailor the article to their requirements in terms of wordage, style etc., and increase the chances of getting the article published.Ask them when you can expect the article to be published, and for how long you should wait before you can submit to another paper, in case it\u2019s not published.",

            "answer_text": "I usually handle research and publication-based queries here. But as I have written for newspapers and sites here, I guess I can handle this. Firstly, you should read up the paper to understand their style and content. Once you are comfortable, and have an idea, you can pitch the idea to the editor. Now, the editor handling this may or may not be the executive editor. For some papers, it may be a commissioning editor. When reading up the paper, you can also find out whom to write to. Once you pitch the idea, and they approve, you need to develop an outline first, though some may ask you to directly write the article. There might be a round or so of editing / modifying, though at times, this is done by the paper itself. Based on the paper, they may make a payment at the end, or at least an honorarium. :-) ",
