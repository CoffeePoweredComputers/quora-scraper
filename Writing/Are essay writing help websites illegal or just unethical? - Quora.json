            "answer_text": "As a student, it would be illegal to submit work that is not your own.As a website that offers assistance, like a tutor, that\u2019s ethical if the student does the work and the tutor teaches.As a website writing on behalf of the student. The site is in the wrong too because they assisted the student to dishonor the code of conduct and regulations at the academic institution. Helping someone to do something illegal will never make it right. So by implication, they are committing a crime, even if their is no explicit law against such operation (yet).It is not a matter of being \u2018just unethical\u2019. Isn\u2019t the constitution building on what is ethical? Law follows ethics. It\u2019s not the other way around. Have you ever considered what the outcome will be to the value of a degree if the majority of students obtained a passing grade due to such fraudulent misconduct? The credibility of the degree and institution will crash, leaving innocent people to suffer because some people wanted the \u2018reward\u2019 without the \u2018work\u2019.

However, the majority of such \u201chelp\u201d websites write the paper for you and have you falsely put your name on it. This is typically unethical, but may or may not be illegal depending on where you live. A minority of such websites\u2014the most dangerous ones\u2014advertise that they will create an original essay upon request for students, but they then cut-and-paste material off the web somewhere and sell it to their rather obtuse customers. Since the materials they provide are technically under copyright by the original author, this sort of intellectual theft is both unethical and illegal. ",

If someone does all the work for you, and you simply submit it, that\u2019s plagiarism and unethicalif you do a first draft and you work with the tutor to make it better, that\u2019s fineIf the tutor/web site copy from others, that\u2019s copyright infringement and plagiarism",
