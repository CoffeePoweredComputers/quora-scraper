            "answer_text": "Most school districts have set procedures for the use of school facilities. So instead of trying to come up with your own, I\u2019d use whatever forms the school district requires to be used to request facility usage. While you could most likely research out the district\u2019s policies and procedures on your own, I always went to the school secretary or the district superintendent\u2019s secretary. Both of these district personnel can be invaluable in helping you navigate through school district bureaucracy and they can expedite your request by putting it on the right desk at the right time. Understand that while it\u2019s always a good idea to be on good terms with your school and district administration, often the people that actually get things done are their secretaries. This last fact also applies to teacher requests for curriculum, field trips, and anything else that isn\u2019t maintenance related. Get to know your school districts support staff. They are usually knowledgeable and want to help you accomplish your educational goals. ",

            "answer_text": "You must first and foremost always find a way to appeal to a need or desire that the school maybe able to benefit from what you are doing, think of some way your project maybe capable of contributing to the economic growth system of the school. I call it GALTAL. Give A Little Take A Lot. Sometimes in order to get what we want we have to give a little. So this facility will probably facilitate your pockets in some way or fashion, I\u2019m guessing you are probably some aspiring party promoter but you need a venue and the school seemed like the perfect location to score off some totally misguided youth who has nothing but time and mom and dad money to spend, if this is your plan it is brilliant but you got to cut in the king or queen if you want to get the cream. so find out if they have like a building fund or something and donate a healthy portion to the cause because then your cause will become their cause.
