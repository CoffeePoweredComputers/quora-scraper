            "answer_text": "That depends on what kind of writing you want to do. Fantasy? Creative non-fiction? Historical? Mystery? Poetry? All of those are \u2018creative writing\u2019 and all of them have places and online courses that you can learn how to write more deeply and more skillfully. My genre is fantasy, so my recommendations are all going to be for the SF/F/H genres. For fantasy and science fiction with a literary leaning, I highly recommend Cat Rambo\u2019s classes. Cat is an accomplished author, editor and instructor. I\u2019ve taken her courses and have found them very valuable. They might be better for intermediate or advanced authors, though I\u2019ve heard beginners do fine as well. If you\u2019re interested, email her for details and ask her whether you\u2019d be a good fit for a specific class. Clarion is a well-known seminar where many SF/F/H short story authors have gotten a good start in writing. (It\u2019s also broken some writers \u2026) A related seminar, but focused on novel length work, is Viable Paradise. These are both based in the United States. Mary Rosenblum does excellent work. She teaches one-on-one and also has book doctoring services. I don\u2019t normally recommend book doctors, but I\u2019ve personally seen the results of her work. Her students and clients advance quickly and are all happy with her. She\u2019s also an accomplished author. For romance, the Romance Writers of America have specific recommendations, and local chapters often offer in-person classes. In general, one of the best ways to find quality learning opportunities is to join a writing group that focuses on the type of writing that you do. Facebook is an easy place to start, but not necessarily the best place. Try the Absolute Write Water Cooler forums. There\u2019s a huge amount of information available there. Please use the search function, as you\u2019ll probably find that someone else has asked about good writing classes before you. You can jump to the last page to get the newest answers first. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If the ability to write creatively were possible through courses, the world would rather have become the hub of institutes imparting knowledge on creative writing skills. Can\u2019t deny the veracity of some institutes though, but if you ask me, I never went for it or will not go for it in future as well. Why? Because writing is more \u2018application of your thought in the fashion that is semantically unique\u2019 than \u2018application of imposed thought-pattern that is semantically artificial\u2019.  This is the reason why the world has countless unsuccessful writers, but very few (finger-countable) ones who are truly gifted in their niche.  You will, if you Google down your query, receive deluge of pros and cons discourses as to whether or not creative writing course leads to successful outcome of making the course-pursuer a talented and gifted, creatively. But my standpoint will always be in the antithesis of those viewpoints supporting such a course. And this is the reason why I barely got stunned upon coming to know about the statement of Creative writing professor Hanif Kureishi, who said such courses are 'a waste of time' (Creative writing professor Hanif Kureishi says such courses are 'a waste of time').  Quandary that most of the pursuers like you may encounter is the reliability of these courses.  Over the last seven months, I have been receiving a mail from a UK-based institute (I\u2019ve spammed it), attempting to persuade me to enroll for its creative writing course (can\u2019t disclose the name on account of my morality). Well, the institute seems genuine on prima facie, as I have come to know various positive reviews supporting its veracity. However, I didn\u2019t bulge. I believe, and I have shared my empirical understanding about creating writing in many articles/blogs of mine, that writing is all about writer\u2019s creative expression, and this expression is an acquired taste. It can\u2019t be instilled in you through inculcated practice of your tutor until you are docile. And if you are docile, then believe me, you will never need your creativity being shaped by others \u2013 you will architect it by yourself...through dedicated practice and learning from others (seniors/known writers etc.).  Does that mean these courses are irrelevant?  Well, as far as I concur, this depends on your docility and financial condition (for sure this doesn\u2019t come cost-free). There were also some comments opposing viewpoint of Hanif, and some of them resonate my views as well. For instance, I agree with Matt Haig\u2019s standpoint when he said - I do think some people will never be writers. Just like some people will never be architects or web designers. But good writing courses will help you work out if you are a writer or not.\"  There are writing courses that can inflict changes in your relationship with the language (writing). So, the decision is all yours.  If you intend to learn it on your own, then just flush out your ego and learn from mistakes. Keep on, as persistence is the reward of an improved talent. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "I am against creative writing courses for the simple reason that 90% of the courses tries to TEACH you something you have learn YOURSELF. No teacher can \u2018fix\u2019 you. They can point you the right path at best, but reading \u2018ON WRITING\u2019 by S. King is enough to get the same result (and sparing a lot of money too). A good point to start writing is accepting you are not good at writing. You accept that and you have done 90% of the job already. Then you start experimenting with style with the only purpose of make your works +++work+++. Don\u2019t try to get your style \u2018better\u2019, \u2018cooler\u2019 or \u2018prettier\u2019. .. It only makes things worse and longer before you become a good writer. Make your style \u2018work only\u2019, and trust me: no one can say you how to do that, because EVERY mind is different from the other and no teacher can tell you what path to take. At best, a teacher can tell you why a single work of yours does not work, but he will never ever explain you hoe to make it work, because he cant. The second part is about ideas. You have to find ideas (not create them). You understand that and than it\u2019s done\u2026 You are a writer already. You only have to read a lot and write a lot, and if there\u2019s a soul in your body, first or later you wil write something worth to read. ",

I would still say that one must have an urge from within to tell stories. No matter how many people have told you this, but it actually is extremely important. You can ask further questions or start a proper discussing under this thread. I will be more than happy to engage myself with this. ",
