            "answer_text": "It depends on following factors - Book size - Although the book contains same concent in different editions, it may have a different size and shapes.Now this depends on the publishers choice whether he/she want a pocket size, regular size or a textbook sized book. Font used - Font has its own special place for many readers and thus, a publisher may want to involve a reader more by using the fonts preferred throughout the world. Now, as Font change, line spacing, vertical and horizontal free spaces change and that's why book size changes\u2026 Thus, these are one of most important factors that arr widely responsible for change in same books having different page count for different publishers. However, this must be kept in mind publishers only change the page and book size and they this does not relate to changing to content of the books\u2026. Thanks\u2026!!! ",

            "answer_text": "The number of pages can vary greatly from book to book depending on a variety of factors. The size of the actual pages may be different. A larger page may have more words per page than a book with smaller pages. Likewise, larger font/text may mean fewer words on the page while a smaller font may permit more words per page. The formating of the book may give more or fewer words per page (some formats may have a large white space on either side of the text and at the top and bottom of the text blocks which would give fewer words per page.)
