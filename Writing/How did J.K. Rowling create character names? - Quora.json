            "answer_text": "In nearly every case, etymology is destiny. Rowling thought of the meaning she wanted to convey and then looked for a name with that meaning. Remus, Lupin, Fenrir and Greyback are all connected with \u201cwolf\u201d. Justin, Ernest, Severus are all character-qualities. Lily is a flower associated with purity and death. Poppy is a flower connected with medicine (opiates). Fleur Delacour is \u201cflower of the court\u201d. Crookshanks is \u201ccrooked legs\u201d. Weasley is \u201cweasel meadow\u201d, the weasel being a red-furred animal. Mundungus is a nasty-smelling tobacco. Hagrid is a slang-word for a stomach-ache. Bottom means \u201ccourage\u201d so the Longbottom family are long in bottom - courageous. But some of the names are derived from famous people, and it\u2019s the namesake rather than the literal meaning that is important. Gilderoy was a romantic highwayman. St Hedwig was the patron saint of orphans. Sirius is the dog-star. Hermione means \u201cbelonging to Hermes\u201d, the god of language; she also had a jealous husband. ",
