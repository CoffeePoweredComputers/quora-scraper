            "answer_text": "Ans. These people or this people both are correct depends on what context the word \u2018people\u2019 is used. Explanation: Dear Learner, First of all we have to understand the difference between this and these. This is a singular form of these or these is the plural form of this. This is used to describe a singular countable noun whereas these is used with plural countable noun. We use this and these for people or thing near us. This and these can be used to introduce people. Now we have to understand the word people The word people has several different meanings. The first meaning is simply the plural of person \u2013 in other words, two or more human beings. Here are two example sentences with this meaning: We met all sorts of people on the trip. (people=more than one person, in this case, probably many)My neighbors are nice people. (people=more than one person, in this case, probably just a few)However, people can also mean \u201call or most humans,\u201d or \u201call humans of a particular type,\u201d as in these examples: He doesn't care what people think of him. (people=all people)Young people carry their mobile phones everywhere. (young people=all or nearly all young people)Finally, a third meaning of people is \u201ca group of people who belong to the same culture, ethnicity, nation, or race.\u201d Here\u2019s the confusing part: When more than one such group is being referred to, people becomes peoples. Here are some examples: To travel on the ice, hunt, and stay warm, the Inuitpeople developed a unique way of life. (the Inuit people=the people who belong to the ethnic group known as \u201cInuit\u201d)In 1991, Australia began a formal process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples. (peoples=different groups with different languages, cultures, etc.)In sum, the only time you will want to use the word \u201cpeoples\u201d is when you are referring to groups of people from multiple ethnic, cultural, racial, or national backgrounds. Conclusion: These people or this people both are correct depends on what context the word \u2018people\u2019 is used. However, the word \u201cpeople\u201d are oftenly used with \u201cthese\u201d in sentence i.e. \u201cthese people\u201d whereas the word \u201cperson\u201d used oftenly with \u201cthis\u201d in sentence i.e. \u201cthis person\u201d Thanks for asking this question. Sharing is caring. ",

            "answer_text": "Like one of our members of this forum-page has kindly and correctly explained, whether \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthese\u201d is used immediately before \u201cpeople\" is contextual - it depends on a user's intended referential group and, a user\u2019s relevant view of this group. If someone wishes to refer to any plural number of different individuals who make up a group, one may use \u201cthese people\u201d. If I may be explaining simply in other words, one uses \u201cthese people\u201d to refer to a group of different human beings who number more than one. Of course, having stated this, may I also be noting that, we can specify further. An example of this is, a pair or a couple which can be used to refer to any two people who, are related in some way to each other. Another similar instance is a trio which, can be used to refer to three people. If one wants to refer to a group of human beings who, although they are actually unique individuals but, for some reason(s), they are viewed by one to be homogenous or, in other words, to make up one united and identical body in relation to some decision a group makes, some action a group takes, some situation a group is involved in, some ethnicity to which a group belongs and so on, one may use \u201cthis people\u201d. I am now heartened that, a fellow member in this forum-thread has rightly highlighted this. Lastly, may I be trying to better explain a difference between a demonstrative which is \u201cthis\" and, another demonstrative which is \u201cthese\u201d by, humbly offering this following pair of sentences. Included in a first of this pair of statements will be \u201cthis people\u201d whereas, included in a second of the two sentences will be \u201cthese people\u201d instead. To this people of the Mountain of Mebipohtatutrania, I eternally, proudly and unrenounceably belong. These people are seeking governmental support for various problems of theirs. ",
