            "answer_text": "There are lots of little buttons on that keyboard. If you hit them in the right order, you will produce a summary and conclusion. In the previous pages, you explained what you did, why you thought it was worth doing, and how you studied it. You take all of that and reduce it to a single paragraph, such as In the introduction, I explained why I thought this was an interesting problem: <stuff here>. In order to measure the results, I had to form a way of getting an unbiased result. I believe the methodology I used, <compact description here> avoids experimental bias because <reasons here>. The results are shown in <Table #, Graph #, Figure #, whatever>. This leads me to the conclusion that <whatever I set out to measure> <does or does not> influence <whatever people had thought it influenced>. Applying statistical tests to the data gathered shows <a direct correlation, an inverse correlation, no correlation> with respect to <whatever data I got>. I can therefore <verify, refute> the <whatever people believed> hypothesis. That\u2019s pretty much it. Sometimes the summary can take a couple paragraphs, and the conclusion, likewise, but ultimately somebody wants a simple thing that tells them something new. Now, if it contradicts their favorite idea, they may spend time trying to prove you are wrong; they may succeed, fail, or be unable to give an unambiguous success/failure judgment on your work. A lot of people are so swamped with stuff that they absolutely *must* read that the standard approach (and I have done this) is to read the abstract, the introduction, the summary and the conclusion. If you have done your work right, nobody can question what you did. However, you may have inadvertently introduced a bias. In one case, a facial-recognition system was presented with photos of people; the standard \u201cmug shot\u201d photos, then photos taken in black-and-white, and/or poor lighting conditions, and/or with facial hair. They did this all in one room, adjusting the lighting to simulate low-light, adding theater-fake beards and mustaches. They were ecstatic: their algorithm had something over 90% successful recognition. The researcher was curious why this number was so high (this was in the early 1970s), so he added some \u201cdebug output\u201d to determine where the \u201chyperplane split\u201d occurred that defined the features. Turns out it was recognizing the patterns of their shirt collars, the pattern in their bow ties, or the patterns in their standard neckties. Because all they did was change the lighting and the facial hair, and the algorithm was not even looking at those, but since they took all the shots in the same room on the same day, nobody noticed that the subjects were wearing the same shirt and tie in all the photos. But the computer vision system did (and you would not have believed the technology they had to use to get that. There was no such thing as a \u201cdigital camera\u201d; it was a heavily-modified TV camera\u2014the kind they use in broadcast studios; the one-and-only camera cost them something the the upper-single-digit tens of thousands of dollars, and *then* they added the circuitry to send it to the computer, and had to interface to an IBM mainframe\u2019s I/O hardware, which added about $10,000 to the cost). I think the total hardware cost was north of $85,000, but it has been nearly 53 years since I saw that lab. It would have been a potential work/study job for me if I had gone to grad school there, but I ended up turning them down when CMU told me I was in. ",
