            "answer_text": "His influence was widespread, both in terms of his fictional technique and in his iconic notions of what is an American man. The short stories of Raymond Carver, for example, seem very Hemingwayesque, but the use of stripped-down dialogue and short sentences, as well as repetition, show up in so many writers after 1930 or so, that a catalogue will look like a somewhat unfocused list. I even recall, for example, sf writers Harlan Ellison and Robert Silverberg writing and speaking of Hemingway\u2019s technique. Ray Bradbury was definitely a Hemingway fan, and wrote a story about Hemingway. As for the iconic / clich\u00e9 American man, that shows up even more. It is a common pattern in detective fiction and stories of the west. You can point out examples in James Ellroy, Cormac McCarthy, and Raymond Chandler. Many of these aspects of Hemingway are so recognized, that they have been parodied.
