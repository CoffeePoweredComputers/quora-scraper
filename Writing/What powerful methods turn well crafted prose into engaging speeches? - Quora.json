            "answer_text": "My top seven secrets for writing an engaging speech are: Vary sentence length. Just as you strive for vocal variety using variations in pitch, tone and rate when you speak, do the same with sentence structure. Start using longer sentences and as you move to a climax (storytelling arc), shorten your sentences. Simple is always better. Watch Bishop TD Jakes\u2019 sermon \u2018The Power of a Thought\u2019 for an example. He may not be your cup of tea but he is a good example of this in action.Descriptive and vivid language. Draw mind pictures. Instead of, \"I feel depressed,\" say something like: \u201cMy heart is so tired\u201d\u2015 Markus Zusak, The Book Thief. No need for complexity or excessively flowery language. In fact the simpler the better. Create a mind movie. The more visual the imagery, the more the audience will recall your content.Use repetition. Remember Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\"? The motif or main theme should be repeated liberally throughout the speech or presentation. Create a motif that is central to your message and use it often. This is especially helpful if you wish to get a particular point across or when branding.Rhyme. Limited use of rhyme (including imperfect rhyme) can be a very effective tool in speech-writing in that it provides emphasis and helps people to remember principles or key statements. Many rap artists use rhyme. Example: \"My strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe. And after this you'll call me your majesty\u201d. A colleague of mine, a motivational speaker, who speaks at schools about compassionate communication uses the term \u201cLabeling is disabling\u201d. It really drives her point home.Tricolons. The power of three! Example: \"You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom, and chuckled at catastrophe.\" ~ The wizard in The Wizard of Oz and \"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\" ~ Benjamin Franklin and an example that also uses rhyme: \"Eye it, try it, buy it!\" Chevrolet Advert. The power of three is also often used to comedic effect with two items setting up a predictable path and the third deviating (the non sequitur). Example: \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\" Dick Van Dyke Show and \"By the way, what are you planning to do for your talent: sing, dance, chew with your mouth closed?\" Miss Congeniality filmContrasts. Example: \u201cIt is our light not our darkness that most frightens us \u2013 Marianne Williamson (poem). \u201cA lie can get halfway around the world before the truth even has a chance to put its pants on.\u201d Mark Twain. \u201cWhat good is the warmth of summer, without the cold of winter to give it sweetness?\u201d John SteinbeckChiasmus. A rhetorical device in which the order of words in the second of two paired phrases is the reverse of the order in the first. Example: \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\u201d John F Kennedy. \u201cWe don\u2019t mistrust one another because we\u2019re armed; we\u2019re armed because we mistrust one another.\u201d Ronald Reagan. And a simple one: \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going\u201dThere are many more tips I could give you but I\u2019d have to charge you. lol Finally, I can\u2019t emphasize the importance of a well told story. I often recommend that people join storytelling circles to improve their storytelling skills. MOTH is a good. The Moth | The Art and Craft of Storytelling I love attending their story slams. Although I have spend the greater part of my life studying speech writing, I still spend four to five hours every day studying my craft. I read and watch and evaluate speeches daily. It helps that this is my business but I believe that anyone can become a captivating speaker if they\u2019re willing to put in the time and effort. Read the book \u201cSuccess Secrets of the Motivational Superstars\u201d by Michael Jeffreys for more insight. ",

            "answer_text": "Preparedness and personality will do it every time. If your personality is shining through material you clearly know well, the audience will be receptive. No matter how prepared you are, a boring delivery won\u2019t work. No matter how bubbly your personality, not really knowing all aspects of the subject matter won\u2019t work. The combination, however, is almost infallible. Of course, there are a number of routine details, such as eye contact body language, etc., but those are aspects of preparedness and personality, too.
