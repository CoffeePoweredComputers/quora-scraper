            "answer_text": "How much truth shall I tell to which people? Most people don\u2019t want to hear the truth - for example, that their culture and therefore their heads are just as stuffed with lies as any other, and that they have no moral high ground on anyone - so they resent it when someone points out the flaws in their way of life and, thus, in the words and actions of themselves and their families. Most of the human race is lazy, mean, and/or stupid most of the time. How much should one point out to them? What degree of honesty is worth the hostility it will draw, and what is not? Which honest observations are likely to produce some useful results and which ones are being hurtful without serving any real purpose? A moral dilemma. ",
