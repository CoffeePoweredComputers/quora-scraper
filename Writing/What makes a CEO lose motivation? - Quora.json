            "answer_text": "It may be a little simplistic but it could be they don\u2019t want to do the work anymore. For example. from your general experiences consider the following: If you want or need something will you automatically be motivated, focused, committed and so on to do/achieve/obtain it?If you don\u2019t want or need something will you automatically be motivated to make efforts towards doing/achieving/obtaining it or will motivation, commitment, focus and so on likely be a problem?Simply put, if you want something, even if faced with major challenges and hardships, you will be motivated to achieve/obtain it; if you don\u2019t want it, you won\u2019t be motivated. If a CEO loses motivation this loss of motivation is trying to tell them something, perhaps the need to consider if they want to be a CEO. Working towards something wanted often involves doing things a person doesn't particularly like, finds boring, tedious and so on. If they really want the end result motivation will return without much effort. If motivation does not return with minimal effort this may be indicating a need for review they are doing in relation to what they want. ",

            "answer_text": "Many reasons, including family or personal issues, a feeling of \u201cbeen there, done that\u201d, continually losing focus due to union issues, lawsuits, lack of support from the Board of Directors, employee discontent, hassles of all kinds, and a general \u201csick of it\u201d feeling. In a few cases you have enough money to support you in retirement - so you retire early. It\u2019s a tough job and sometimes you lose motivation and realize it\u2019s time to move on. ",

            "answer_text": "It can only and should only be the Board of Directors that blocks all money expenditures for a direction change in a company when the company is making poor sales or inferior/outdated products. Anything else that demotivates a CEO, means that the CEO was not competent being a CEO in the first place. ",
