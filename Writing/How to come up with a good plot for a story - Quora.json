            "answer_text": "Thanks for the asking. Coming up with a good plot these days is dam difficult, because many of the ideas have already been done to death, and the techniques that govern success have also been done to death. If you look at the massivly succesful film series of the lasty 40 years such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and others then you\u2019ll see that they have some glaring similarities.  The under-dog youngster, the Wizard and the magic sword. LOTR started the ideas flowing and sooo many authors since have copied the basic style and in some cases the whole thing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I liked Harry Potter immensly, as do my children, but it is a pretty close match for LOTR, on many levels. The link below does have some NSFW publicity on it, beware, but is a very good comparison, too long to post entirely here. 27 Weird Similarities Between Harry Potter And Lord Of The Rings It is not exactly cheating, but as you get older, you start seeing the pattern, and you know what is coming, every single time. So, how do you sell an idea that is different? You do it quickly. I have waited way too long to put my ideas on paper, and as such if I did, people would say that I have copied the ideas of others. I thought about cloaking technology when I was 11 years old, 1976. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a great idea to put a camera behind the television, filming the wall, and then viewing that onscreen, you could make the television almost dissapear.\u201d Anyway. How to find an original and different idea for a story plot? I write down my dreams, as sometimes, my sub concious makes up some real doozies. If you want to be different from the mainstream rules then it has to be really different. I write now, by deliberately comparing my ideas against the ideas already written by others, and then changing for the opposites, where my work is concerned, if the hero is a young lad setting out on an adventure with a wizard, then I\u2019ll make him an old lad coming back from an adventure with an idiot in tow. I write (bad) comedy and sci-fi, I mix them. The problem here is that I should have published years ago, because Farscape, for example, destroyed any chance I have of publishing what I wrote 25 years ago, it is just too similar. \u201cThe displaced happy go lucky pilot having an adventure with aliens and comic effect\u201d. You are going to have to look at your idea and ask yourself if it is realistic enough, then you\u2019ll have to run it through the \u201cunreal fantasy mill check\u201d, where you confirm or not if it is at all credible. What limits the size of dragons in films? The visual credibility, if it is a dragon the size of a planet attacking earth, it doesn\u2019t really work, so you get Godzilla as a kind of maximum acceptable size. If you are going to write a character\u2019s style, then he/she/it has to be \u2018credible\u2019, otherwise people are going to read it and say \u201cnah\u201d. How on earth do we do that? By observing what the audience will accept, and pushing the boundaries. One of the best and most surprising \u201cnew\u201d plot styles, (it\u2019s not new, just refreshed) was the recent Deadpool movie, that broke the 4th wall and allowed the character to interact directly with us the audience. It works very well, and I for one have written story lines using that premise. (years ago\u2026 should have published, man, am I kicking myself now) You\u2019re lucky these days that we have the internet, because what ever you write, you can publish it on the net. This gives you a far better way of having your work analysed for free, instead of not getting past the publishers trash basket. Work to a plan, and \u201ctweek\u201d it just enough that it isn\u2019t a copy of others work, or throw lines into a bucket and pull out randomly, in much the same way that David Bowie once wrote his songs. The one thing that you will come up against is that \u201cthere are no new ideas\u201d, it\u2019s all been done. But as Harry Potter, Star Wars, and others prove, it can be redone again and again. Just slightly different each time. If JK Rowling tells us that she hasn\u2019t read LOTR, she\u2019s fibbing.  The main way to come up with ideas and plot lines is to brainstorm with other writers and artists, spend nights eating and drinking together until something useful takes shape, that\u2019s how I grew my ideas sometimes. I think that no matter what you think of your work, you should publish it somewhere, and as such should take heed of my own advice. ",

            "answer_text": "How JK rowling can make Harry Potter to be a such master piece in novel history ? How Tolkien have a such idea to write the lord of the rings ?    Go watch this youtube video created by ted-ed. It sums up the whole things about how to make a good plot. The hero's journey means the story about 1 person that live in 1 ordinary world, soon he /she has quest to go the special word. The hero's journey it self consist of 12 sections and i am quite sure this thing pretty much works in many different stories or plot. ",
