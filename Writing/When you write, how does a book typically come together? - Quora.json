            "answer_text": " I generally have an idea for a plot when I start writing, a thing I\u2019m trying to explain or explore. I\u2019m currently working on multiple pieces\u2014-all of them will be fiction novels. Street Life, A Novel Street Life is about just that, street life. I\u2019ve had a character, a woman who\u2019s run brothels that has passed through several of my other novels and I\u2019ve always wanted to write about so this time I\u2019m going to make her a central character. When I walk around NYC I see all kinds of people and I think to myself how and what do they do in order to survive. Wanda Coleman's poetry mentioned about homeless people having sexual urges/sex lives, falling in love. I thought that was profound and elucidating. The first 20+ pages of Street Life of the neighborhood, the things that stand out, the buildings, the architecture, the children. I don\u2019t have a plot yet other than a few characters but it\u2019s percolating in the back of my head. Eventually, I\u2019ll see something or watch something in a movie and think I could twist that idea a bit farther. It doesn\u2019t fail but it takes time. Sanction, A Novel Another project Sanction, I\u2019ve written about 150+ pages of longhand and it\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m at the middle and have to craft the middle, denouement, and ending. Which means I have to decide on changes and structural decisions about different characters. I longhand write first so I thought initially twelve 50 pad legal pads like I\u2019ve done other novels. Then about 6 pads in I thought I had the right amount of characters, I didn\u2019t need to create more. Now I\u2019m thinking about those people. Who lives, who dies? I know the push of my story and I\u2019ve had to do some mathematical research to figure out the effects of a levee or dam being purposefully destroyed\u2014-how fast and far water travels. Which meant for the writing itself I had to design my first map of a location so that both myself and the reader can imagine this town. That really slowed me down. Not that I thought it wouldn\u2019t work but in cutting off a town, I had to then really think about what would you do with no knowledge, some knowledge, and expert woodsman knowledge to get out of this town. Now that means going back\u2014-during my typing Drafts 2 and forward (I do 12 Drafts of every work)\u2014-I have to incorporate more skills or skill clues to characters. Another one that\u2019s a percolating in the back of my head. Race War, A Novel For at least 20 years I\u2019ve wanted to work on a novel about a Race War and after pulling together of some threads\u2014-I have it as a trilogy. I\u2019m still shaky on the absolute ending but I like the first two books and the challenge of the writing styles and narrative points I\u2019m going to engage them with. To each work, I look for also a stylistic shift or difference that I\u2019ll be exploring. Whether it be the first person or will it jump between different eras, or jumping between different world or world views, will I have characters easily definable or do I want characters to instead simply stand for a thought or a feeling? I\u2019m always pressing for my work, the next work, a new work to be different than the last. I even get caught up in laying out all of my books and looking for similarities in covers, in fonts, am I pushing cover design enough, far enough? I\u2019m often looking at art books now and book reviews and looking at the covers\u2014-what works, what looks fun, what brings up thoughts of the plot. The assemblage though is not static as in Day One you know how it will complete on Day Ten after non-stop typing. It\u2019s a fragment here, a chunk there, some renovation there and that reveal another chunk and then it sits for a while, you have to look at it\u2014-like a sculpture and figure out what\u2019s missing, what it\u2019s saying or not. I have projects that have sat for years on end as they slowly coalesce. I think sometimes that different projects are like extensions of my own skills and abilities but there are aspects to projects that my abilities can\u2019t complete. I have to go do something else, strengthen my ability in another dimension then return and apply it to the initial project. I\u2019m maybe good enough to birth something but not raise it, not evolve it right then. That\u2019s often the weirdest part because you see and know your work but it is impenetrable to you at the current time. You literally need time to grow, to write, to read more, to experience life to complete the work. The Dress, A Short Story I wrote The Dress because I needed a short story to fill another 10\u201315 pages in a collection of short stories and I had it as an idea for a while. I thought it was the kind of story that my mentor Raymond Federman would\u2019ve enjoyed in class and I also thought it had a Raymond Carver brevity and yet Gabriel Garcia Marquez underlying surrealistic complexity to it. I wanted to play with age, desire, dreams, the end of life, totems, and what it must be like to witness this: Can you write something edgy here? It wasn\u2019t long enough for a book nor did it fit into anything I was currently writing as a chapter nor flashback or extension of a tale. It was simply this story from a fragment of a dream I had of looking down a city block. I also wanted to play with the profane, the shocking as that is what Escapades, it\u2019s in, the story collection is about. The little tweaks of desire, sexuality, personality, choices. Publishing A Lot Is Really An Illusion of Timing I often publish half a dozen books at a time because I have dozens of projects in perpetual stages of development and completion. What seems prolific is, in fact, logger jam. There does come a point though in most projects where the story or plot looks done\u2014-it\u2019s even in a proof form and I\u2019m going back and forth with editorials on it but it\u2019s still not the tale I want to tell. I\u2019ll tell you a secret, it\u2019s never quite the tale I want to tell. It\u2019s always different. It\u2019s like renovating a house and if you could take a snapshot of what you mentally thought you were constructing in the beginning, it\u2019s a different picture somewhat by the end. Sometimes it\u2019s major changes where you turned a tree branch into a blossoming bushel of flowers. Completely different. Other times you chopped down the tree and built a cabin out of it so it\u2019s different in form but you can see the original wood. Other times, perhaps in shorter\u2014-under 300 pages\u2014-it\u2019s tighter to the original snapshot because the idea itself, the point in time, the event is easier to capture. More pages and more characters require more complexity in structural support systems. I would say once you get past 325 pages, you\u2019re building in more support systems to hold the project together cohesively. It could be 400 pages and 425 and that could be a necessary 500. Complexity begetting more until the editing process where you can see overgrowth, redundancies, dead ends. Sometimes I\u2019m editing down from 600 pages to 500 pages because of the pruning and removal in editing or the control of the complexity. I don\u2019t construct with page number in mind but I know that if it goes farther than a point I\u2019ll need more tapestry to do more weaving. Other times the story, the tale, is compact and ends abruptly and I have to go back into 200 pages and make it a little more, stretch the stew a bit to ensure it\u2019s answered itself to the reader. It\u2019s better to have a little bit of fat left over than for someone to read your book and spot or posit missing parts that could\u2019ve clarified or improved it. Questions are great but not glaring holes. Hobby vs Real Writers When you\u2019re playing, when writing is a hobby, it\u2019s like you just want to launch something, anything and you don\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d which is why there\u2019s so much mimicry of Harry Potter, sci-fi, fantasy worlds, etc\u2014-the hobbyist reads someone like Neil Gaiman and likes it so much they want to internalize and extend the mental orgasm. So they write a bad imitation novel, get 250 pages in and peek through the keyhole of having bitten off more than they can chew. The piece you\u2019ve tried to swallow is attached to 10\u201320\u201330\u201340 years of writing experience, just trudging through millions of words\u2014-that you don\u2019t see in a novel\u2014-all the backstage, behind the curtain learning and reading and trial and error. Then, maybe, you start doing it at a professional level, and that takes time because you\u2019re crafting something. The hobby level is satisfied or trying to achieve \u201cgood\u201d, the professional level is always thinking about not good enough. Most people are asking questions online from a hobbyist POV as a writer. They\u2019ll try and put it down, never finish, are convinced they could do things better but then they hit the world of writing work and it, like a wall, shuts them down. Then there are the others, who others see as True Writers who are like\u2014-how am I going to get through that wall? Over that Wall? What if I just kept writing and climbed up my writing until I reached the top and then used my writing to build a bridge down? Your writing becomes the bridge or bulldozer or rope to deal with the wall because the impulse to write is this insane thing, Voltaire called it his daemon, I call it my Phoenix-\u2014that I MUST write. I must finish Sanction, Race War, Street Life. Something akin to my life depends on it. Not on you liking it or it selling a million copies or it being hailed as the best of the best from the best of the best. I must complete giving birth to these because they exist within me and must be born. I must. They are like children who have started to evolve, gestate, grow will have been born of me, must grow, they refuse to be stunted. They will demand my attention and energy to get them to a form of maturation or at least my current abilities maturation and then when I get to the next level, they will call me back to fix, evolve, improve them to completion. It\u2019s insane. With a real, true writer\u2019s ear and eye, to the work of other\u2019s, I listen for the obsessive, that near fanatical quality or energy, perfectionism to the process and an almost casual, ignoring experience of the audience. Real writers like the feedback, the inspection sometimes but not the adulation or false praise. I had to write in jail. I nearly went crazy for a few weeks until they gave me pen and pencil to write, to pour out suffering and humor and Last night I was lining up text above and below a picture on a book cover and I was going back and forth, pushing the program to its infinitesimal limits to do something in space. At 545 am I realized I was insane but I got it to \u201cgood enough\u201d, which you find as you work more and more is closer to perfection. I remember I wrote a tale from Alice Vacchs work as an ADA here in NYC about a child being murdered by the mother\u2019s boyfriend. Vacchs had written it as the outline of a criminal case, I wrote it as a meta-piece and I was going around doing readings and it was one of the short pieces I would read. I read it and as always it chokes me up, upsets me, brings me close to tears. A lady came from the audience and told me in that little 5-minute piece she was sobbing in the back. And we had a good cry. In that crying jag, we honored Michael a little four-year-old boy who\u2019d been beaten to death decades and miles away from both of us. #KylePhoenix #TheKylePhoenixShow ",

            "answer_text": "When I wrote Between You & Me I was working as a copy editor at TheNew Yorker,so the material was right in front of me and was pretty easily organized. There would be chapters on spelling, grammar, punctuation, gender, apostrophes, profanity, and pencils. I wrote down everything I knew about these subjects and found examples to draw on. Then, revising (and revising and REVISING), I shook the material into the best possible order, as I saw it. I worked with an editor to give shape to the chapters\u2014I tend to collect details in abundance, and my editor picks only the best ones and hopes I won\u2019t notice what he\u2019s deleted (but I do). When he had sheared off the extraneous verbiage, I had the intense pleasure of recognizing that it was my voice, purified\u2014the tip of the iceberg. For my new book Greek to Me, I had too much material, most of it useless\u2014boxes of notes from classes in both modern and ancient Greek, files of travel pieces (failed travel pieces) from the 1980s . . . I also did a lot of additional research on Homer and the alphabet, subjects with a very high boredom quotient for anyone but me. I couldn\u2019t bear to waste any of the research, and what I turned in to my editor was an inchoate mess. (I believe those were his actual words.) But, according to Hesiod, everything came from chaos, so it was a start. We developed a rough table of contents and worked a chapter at a time, under deadline (I would never get anything done if I didn\u2019t have a deadline). The editor would find places in the larger structure for some of set pieces on, say, cleaning products in the Dodecanese (I was determined to get in a joke about Ajax), or the Amazons, and I would try to get above the details and write something that pushed forward. We ended up with a book that is almost the opposite, structurally, of the first book: instead of material organized by topic, we had themes that snake through chapters that alternate between word lore and experience. We turned chaos into a well-designed labyrinth. Basically how it worked was that I wove the cloth, and my editor cut and shaped it. ",
