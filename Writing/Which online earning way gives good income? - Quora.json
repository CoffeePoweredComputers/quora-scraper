            "answer_text": "If you are actually interested, email me at bbosley222@outlook.com. This is my business email, but since the question is rather broad I can ask you a few questions to narrow down a good route for you to start off with. If you want to do something that I do not have experience in, then I'll let you know that you may get better info someplace else. However if you're interested in something that I've had success in then I'd be happy to help you get started and give you the steps that have worked for me. Since there's so many different ways to earn extra income now, it'll help to narrow down your options. When earning online, I believe in creating a network that'll help all parties in the long run so don't worry about spending money if you decide to ask for my help. Personally I do not charge a dime for my services unless I am freelancing. Hope we can connect and get you started! If you do not decide to reach out, just make sure you stay away from certain programs that give vague information and make you spend money upfront before you actually know what it is you'll be doing.
