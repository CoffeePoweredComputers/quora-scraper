            "answer_text": "As a schoolboy, I delivered (at various times) newspapers, milk, groceries and prescription medicines to homes in Scottish tenements. I\u2019ve climbed a lot of circular (and other form) staircases in my time, and given a little thought to them-Tenement stair types - Google Search: Shows various arrangements. Sometimes, adjoining tenements were opposite handed, just for the sake of symmetry, assuming they were built as part of one development. The tenement building I lived in had a staircase that was clockwise ascending, but, as I lived on the ground floor, I seldom had cause to climb those\u2026 I found anticlockwise ascending better to climb, for some reason. I raced up stairs, two or more at a time, using my left hand on the handrail for additional power, newspapers or milk crate in my right hand\u2026 Descending, with the assistance of gravity was easier, and faster, and in most cases achieved by sliding down the wooden handrail (which I called a \u201cbannister\u201d back then) Some rails had metal buttons or short, blunt spikes to prevent that, though\u2026 Some stairs had an odd combination of \u201cgoing\u201d and \u201crise\u201d which just didn\u2019t lend themselves to speedy ascent or descent. The best were in a block built in 1879, which my cousin still lives in, has done for over 70 years. They lent themselves to rapid ascent and descent with their anticlockwise ascent and smooth handrails. Haven\u2019t exactly kept to the brief, have I? I\u2019d love to be able to climb stairs at that speed, now, 50+ years on. Never had to ascend stairs armed with a sword, though\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Not always true - I guess you\u2019re talking about SPIRAL staircases - they spiral both ways - how exactly clockwise? Clockwise ascending would make them clockwise descending, anti clockwise ascending would make them clockwise descending. Most people are right handed, they will have more of an inclination to turn right than turn left if changing direction or turning around, which is reflected in many pieces of architecture & building design.
