            "answer_text": "Keywords are the phrases that someone searches in the search engine to gain information. Whenever you\u2019re writing an article make sure you don't use too many keywords, this process is known as keyword stuffing which comes under black hat SEO. Here you can use keywords in your article: 1. H1 tag: Place your keywords in the Heading tag H1 tag. 2. First paragraph: Always use your keyword in the first paragraph of the article. 3. In sub-headings: Use your keywords in the sub-headings. Make sure that the keyword density of your article shouldn't exceed more than 3%. You can calculate Keyword density using this formula- (Total No. of keyword appears in your article \u00f7 Total words in your article) So if your article is of 100 words & you are using your keyword 10 times, your density will be 10%.
