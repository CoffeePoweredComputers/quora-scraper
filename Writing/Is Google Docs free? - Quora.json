            "answer_text": "In terms of you not paying for access to the software then, yes, it\u2019s free. However, you have to give them your email address to get access, so they\u2019ll likely market paid products to you over time. You also then have to spend time to learn how to use and to then actually use the software. The more time and, therefore, money you invest in it, the less likely you are to want to switch to something else later. However, with free software, what you can do will still will be limited in some way (reduced functionality or support are the common ones). Then, when something doesn\u2019t work and you\u2019re fed up of waiting for support, then $5 (or whatever a month), won\u2019t seem too steep for short-cutting the system - that\u2019s what some upgrades offer (not necessarily GoogleDocs and G Suite - I haven\u2019t gone that far, but that\u2019s what free is for). It\u2019s to entice you, to dangle that carrot in front of your nose. Then there\u2019s the thing called the Law of Reciprocation, too. It\u2019s quite interesting and because they\u2019ve now done something \u2018nice\u2019 for you, it\u2019s human nature for you to be more inclined to return the favour at some point. Of course, with something like free software, it\u2019ll be to upgrade to the paid version. (Get Robert Cialdini\u2019s book, Influence, if you\u2019re interested in learning more about the Law of Reciprocation.) Google can wait for you\u2026 they\u2019re not going anywhere for now - it\u2019s a long sales process. The longer it goes on, the more time you invest in Google products. *** As an aside, it always make me laugh when Mac users claim that they don\u2019t have to pay for Apple Pages and the rest of them - \u201cOh, they\u2019re \u2018free\u2019 software for Mac users. Who wants to pay for Windows, right?\u201d. Sure. It\u2019s free when you\u2019ve bought their hardware. However, they selectively choose to ignore that part (I have both pc and Mac, so try and stay objective when possible).*** A much longer answer than I anticipated but, yes, in the first instance, GoogleDocs is \u2018free\u2019.
