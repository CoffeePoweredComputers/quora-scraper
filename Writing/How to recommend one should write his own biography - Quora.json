            "answer_text": "First of all, I\u2019d recommend approaching it as an autobiography, not a biography. It\u2019s much, much more personal, and much, much more fun to read. Second, write it for you. You don\u2019t have to be famous or rich to have led an interesting life \u2014 hell, you don\u2019t even really need an interesting life to have an interesting life (if that makes sense). No matter how ordinary or mundane you think your life is, there\u2019s still something worth writing about. Thirdly you\u2019ll need to get comfortable with yourself, with the things that happened to you and the things that you did. You need to come to terms with your life and get comfortable talking about it. Last thing to consider before writing an autobiography is what you want to focus on. You will never be able to encompass an entire life in a book, nor should you want to. Most of life is repetitive, and only fun for the ones living it. I\u2019m not going to write a book about how everyday after work I would relax and watch TV with my family because that\u2019s not interesting. I\u2019m going to write about my hardships, my obstacles and how I overcame them. Alright, considerations aside, here\u2019s how to write an autobiography: Approach it as a memoir. It\u2019s really intimidating to have to decide to write about ALL OF YOUR LIFE, ALL AT ONCE \u2014 so for that reason, decide one thing, one part of your life that you want to write about. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many there are: how you fought your family\u2019s poverty, your budding genius on the violin, your brother\u2019s battle with OCD. They may all be interrelated (your brother developed his OCD to cope with poverty while you were driven to the violin to cope with his disorder while the violin lessons forced your family further into poverty), but you\u2019ll find that choosing just one to focus on makes writing so much easier.Plan your story from start to finish. Really think about what events in your life are important to the story you want to tell. Birth, even though it\u2019s technically the starting place, is usually a terrible place to begin. Choose something instead that\u2019s really relevant to your story \u2014 for example, if you were to write about your violin skills, you might start with the first time you heard someone play the violin. Then you can map out the course of your life in terms of the violin, the first time you touched a violin, the first time you played it, each time you performed and how you changed between each.If you\u2019re writing about your brother, maybe begin with some of the warning signs your family missed in the beginning. Trace the arc of his disorder from its origins to its peak to (if you\u2019re lucky) his eventual recovery.Write everything. Describe absolutely everything you can in as precise detail possible. Remember everything you possibly can and dredge up memories you never knew you still had. Ceaselessly interrogate family and friends until everyone hates you. Write until you can\u2019t possibly write anymore, then go back and add more.Go back and re-write. Focus on the important things of your story, cutting out all the rest. Maybe you should take out the part where you picked your nose in first grade and your brother made fun of you \u2014 but leave in the part where you watched him count the number of steps across the kitchen over and over for hours. It\u2019s probably not necessary for the readers to know about the time you wore your shirt backwards to a violin lesson, but they will need to know about when your teacher told you that you have a real gift. Cut all the meaningless details and descriptions that don\u2019t add to the story, so that you have a clear, concise narrative.Re-write again. This time, focus on you. It\u2019s really easy, especially when writing about somebody else, to forget this is an autobiography, and your point of view is the most important point of view. If you\u2019re writing about the violin, make sure it\u2019s your journey \u2014 how you felt when you played that sonata, what your thoughts were when you preformed on stage. If you\u2019re writing about your brother, be extra aware; this is your story, not his. How he felt is irrelevant; how it affected you is what matters.Keep editing and re-writing until you want to puke. Not much more to say here. Refine your story to perfection.(optional) Repeat steps 1 - 6 until you have stories on every aspect of your life. If you\u2019re really determined to write an autobiography instead of a memoir, you\u2019ll have to be ready for a challenge. Take all the stories you\u2019ve written, and begin compiling them into one. Be scrupulous. Whatever you write can\u2019t be twenty novels long, so you will have to cut out huge swaths of semi-essential information. Maybe even whole aspects of your life will be left out \u2014 do you really have room to write about your grandpa with dementia when you\u2019re already up to the neck in violin music, OCD, and generations of poverty? It\u2019s going to be rough, but keep going.I hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, I don't recommend for no one will read it unless you are a famous person or in your life you went through remarkable experiences that can be of interest to others. Still, if you are adamant, I suggest you start with journal writing wher you put down all the important events you had and later go through it to make a cogent and interesting story of it with your word craft. If you are not that good at writing, and if you are filthy rich, you can hire a ghost writer and pay him to do the job and to keep his mouth shut about it and claim it to be your autobiography. ",
