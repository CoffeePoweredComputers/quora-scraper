            "answer_text": "A 3 am journal. You know those frustrating moments at 3 ungodly am when your brain starts spewing all the best ideas while you are curled up comfy in your bed? So I picked my choice. For a lazy creature I will doubtlessly describe myself to be, I somehow managed to compromise my comfort and actually start recording them. It started with no actual discipline. I would be laying home, my eyes drooping, and bazinga! the most exciting idea right there. It's kind of disturbing how my evil brain plays with me. And tired as I may be, I would just blindly throw my hands around for any rogue paper and a pen and just start writing in the dark; eyes still closed. It happened so many times, I just ventured keeping bundles of papers on my bed with tens of pens strewn around so that anywhere I shot my hand it would hit at least one. Jeez, you should have listened to my mom! I mean that woman would never let my pens be in the perfectly orderly disordered state I so planned it to be. But anyway, I moved out after tenth. And I didn't have as many bundles of papers as I would like. So I just bought a journal. Much easier. Oh! But not to worry! I am still as undisciplined as I ever was. (Ah, my teachers would be so proud. ) The journal has my craziest ideas: A fan fiction with a really detailed plot, three Quora answers that I haven't posted, a Sherlock-Langdon crossover with a proper riddle and chapter-sized plots, a working on a mathematical proof to how it is easier to be sad than happy (What? Don't look at me like that; it was a 3am thought), two poems \u2014 a nursery rhyme, and a concept book. I was really shocked at how much I was able to do between the hours of 1 and 3 for my concept book! Five handwritten chapters, all the crucial plot points, character sketches, and a completely detailed plot \u2014 in less than 2 hours! And that's from a guy who found it difficult to take time to write one chapter for his previous concept book. And those are just the entries for the last three weeks. Perhaps not appreciable, but it's really fun to carry those ideas. Although, yes, they are probably all very bad and have scarcely ever been taken to completion, but they're one of those things that excite me. I remember when I was a kid, and I would die for the school to be over because Swat Kats used to play on Saturdays just after that. It's sort of like that. And perhaps I'm too old for (awesome) cartoons, and too bored for TV in general, but it's uplifting to look up for something that no other person cares about. My life summed up. That makes me happy. Pro tip: You should probably know this. You know all the brilliant ideas that you think are most brilliant of all? Yeah \u2026 they aren't. They are just as crappy as any other you think of in a day. You just don't know it, because your mind is tired. It's not like DaVinci possesses you at 3 am, you know. (Whoa, that would make such a good short story. I call dibs.) ",

            "answer_text": "What kind of journal do you keep? I don\u2019t know. How many kinds are there - or have there been? I grew up with having been given a nice little hardback volume with a lock and a key. Don\u2019t who gave it to me, but possibly my dad. He was in prison at the time, sending me letters the censors had blacked out, so I couldn\u2019t really know what he\u2019d done to end up in that place. Embezzlement, I suspect. He did a lot of bookkeeping once he\u2019d admitted to himself that he\u2019d never be a movie star, a singer, any remote part of The Rat Pack. I wrote in that journal/diary for as long as I was interested. My interest in almost anything wore down to a nub in a short time, so life just mosied along from there on out. But you ask - what kind of journal was this? It was one hard-pressed for interesting, out of ordinary, snippets of that small/moderate town that not every one of its 10,000 population didn\u2019t already know. On the other hand, they didn\u2019t know it all: not that my drunken stepfather stood at the foot of my bed - just staring, just waiting for me to notice him so he could crawl under my covers. I never moved, once an eye had caught him there. That made it to the journal. His drunken nights roaring the car up the inclined driveway, the pause after he\u2019d parked the car, hid his booze in the garage rafters, came stumbling to the kitchen where my mother and his mother sat in wait, sat in anticipation for the night to begin once more. I wrote about that. More about the horrid anticipation than about what came next, more about what might happen that night that would be worse than the other night, if he\u2019d finally have his way and I\u2019d be without help except for a cry in the night. I couldn\u2019t envision my mother or his mother rushing in to help me; I didn\u2019t think it was in them to do that. But I\u2019m getting carried away from your question. Just to say my journal-diary was dated somewhere in the early-1960s, with such things so very different and fingers pointed the wrong direction. As I recall, girlfriends didn't write about such things, maybe hadn\u2019t lived through them, maybe were too brain-stunned to put it on display, maybe that someone in the future would read it. I\u2019m sorry if this doesn\u2019t explain what kind of journal I kept. I wasn\u2019t the typical \u201cdiary\u201d girl. I wrote my angst out, and Ricky Nelson sang me to sleep, so to speak. ",
