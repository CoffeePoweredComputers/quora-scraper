            "answer_text": "I have thought about this a good deal. In my first novel, Tarrytown was Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow was Sleepy Hollow. Except for a shopkeeper who had left town, I felt uncomfortable having a person in the book who could be associated with a location such as a woman who ran the flower shop. My main characters were transplants so they not identifiable. The well-known sites stayed as they are but I changed restaurant names and threw in some out-of-date events which helped the plot. Blooded in Sleepy Hollow proved more problematic. I needed SH. What other town is known for the Headless Horseman but characters in Tarrytown could hurt others and perhaps bring on lawsuits? I called the town Couhaven and got on with it. I wrote freely in early drafts but then had to layer people over with different identities. I changed street names and locations of crucial places except for the main tourist draws. If the novel had a major publisher, an experienced editor or company lawyer might want changes made but I have left things as they were upon completion. It\u2019s kind of funny. A good person who recognizes themselves in a novel, won\u2019t have much recourse. Hopefully, they would feel flattered but an evil one would have to prove that the despicable character is them. A lawsuit was mounted not against the Bell Jar novel but the movie version because they added a lesbian relationship. The woman the character was based on was not gay. I understand she successfully sued. Novels do contain disclaimers such as any person or locale is uses fictitiously and so on. The setting of the neighboring towns has worked wonders for me. My son knows he is the slender blond boy in the first one but understood the character acts out in a different world. So far, so good. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually the biggest issue is getting things wrong. Also depends on the size of the town. I read one where they had Royal and Bourbon streets in New Orleans meeting at a corner \u2026 since they\u2019re parallel, that\u2019s a little difficult. <laughter> Get the landmarks right. One of my favorite authors mentioned a popular park in Chicago for a family reunion and one of the fans pointed out that a large congregation of white people in that park could be a problem. Do your research if you\u2019re not familiar with the town. Big cities are easier: New York, New Orleans, Chicago, San Francisco, etc. because you can neatly tuck your fictional places into spots near non fictional ones and give the flavor of the town without messing it up. Have fun. ",
