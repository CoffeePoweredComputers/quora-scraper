            "answer_text": "Greetings from GJM: Answer: The rates of Indian Income tax as applicable on your Royalty income will depend on the type of entity that receives the royalty. If it is an individual, then individual rates of tax apply, whereas in case of Companies, LLP or Partnerships, the income tax rates are different. However, the Payer of royalty is bound to deduct withholding tax in form of TDS at 10% if the amount of royalty exceeds Rs. 30,000/- during a financial year. Trust this answers your question.
