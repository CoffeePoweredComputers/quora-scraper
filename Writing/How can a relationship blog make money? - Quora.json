            "answer_text": "If you mean a blog that discusses the topic of relationships I would suggest as a popular topic area the blog could focus on articles and stories about people's experiences and learnings and then open up the comments area to debate. You could improve this dialogue by linking each article to a forum area. The more people who read and want to agree their own views and experiences, the larger the audience will grow as content will build. People love to share their views and experiences.  The commitment of regular and frequent articles will result in a growing and returning audience. Advertising and sponsorships would start to bring in earnings.   You could then consider other revenue opportunities such Ebooks and product sales.  But first you need that large audience :-) ",

Earning income through sponsored posts is a possibility. You may be able to negotiate  projects directly with brands or there are also blogging networks that regularly offer blogging opportunities that you can apply for.  I would also sign up to be an Amazon affiliate and write your own \"sponsored\" posts linking to a few things on Amazon through your affiliate link in popular articles.  If you write an article about romantic date night tips, you could link to candles, etc.  There are also other ways related to your blog to monetize utilizing your social media following including paid tweets, paid Facebook posts and more.  Good luck!  ",

            "answer_text": "Relationship blogs are no different from other blogs. Yes, some niches are more profitable than other, but the dating/relationship niche has a load of potential. It\u2019s really not about whether one blog niche makes more than the other, but rather about the one making the blog. If you are willing to put in the time, effort and consistency into it, you shouldn\u2019t have any problems making money with your travel blog sooner or later. I would say the primary way that relationship blogs make money is by affiliate marketing, selling different relationship courses/programs. Hope that helps.
