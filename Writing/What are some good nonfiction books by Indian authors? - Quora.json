            "answer_text": "Indian non-fiction writers seem to be a minority group as most of the popular or award winning Indian authors are fiction writers (Jhumpa Lahiri, Kiran Desai, Rohinton Mistry, Vikram Seth, Arundhati Roy, \u2026). Other than the names listed in the question details, here are a few more names of Indian non-fiction writers and their books (in random order) - K.A.Nilakanta Shastri - He\u2019s an authority on history of South India, and his most popular book is - A History of South India: From Prehistoric Times to the Fall of VijayanagarEknath Easwaran - Respected around the world as one of the twentieth century's great spiritual teachers, his popular titles include - The Upanishads: A Classic of Indian Spirituality, Amazon.com: The Bhagavad Gita , Gandhi the Man: How One Man Changed Himself to Change the WorldNisid Hajari - Author of a very well researched book on India\u2019s Partition - Midnight's Furies: The Deadly Legacy of India's PartitionNirad Chaudhuri - One of the greatest writers India ever produced. Author of The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian and several other books.Pankaj Mishra - Award winning author gaining prominence and following around the world. Wrote From the Ruins of Empire: The Intellectuals Who Remade Asia and Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet, and BeyondUpinder Singh - Daughter of former PM, Manmohan Singh, and a History Professor. Author of A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th CenturyNayanjot Lahiri - History Professor and Archaeologist, author of Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization was Discovered and few other good books. Co-author with Upinder Singh on the book listed above.Sanjeev Sanyal - Author of few good, non-academic History books like - Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's GeographyPavan Varma - Bureaucrat and author of Being Indian and few other booksMark Tully - Given that he was born in Calcutta, and has spent decades in India, I don\u2019t see why Mark cannot be called Indian. We do call authors of Indian origin who have never lived in India as Indians. Very few understand India as well as Mark and his books attest to it - No Full Stops in India: Mark , Amritsar Mrs. Gandhi's Last BattleAbraham Eraly - An authority on Mughals, author of popular books like - The Mughal Throne, Gem in the Lotus: The Seeding of Indian CivilisationSiddharth Mukherjee - A cancer physician and researcher, author of Pulitzer prize winning book - The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer and another recent book - The Gene: An Intimate HistoryAtul Gawande - A Surgeon and Professor at Harvard medical school. He happens to be Indian origin but I don\u2019t think has lived in India. Author of bestseller Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End Note that this book has 6,000 comments on Amazon!These are few names I could think of. Will add more later as they come to mind. The interesting thing to note as you start to compile this list is the definition of \u2018Indian\u2019. Is it just because he or she looks Indian or has an Indian name, but has never been to India, an Indian? for instance author Pico Iyer, or someone like Ruskin Bond who was born in India and has lived his entire life here? There are many such instances that make you wonder about identity. ",

            "answer_text": "The Inscrutable Americans - Anurag Mathur: A beautiful novel and a great take on the cultural clashes early travellers to USA from India in the early 90\u2019s faced. Its about how gopal, a young boy who worked for a hair oil company in the south, goes to the USA. How his persona gradually convolves with the cultural fabric there makes the story. Happens with a lot of us too.Nine Lives - William Dalrymple: I know you said \u2018Indian authors\u2019 but Dalrymple is probably more Indian at heart than most of us!. From a myriad forms of devotion and mysticism, he picks stories of nine people whose devotion /concept of mysticism were incredibly diverse yet similar. Devadasis of karnataka, the mysterious bauls, black magic at the suburbs of Kolkata, tibetan monks,the story of Lal peri and more. History, consummate story telling, India and travel. A rare meeting. All his other books make for great reads too.Life is what you make it - Preeti Shenoy: Its a story of how a over achieving young girl goes through a bipolar disorder and recovers with the love of her friends at the rehab. Very inspiring and a well told story. All of the authors books later are not as good though.The difficulty of being good - Gurcharan Das: A treatise on dharma and its complexity in todays world. Makes you think.No full stops in India - Mark Tully: (Mark Tully has been in India for many decades now and continues to) . He\u2019s got a matured style of writing that dovetails with his strong love for India.Autobiography of a Yogi - Paramahansa Yogananda: Used as a text in yale, caltech, oxford, the only book Steve Jobs had on his IPad. My favourite so far!Do Let me know if you want more :) . Good Luck!",
