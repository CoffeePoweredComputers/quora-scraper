            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at \u2018legal\u2019 for a moment. Fan fiction is copyright infringement. You\u2019ve taken the work of someone else, and copied a lot of it in order to avoid writing something new yourself. The motivation for it, like loving the characters and setting, are irrelevant. Adding your own ideas to someone else\u2019s published work, is NOT legal. So before you even get started, you are already in the wrong. So even if you pursued this legally, the first thing you will get is counter sued for copyright infringement. And that\u2019s assuming a trademark is not involved, which would be an even bigger problem for you. I agree with the others saying this is co-incidence. The fact you came up with characters could well indicate these characters were a logical extension of the last book, taking the story forward. Now, you haven\u2019t said which series this is, so we cant check how often the author releases. But the vast majority of authors release 3 monthly or slower, and so will have been writing the book before your fan fiction was available to be read. Now if it was an author on a faster schedule such as monthly or even 2 weekly (there are some who can write that fast), the thing is those people put in an 8 hour day writing, and don\u2019t have much other time for reading anything, let alone fan fiction. So the chances are, the author doesn\u2019t even know your fan fiction exists. There are plenty of examples about where multiple people in the world have had the same ideas more or less at the same time, and published very close together. Often if comes from the same idea source of something published before the ideas, making thought processes go the same way. There is nothing unusual about this. Annoying as an author, yes. But not unusual. Certain new ideas generate new ideas themselves. And all writing is based on everything that\u2019s come before, to some extent. When I first started full time writing, I was compared to EE Smith. I\u2019d never heard of him. Yet he was considered the first author for the Space Opera genre. I\u2019ve still not read any of his work, and yet people think I write the same way. That\u2019s how the world works. I don\u2019t like the whole concept of fan fiction. Too much of it is canon breaking for the sake of canon breaking. Too much of it just bad writing. But there are gems in there. My attitude is, if you want to write fan fiction in my universe, talk to me about it. If you can write a core story which extends the universe or fills in a lot of the gaps I left behind, I\u2019m all for that. But NOT as fan fiction. I\u2019m happy to co-author, taking your story, making sure it works, and making sure the quality is there. It then gets released as an official book with both our names on it, and we split the royalties. I don\u2019t understand the people writing fan fiction, which by definition cannot earn any money without invoking legal action. If someone can write a decent story, why not approach the author to co-author, and get the book out officially, and make a living from it. If the author is not approachable, why not take the ideas you have, put them in a completely new setting, and write your own book? Co-authorship has its issues, but fan fiction is a dead end. And the reality is, you\u2019re already on the wrong side of the law, so there is nothing you can do even if the author did use your characters, which is unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "As an author, I say, sure you can play in my world. I'm even flattered you would want to. But keep your hands off my main characters! My chacters are my friends. They live in my head and I live in theirs. They are extensions of me. You cannot possibly know their secrets any more than you can know mine. What they do, what they think, how they act, its far too intimate for me to share with someone else. So I can understand you might be upset. They're is, however, good news for you. Would I steal someone else's characters? No, that would be like stealing someone else's friends. In fact, I would do the opposite. If a fan came up with a character similar to one I was working on, I would curse my bad luck and feel I had to abandon that character. Why, because that character is no longer uniquely mine. Somehow, they have started to dance to the tune of someone else's mind. They are traitors. How about a minor character? I might give someone else permission to develop a minor character, if I had no plans for them. They would have to be dead to me first though, because you never know when a minor character might start to develop a mind of their own. If, though, the minor character were part of a successful series, I'd be inclined to think about licencing their use to you. I will allow you to develop them, give them new life, if you give me 10% - 20% of your profits. Would I coauthor? Only if I have complete control over the story development, product quality, and distribution. Then, of course, I would want 50% - 60% because that is a lot more work on my part. To be fair, if you came to me wanting to coauthor, I'd be far more interested in helping you develop your own world and your own story. I would rather mentor you to your own success than share, but that is for my own selfish reasons. Would I use someone else's minor character? No way. Minor characters are far too easy to re-write, so I would just tweak away until they were unrecognisable. Simples. Has this author stolen your characters? Highly unlikely. They are more likely to steal your story, then populate it with their own characters, because creating a stories is a lot harder. As others have written here, I think it's just unfortunate coincidence. There is, however, good news for you: if you can develop an existing story in the same way as the original author, to the extent where you are both creating similar characters, you have clearly developed the skills to create your own original works. You are ready to branch out on your own. Seriously. Re-skin your own characters (authors recycle characters all the time), give them their own story world, and cut out all the original author's characters. Your idea of the author\u2019s world is going to diverge at some point anyway, so just take those changes to the extreme. Then rename everything and re-brand. Okay, so your first independent story might still be close enough to the original for the influences to be clearly visible. But I bet your third and fourth ones will be much more original. Go for it.
