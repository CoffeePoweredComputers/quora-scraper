            "answer_text": "If a blog doesn\u2019t allow comments, it\u2019s not a blog. It\u2019s a static website, something from the last century. The whole thing about blogs is that they allow commenting. They were the first things to be interactive, the reason for Web2.0. However, most interaction has moved over to social media with the rise of spam. Spam got so evasive it forced bloggers to close down their commenting systems. But they soon realised this drove away their readers, because the sense of community had been lost. There was no reason to read a blog that didn\u2019t allow its readers to have their say. It was like the blogger was preaching, rather than communicating. And the act of moving elsewhere to comment meant the spontaneity for commenting was often lost on the way. Commenting on a blog is important because it creates a community, a safe haven, with your readers. It allows them to give feedback to what you have written. This enables you to find out what to write which they want to read. Comments also show the world that your posts have been read, and that your readers appreciate your writing. This encourages them to return to read the next post, and the comments from the other readers in response to their own. Comments can create a sense of discussion. OK, they may not be in real time like on social media, but the moderation keeps out the spam and trolls, eg makes sure the comments are clean and relevant. Blog commenting does require different tactics, eg they are more substantial because you know there won\u2019t be the ping-pong responses you get in real-time. Blog comments do better with a proper beginning, middle and end, whereas comments that are a single word or a one-liner tend to fall foul of the moderator. And I mentioned earlier that comments show the world the blog has readers. Plenty of comments suggest popularity. Popularity attracts more readers, and also the search engines. Their algorithms are set up to notice blogs with lots of reader interaction, because this means the content is worth reading, and therefore indexable. This may not be the case, as not every popular blogger is the most fantastic writer, but obviously the subject matter is what people want to read about, and makes readers want to have their say. ",
