            "answer_text": "The art of writing an essay is by far the most difficult of arts to practice, especially for the students who are still not mature enough to perceive instinctively the full implications of the subject matter of the compositions which they are called upon to attempt. Students, moreover, do not have generally adequate command over language to express themselves efficiently through a foreign medium like English. They keep on groping in darkness. Conceptual difficulties as well as difficulties of expressing thoughts, through a foreign medium, impinge adversely on the style of their writing. The essay has to bring thoughts to converge into a sharp focus so that after going through a well-written essay the reader feels unforgettably the dent of the author\u2019s thoughts on his own mind. The effectiveness of an essay, therefore, depends on the author\u2019s ability to present himself with the greatest possible clarity of thought and lucidity of expression. The style has to be straight and simple. There must be a direct hit on the points which the author desires to emphasize. Find more at The Art of Essay Writing in English | The College Study ",
