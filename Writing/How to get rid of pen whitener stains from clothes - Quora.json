            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to help but I have no idea what \u201cPen Whitener\u201d is. More info would help re what it is and what it is used for, name brand (for hopefully ingredients), how it got there, when you precisely discovered it, and anything else applicable. If you\u2019re talking about ink of some sort in a laundry load, washing in water has a zero to none chance of removal more time than not. Discovery after going through the dryer is the worst because heat can cause a reaction to the ingredients in combination to the different types of fibers of the clothing. You might take a few most important items to a REPUTABLE dry cleaner to get an on-hand opinion from either the person doing the cleaning or the manager. Don\u2019t trust a counter person to pass on sufficient info from you to the person who needs the whole story. ",
