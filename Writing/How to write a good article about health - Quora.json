            "answer_text": "The key to writing great health articles researching and only using reputable sources. People make all kinds of claims online. Stick to resources like Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, CDC, WHO, US National Library of Medicine and sometimes WEBMD. In health, it\u2019s also important to be very careful about your claims. Make sure you\u2019re clear on the difference between \u201cconnection/link\u201d and \u201ccause & effect\u201d. Just because a study can show a connection, doesn\u2019t mean that something causes something else. This is very common in studies. In the US, at least, if something hasn\u2019t been proven by the FDA, we have to say \u201cmay help \u201d or \u201ccan support\u201d rather than stating that something cures or treats something. FDA can fine you for making unapproved claims, especially if you\u2019re selling something. Disclaimers are also important.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things you can do. First, write about something people are thinking about. What are they afraid will happen to them? What are the risks? What can they do to make the pain and the problem go away? Why take this angle? Because people don\u2019t think about the dangers until they feel the pain. Then it\u2019s real and they\u2019re ready to do something about it. Second, use words people can understand. Doctors use lots of complicated words that confuse us, scare us, and make us look to them for definitive answers. When they hold the keys to a better future for you, you look to them as a savior who will rescue you from the darkness. You don\u2019t want to confuse people. They won\u2019t read your work when you do. If you\u2019ve got to use a medical term, explain it so a child can understand. Use word pictures to make it clear. Then your words will sound more like a warm conversation over coffee than a sleep-inducing college lecture. Do these two things and you\u2019ll have a fantastic article anyone will want to read. ",
