            "answer_text": "I don't think there's one right answer.  Grammatically speaking, you should Underline or Italicize. They are considered equivalent, so either is equally acceptable. However, there are deviations from these two that are so commonplace, no one would take issue with them in your essay. They are: \"Quotation Marks\" - This is actually not grammatically correct, as quotation marks are for shorter works, songs, articles. But people do it all the time, and if you do, it's not the end of the world. Capitalizing First Letters - Just be careful with this one. If you talk about The Matrix, the context is pretty clear, but if you're talking about the TV series Planet Earth, it can get confusing... I love Planet Earth. See? CAPITALIZING ALL LETTERS - This one I see a lot, and I use it myself. The advantage of it is it's pretty obvious you're highlighting the term in some way, but it also can be used with plain text, whereas you might have issues italicizing or underlining in that case. Essentially, they call can work. What's most important is clarity\u2014we understand the meaning\u2014and consistency\u2014once you once one type of format in an essay, stick to that format throughout! ",

            "answer_text": "Most people will agree that Pulp Fiction is better than I Spit on Your Grave.   If you can't Italicize, then underline:  Most people will agree that Pulp Fiction is better than I Spit on Your Grave.    If you can't Italicize and you can't underline, because your word processor is just that crude, then you signal that you are underlining this way:  Most people agree that _Pulp Fiction_ is better than _I Spit on Your Grave_.    Notice that, since the period at the end of the sentence is not part of the movie title, I quit Italicizing before I type the period. ",
