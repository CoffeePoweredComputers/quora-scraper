            "answer_text": "A part of answer to this question can be found here (specially point number 21) in this answer\u2192 Gaurav Garg's answer to How do I improve my writing skills for the UPSC? For the rest of it; here is the answer: First discover your present writing speed. For this solve full three hour question paper. The clock should run continuously. Even if you have to get up in between for food, sleep, toilet etc., let the clock run.This will determine your true efficiency and speedOnce you have discovered the time, then you will discover the factors which lead to decrease in your speed. Some of the common factors are:Lack of concentrationSleepinessBoredLack of motivationFaulty penfrustration with the questionsHunger pangsImagining life after getting selectedLack of knowledgepoor attitudememory of ex/present relationshipYou might recall that uncle/aunty/\u2019friend\u2019/enemy/teacher/batchmate/schoolmate and who not who told you that you will not succeed.You might recall all insults that you have ever faced.The list is endlessAll these factors which cause slow speed can be controlled. Meditate over them. Realise the importance of this exam. if any stray thought like above comes, say to yourself, ok for now let me write and will talk about it the moment exam is over.The solution lies in writing more within given time frame.Begin with 90 minutes of writing.Never practice writing 2\u20133 questions. Always do at least 10 questions in one go when you write. I have explained this in my answer to different question.Using imagination helps a lot. Recalling takes hell lot of time. Recalling slows down. (How to imagine will take another Quora answer, if you may like that to be answered as well.)Do not waste time reading the whole question paper the moment you get it. Just sit down and start writing the answers. Read questions as you progress.Do not talk before exam to anyone. Calm your mind. Focus on calmness. That will greatly increase your speed.Do not waste time drawing diagrams if you do not what to draw and if you have not tried it before.After prelim exam write more than you read. Even at cost of leaving some syllabus, you should be writing. Write till you have full control over writing.Join a test series. Write it from home without cheating.Eat curd and and sugar mixed before exam/practice at home. It reduces acidity. Calms you. It will fulfil your immediate nutrition requirement.For those who do not like curd may have jaggery or even better with to keep a clove in mouth for a while before entering the examination hall.For who do not like any of these- please try to like at least one of them for exam. It works magic. You need focus and concentration and you cannot afford to allow your body to trouble you.Learn to say no to everyone when you are practicing. When you are writing, keep writing even if there is earthquake or fire in building. The most important even for you should be completion of paper written in effective and efficient manner.Write till your hand is swollen during practice. I literally had a swollen hand. And then when your body gives up and says stop writing. Then write with your heart. DO NOT stop writing at home. I had this written in front of me on my desk - When the hand is tired write with heart.You should be obsessed about writing. Keep writing.Have a plan about how to write answer. Make your plans on the basis of this Quora answer. If you are clear with the plan than your speed will automatically increase. If you are sure about what you are writing, your writing speed will automatically increase.Whenever you slow down imagine that very moment why you first started? Try to pass the moment.Next important thing is Pen which can impact your writing speed.Contrary to common myth, ink pens can be really really fast. But they are expensive. A little practice will help.Whatever pen you choose, stick to that pen. Make it comfortable. Never use a brand new pen in hall. Buy few pens. Use them. Make them little used. Then take them to examination hall.Before I share the pen I used I must tell you that people have cleared this exam with 5 rupee pen as well. Further the pen I am going to share with you I DO NOT RECOMMEND this pen, as it is prohibitively expensive. For me it was a gift. I wrote my answers with this pen (TWSBI 580) and ink(Noodler\u2019s Baystate Blue) (I wrote average of 4000 words per exam):  I will update this answer based on comment and memory of what can be done and inputs if any from others. Please do not forget to comment on this answer. It motivates me to write more and write better answers. ",
