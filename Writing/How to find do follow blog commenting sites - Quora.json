            "answer_text": "Perhaps you\u2019ve heard that do-follow blog comments are bad. They\u2019ll destroy your site, bury your future\u2026 Bulshit! They\u2019re not that scary, but there\u2019s a right way to do them, and there\u2019s a wrong way. Here I will tell you how to get do-follow comment links that actually help your SEO And by reading you will also learn the common mistakes that make Google think you\u2019re just a common spammer. Don\u2019t be common. Read more. First, the simple truth: do-follow comment links are every weak. On their own they won\u2019t help you one iota. However, mixed in with other quality links they start to gain, and give value. This happens in two ways: First- they contribute to your overall link profile. Healthy link make-up is as diverse as it can be and do-follow blog comments contribute a lot. So it\u2019s a case that they\u2019re weak on their own but in the crowd they gain strength, and for you benefit no less. Second- I\u2019m convinced that at first Google doesn\u2019t trust do-follow comments. Because they\u2019ve been spammed to death before. So you leave a comment and\u2026 nothing! it\u2019s sterile, and no link equity passes through. But then you go and build other links and Google \u201crealizes\u201d that all you\u2019re doing is healthy marketing, so they suddenly start to count those do-follow links. How to Find do Websites that give Do-follow Blog Comments? Use a tool. This tool to be exact. Drop my link is: freeeasy to usefasteffectiveHere\u2019s how: Go to Drop My Link and set the parameters to: Category- Comment BacklinksFootprint- do-follow commentsAnd our test keyword shall be \u201cturmeric\u201d  Let\u2019s see what the tools shows.  The result=9 Drop My Link homed in on 9 websites. I checked them all and sure enough- they all allow do-follow blog commenting. Great! A Word on No-followed Comments You need those. Period. Here are 3 reasons why: 1. They make your link profile look more natural. It\u2019s normal that your site has both followed and no-followed links. Without them Google will easily see you\u2019re trying to game them. And the emphasis is on \u201ctrying\u201d 2. They push relevance. You thought nothing passes through no-followed links? You were wrong. No follow links build relevance because commenting happens on niche specific websites. So when you are turmeric site and you comment on other websites that talk about turmeric (and related herbs) you help Google understand that your site is also about those topics. And the more they understand who you are the higher you\u2019ll rank for the cluster of niche-specific keywords. 3. Traffic If you can be the first to comment, and the post becomes popular, you can gain valuable traffic. They won\u2019t be Earth-shattering numbers, but the folks who do come through will be highly curious to learn more about you. Conclusion Do-follow blog comment can help\u2026 if you know how to approach them, and if you\u2019re not greedy. Thanks for reading: I hope my answer has helped you, Nikola Roza ",
