            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t bother. They won\u2019t look at your \u2018submission\u2019 (writer, groveling). Historically, when manuscripts were physical collections of paper, all \u2018submissions\u2019 (writers, groveling) went onto the \u2018slush pile\u2019 and none were ever read. Publishers are not staffed to review \u2018submissions\u2019 (writers, groveling) and rely on agents to scout competent storytellers, fiction or nonfiction. Sending an email document attachment is not even possible with publishers today. They are not staffed to accept or review such \u2018submissions\u2019 (writers, groveling). You might try sending your \u2018submission\u2019 (writer, groveling) to an agent, but it won\u2019t help. Agents are servicing their established authors and rarely accept new clients. Indeed, the odds of even getting a response or acknowledgement from an agent are very poor. Even then, you have no way to know whether the agent is competent and well connected to principal editors at publishing houses. And even if that book is accepted by an agent and submitted (writer, groveling) to a publisher, it must compete with all the known, established, revenue-producing writers already inside the system. The reality, today, is that a writer with a book, either of infinite wonder and worth or better suited for lining the birdcage, who wishes to gain the attention of an agent or publisher, faces odds of around 1:100,000 in gaining that book\u2019s acceptance. That\u2019s just a guesstimate and other Quorans may have better odds. Reality is better than self-delusion. The route to acceptance, publication and eventual monetizing of a writer\u2019s work is long, hard and discouraging. And I derive no pleasure from explaining this. Here\u2019s the thing: agents\u2019 or publishers\u2019 evaluations of manuscripts are totally subjective, entirely a matter of taste. Many best sellers were rejected repeatedly by supposed brilliant arbiters of potential publishing success; many works from supposedly wonderful authors receive huge advances, yet fail. In the words of the great screenplay writer, William Goldman: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d He was referring to movies but with books it\u2019s no different. All it takes is a lightning strike, followed by popularity, then a cult following, regardless of genre. Then agents and publishers will be beating a path to your door, telling you how wonderful you are. Good luck with that. ",

If you are sending an unsolicited manuscript to an imprint of a mainstream publisher, assuming you\u2019ve checked and they accept unsolicited manuscripts, it will go into a slush pile. At some point whatever person has been assigned to read it will pick yours up, take a look, and if you\u2019re lucky keep reading long enough to at least warrant a halfway-personal rejection. If it\u2019s someone that guarantees they\u2019ll publish it, either you\u2019ve already got a contract and should know the name of the person you\u2019re dealing with or they\u2019re a scam/vanity press and you shouldn\u2019t be dealing with them at all.
