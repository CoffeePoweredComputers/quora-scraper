            "answer_text": "Heaven is the dwelling place of Almighty God and myriads of faithful spirit crearures. It is the spirit realm separate from the earthly realm. The Earth and everything in it was created for us, God's children. Created for our enjoyment. Psalm 37:29 states \u201cThe righteous will possess the Earth and they will live forever on it\u201d. The purpose for the Earth was originally to be a paradise. God himself designed the Garden of Eden. He created man and woman to care for it and to bring forth children to populate the Earth and spread this paradise all over the Earth. But, the first pair became disobedient, they lost their focus on our Almighty Heavenly Father. It was their freedom of conscious to do so. But the consequences were sin, suffering, death that all their children inherited. Heaven was not our inheritance. The Earth is. God came to the rescue after Adam and Eve sinned. He promised the end to satanic rebellion, the restoration of paradise, and the resurrection of the dead. That rescue was his son, Jesus Christ who proved obedience out of love for God and us was possible. He opened heaven to a \u201clittle flock\" who would rule over the Earth in righteousness and loyalty. This is the Kingdom that the entire Bible refers. When God's Kingdom comes, Earth will be as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10). ",

            "answer_text": "You need to honestly think about the reality and the practical implications of the concept of heaven, and that should help in determining if the story has any basis in the real world. How old is everyone in heaven?  Almost certainly the extremely elderly or young will want or need to be much younger or older, respectively.  If so, they won't be recognizable to the people who knew them when they died.Do babies go to heaven?  It would seem almost certainly so as they are what we call 'innocent'.  However, their brains havent developed to appreciate or have any useful function, so what good would eternity be for an infant?  Are we saying they grow to a youthful vibrant age in some heaven daycare and then stay that way forever?What happens to all the people we loved in life that didn't make the cut?  Surely if heaven exists then why not hell, so is heaven full of people mourning their loved ones eternally burning in some other realm?  I thought there was no sadness in heaven?  Is everyone just magically okay with it?Consider the idea of eternal happiness.  On earth, happiness is only meaningful because duldrum and sadness exist as well.  The idea of being happy forever would eventually become a kind of torture that our minds cannot handle.Where along the way did we evolve to the point that we get to go to a heaven?  Or is there an ape heaven as well?  What about before we were apes?  At what point in evolution did the cutoff happen and some people went to ape heaven and some to human heaven?  Are neanderthals and denisovans up there too?  Do they all mingle?  What about animals?How would Christian heaven relate to all the other religion's reward systems?  Are they all actually one place - and everyone who gets there is surprised by how different it is from what they were taught?Where in the universe would our modern earth human christian heaven exist?  Is it a physical place?  Is it a place a living human could ever visit or witness?  Is it just energy, and do we imagine it would ever be measurable?  Or does it exist only as thought - and if so, how would that survive the death of our bodies and all of our neurons turning to dust?Finally, consider the most likely reason for the idea of heaven.  If what you're selling has no physical presence in the observable world, you can offer literally anything as a reward for a lifetime of obedience (and donations, no doubt).  Saying you'll be happy forever and see all your beloved dead relatives again is just about the best thing a person can come up with - other than endless sex, but then our Islamic friends have that one covered.  Remember that whatever the supposed source of inspiration, religions are completely and wholly created by human beings. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The problem is not just one of lack of evidence, but one of whether Heaven makes sense as an idea. The problem is that death is not often a clean process for the brain. Consider that if someone slowly loses their sanity from birth to age 50 before dying of brain damage and going to Heaven? Which them goes? If it is their current self, then they have no personality and no thought process, because they're dead or seconds from death and their brain is so badly destroyed that they won't really be able to experience anything if they stay the same person. There is no way they could be \u201chealed\u201d either, because their entire life and personality came to be shaped by their disability. If they were \u201chealed,\u201d the person who ended up in Heaven would not be them. There is no fundamental essential version of them on which you can base their soul in Heaven. The same is true for anyone. If you go to Heaven before you're dead, then this creates a philosophical zombie to live out the rest of your life, who will not go to Heaven. If you go to Heaven while you're dead, your brain has been permanently altered and probably no longer holds any recognizable beliefs or personality. Heaven is not a robust enough concept to deal with the medical understanding of death. Someone hit by a .50 BMG round to the brain will have no personality in the final millisecond of life as each cell is systematically disconnected, popped, shorted out, crushed, or otherwise destroyed. If the you that went to Heaven is the you that died with their brain in 7000 pieces across half a room, that person probably had no beliefs or personality, and the parts of the brain still alive for the remaining milliseconds bear little resemblance to the original you. But take this a step further? What about an atheist shot in the head with a 9mm handgun who survives for another day and then dies, but converts on their deathbed to the correct religion due to a change in personality accompanied with severe mental disability caused by the gunshot wound? If they go to Hell the moment the bullet touches their head, then who is the person alive afterward and was their deathbed conversion in vain? Or if the deathbed convert goes to Heaven, are they given back their old personality, resulting in an immediate deconversion toward atheism? Or do people with severe brain damage just live a lower quality of life in Heaven as well? It really doesn't work out. There is no way to assign which version of \u201cyou\u201d should go to Heaven. What about people who've had their corpus callosum split? The two brain hemispheres now have separate thoughts. Can a brain hemisphere go to Heaven or Hell missing large personality components that were present in the brain beforehand? Neuroscience indicates Heaven and Hell as conventionally understood either do not make sense or are empty, since people's consciousness and personality and beliefs are not preserved well in any sort of death.

            "answer_text": "Yes and maybe. Yes, it is possible to live relatively good and happy life on earth (heaven on earth). Maybe there is an afterlife that has been provided by the courtesy of a benevolent being or, more likely, a community of benevolent beings.  No human being knows how likely that is.   On the one hand, it is unlikely that heaven just happens to exist.  But, it is possible that a species has evolved elsewhere that is benevolent and technologically advanced enough to provide a reasonably nice afterlife for us.  We do not currently have enough information to make a reasoned judgment as to how likely or unlikely that is. We have objective proof that there can be a tendency toward progress among a species of semi-rational, semi-social, sentient beings toward becoming more powerful, more compassionate, less exclusivist beings.  (Look at our own history). We also have objective proof that a species of semi-rational, semi-social, sentient beings has come to exist at least once in our universe. (We are that species). Our universe is huge.  We have no rational basis for assuming there are not many more similar universes.  To the contrary, as our horizons have expanded, we found that our sun was not unlike anything else, but was one of about one hundred billion  stars in our galaxy.  Our planet was not unlike anything else, but was one of many planets.  Our Galaxy was not the only galaxy, but one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in our universe.  If the pattern continues, our universe will be one among a large number of universes. It would appear that the number of opportunities for other semi-rational, semi-social, sentient species to evolve may be very large. Thus, we currently lack enough information to determine how likely it is that some being or community of beings have come to exist that use their superior technology benevolently to provide a nice afterlife to other sentient beings. What about the fact that we have no direct evidence of the existence of such a benevolent being or community?  If they exist, they are hidden from us.  But, this does not resolve the issue because they would have reason to hide themselves from us and not interfere excessively in our history.   Benevolence entails not exposing anyone to technology they are not intellectually, emotionally, and morally prepared to use in a beneficial manner.  (Remember Star Trek's prime directive).  An adequately advanced benevolent being or community of beings would not reveal themselves to us because our species needs to be allowed to mature at its own pace. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is more than a mind-bender. For thousands of years, certain people have claimed to have actually visited the place that, Saint Paul promised, \u201cno eye has seen \u2026 and no human mind has conceived,\u201d and their stories very often follow the same narrative arc. A skeptic, a rogue or an innocent suffers hardship or injury: he is hit on the head, he suffers a stroke, he sustains damage in a car crash or on the operating table. A feeling of disconnection comes over him, a sense of being \u201coutside\u201d himself. Perhaps he encounters an opening: a gate, a door, a tunnel. And then, all at once, he is being guided through other worlds that look and feel to him more \u201creal\u201d than the world in which he once existed. These realms are both familiar and strange, containing music that doesn\u2019t sound like music and light brighter than any light, and creatures that may or may not be angels, and the familiar faces of loved ones lost as well as figures from history and sometimes\u2014depending on the narrator\u2014even Jesus himself. The tourist is agape. Words fail. He leaves reluctantly to reoccupy his body and this earth. But the experience changes him forever. Convinced as he is of a wholly different reality, he is calmer, more self-assured, determined to persuade the world of heaven\u2019s truth. He tells his story to the masses. \u201cHeaven is real!\u201d he proclaims. The Book of Enoch, written hundreds of years before the birth of Jesus, tells a version of this story and so does the Book of Revelation, Christianity\u2019s most foundational description of the sights and sounds of heaven. So do the medieval visionaries whose accounts were to the Middle Ages what reality TV is to the 21st century: \u201creal\u201d events marketed as popular entertainment (with an edifying Christian message thrown in). And despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the increasing rationalism of our times, this narrative genre thrives today. Ninety Minutes in Heaven (2004), about a Christian pastor who ascended to God after a car wreck; Heaven Is for Real (2010), about a child who sees heaven during surgery; and Proof of Heaven, by a Duke-trained neurosurgeon who traveled to heaven in 2012, have all been bestsellers, all following the same storyline. The neurosurgeon, Eben Alexander, said in Newsweek in 2012 that his experience convinced him that his consciousness (the soul, or the self) exists somehow separate from or outside the mind and can travel to other dimensions on its own. \u201cThis world of consciousness beyond the body,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis the true new frontier, not just of science but of humankind itself, and it is my profound hope that what happened to me will bring the world one step closer to accepting it.\u201d Tales like these are thrilling in part because their tellers hold the passionate conviction of religious converts: I saw it, so it must be true. According to a Gallup poll, about 8 million Americans claim to have had a near-death experience (NDE), and many of them regard this experience as proof of an afterlife\u2014a parallel, spiritual realm, more real, many say, than this one. Raymond Moody, who wrote Life After Life in 1975, one of the first popular books about NDEs, told CNN in 2013 that among people who have had such experiences, conviction about an afterlife transcends the particulars of religion. \u201cA lot of people talk about encountering a being of light,\u201d he said. \u201cChristians call it Christ. Jewish people say it\u2019s an angel. I\u2019ve gone to different continents, and you can hear the same thing in China, India and Japan about meeting a being of complete love and compassion.\u201d Moody was one of the founders of the International Association for Near-Death Studies, a group devoted to building global understanding of such experiences. It\u2019s an inversion, almost, of the old philosophical puzzle: If a tree falls in the forest and there\u2019s no one there to hear it, does it make a sound? If you are certain that you saw something (or felt something or heard something), does it mean that it\u2019s empirically proven? And if you are predisposed to want to see something, are you likelier to see it, the way Harry Potter saw his dear departed mother in Hogwarts\u2019s magic mirror? And finally, if you see something while you are stressed or unconscious or traumatized in some way, does that circumstance delegitimize the veracity of your vision? This is the trouble with NDEs as a field of scientific study: you can\u2019t have a control group. Most people on the brink of dying do die (and so cannot describe what that process is like), and those who survive approach the brink in such different ways\u2014car accident, stroke, heart attack\u2014that it\u2019s impossible to compare their experiences empirically. But over the years, science has posited a number of theories about the connection between visions of heaven and the chemical and physical processes that occur at death. Andrew Newberg is a neuroscientist and professor at Thomas Jefferson University and Hospital and has made his reputation studying the brain scans of religious people (nuns and monks) who have ecstatic experiences as they meditate. He believes the \u201ctunnel\u201d and the \u201clight\u201d that NDE-ers so frequently describe can be easily explained. As your eyesight fades, you lose the peripheral areas first, he points out. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019d have a tunnel sensation.\u201d If you see a bright light, that could be the central part of the visual system shutting down last. Newberg puts forward the following scenario, which he emphasizes is guesswork: When people die, two parts of the brain that usually work in opposition to each other act cooperatively. The sympathetic nervous system\u2014a web of nerves and neurons that run through the spinal cord and spread to virtually every organ in the body\u2014is responsible for arousal or excitement. It gets you ready for action. The parasympathetic system, with which the sympathetic system is entwined, calms you down and rejuvenates you. In life, the turning on of one system promotes the shutting down of the other. The sympathetic nervous system kicks in when a car cuts you off on the highway; the parasympathetic system is in charge as you\u2019re falling asleep. But in the brains of people having mystical experiences, and perhaps in death, both systems are fully \u201con,\u201d giving a person a sensation both of slowing down, being \u201cout of body,\u201d and of seeing things vividly, including memories of important people and past events. It is possible, Newberg asserts\u2014though not at all certain\u2014that visions of heaven are merely chemical and neurological events that occur during death. Since at least the 1980s, scientists have theorized that NDEs occur as a kind of physiological defense mechanism. In order to guard against damage during trauma, the brain releases protective chemicals that also happen to trigger intense hallucinations. This theory gained traction after scientists realized that virtually all of the features of an NDE\u2014a sense of moving through a tunnel, an out-of-body feeling, spiritual awe, visual hallucinations, intense memories\u2014can be reproduced with a stiff dose of ketamine, a horse tranquilizer frequently used as a party drug. In 2000 a psychiatrist named Karl Jansen wrote a book called Ketamine: Dreams and Realities, in which he interviewed a number of recreational users. One of them described a drug trip in a way that might be familiar to Dante, or the author of Revelation. \u201cI came out into a golden Light. I rose into the Light and found myself having an unspoken exchange with the Light, which I believed to be God \u2026 I didn\u2019t believe in God, which made the experience even more startling. Afterwards, I walked around the house for hours saying \u2018Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\u2019 \u201d For some scientists, however, purely scientific explanations of heavenly visions do not suffice. Emily Williams Kelly is a psychologist who works at the University of Virginia\u2019s Division of Perceptual Studies, which treats the study of NDEs as legitimate science. Her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is impressive: she has degrees from Duke, the University of Virginia and the University of Edinburgh\u2014not institutions one usually associates with the study of the supernatural or paranormal. Kelly has spent her career researching, as she puts it, \u201cthe interface between the brain and the mind.\u201d Practically speaking, she interviews dying people and tries to find patterns among their similarities. Kelly believes the experiences of people who have had near-death visions demonstrate that consciousness exists even after normal brain function ceases. (She would seem to provide some corroboration for Eben Alexander\u2019s claims.) This theory, she argues, could suggest explanations for the afterlife: \u201cIf our conscious experience totally depends on the brain, then there can\u2019t be an afterlife\u2014when the brain is gone, the mind is gone. But it\u2019s not that simple. Even when the brain seems to be virtually disabled, people are still having these experiences.\u201d What is she saying? That upon death, people really go to another realm? And that science can prove it? Kelly shrugs. NDEs \u201ctell us to open our minds and think there may be a great deal more to mind and consciousness\u2014that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m willing to go.\u201d When Alexander published his book in 2012, drawing on the work of Kelly and her husband, Edward, he drew derision, as he knew he would, from broad segments of the rationalist and scientific communities. Having fallen into a coma after contracting bacterial meningitis, he saw incredible things. \u201cI was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cmillions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through blooming flowers, blossoms on trees, and they were all coming out as we flew through them\u2026[There were] waterfalls, pools of water, indescribable colors, and above there were these arcs of silver and gold light and beautiful hymns coming down from them. Indescribably gorgeous hymns. I later came to call them \u2018angels,\u2019 those arcs of light in the sky.\u201d This experience convinced him beyond any doubt of the existence of a loving God and the ability of souls to travel to the realms where God lives. The idea of a godless universe \u201cnow lies broken at our feet, \u201d he wrote in his book. \u201cWhat happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more than our physical brains as clear as I can.\u201d The rationalist author Sam Harris, who is also a neuroscientist, aimed a fierce critique at Alexander\u2019s account of his NDE. On his blog, Harris wrote that while he had no particular convictions about the essence or origins of consciousness, he was quite sure Alexander\u2019s argument was specious. No one\u2019s cerebral cortex shuts down entirely during coma, Harris pointed out. Additionally, the doctor showed no understanding of the kinds of neurotransmitters that can be released by the brain during trauma, including one called DMT, which produces hallucinations. \u201cLet me suggest that, whether or not heaven exists, Alexander sounds precisely how a scientist should not sound when he doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about, \u201d Harris concluded. My own concern is somewhat different, relating back to the tree-in-the-forest conundrum. I believe Alexander (and all the others who testify to having visited heaven) saw what he says he saw, but one person\u2019s vision, seen during trauma, does not add up to proof. Further all the emphasis on Alexander\u2019s scientific credentials that accompanied the marketing of his book is disingenuous and entirely beside the point: the veracity of a vision of heaven would have nothing to do with where one went to medical school.

            "answer_text": "No. There\u2019s no proof that there is a heaven. It\u2019s a term that people have used for centuries to describe a place that does not exist per se. However, if you drop the term \u201cheaven\u201d and use the term that people actually use \u201cback home\u201d - then yes, there is quite a bit of first person accounts of people who claim to remember after their lifetime \u201cgoing home.\u201d They consistently describe this place as a place of being with a person\u2019s loved ones (\u201csoul group\u201d) being advised by wiser souls (\u201cspirit guides\u201d) and in general describe a feeling of \u201cUnconditonal love\u201d associated with that particular place. No two descriptions are identical as to the visuals - but the reports are consistent across all the 45 people I\u2019ve filmed talking about that journey. We tend to use the term \u201cheaven\u201d as short hand to meet something - but I refer to it as a \u201cbrain freeze word.\u201d Because it is associated with religion. And what these people claim (2000 from Dr. Helen Wambach and over 7k from Michael Newton) is that this \u201cback home\u201d place has nothing, zero to do with any organized religion here on the planet. There\u2019s not one report I\u2019ve seen where people claim that they experienced anything remotely like any version of the afterlife as described in various religious texts. Zero. None. I\u2019d be happy to report that to be the case. So on one hand, we\u2019re talking about a \u201cplace\u201d that is \u201cetheric in nature.\u201d Consciousness appears to be the vehicle that \u201ccreates\u201d this particular place, and it had little or nothing to do with tactile pleasure or sensations. Those artifacts remain reportedly remain here. One can argue that it cannot exist if there\u2019s no physical evidence of it existing - and that makes sense. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that it does not exist, as there are many things that do exist that are beyond our capacity to experience them in a tactile way. (sounds that reach below 20 hz or above 20k hz, light waves that are outside the visible spectrum, tastes that animals are aware of, smells they\u2019re aware of that humans can never be aware of with the equipment we use while we are here. If it\u2019s true that bees can see UV light and we cannot - it may equally be true that humans in energetic form experience \u201cgoing back home\u201d when we here on the planet cannot. ",

            "answer_text": "NOTE: This answer was originally directed to a person who believes in heaven, but was given a classroom assignment to debate and argue against the existence of heaven. That person\u2019s question was merged into this thread, and without knowledge of the reason for my answer, the follwoing answer might appear confusing. Plan to rebut arguments for heaven. The strongest arguments for the existence of heaven would probably be: 1. Near death experiences. That will be very likely to come up, so prepare to answer it. For me, the best explanation for NDE's is that people hallucinate for various reasons such as low blood oxygen or being in a drugged state in the hospital. I'm not clear on it, but looking down that avenue should suffice. Find natural explanations for NDE's. 2. Widespread belief in the afterlife. Billions of people believe in some sort of afterlife, so plan a rebuttal for this argument. Billions of people can, after all, be wrong. 3. The teachings and resurrection of Jesus. Jesus allegedly rose from the dead, and taught his followers that they would join him there. Jesus' only claim to having the authority to say heaven exists is his resurrection so, even though you are a Christian yourself, compose arguments against the Resurrection of Jesus. I don't think you'll need to make these arguments unless the other side claims Jesus as an authority. It's a rebuttal argument only. As for arguments for the non-existence of heaven, the atheists have this one covered. Where is the evidence? Claim you have no burden of proof. If the instructor won't pass you unless you try to prove a non-existence, then do your best. Some arguments against heaven might be: 1. Where is heaven? There is no place in the known universe where humans can go for all eternity. 2. What's the point of eternal life? Every star, galaxy, etc. will eventually be destroyed, and new stars/galaxies will be formed. Why are we any different? We are all destroyed in death, and the young pick up where we left off. There is no need to keep us around. 3. How can humans be expected to live in peace for eternity when we can't even make peace for the few years we are here on earth? Anyway, it's your project, not mine. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Muyiwa, A wonderful question, what is the proof that Heaven exist? I will take the challenge to explain it to you in detail. I hope you take the time to study the words and try to understand it, that is all I ask from you. Because, I feel this could be a long answer. It is not difficult to understand, just very different than what you have heard before. Still it all will connect. Open yourself and just try to understand our logical approach. Afterwards, you can always decide when you want to believe it or not. I know that Heaven exist, let me explain you why? Give it time and space, to learn something new. Let us try to see, what is beyond the stairs of our earthly plane.  You have probably heard people speaking about Heaven, or read it in the Bible or somewhere else you picked it up. Now, you are wondering what is Heaven and does it exist and how can we really know it exist? How can you know something is real, when you don\u2019t understand who you really are, and in what kind of dimension are we living. What is reality? Are we a human? Looks like it, feels like it, hears like it, smells like it, tastes like it, more or less. You understand the senses defines normally our reality. Now, some scientists have made very technical advanced instruments and can measure all different happenings on earth and know everything about happenings on earth. Sometimes we can\u2019t experience it with our senses, but our measurements are so good, they can explain even more about our earthly plane. All this defines our human reality of the Atheist. WHAT ARE WE REALLY?  No, I am not going to tell you that we are an insect. It is just a picture that explains that our scientists have developed powerful electro telescopes and with this they can zoom into material. Like cells of a fly, or cells of a human, or just material. We always see a lot of space in the cells and molecules. When we zoom into the molecules, we see again a lot of space and atoms. When we zoom into the atoms, we see a lot of space and protons and neutrons, when we zoom these elements we find space and quarks. When we zoom into quarks, we find space and weightless energy patterns. (There are some more smaller parts defined, but end all in weightless energy parts). This really means that material does not exist. There is no part we can describe as material. When we look with perfect eyes, like an electro telescope we see only space and energy. Conclusion, we live in an reality that looks and feels real, still it is immaterial, just energy patterns in space. Stacked in a specific way. It is like a consciousness, a dream that looks very real for our senses. When you ask scientists and brain specialists about this. They confirm this reality of our earth, can be a dream an illusion. Which we have proven. Right? Our earthly plane and life is an expression of energy. Who are you really? When your body is space and energy, your brain is space and energy, and your thoughts are energy in specific frequencies (proven also by scientists). Yes, you are your awareness. The brain specialists and scientist have searched for the observer in the brain, but they can\u2019t find the observer. A better name for the observer is your awareness. Because when you are blind, you still observe. To take away the confusion it is better to say, we are aware that we exist. What is your awareness? Your awareness is an electric field of energy that is aware of itself. What did Jesus said about who we are? We are rest and movement and come from the light. Yes, energy. Is it really so strange to believe that we are an energetic awareness that we call Soul. No it is not. Our awareness filters our senses on a very narrow electro magnetic spectrum. That means we see only a little, we hear only a little, we feel only a little, we taste only a little and we smell only a little and we can measure only a little. That means we see earth as a reality, because of the filter. When our awareness has no filter it sees, space and energy. Our awareness is energy. According to scientists energy can never be destroyed and will always exist. That means our Soul is immortal. Your awareness is immortal. For so far we know who we are. See picture below.  When you are an immortal awareness, you will always live. What is our reality? What is our human life? Our human life, earth and universe is an expression of energy, a consciousness build to create a dream that is so real that even the Souls who participate in it, will think they are human. Get the picture? The Soul has an possibility to project a conscious part of your Soul, what is called your awareness into this human vessel. The Soul operates your projected human body, to experience an apparently material world, to learn from this material world, and to evolve itself into a more experienced and more positive awareness. Why can\u2019t the Soul be in our earthly plane? Because the Soul is real, an energetic field that is aware does exist for ever. The expression of energy of our world, is an illusion for the Soul. Like a school for the Soul. The awarenesses of all living things are in the in-between dimension. That is the place where all people go to when they pass over. This is a dimension that has the ability and laws of the apparently material dimension and the laws of the immaterial pure positive dimension, we call Heaven. How do we know this in-between dimension is real. Because there are many people that have communicated with passed over Souls, there are many people that experienced small manifestations of Ghosts, which are lost Souls. We have people that experienced a near death experience and experienced to go out of the body. We have a lot of people, including me that have experienced out of body experiences. What all confirms the existence of this in-between dimension. Which makes it possible for Souls to communicate with people on earth. They don\u2019t really talk with the humans on earth. But with the attached Soul. That is the reason why psychics and sensitive people, can communicate through their Souls awareness with other Souls. etc. Now you have heard all this information. My question for you, do you think we live in a material world or an immaterial world? Yes, with no doubt an immaterial world. We come closer that we can understand that the home of our immaterial Souls is an immaterial dimension. Why is Heaven good and pure positive and vibrates on a very high frequency? Have a look at the next picture. Let us study ourselves to understand life better. You see on the left side of the picture, the quoted frequencies. Brain specialists have researched the brain waves and concluded this picture. Positive thoughts create positive emotions and feel great. Negative thoughts create negative emotions and feel bad. If you study the picture a little better you see that how more positive thoughts, which are good for you AND good for all other people on the world AND good for Nature you formulate, how more happier and more in balance you will become. You are raising your frequency, by formulating these pure positive thoughts. That is the reason why positive emotions have a higher frequency, than negative emotions. what does it say about our Souls energy. When you raise your Souls energy you become pure and positive, like an angel, like Jesus, like the ultimate consciousness evolved.This is what the school of Souls is all about, to evolve as awareness.  A negative dimension does not exist. A hell does not exist in the immaterial dimension, this is impossible. A hell only exist on earth. Believe it or not, it is your decision. Why does a negative dimension not exist, you can never have minus two apples, or minus energy, this does not make sense. You can only have positive energy that vibrates on a low frequency as in the alpha state, or on a high frequency as in an omega state. We have the immaterial dimension we call Heaven, vibrating on a high frequency. We have an in-between dimension, where low frequency awarenesses can exist and high frequency awarenesses can exist. When you pass over you are in the in-between dimension. Your ego perspective is your creator of negative thoughts on earth. It causes the negative emotions. When you have large ego perspective, than you have lowered your Souls energy into a lower frequency. This makes it impossible for you to return to Heaven. Still you have a choice. You can get rid of your ego perspective and negative thoughts on earth, and become enlightened, that means you formulate pure positive thoughts, like stated before. Than you have already transformed your Souls energy in a high frequency energy and can enter Heaven easily. Because you vibrate on the same frequency. Or when you passed over, you will have to work at your ego perspective and to get rid of it in the in-between dimension. Only when you let go of negative thoughts and replace with positive thoughts, you can enter this immaterial pure positive dimension, we call Heaven. A Soul vibrating on a very high frequency, means really unconditional love. In fact, believe it or not, it is your choice. We as Souls are all angels. The fallen angels some people talk about, are lost Souls who refuse to transform their negative thoughts into positive thoughts. They don\u2019t want to raise their frequency and stay in the in-between dimension for as long they want. They roam the earth and other places, like lost Souls, ghosts. It is what it is. When you overview all this information, you realize that an immaterial world is real and a material world, earthly world is an illusion. That is the only right conclusion you can make. When you look at the immaterial world, you know that it is made from pure positive energy, just like you. Closer than this I can\u2019t make it more obvious, than to say, wait until you pass over and see where you go. Or you study the ancient real words of Jesus and will see they are in base all the same. (Still even the Bible has been rewritten for control and power). Embrace that what is good and transform the negativity into positivity, based on your decision what is right and wrong, what is positive and what is negative. You will find the truth when you start searching for it. Jesus said: the first people on earth, (with the biggest ego perspective) will be the last in Heaven. He was right. They have to work a lot on transforming negative thoughts into positive thoughts, before their energy of their Soul raises and they can enter Heaven too.  The main reason of everyones life is to grow above the own negativity of their egoistic, greedy and negative ego perspective and to grow above the negativity of life, by formulating in good and bad situations, pure positive thoughts, which are good for you AND good for all people on the world/ beyond AND good for Nature. This is the only way to create balance in yourself, balance between people and balance with Nature. When you have more questions, or need more details, just ask. Choose well.

            "answer_text": "Our sense of justice demands that there must be a reward for those who lived their lives for God and punishment for the criminals -those who offended, abused, raped and murdered people. Human beings have a sense of right and wrong and good and evil. And so, we have a justice system in all government system we have - we put into trial all those who are accused of doing crimes and punish those who are guilty. Our desire for justice in this life is there because we are moral beings and we crave for justice. But our earthly justice and penal systems are not perfect. Not all criminal investigation results in a conviction. People literally get away with murder, rape and abuse. Is that right? If there is no heaven or hell, then criminals truly got away with what they have done. Some rich people are able to bribe their way out of prison. They do not have to pay for anything. Sometimes the justice system itself is corrupt or flawed. Is that right? Is that okay? Is that acceptable to our sensibilities? A shocking number of US murders went unsolved last year There\u2019s a nearly 40 per cent chance you\u2019ll get away with murder in America What about those who were oppressed, abused, raped, and murdered? If there is no heaven and hell, then they will never get justice. They were victims of crimes forever, and the guilty would never ever get punished. They were just very unlucky victims who would never be heard and be given justice. Is that right? Is that okay? Is that acceptable to our sensibilities? Our innate sense of justice demands heaven and hell. Below is a video of a man named Ninoy Aquino - he was a Filipino politician who was unjustly imprisoned for many years [some in solitary confinement]. While in prison, he pondered about life, meaning, purpose, and if there is a God or not. At the end of the day, he surmised that there must be a God, a heaven and a hell - otherwise, his life and his suffering are totally meaningless and the perpetrators of the crimes committed to him get away without punishment. His long-suffering led him to the conclusion that there would be an eternal justice one day and he would get his justice in the next life if not here on earth. [He did not get justice on earth - he was murdered.]  Human beings crave for justice. Injustice on earth demands justice in the afterlife. Otherwise, life is meaningless and absurd. ",

            "answer_text": "There is absolutely no evidence that heaven exists. Try these seven ways to prove if heaven exists and see how difficult it is: Bible True, then Heaven True. We do know that much of what we read in the Bible is not true.Jesus True, then Heaven True. We only know about Jesus from the Bible, so if the Bible is not true in the claims it makes about Jesus, then Jesus is not true in terms of being out saviour.God True, then Heaven True. We only know about God from the Bible, so if the Bible is not true in the claims it makes about God, there may be no God and therefore no heaven.Christian principles true, Heaven True. Not necessarily. Christian principles are similar to the principles of many other religions, both ancient and modern, but they can\u2019t all be true.Miracles True, then Heaven True. Many religions report miracles, not just Christianity. If reports of pagan miracles do not prove the tenets of the pagan religion, then reports of Christian miracles do not prove the tenets of the Christian religion.Does Christian ideology give objective grounds for believing heaven is real. Certainly, Christianity claims to know the answer, but can not provide it.Near death experiences True, then Heaven True. Paul Kurtz says in Science and Religion: Are They Compatible? that not everyone who is dying reports near-death experiences, but the common factor is the belief that one is dying. In other words, he did not find a belief in any particular deity to be a common factor, or even the likelihood of death \u2014 simply the belief that one is dying. He found interesting that when Christians report near-death experiences they report visions compatible with the Christian religion, but when Hindus report near-death experiences they report Hindu experiences.If there is no God there logically can be no heaven, but if your faith requires you to believe that God actually exists, then it is still possible to say there is no heaven. The biblical evidence is that prior to the Babylonian Exile, the Jews did not believe in heaven as a place of reward. You could ask, if heaven exists, why the Jews only learnt about heaven during the Exile, when they came into contact with the Zoroastrian religion of their Persian liberators. No matter how you look at it, there is no reason to believe heaven exists. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Where is heaven? Firmly in your imagination. Whilst the concept of a heaven is a very ancient one, going back as far as ancient Egypt some 5,000 years ago, it\u2019s entirely imaginary, and arose out of the beliefs of our ancient ancestors at a time long before they had any idea of the laws of science which govern life, death and everything. There\u2019s only one reason why the idea of a heaven still persists to this day, and that\u2019s because it - along with the equally imaginary concepts of a soul, an afterlife and a hell - are part of the mechanism used by organised religions to gain and retain followers. \u201cFollow us, believe what we tell you and do what we tell you, and after you die, part of you will live forever in peace and contentment this wonderful place called heaven, reunited with your already dead loved ones.\u201d But of course then the threats come out: \u201cDon\u2019t follow us, don\u2019t believe what we tell you and don\u2019t do what we tell you, and after you die, part of you will live forever in agony, burning in this place called hell.\u201d These are powerful psychological messages to huge numbers of people (especially impressionable children), particularly when backed up by an innate human propensity to believe in the supernatural, and especially when supported by the claim that there\u2019s this entity called a god, who looks after you in life - but only if you believe in it of course! But not one single part of it has any basis in reality, not one tiny bit. It\u2019s all about religions maintaining power and control, both over people and in wider society, not to mention the wealth they gain. If organised religions were any other type of business, certainly in modern westernised societies, they\u2019d be shut down in an instant for breaking just about every consumer protection law there is concerning the honesty, truthfulness and validity of their claims concerning their \u2018product\u2019! Unfortunately though, this belief in souls, spirits, an afterlife\u2026, also generates a huge market in frauds, people who claim, either because of genuine self-delusion or downright duplicity, that they can facilitate you making contact with the dead, or they can ensure you get to heaven after you die. Don\u2019t believe a word of any of it, it\u2019s utter rubbish, and despite their pseudo-scientific claims, haven\u2019t got one single shed of credible evidence to support what they say. Dead is dead. Souls do not exist; an afterlife does not exist; heaven does not exist - apart from in the mind of those indoctrinated with a belief in them, period. ",

This man was a vicious dictator, and yet died happy in bed. Wheras this poor fellow was pious and served his community and yet died a painful death of disease and poverty. \u201cThat\u2019s not just! That\u2019s not fair\u201d they would cry. And they would be right. And then they might point out. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being good and unselfish? If the thieves and murderers go unpunished and the pious go unrewarded?\u201d Oh dear, oh dear. We cannot have this. We can\u2019t have people thinking being bad is tolerable, and being unselfish is pointless. So, I thought upon this problem and found a solution: \u201cJustice is rectified after death!\u201d Yes! That will do! So\u2026 When a bad person dies, their crimes are tallied and they are subject to terrible punishments in some, post-death detention center. Something really quite nasty. Just to put those ideas of being selfish out of their heads. And when a good person dies, they go to a nice resort, with ..er.. swimming pools and on-demand massages. And the weather is always nice. So that solves the problem! By promising post mortem justice we get them to behave in this life by the clever application of carrot and stick. It does not really matter that I made this stuff up. What matters is that they now behave themselves. Of course I should keep the actual details fuzzy. If a man dies and his wife remarries, he finds himself in heaven having to share her with another fellow. That could get embarrassing. What if someone has both bad and good qualities. Infinite suffering would be unjust. But some of their misdeeds should be paid for. And if a supernatural being is able to make a perfect place, how come they cannot make this world perfect? What\u2019s with all the deferred gratification? Never mind. Worry about that later. If someone had told me that heaven (and hell) exists, I might have reason to be suspicous. Because someone aiming to take control of a community would invent something that sounded exactly like that. With vague promises of reward, but all the specifics left out. The world, as it happens, is not policed. Injustice abounds. The only justice we have is that we make for ourselves. But we can mollify the population of we provide a comforting fiction of all things being rectified in some unseen place. ",

In my case, the neocortex was out of the picture. I was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed completely free of the limitations my physical brain\u201d. \u201cMine was in some ways a perfect storm of near-death experiences. As a practicing neurosurgeon with decades of research and hands-on work in the operating room behind me, I was in a better-than-average position to judge not only the reality but also the implications of what happened to me\u201d.  \u201cThose implications are tremendous beyond description. My experience showed me that the death of the body and the brain are not the END of consciousness, that human experience continues beyond the grave. More importantly, it continues under the gaze of a God who loves and cares about each one of us and about where the universe itself and all the beings within it are ultimately going\u201d.  Finally, modern physics has demonstrated that consciousness (mind) DOES exist independent of matter. \u201cObviously\u201d this means there is NO scientific basis for denying immaterial conscious beings.

            "answer_text": "Probably not. If the entire universe was designed around a system where people would be born into painful positions and be products of their environments only to have this omnipotent being who makes a painstaking test he knows the endings of could have designed it any other way, that would require this god was sadistic. The idea of getting what we deserve is deeply satisfying to us humans, but do people really deserve to burn forever or be rewarded forever for being born into abusive or nurturing environments respectively? Science has shown that humans are good only when they are in nurturing environments. One of the hardest facts to accept is that good people do not always get what they deserve. Not only that, but morality is subjective, so doing one thing that seems good to you is evil in other's eyes. Regardless, people wouldn't get what they deserved regardless of whether an afterlife existed. I'm not just referring to Heaven and Hell, either- I'm referring to the Fields of Asphodel, The Fields of Punishment, Elysium, the Isles of the Blessed and the Egyptian afterlife. One of the most difficult life lessons to learn is that it's easier to be a good person when you are promised a reward, but the most heroic acts are those that don't directly benefit you. It's easy to do the right thing when it offers you short-term rewards. As for the afterlife complex in Red Dead Redemption 2:  I found this rather silly. Why did I find the wolf-stag visions silly? Why, because if the wolf and the stag are metaphor for heaven and hell, then if I am going to suffer forever because Is it better to give someone freedom to do as they please or to just make them perfect? If you have the threats of heaven and hell involved, then people don't really have free will. Not only that, but people are products of their environments. They can only make choices they have learned how to make. So, say I was dishonourable- the fame should just turn me into an all-powerful, all-perfect being who would solve very problem in the world. Why are there problems again if \u201cGod\u201d supposedly designed it that way? Why is murder so wrong if it's \u2018part of \u201chis\u201d plan\u2019? What about if I was 1 honour over or under the requirements to get the honourable or dishonourable ending? What's worse, is murdering hundreds of people suddenly made okay because the character is likeable? I understood Jon Marston\u2019s motives, but Arthur\u2019s? Arthur was self-aware that he was a bad person fron the beginning. Not even Christians can agree on this supposedly \u201cobjective morality\u201d, which is part of my point. As soon as you introduce a designer into the picture, the fault lies no longer with the designed, but with the designer. If a watch doesn't work, do you blame the watch, or the watchmaker? But that just solves the emotional part that makes religion so attractive to some people. I disbelieve in an afterlife because the logic of it doesn't line up with the nature of the universe. With natural selection and the trillions of planets we will never see because they are travelling a turret a too fast, it's safe ti say this universe wasn't built for us. We randomly evolved, and those who didn't evolve the necessary useful traits to survive died out. A wild tiger does not care about you or you misfortunes- it simply wants it's dinner. The universe does not hate you and the bed does not hate you when you stubbed your toe- it's an inanimate object with no brain or emotions. It used to have some degree of emotions when it was a tree, but now it's dead. The universe does not hate you, and neither does it love you. You can't generalise the entire universe just because you are used to dealing with people who like or dislike you. Good people don't always get what they deserve. Just look at Martin Luther King. If he really had the support of a benevolent designer god then racism wouldn't exist to begin with. Hitler died and that's the end of that. He's now decomposing. Hitler is decomposing. Hitler is the body. Don't pull out the \u201cmysterious ways\u201d card trick because that same premise can apply to literally any tyrannical dictator to exist. I could just as easily say that Hitler or Stalin worked in \u201cmysterious ways\u201d. I disbelieve in an afterlife because there's no evidence for it. Most of my Christian friends think that I would go to heaven if it existed, but that really depend son who's idea of \u201cheaven\u201d you a re asking about. If a god sends me to burn for If I believed in God, then Zeus and Hades might punish me by sticking my feet into the ground and starving me for the rest of eternity. If I believed in Hades, then Osiris might destroy my spirit and I\u2019ll cease to exist. If I believe in Osiris, Odin might send me to Helheim. If I believe in Odin, Allah might send me to burn forever for eating pigs and for not wearing my hijab (again, it depends who you ask). I don't see God as being any more real that Zeus, Aghalee or Osiris. God is a fictional character from my point of view who exists only as a label for anything people don't understand. I don't need to disprove that there's a bear in my wardrobe to disbelieve claims about it. You can't nod your head at a proposition just because it sounds nice on paper. Why is disbelieving that my poop passes through an omnipresent diety more amazing than disbelieving that there's a bear in my wardrobe? I know bears exist because there's evidence that bears exist. Everyone can agree independent from perr pressure what a bear is. Nobody can do the same with a god. People couldn't even decide what Zeus was allegedly. So to answer the question: no, I don't think heaven exists. There have been nothing but claims about heaven existing, and they all come from very specific people who are not independent in its description. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a class of questions which can be answered by science. Generally speaking, these questions arise from physical phenomena. As well, although many fail to examine the matter carefully, science deals with certain clearly non-physical phenomena (such as the laws of physics; think about it), but which are also, one may say, generalized to all things. On the other hand, people-- likewise quite clearly-- have a great number of attributes which are not able to be directly examined by science, yet which are, so far as we are able to discover through science, unique to humans. That is, these attributes are precisely those which make us human (as regards our possibilities, not our species).  If you have ever been in love (a phenomena which language itself cannot adequately describe, nor can science determine anything about its essence), then you know the answer to your question. If you have ever experienced the birth of a child, then you know the answer to your question. If you have ever been carried away by joy, or experienced the pleasure of sharing time with good friends, or spent time amazed by someone's wisdom, then you know the answer to your question. If likewise you would want to ask about the reality of hell, similar assertions could be made. If you have ever been angry without cause for days or years, then you know whether hell exists. If you have been ashamed because you have been selfish or foolish or careless in some really important matter, then you know whether hell exists. If you have suffered deeply because of a stupid mistake, then you know whether hell exists. Heaven, in both this world and the next, is not a matter of place: it is a matter of condition; likewise hell. The proof of these conditions in this world is easy for most people to find, because the vast majority of humans have been in both places. But note that whereas science can examine the results of, say, joy (e.g. research into endorphins), it cannot prove the existence of joy itself. Scientists may accept self-reports of love as proof of the existence of love, but if examined carefully, what has happened in such an instance is not that science proved something, but rather that it stipulated something as a given, as an essentially unexamined assumption. That is the key with regard to the essence of all states and conditions that make humans human: they must be experienced, and cannot be proven by science. If you have experienced love, you don't need science to prove that it exists. And if you have never experienced love-- and there are some few who have not-- then science will not help you discover its truth and beauty.  And with regard to your question, then, that points to the answer. I know, in and of myself, and because of my own individual experience, the answer to your question. I know, because of my own individual experience, that humans have an experiential capacity for answering your question. But likewise, I know, because of my own individual experience, that my experience is proof only for me, and not for anyone else. You must, therefore answer the question yourself. I would assert, as a matter of universal truth, that God exists and that our existence continues beyond this mortal coil. But, as well, I am certain, as a matter of universal truth, that my thought, experience and belief  cannot serve as proof for anyone else.  (And by the way, this is not some partisan 'heaven'. God is limitless, well beyond the highest and best and most sincere human explanations, and therefore obviously beyond our petty and exclusivist preening. I expect to find absolutely everyone who has gone before me immersed in that ocean of light, and to find each in the condition which repeated life-choices and their efforts in the beyond have provided to them, fully regardless of what phrases they repeated in this world, what rituals they attended, or which catechism they claimed was theirs.) We do not live alone, but each will experience physical death, and each must find or fail by ourselves.  As the song says: \"You got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else, can walk it for you...\" ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you are specifically referring to the Christian idea of heaven (as opposed to, say, the Greek idea of Elysium or the Norse idea of Valhalla), we can look to the early descriptions in the Bible and the writings of the earliest Christians to see how it was described. And it\u2019s pretty clear from those sources that Heaven was located up in the sky above the clouds where God and His angels could look down upon us. Whenever an angel came to visit, it was written that they descended from the sky (as opposed to, say, suddenly appearing as if from another dimension or materializing out of thin air). Of course, we now know conclusively that there is no heaven in the sky (and the whole concept of angels \u201cdescending from heaven\u201d makes no sense once you realize that the earth actually rotates on an access and is always pointing at different parts of the universe. This has led many Christian apologists to change the description of heaven to something else, such as \u201ceverywhere around us\u201d or \u201ca different spiritual dimension\u201d. But it\u2019s clear that this is merely post hoc rationalizations and not actually based on scriptural texts and can therefore be safely ignored. So, where is heaven? If you are a Christian, it can only be where it has always been \u2014 in the sky above the clouds. And if it\u2019s not there, then there must not be a heaven after all. ",

            "answer_text": "As an actual place, no. As a state of mind? Yes, I think it is possible. As an example of what I mean, I would direct your attention to groups like the Westboro Baptist Church who consistently hold up signs of hatred and intolerance. These people are already living in a hell of their own creation. I have lived around intolerance, and I have lived around ignorance. I can see the state of mind that results from rigid thinking. It is nightmarish state of being that people become so accustomed to over a period of time that they don't realize just how deep they are in it. It leads to higher stress levels, more relationship problems, and poor health. It takes joy from life and replaces it with misery more for the person spreading the hatred than the person receiving it. Conversely, and a lot more difficult to attain because it takes effort, there is a state of mind that can bring about peace. One might call this a type of Heaven. This is the State of Mind that does not judge, and accepts not only the person next to you, but the challenges that life will naturally throw your way. Yes, often there is a change needed, but that is not viewed as a negative thing. Change, though difficult, can be seen as a positive in one's life. The understanding of oneself and the acceptance of all life has to offer unconditionally could be construed of as a type of Heaven. The attainment of this state of mind, however, is extremely difficult. In all honesty I have not achieved it. However I have to believe that I can be better than what I am and have found the best path to a better me not in religion, and all its dogmas, but in the two concepts that seem to elude religion: fact and truth. An education that teaches the learner to question authority is heaven. Friendship despite differences is heaven. Respect despite opposition is heaven. Self worth and dignity are heaven. All these are my truths. They are truths that I believe are based in fact. I strive for them. When I attain them, I understand a little bit of Heaven. It is not a place. It is my attitude on a daily basis. That is heaven or hell and the decision is mine. I hope this helps. Adrian Lee Magill ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven [Heaven is a subject of both wild speculation and heated controversy. Yet, what the Bible teaches about it is far different from what many have been taught. What is heaven? WHAT SOME PEOPLE SAY There are diverse beliefs about heaven and its purpose. For example: Many professed Christians would agree with the New Catholic Encyclopedia, which calls heaven \u201cthe ultimate home of the blessed who die in the Lord.\u201dJudaism focuses more on the present life than on the afterlife, says Rabbi Bentzion Kravitz. But he suggests that \u201cin heaven the soul experiences the greatest possible pleasure\u2014a greater perception and feeling of closeness to God than it had previously.\u201d Kravitz acknowledges, however, that \u201calthough Judaism believes in heaven, the Torah speaks very little about it.\u201dHindus and Buddhists believe that heaven exists on many spiritual levels. It is a temporary stop, after which a person is either reborn on earth or transcends to Nirvana or Buddhahood\u2014a state that is higher than heaven.Some reject any religious notion of heaven and say that the whole idea is childish nonsense. Heaven is a topic of much speculation WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES In the Bible, the word \u201cheaven\u201d has more than one meaning. For example: Genesis 1:20 describes the creation of birds that \u201cfly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.\u201d In this case, the word \u201cheavens\u201d refers to our atmosphere, the observable sky.Isaiah 13:10 mentions \u201cthe stars of the heavens and their constellations\u201d\u2014what we would call outer space.The Bible speaks of God\u2019s \u201cdwelling place in the heavens\u201d and says that there are \u201cangels in heaven.\u201d (1 Kings 8:30; Matthew 18:10) Note that the words \u201cheavens\u201d and \u201cheaven\u201d are not simply metaphors, but describe an actual place of residence. *\u201cLook down from heaven and see from your lofty abode of holiness and glory.\u201d \u2014Isaiah 63:15. Do all good people go to heaven when they die? The Bible does not teach that the earth is merely a temporary home where we await death and a subsequent afterlife in heaven. The Bible makes clear that death was never a part of God\u2019s original purpose for humans. Consider: God told the first human couple: \u201cBe fruitful and become many, fill the earth.\u201d (Genesis 1:28) Earth was to be man\u2019s permanent home, where he could live forever. Death would come to the first man and woman only if they disobeyed God. Sadly, they chose to disobey.\u2014Genesis 2:17; 3:6.The disobedience of that first man resulted in death, not only for himself and his wife but also for their offspring. (Romans 5:12) Did that leave the human race without hope?The Bible says that \u201cthere are new heavensand a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise.\u201d * (2 Peter 3:13) By means of his Kingdom, God will restore our earth to the condition he intended for it, \u201cand death will be no more.\u201d (Revelation 21:3, 4) ]Source- www.jw.org ",

            "answer_text": "It seems that they certainly do. However, despite a pretty strong belief in heaven among religious folk, the problem is finding out exactly what they define as heaven. Despite several debates about heaven on this site alone, I still have yet to find any two heaven believers who describe it in the same way. All fail to explain satisfactorily how heaven can be a wonderful paradise when one of the following scenarios must be true. Scenario 1. Not all of your loved ones are going to believe in the correct god in the correct way. Statistics show that a maximum of one in six theists can be correct. A strict god is going to punish those that don't believe or worship correctly and people will be upset when their loved ones are facing eternal torment despite leading essentially good lives. Scenario 2. The heaven of a forgiving which is all good until the murder victim comes face to face with their assailant. Of course there could be an in-between scenario, but God has certainly left no clear message as to whether theft of food to feed a starving baby is acceptable over theft of an art piece. In short, every explanation of heaven is riddled with paradox. And quite frankly, I would much prefer oblivion, thank you. Even Hell would be preferable, because Hell is a better thought out thing.

We believe that God will reward us for obedience, repentance, and good deeds God will forgive the sins of the obedient believers We do not know about what God has prepared for the righteous obedient people All what is mentioned in the scripture are just examples of eternal youth and unlimited happiness There are verses to teach us that the heaven will be as wide as a universe There are many verses to teach us that people will be very happy there There are more verses to teach us that people will get whatever they wish There are more verses to teach us that people will not get bored and that they will not wish to change to any other environment Just think about the rich people who are willing to spend fortunes to stay young, attractive, and healthy Just think of the unlimited capabilities of the God who has created such a miraculous universe; do you think it is difficult for him to make an everlasting happiness as he promised? We have been warned that the good and the bad will be judged; all the deeds are recorded It will be very easy and very happy day for the obedient believers It will be a very sad and difficult time for the disbelievers and the wrongdoers God wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our faith and our deeds Qur\u2019an 27:83-85 is a scene from the hereafter, when we are asked \u2018what else have you been doing?\u2019. \u2018When they \u02f9finally\u02fa come before their Lord, He will ask \u02f9them\u02fa, \u201cDid you deny My revelations without \u02f9even\u02fa comprehending them? Or what else have you been doing?\u201d The sentence will be carried out against them for the consequence of their wrongdoings and they will not be able to utter a word\u2019. 28:65-66 is also a scene from the hereafter to warn those who reject the Prophets. \u2018And on that Day He will call unto them, and will ask: \"How did you respond to My messengers?\" but all arguments and excuses will by then have been erased from their minds, and they will not [be able to] obtain any [helpful] answer from one another\u2019 The following are some scenes from the judgement day as recorded in Qur\u2019an chapter 45 45:21 Do the evil doers think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe and do good deeds, and that their lives and deaths shall be alike? Bad is their judgment! 45:24 The disbelievers say: \"There is nothing but the life of this world? We live and die; nothing but time destroys us.\" In fact, they have no knowledge concerning this. They are merely guessing. 45:28-34 explain a scene from the hereafter; people will be rewarded for their deeds; all deeds are recorded. \u2018You shall see every nation on its knees. Every nation shall be summoned to its book of record, and Allah will say: \"Today you shall be rewarded for your deeds. This book of Ours speaks about you with the truth. Surely We have recorded all your deeds.\" As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their God will admit them into His mercy. That will be a glorious achievement. But as to those who disbelieved, Allah will say: \"Were My revelations not recited to you? But you showed arrogance and became a people of criminals\". It will be said: \"Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours! Hellfire will be your home and none will be there to help you\u2019 Qur\u2019an 33:67-68 is a scene from the hereafter to teach that those who follow the arrogant leaders will be misled. 23:64-66 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who prefer to live a luxury life ignoring God\u2019s message. \u2018But as soon as We seize their elite with torment, they start to cry for help. We shall say: \"Do not cry for help this Day, for surely from Us you shall receive no help\u2019. 46:20 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant people who did not obey but chose to enjoy a luxury life. \u02f9Watch for\u02fa the Day \u02f9when\u02fa the disbelievers will be exposed to the Fire. \u02f9They will be told, \u02fa \u201cYou \u02f9already\u02fa exhausted your \u02f9share of\u02fa pleasures during your worldly life, and \u02f9fully\u02fa enjoyed them. So Today you will be rewarded with the torment of disgrace for your arrogance throughout the land with no right, and for the transgressions you committed.\u201d That is similar to the wisdom taught by Jesus in Luke 16:25 17:14 is a scene from the hereafter teaches that each person will validate his records of his deeds. 32:12 is a scene from the hereafter to warn those who fail to do good deeds. \u2018If only you could see the wicked hanging their heads \u02f9in shame\u02fa before their Lord, \u02f9crying: \u02fa \u201cOur Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back and we will do good. We truly have sure faith \u02f9now\u02fa!\u201d 34:25-26 teach that everyone will be judged for his deeds only (not for the mistakes of fathers or others). \u2018Say: \"Neither shall you be called to account for whatever we may have become guilty of, nor shall we be called to account for whatever you are doing.\" Say, \u201cOur Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us with the truth. For He is the All-Knowing Judge.\u201d 34:34 warns the people who have wealth and authority because those are usually the first people to reject the prophets. \u2018Whenever We sent a warner to a society, its elite would say, \u201cWe truly reject what you have been sent with.\u201d 35:37 is a scene from the hereafter to explain the conditions of the disobedient who wish to go back to life to do good deeds (although they are granted enough time to demonstrate their behavior). \u201cTherein they shall cry for help: \"Our God! Get us out, from now on we shall do good deeds and shall not repeat the ones we used to do\". The response will be: \"Did we not give you lives long enough so that he who would, could take a warning? Besides, someone did come to warn you. Now taste the fruit of your deeds, here there is no helper for the wrongdoers.\" 39:59-61 is a scene from the hereafter to warn the arrogant who deny the signs and revelations. \u2018Not at all! My revelations had already come to you, but you rejected them, acted arrogantly, and were one of the disbelievers.\u201d On the Day of Judgment you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces gloomy. Is Hell not a \u02f9fitting\u02fa home for the arrogant? On the contrary, Allah will deliver the righteous to their place of salvation. No harm shall touch them, nor shall they ever grieve.\u2019 Qur\u2019an 39:71-74 After the Judgement, the Unbelievers will be driven to hell in groups. When they reach there, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Did there not come to you messengers from among yourselves, who recited to you the revelations of God and warned you about the meeting of this Day?\" \"Yes,\" they will answer. But at that time the sentence of punishment would have been already announced against the unbelievers.\" It will be said to them, \u201cEnter the gates of Hell, to stay there forever.\u201d What an evil home for the arrogant! And those who were mindful of their Lord will be led to Paradise in \u02f9successive\u02fa groups. When they arrive at its \u02f9already\u02fa open gates, its keepers will say, \u201cPeace be upon you! You have done well, so come in, to stay forever.\u201d They will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has truly fulfilled His promise and gave us this land to inherit, now we can live in paradise wherever we like.\" How excellent will be the reward for the righteous? As recorded in Qur\u2019an 52:35-36 disbelievers will be asked: \u2018Were they created without a Creator? Or were they their own creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth?

Having said that, there are exceptions that have explored this ontological issue. It appears that the age old question persists in many theological, philosophical and psychological areas of knowledge. Theoretic physicists who are exploring for an example, such things as \u201ceternalism\u201d (\u2018past,\u2019 \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 are all real) which differs from \u201cpresentism\u201d (\u2018present\u2019 is real, but \u2018past\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019 are not real) seem to point toward dimensions other than physical third dimension mentality. For example, if we can use the metaphor of a \u2018black hole\u2019 as probably being one of the best representations of an idea of an idea, not only because it is \u201cinvisible nothing\u201d but also because it contains almost all the data of the universe in the same place at the same time (singularity). From the vantage of the \u2018black hole\u2019 (idea) it is the \u2018real.\u2019 Everything else is just a projection of aggregates of data, \u2018information\u2019 that is projected (like movie projector) as an illusion of itself, in the form of a third dimension hologram. The same idea of Aristotles \u201cWhole\u201d and \u201cParts\u201d; Schopenhauer\u2019s \u201cThe One\u201d and \u201cthe many\u201d; or \u201cME\u201d and \u201cUS\u201d are multiple-unities. \u201cIn Einstein\u2019s vision, the universe is like an organism in which each part is the manifestation of the whole\u201d (Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind p 76). We are \u201cmirror images\u201d and \u201cPART + icipants\u201d of eternity. We are \u201cmultiple-unities\u201d composed of light, sub particles, atoms and molecules, chemical dna, organs (multiplicity) while at the same time a person (unity). In this sense, we are entangled at the same time as part of our immortal UPPER CASE REALITY/SELF and mortal lower case reality/self. Our flesh is the slowest part because it is made of material, thereby cannot be as swift as energy without transformation. \u201c,,, the eminent astronomer, V. A. Firsoff suggested that \u2018mind was a universal entity or interaction of the same order as electricity or gravitation, and that there must exist a modulus of transformation, analogous to Einstein\u2019s famously equality E=mc squared, whereby \u2018mind stuff\u2019 could be equated with other entities of the physical world.\u201d (Arthur Koestler, The Roots of Coincidence, p 63); Einstein used to be a frequent dinner guest, in the early stages of his relativity theory, at Dr. Carl Jung\u2019s mansion. Depth Psychologist, Dr. Ira Progoff says, \u201cIt is interesting in this regard to note that the recent opening of Einstein\u2019s private papers has disclosed that dreams and images played a very important role in Einstein\u2019s creative life. Those luncheon conversations may have been more fruitful that Jung realized, especially since we now know that Einstein possessed a keen sensitivity to the deep levels of the psyche. It may, at some later tie, be very fruitful to study the relationship between Jung and Einstein more closely, particularly in view of Einstein\u2019s interest in Hindu/Buddhist thought and his later description of the archetypal qualities of the relativity concept. \u201cWhile Jung may have had an important psychological effect on Einstein, the theory of Relativity became the base and starting point for his own thinking about Synchronicity. At several points he seems to have been consciously seeking to develop a concept that would be the equivalent of the relativity theory with the added dimension of the psyche\u201d (Ira Progoff, Jung, Synchronicity and Human Destiny, p 152).  In short, if matter and mind are the different aspects of the same abstract, and the abstract realm is eternal, then we at least have some connection. Whether or not we are able to experience any phenomena to prove it scientifically, is a secondary option.  The problem with expecting science to sanction something like \u2018unmeasured time\u2019 and a \u201cspace\u201d or \u201cabode\u201d that is beyond the electro magnetic spacetime dimension might be too demanding of science, at least currently, in my opinion. - Perhaps, if you look at phenomena that you believe exists that are not explained by science, maybe \u201ccoincidences\u201d or \u201csynchronicity\u201d for example, the bridge between matter mind and spirit would provide insights that science has not yet uncovered.

            "answer_text": "Yes but I want to give you a true biblical context to help you consider. In the Old Testament, Heaven was mostly used in context of a distinction of location with us being on earth and God in heaven. But God's promise has always been to be with us (merge heaven and the new earth). This is what Jesus the Christ came to initiate - read the gospels about all He says about bringing the Kingdom and how we will see it before it is fully visible to us. Following the God of Christianity is not putting your life on hold to fly off to heaven after you die. With Jesus reigning at the right hand of the Father, the Kingdom of Heaven is active here and now. God is calling people now to work in His fields, making disciples and bringing hope and restoration to those that are broken. You are deciding how you will live your life and the bible is suggesting a better way. Seeking more money or status will leave you empty at some point (is this all there is?) and at death whatever you stocked-up will be lost.Have you heard the joke about why funeral suits have no pockets? However, what you do for others out of love is enduring. A change in heart now makes you a different person NOW. You will see the difference NOW and know NOW - it is not just blind hope. Most visible is in times of trial (which we all experience), you will have hope and peace. Christianity is not ball and chain to endure for future gain, it is a new freedom NOW - to do what is right. With that is promised eternal life, HERE on the new incorruptible earth, as the good news of the gospel is God with us. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The first suggestion that there can be a heaven is the fact that we have a mind. I have mine, and you have yours, and everybody else has theirs. Mind is the primary metaphysical identity that you can recognize. Also, the thoughts and feelings that you experience are associated with your mind. Moroever, most of the language that you will learn in your life bears witness to the critical aspect of the metaphysical identities (metaphysical things or metaphysical objects) in your daily experience. Our mind (or \u201cconsciousness\u201d as some people call it) is an attribute of what is called our Self, or Soul, or Spirit. For the purpose of sheer momentary practicality, we can regard our mind as our Soul. The reason for this is that ultimately, all of our human knowledge leads us to mystery. There just is not found definitive explanations for all things in objective terms. There is a point at which all knowledge reduces to a metaphysical foundation and metaphysical premises. So to answer your question in a basic way, the domain referred to as mind, is at least in part, associated with that domain which is called heaven. Jesus Christ spoke of it this way: \u201cNeither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.\u201d\u2014\u2014 Gospel of Luke, Chapter 17, Verse 21 (King James Version) Thus, your mind is \u201cwithin\u201d you, and so is the heaven. When we complete our journey in this world, we can experience the fullness and glory of the heaven. For now, it is our duty to work here and complete the journey. May the peace of heaven be with you.

            "answer_text": "You could go on the basis that there has been no observable plane of reality in which heaven exists and as such we must assume that it does not exist until proven otherwise. This is because the burden of proof is beholden to the person making the claim. In order to hammer that point in claim that Santa is real and ask anyone to prove that he is not. It is a lot easier to make a statement than to refute that statement.   You could discuss how many religions there are and state that since all of them claim that any other religion is incorrect, that it is highly improbable that any of them are actually correct. Considering the wide multitude of religions today it would be difficult to prove that one's views are more valid than another's.  The arguments against the existence of god also would be useful here, a useful phrase   \u201cIs God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?\u201d That was said by Epicurus, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. While it doesn't necessarily target the Judeo-Christian god that we have now it is a valid point nonetheless.  I imagine the arguments being used against you will reference the accounts of people who have died then brought back to life with stories about a supposed heaven, the counter to this would be the massive chemical changes that the brain undergoes when one dies. It should be easy enough to look up.  There might be arguments that revolve around the popularity of the belief in heaven but it is handy to keep in mind that no matter how many people believe in something it doesn't make it true. Everyone could tomorrow believe as hard as they like in a political candidate but it doesn't necessarily make his views correct or Democracy would be a perfect system in where the people truly do choose the best candidate 100% of the time.

            "answer_text": "Heaven as defined by religions can be analysed. Such analyses are available. Many people have asked many questions to examine the ideas of heaven such as:  What do people do in heaven? Are people supposed to do the same activities eternally? Can they rest or need to rest? What do people eat in heaven? To eat meat, do they have to kill animals?  What does God eat? Is His food better than others'? ...What about loved ones? Can they be found in heaven? How to deal with loved ones in hell? Heaven and hell are two ideas given. Two contrasting places are practical idea to make people wish for heaven after they die. Is it possible to make a loved one in hell get free? Is it possible to meet/pray God and ask to free loved one? Loved ones are parents, husband or wife, children, friends, ones who helped during hard time... How can one be completely happy knowing them suffering in hell? If loved ones are to be forgotten in heaven, what's the point loving, protecting, raising them on earth? Can we get the same pets we had on earth? Can we get them live again? Many more questions can be asked. Many of these questions remained unanswered because of two reasons: not in the scriptures, not possible to have thought of everyone's desires.  Whether heaven exists or not, everyone must come up with an answer him/herself honestly and decide. A bias will let intellectual integrity down.  Asking others if they believe heaven exists or not is a hopeless task. You will only get three answers: yes, no, and maybe/IDK.  ",

Jesus told us that he came down from heaven. Heaven is his eternal home; he just came down to earth for 33 years to do an important job. After he died and spent two nights in the tomb, he came back to life. Forty days after that, he rose up into the air and returned to heaven. His testimony is the strongest evidence for heaven. Other followers of Jesus have seen heaven in visions. The most detailed vision of heaven was seen by John. Most of his book, Revelation, describes heaven and events that take place there. Paul, another follower of Jesus, wrote that he was taken to heaven. The experience was so unusual that he was not sure afterward if he had traveled there bodily or merely seen it in a vision. Steven, another follower of Jesus, was being murdered by an angry mob who stoned him. Before he died, he shouted that he could see heaven and that Jesus was there, standing at the right hand of God. If you\u2019re looking for scientifically testable evidence of heaven, you won\u2019t find any. The tools of science are not designed to detect spiritual things, and heaven is a spiritual place, not a natural one. However, you can examine the testimony of Jesus who came from heaven and of his followers who have seen heaven. If you believe them, then you will know that heaven exists. ",

So \u2018heaven\u2019 is a situation in which the mind gets what contends it deeply, a relaxation. That relaxation is not possible in the otherwise agitated life. Common life is sheer agitation. Right? Provocation, agitation, excitement, and the resultant frustration. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is the company that on one hand relaxes you, and on the other hand gives you the courage that it can happen! That it is not impossible, that the situation is not hopeless. \u201cI can be free! My deepest dreams were not just nonsense. There were there to be realised. They can be realized!\u201d And what is your deepest dream? Not the dream that you start assimilating from here and there. Your deepest dream is to just be what you are, what you really are. And the world gives you a thousand dreams, but not this one. This is your own original dream. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is the moment when you realize that this dream is possible. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is the moment when you clearly see that in this hateful world, love is possible! And not only is it possible theoretically, it is possible for you. It\u2019s there! It doesn\u2019t happen on its own, because you being what you are, you are just stuck. It happens when per-chance in the middle of your bonded world, just by chance you encounter a glimpse of freedom, you encounter the music of love. That is \u2018heaven\u2019.  You are struggling, laboring, somehow carrying yourself on, trudging and taking life as drudgery. You have given up all hope, and then the hope is rekindled. That is \u2018heaven\u2019. And not only is it a hope that something can happen in the future, it is there for the taking. Extend your hand and take it! That is \u2018heaven\u2019. The false will never admit that I am just a shadow. It will say that nothing but me is there. The world itself is \u2018heaven\u2019. When is the world \u2018heaven\u2019? When you realize that the world is like a door, a gateway to the beyond, now it is \u2018heaven\u2019! The beyond is not heaven. Remember! Because beyond, there is no mind, and \u2018heaven\u2019 and \u2018hell\u2019 are in the mind. The world is \u2018heaven\u2019, when it is a gateway to the beyond. The world itself is \u2018hell\u2019 when the world becomes an objective reality in itself. \u201cI am all!\u201d When the world says, \u201cI am all that there is,\u201d then the world is \u2018hell\u2019. Everything is neither \u2018heaven\u2019 nor \u2018hell\u2019. \u2018Heaven\u2019 exists for us because we are distant from the truth. When you are far something, only then it seems like \u2018heaven\u2019. We said that the world is a gateway to the beyond. Beyond, there is no \u2018heaven\u2019 or \u2018hell\u2019! There is just an empty stillness. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is for the one who has lost his way and who suddenly gets a guide. \u2018Hell\u2019 is when you have lost your way, and there are voices around that say that you cannot go back, that there is no home. A point comes where there is neither \u2018heaven\u2019 nor \u2018hell\u2019. So, from \u2018hell\u2019 to \u2018heaven\u2019 and then \u2018beyond\u2019! The very thing that was craving for \u2018heaven\u2019, the very thing that was suffering and for it \u2018heaven\u2019 was like a balm upon the suffering, that very thing is now very peacefully retired. Gone. Beyond. Finished. ------------The content of this answer is from my blog \"Words into Silence\".I invite you to visit the blog for deeper clarity and understanding of life. AD ",

            "answer_text": "I have some believe that Jesus might have actually existed, and if he did, he appeared to have stumbled upon something very profound about suffering and consciousness. But first the science part. There are parts of the brain, that are now known as the Default mode network - Wikipedia:  These parts are responsible for the following (quoting Wikipedia): It is potentially the neurological basis for the self: Autobiographical information: Memories of collection of events and facts about one's selfSelf-reference: Referring to traits and descriptions of one's selfEmotion of one's self: Reflecting about one's own emotional stateThinking about others: Theory of mind: Thinking about the thoughts of others and what they might or might not knowEmotions of other: Understanding the emotions of other people and empathizing with their feelingsMoral reasoning: Determining just and unjust result of an actionSocial evaluations: Good-bad attitude judgments about social conceptsSocial categories: Reflecting on important social characteristics and status of a groupRemembering the past and thinking about the future: Remembering the past: Recalling events that happened in the pastImagining the future: Envisioning events that might happen in the futureEpisodic memory: Detailed memory related to specific events in timeStory comprehension: Understanding and remembering a narrativeSo, basically, if all you\u2019ve ever experienced is fluctuations in the space of consciousness, which clearly have been shown to be correlated with fluctuations in the brain, then that whole sense/understanding of being separate from other fluctuations within consciousness (others/past me/future me), is actually just a fluctuation in consciousness as well. Consciousness itself is non-dual by nature. The sense of duality merely arises in that non-dual space as a dream created by the default mode network. Like a virtual reality. Having said that, it is also clear that we have never seen the actual outside world, just some subjective representation of it. For instance color is not an aspect of reality outside consciousness, but a subjective representation of it, inside the waking dream. And the cold, mechanical process of evolution made sure the subjective experience of time is presented threatening enough that we experience desire and fear, in order for us to try to hold on to the complexities of our bodies through the course of time as much as possible. But what do we know about time? Physics taught us that time is not the process of change occurring in space, but time is actually a dimension that\u2019s part of the same fabric as space itself. We now call it \u201cspacetime\u201d rather than \u201cspace\u201d and \u201ctime\u201d as it\u2019s this single 4D continuum. The Relativity of simultaneity - Wikipedia showed us that the intuitive sense of the \u201cpast 3D universe\u201d being completely gone and the \u201cfuture 3D universe\u201d as completely non-existent is not true, simply because there\u2019s no such thing as a \u201ccurrent 3D universe\u201d. This is because absolute simultaneity throughout space has shown to be an illusion. It appears time is actually quite similar to space: Does time pass? | MIT News. We can only ever experience one location in spacetime at once, like a sparkle of a huge diamond. So, if reality isn\u2019t as threatening as it appears, subjectively, because time is quite static and the whole world we\u2019ve experienced is actually a non-dual appearance within me, then what is this appearance in me that calls itself \u201cme\u201d?

However, in saying that, I do not mean that there\u2019s no truth hiding behind the dogma and doctrine. I mean that I think those definitions are flawed. I do not believe in the stories that have been told to me. A better story might make a difference. Any established religion has been around long enough that much of its content is technologically unsophisticated. It\u2019s not the writers\u2019 fault that their frame of reference may have aged poorly. That\u2019s what happens when one era declares its \u201cwisdom\u201d to be \u201cTruth\u201d: it becomes fossilized and petrified, and cannot keep up with the changes that affect society, evolving language and technology. Could heaven be a \u201cplace\u201d in another dimension, or at a different vibrational frequency? Sure it could. Those old descriptions may have been sincere, and the most accurate that the writers of those descriptions could write, but they were ill-equipped to describe anything that far surpassed the state of their knowledge. And if there is anything that could far surpass their knowledge (or perhaps even ours), it would likely include parallel dimensions, vibrational frequencies outside the range of human sense organs, or perspectives that transcend the earthly human experience. I do think \u201cthere\u2019s something else out there\u201d. Just not the place I heard about in Sunday school, or even in my studies of the great religions of the world, possibly not even in my college philosophy classes. The classic problem with knowledge is that we never know how much we don\u2019t know. That leads to a lot of assumptions and presumptions. ",

It begins at the surface of the Earth and extends out to about 4 to 12 miles (6 to 20 km). This layer is known as the lower atmosphere Stratosphere Above the troposphere is the stratosphere, which extends to about 31 miles (50 km) above the Earth's surface. This layer is where the ozone layer exists and scientists send weather balloons. Jets fly in the lower stratosphere to avoid turbulence in the troposphere. Mesosphere From about 31 to 53 miles (50 to 85 km) above the surface of the Earth lies the mesosphere, where the air is especially thin and molecules are great distances apart. Temperatures in the mesosphere reach a low of -130 degrees Fahrenheit (-90 C). This layer is difficult to study directly; weather balloons can't reach it, and weather satellites orbit above it. The stratosphere and the mesosphere are known as the middle atmospheres. Thermosphere The thermosphere rises several hundred miles above the Earth's surface, from 56 miles (90 km) up to between 311 and 621 miles (500\u20131,000 km). Temperature is very much affected by the sun here; it can be 360 degrees Fahrenheit hotter (500 C) during the day than at night. Exosphere Extending from the top of the thermosphere to 6,200 miles (10,000 km) above Earth is the exosphere, where weather satellites are. This layer has very few atmospheric molecules, which can escape into space.

            "answer_text": "Does heaven really exist? +JMJ+ Indeed! It is heaven or hell. So many people throughout history have known this even without direct revelation from beyond. But then God came in person and told us, so now we no longer have to be in doubt or disbelief. Despite what some people believe, we can look at animals and realize that we are different. We have an eternal spirit and this entire world is just here for us to grow up and become good people so that we may live for eternity in heaven. The sad part is that most people invest themselves in this world and so fail the ultimate test. And live in one place or another we will, whether we believe it now or not, we will when we get there. The greatest deception that Satan has ever worked is to spread disbelief in him. from Modern Catholic Dictionary by John A. Hardon, S.J. Doubleday & Co., Inc. Garden City, NY 1980 Heaven. The place and condition of perfect supernatural happiness. This happiness consists essentially in the immediate vision and love of God, and secondarily in the knowledge, love, and enjoyment of creatures. Until the final resurrection, except for Christ and His Mother, only the souls of the just are in heaven. After the last day, the just will be in heaven in body and soul. Although the same God will be seen by all and enjoyed by all, not everyone will have the same degree of happiness. The depth of beatitude will depend on the measure of God\u2019s grace with which a person dies, and this in turn will be greatly conditioned by the merits that one earns during life on earth. Heaven is eternal because it will never cease. It is continuous because its joys never stop. It is communal because the happiness is shared with the angels and saints and the company of those who were known and love on earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, Your asking this question on a predominantly atheist forum, your never going to get an answer from them about God or Heaven, because they do not believe there is a God or Heaven. As a Born Again Christian I can tell you exactly where Heaven is , it is right above us, not trillions of miles away. The bible tells us that the earth is God`s footstool, that sounds about right as this is what it says in Genesis \u2026 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. 5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 8And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 13 And the evening and the morning were the third day. 14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. And again here\u2026 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? So you see God is right above us, in the second Heaven, the first holds the sun and moon and all the stars. As it clearly says above. Do not let those atheists mislead you. God is real and so is Heaven, it IS an actual physical place, as Jesus said\u2026 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Sorry, but this assumes it is located in the universe per se. It is thought of as a different domain, a spiritual domain (I agree). My assumption is (an I am alone on this as far as I know) that dark matter, dark energy is persistent, that is, uncreated, that the creation event of Genesis was God using that matter to make what we describe as the physical universe, and that the other being are not physical. Jesus breeches this gap by adding physicality to his being. (I added a titanium plate to my being when I broke my right radius, right?) This explains much, and way too long to get into it here, but also answers why humans such as friends of mine have near death experiences and return with verifiable information that was unknown to them before the event, and that includes information both about things here on earth and things in heaven (a child returns knowing he had an older sister who was stillborn, and the parents did not name her, a person returns having spoken to a grandfather who dies before they were born, many, many other such events). Most are no longer afraid of death, many, like a friend, regretted coming back (he didn\u2019t the second time, decades later, and a Professor, Psychologist at that). The issue most Christians have is that they refuse to acknowledge that these spiritual beings are something, rather than nothing. But, if they are nothing, then they do not exist, they must be something (this is a misguided Greek model). It also answers why there seems to be distance in that world (domain), read the book of Daniel, the angel coming to answer his prayer took 22 days to get there. The long and short of it is that, if they are something other than the physical universe made with the Higgs Boson (et al), then we would be unaware of them/it unless something unusual happened. The Cardassian coordinates (your question) are irrelevant since, they could be standing next to you and you would be unaware of them. But aren\u2019t there such stories in all cultures, just like there are world flood stories in all cultures? ",

            "answer_text": "Heaven isn\u2019t a physical location. You can\u2019t take a spaceship to get there. Heaven is something that exists around us at all times. We often reference the sky, but that is just a metaphor. There is an old phrase, that describes sudden silences in a room when the shared feeling is intimate. Usually this happens when there are many people getting along and everyone just stops talking randomly, all at the same time. We all experience this. The old phrase is that when this happens, an angel is passing through\u2026. If angels live in heaven and can pass through our lives, then where is heaven? Heaven is all around us. \u201cThis cookie is heaven. That person is heaven. I want to go to heaven. Heaven on earth is coming. My dead grandfather is in heaven.\u201d Just because you cannot see heaven, doesn\u2019t mean it is far away. Spiritually, sure, it is far. Physically though, it is close. You just have to open your mind to get glances into it. Heaven is the place good people go. The body dies, the mind dies, but the spirit lives on. Your spirit is not a physical thing; it is an idea. When you have an idea then forget it, where does it go? Is it gone? Is it beside you? Did it disappear? Where is it? Then you remember\u2026. Did your idea magically reappear? Where was it in the time in between? Stored in the back of your brain? Sometimes, yes it was, but not always. Sometimes life has to remind you of your ideas. You remember half and life has to tell you the other half again. The world is like an imprint of you, in a way. God technically lives in hell too. Satan is a part of God, like anything else. That is some seriously advanced stuff though, for experts only. ",

No one believes in anything, some people hope there is a heaven. The degree of certainty people want belief vs hope to represent is largely political, emotional, etc. They have no evidence for it at all, there\u2019s nothing to test. Even though we\u2019ve spread the ability to think rationally and repeatedly test with rigor around the world and have record enrollment in higher education institutions ( meaning hopefully larger numbers of people are choosing to take over their own adult education rather than give up after high school ) people refuse to seek out a form for accurately depicting often enough their epistemology of even science ( which would help in recognizing what can be done with the results of tested knowledge in science, pseudoscience, BS, and other agenda based ideological formulations of what we could never prove anyone should do with a given concept, let alone religion ) for us all to see results in how people report belief. Most attempts happen in conversations people act like are hostile, so there won\u2019t be and hasn\u2019t been much progress with this epistemological issue in the current state of how information is handled in nearly exclusively informal claimable-as-hostile discussion. Epistemology, and how we formulate an epistemology through scientific testing, has yet to make it into the daily news cycle, isn\u2019t taught in grade school, and definitely isn\u2019t being presented accurately in places of worship and spiritual households enough for us to see more rigorous treatment of spiritual epistemologies or ideological epistemologies. In case you\u2019re wondering, this probably isn\u2019t due to how a spiritual person might forgive themselves for something rather than address it scientifically with rigor, due to their relationship with spiritual authority figures and their willingness to move on to what spirituality is helping them achieve in life, and is likely entirely based on how we handle public discussion of epistemology in aggregate across our entire civilization.

            "answer_text": "Heaven is an actual place, in a real location, designed by God with people in mind.  Beings have traveled to and from heaven, including Christ (John 1:32; 6:33; Acts 1:2), angels (Matt. 28:2; Rev. 10:1), and humans (2 Cor. 12:2; Rev. 11:12). Jesus, speaking as the bridegroom to his beloved bride, said to us, \u201cI go to prepare a place for you, that where I am you may be also.\u201d Heaven is that place. The New Earth, where the heavenly city will be brought down to and relocated, will be a vastly improved form of the present earth and will have much in common with it\u2014light, water, trees and fruit (Rev. 21:1-2), people and animals (Rev. 6:2-8; 19:11). The New Heavens and Earth is actually the eternal state, whereas the heaven we go to when we die is the intermediate state. So it is the New Heavens and Earth where we will live forever as resurrected children of God. It\u2019s important to remember this, since people often think as if the heaven we go when we die is exactly where we\u2019ll live forever. It isn\u2019t. The return of Christ and the resurrection of believers is followed by the resurrection of the heavens and earth. That\u2019s where we will live forever, as physical-spiritual beings in a physical-spiritual universe. As a new car is a better version of an old car\u2014but with the same essential components that make a car a car (four wheels, engine, transmission, steering wheel, etc.)\u2014the New Earth will be a far better version of the old earth, with the same essential components. Heaven will exist in the realm of the New Earth and will therefore be very earthly in its properties. Since it is not only the dwelling place of God, but is fashioned by God to be populated by people, the present heaven is also people-friendly, designed with their God-given desires in mind. (No child can get excited about a heaven that isn\u2019t physical.) For more information on the subject of Heaven, see Randy Alcorn\u2019s book Heaven. Is Heaven a real place, a tangible reality?  ",

Some jackholes were making fun of my Chinese ancestry and I still feel my blood boil when I think about the moment. \u2018Ugh! Those guys made me so angry! They made me feel like an outcast!\u2019 That's when it hit me. In that moment, I was suffering. I suffered in that moment, I suffer when I think about bad experiences in my past, and I will continue to suffer until I'm on the other side of the ground. Such is life. Such is existence. If you exist, you will always experience suffering, at one point or another. I've been led to believe that heaven is a place where you experience eternal bliss, no more pain and no more suffering. Well if I were to go to heaven, I would still think about my time getting bullied as a kid and I would still be pissed off as a fire hydrant. Therefore, I would be suffering, which isn't supposed to happen in heaven. To exist is to suffer ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re referring to the spiritual realm of heaven found in Abrahamic religions as the dwelling place of God, or among other world religions, where deceased ancestors and/or supernatural beings reside, either temporarily or eternally. By its very definition, Heaven cannot be said to be a part of the physical universe. Therefore, a scientific answer cannot be provided. If Heaven is the realm of a God who is also the Creator of the physical universe, then we need to reason on it. Any being or force capable of creating what we perceive to be the entirety of existence for corporeal entities like us, as well as the complete collection of physical objects and forces that we are capable of detecting, would have to be of an entirely higher order of existence (life, sentience, consciousness), possessing innately, or having access to, more power than the physical universe itself. This makes any earnest efforts to detect Heaven in a conventional scientific sense a complete waste of time. If you\u2019re seeking tangible proof of its existence, you won\u2019t find it. Either you find meaning for it in some religious text, or you use your imagination. In all presentations of supernatural realms, conventional laws of nature do not appear to rule absolute. A higher order of good and evil has direct consequences. In every setting, Heaven is depicted as the center of Good; whereas Hell, purgatory, or other realms of ill repute, is said to be either a place of punishment: banishment with either corporeal or non-corporeal torture for a limited or indeterminate time period, or nonexistence. Often religions use the concepts of supernatural laws of good and evil as a measure of control over your behavior now. Empires have dominated the known world utilizing in part superstitions over what eternal consequences might befall those who reject the authority claimed by those with power. Normally, I would proselytize here, but suffice it to say, no belief system which causes or inspires you to commit acts of injury toward others is fit for society. Even if the belief system to which you align yourself is exclusive, it must commit no act intended to punish those who have never accepted it. ",

I'll say up front that I don't believe in God just so you understand where my answer is coming from. One of the profound problems I have with religion is people claiming to know things that they don't actually know. Now I completely understand that those people believe things to be true, but without evidence, claiming to know it is false. Many people claim to Know that heaven is real. Without having been there, or having tangible evidence of said location, how would you know that to be true? Listen, I understand that religion is faith and that faith is different from knowing and I accept that distinction for religion. Personally it's why I choose not to participate. But please understand you're asking someone to give a concrete answer regarding a topic they cannot know concretely and can only demonstrate faith in. I hope that you learn to question why people say things and how they claim to know things through a skeptic lens. There are plenty of people who maintain both the scientific worldview and a religious worldview by separating the two views from each other and that is acceptable but don't accept answers themselves as if they are the concrete evidence for an idea, when they are based in faith only.

Of course, it is hard for us humans to understand the concept of Heaven, and the eternal life we spend with God. What is eternity like? This is that many Christian mathematicians and physicians wonder. It is hard to imagine, is it not? First of all, if you are to ask if Heaven exists, other things must be explained first. How did the world come to be? Many people say that it was through the Big Bang, evolution, and other theories. Many people also think that these things disagree with the Bible. But actually, in Genesis, it says that God created the world, but it never mentions how long each of those days was, or how God actually created it. God spoke, and things happened, but it may have taken a long time and through processes like the Big Bang. Science actually proves that the Bible is right. When God created, the Earth, he also created the Heavens, the place where God dwells (if I remember correctly). Before sin came into the world, the Earth was sort of Heaven in its way, with no sin, and everything was perfect. Humans would have lived forever. But when sin came into the world, that was when the Earth became corrupt and full of bad things. Many people are skeptical about the existence of Heaven and use excuses like logic and other things to \u201cprove that Heaven is not real.\u201d Just forget about logic for a while, God\u2019s knowledge and wisdom are far greater than our understanding, so it is illogical to use logic to decide whether Heaven is real or not. I am sure that Heaven exists and that you will go there after death by just believing in Jesus Christ and repentance. ",

They can be realized!\u201d And what is your deepest dream? Not the dream that you start assimilating from here and there. Your deepest dream is to just be what you are, what you really are. And the world gives you a thousand dreams, but not this one. This is your own original dream. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is the moment when you realize that this dream is possible. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is the moment when you clearly see that in this hateful world, love is possible! And not only is it possible theoretically, it is possible for you. It\u2019s there! It doesn\u2019t happen on its own, because you being what you are, you are just stuck. It happens when per-chance in the middle of your bonded world, just by chance you encounter a glimpse of freedom, you encounter the music of love. That is \u2018heaven\u2019. You are struggling, laboring, somehow carrying yourself on, trudging and taking life as drudgery. You have given up all hope, and then the hope is rekindled. That is \u2018heaven\u2019. And not only is it a hope that something can happen in the future, it is there for the taking. Extend your hand and take it! That is \u2018heaven\u2019. The false will never admit that I am just a shadow. It will say that nothing but me is there. The world itself is \u2018heaven\u2019. When is the world \u2018heaven\u2019? When you realize that the world is like a door, a gateway to the beyond, now it is \u2018heaven\u2019! The beyond is not heaven. Remember! Because beyond, there is no mind, and \u2018heaven\u2019 and \u2018hell\u2019 are in the mind. The world is \u2018heaven\u2019, when it is a gateway to the beyond. The world itself is \u2018hell\u2019 when the world becomes an objective reality in itself. \u201cI am all!\u201d When the world says, \u201cI am all that there is,\u201d then the world is \u2018hell\u2019. Everything is neither \u2018heaven\u2019 nor \u2018hell\u2019. \u2018Heaven\u2019 exists for us because we are distant from the truth. When you are far something, only then it seems like \u2018heaven\u2019. We said that the world is a gateway to the beyond. Beyond, there is no \u2018heaven\u2019 or \u2018hell\u2019! There is just an empty stillness. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is for the one who has lost his way and who suddenly gets a guide. \u2018Hell\u2019 is when you have lost your way, and there are voices around that say that you cannot go back, that there is no home. A point comes where there is neither \u2018heaven\u2019 nor \u2018hell\u2019. So, from \u2018hell\u2019 to \u2018heaven\u2019 and then \u2018beyond\u2019! The very thing that was craving for \u2018heaven\u2019, the very thing that was suffering and for it \u2018heaven\u2019 was like a balm upon the suffering, that very thing is now very peacefully retired. Gone. Beyond. Finished. Source of the article is \"Words into Silence\" where you can go for more clarity. ",

            "answer_text": "http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2006/j0802p23.pdf One Perspective of Heaven and Hell from the lens of Sikhism, by Virinder S. Grewal, M.D., F. A.C.S. My discussion on Sikhism is based on the information given in the Aad Guru Granth Sahib (AGGS) [1], the only authenticated source. The terms \u2018Heaven\u2019 and \u2018Hell\u2019 have been used metaphorically in the AGGS to emphasize in becoming a better human being by understanding the Word (Sabd Guru) in the company of holy people. It is the mental poise achieved by deliberating and reflecting on it in daily life. While living, one should aim to realize the mental equipoise and tranquility vibrating everywhere (Mother Nature) in the universe and in every living being. Living according to God\u2019s Will (Laws of Nature) and singing its virtues during the earthly life is living in heaven. Guru Nanak describes this state as the last step in Jap as spiritual progress is made by active action on the part of the individual to practice and live truthfully, which has been further explained in his following hymns: One does not get a passage to heaven* by mere talking, it is achieved by practice of Truth (truthful life). AGGS, M 1, p 141 [1]. * Heaven is a metaphoric expression for \u2018Living like in heaven\u2019. Guru Nanak further stresses that self ego is the reason for the state of the individual consciousness to project it either way. When one pays attention to wisdom, then the wisdom is enshrined (in mind), this is the state of dwelling in heaven. AGGS, M 1, p 635. Without the conducting good actions (karmas), heaven like living is not attained. AGGS, M 1, p 952. This mind wonders around, at one moment it is like in heaven and at other in hell. It will continue to happen so until realize the philosophy in the Sabd (of Guru Nanak) AGGS, M 1, p 1345. Guru Nanak in all the above hymns explains that salvation is achieved by performing good deeds; the only way to reach the Theo-philosophical heaven otherwise the mental state is equivalent to living in hell. Guru Arjan (the fifth Nanak) further explains the basic principles about heaven and hell in Nanakian Philosophy in his own Bani that reciting and understanding the Naam in the presence of the True Company (Sadh Sangat) is the way to salvation (heaven). Salvation and heaven are found in the company of noble people that means one (humble servant) finds living place free from troubles. AGGS, M 5, p 682. Again, heaven has been used metaphorically to represent a place where there is no (vices / troubles) but it is not any place where God lives since in Nanakian Philosophy God does not live at any certain place but pervades everywhere.

            "answer_text": "If you mean as described in various religous books the simple answer is no. There is no evidence or solid reason to believe that when we die somehow we live on without the body. Everything we know about how the mind works is based upon the need for a physical brain. The brain is the hardware that runs the mind, which is best described as the state of the connections of brain at any one point of time. Those connections give rise to complex behaviours, the vast majority we are not aware of but without we would not have awareness. The sheer amount and arrangement of these connections give rise to emotions, both simple and complex, and also gives arise to consciousness. So no brain, no connections. No connections, no mind. No mind, no memory or emotions. No emotions or memories, no consciousness. No us.  We are not 'just' a brain - we are more than the sum of the parts. But we need the parts to be. For that reason alone the idea of a heaven makes no sense.  It's a nice story that, under a slight bit of critical thinking, becomes a child like fantasy. Just as there is no Santa there is also no heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "Spirit World There are 7 Realms in the spirit world starting from 1st and going up to 7th. Each Realm has seven stages of progression. Speaking, no one, and I mean no one has control over what realm they want to arrive. God systematically constructs everything, and each and every one of us shall enter on the specific realm based on our karma. If, for example, you have murdered \"intentionally\" any being -be it a flower, be it an animal, be it one of your kind- especially mass killing, and not for a reason to survive only, you will undoubtedly go to Realm 1. Realm 2, Realm 3, Realm 4, are not for such extreme cases, but they are indeed a regress, and it's part of what we call now \"Hell\" or so to speak. Realm 4 Stage 5 is the place where all souls started their journey and by reincarnating (yes reincarnation is real) to places like Earth (in a physical dimensional world) they could literally choose based on their free will to either gather experience leading a healthy life based solely on instincts and survival or become what we have become today, leading a miserable life and being enslaved to many concepts such as monetary system, church, etc Souls in the Realms of the Spirit World can visit higher realms or lower realms except of course Realm 1 - Realm 4 (included), meaning these 4 Realms can see only what is below them and not higher as the higher Realms are invisible. From Realm 5 and onwards souls can visit higher realms than them but not higher than 1. ",

            "answer_text": "I do believe, I believe that the Bible is an inspired book due to studying it, using it, praying with it. And I believe that there is a reason we are here, I don\u2019t think we magically showed up. Plus I believe we have an afterlife or Heaven with God. I have had an out of body experience in which I was hundreds of miles from earth - during this I witness hundreds or thousands of angels or souls traveling to earth from another part of the universe. This experience also enforces my belief in God, Souls, and perhaps Heaven. Atheists are generally very smart individuals, yet they base their doubt about God normally only on scholastic reasoning. Generally they have not spent adequate time taking to real believers, they don\u2019t believe in prayer so they can\u2019t experience God, etc. One important aspect of Christianity is communion with God, without it we can\u2019t know the real God. Communion with God happens through prayer but generally only after a person has been through salvation. So, by that math, an Atheist, as hard as he might try, can\u2019t find the real God because he is not willing to go through salvation. Simple math, they can\u2019t find God, not because they are brilliant, it\u2019s because God won\u2019t let them experience himself - without salvation. Neat. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't prove the non-existence of an after life, at least not so long as said afterlife doesn't need to adhere to any known properties of the way the universe works. As long as it's considered reasonable to propose an afterlife whose characteristics include undetectability, proving that there isn't one isn't in the cards. The best thing you can hope to accomplish is to show that, going based on the observations of the physical world we've made so far, the odds of the existence of an afterlife that wasn't deliberately created by some entity to be hard to find are vanishingly small. There are two possibilities: Either the observations that humans have made about physics are correct, or they're not. If they're not, it becomes very hard to explain how things like spaceships, transistors, TVs, and lasers work at all. So if you believe in computers and lasers and space travel, it's reasonable to assume we have a pretty good handle on the basics of physics. If the laws of physics we've observed are true, there are again two possibilities: Either they hold true no matter what, or there is some invisible, impossible to detect way in which they are fundamentally broken. Again, if these laws (observations) are reasonably accurate without unobservable, unprovable, and self-inconsistent exceptions, an afterlife of any kind is nearly impossible to explain. Not totally, but it gets really hard, on the order of the same odds that the Nigerian prince who emailed you really does have a trunk box worth of $5 million in JFK customs. So, if you want to try to make a plausible case for an after life, you essentially are required to posit the existence of specific, inconsistent, invisible holes in the most fundamental observable laws of the world, all of which not only fail to break the countless ways they're put to practical use by everyone all the time, but also just happen to allow the existence of an afterlife that also just happens to be impossible to detect. What it comes down to is this: Either there is no afterlife, or the world has been made so that every shred of observable evidence points to its impossibility, but was nonetheless seeded with a hidden, unprovable violation of its own laws in order to trick beings that would arise billions of years later into thinking there is no such thing, for no apparent reason. If you ask me, that's a pretty reasonable counter argument when the main argument in favor is, \"dying really makes us uncomfortable and we're happier if we think it's not final\". ",

Although the heavens are not the ultimate pinnacle of afterlife love and consciousness. The Vast Void reunification with the Divine Oneself is the ultimate! This is my experience and just the way I am processing the information I was given. So if it does not agree with a specific others experience it is not a contradiction just we didn\u2019t go to the same places. Of course there is more than what I have experienced. Starting from the bottom and going up. The empty void (not the vast void) can appear black, blue, grey, white, pink. I suppose any uniform color. Populated only with those individuals with active roles. You and your spirit guide and a relative for example. Sometimes appears as a copy of earth but empty. Primarily for transitioning or processing the shock of death.Highly populated with many beings mostly non humans. Not a fun environment. The steward of this realm has horns and is holding the vibration so souls can play out the dramas that help them to advance.Classic garden utopia. Some dwellings. Populated by many but not overcrowded. Everyone is friends and family and loves you immensely. One region is all you can eat.Similar to level 3 but more like city. Active is more directed and purposeful. Centers of learning and cooperation. Central impressive round building and another library that has massive pillars.There is a membrane that prevents lower level souls from access. This level has group souls and councils.Guides and Lower level angelsHigher level beings and arch angelsAs the levels go up the connection of consciousness increases. Being like Indian and Greek gods and goddesses highly vibrating yet stil having identity and some individualism.Angels without names.Divine forcesThe vast void. The Divine Oneself. All. Love-consciousness. Potential prior to actualization. Ineffable. Geodesic being of light.This is a brief list I go into much more detail in my book. It is not true that no two experiences are alike. These details are coherent evidence. I have spoken to many other people who saw the building with huge pillars,the empty void,the copy earth,the gardens,the group souls,the vast void andthe geodesic being of light.Recently I met someone who experienced many environments but moved laterally between them.Update: 3/25/19 During my transcendent experience in 2001, I experienced part of the physical universe that I would not have ever been able to experience in the body as it is beyond the limits of physical perception. I observed the Higgs Field. A matrix of photon like particles flexibly fixed into position. They did not spin but they did wiggle. This is a detail that will be validated eventually. In 2013 or 2015 the electron microscopes were first able to image the atomic structure of gold and it looked stunningly similar. The atom looks the same as the Higgs field because it it is using it as a framework. ",

This fit and match the concept of 7 superimposed heavens (multiverse). The lowest heaven/paradise is right above our universe (above the 1st sky). The 2nd lowest heaven/paradise is above the 2nd sky. The 3rd heaven/paradise is above the 3rd sky and so on. The skies under & beyond underneath (in the negative directions) may be all the hell. The most important reason why the heavens and hell do exist is to make sure all mankind will always do the righteous & avoid wrong doing. Our life after death is immortal & every mankind has an infinite future. Everybody will a have a fair trial on the judgement day and nobody can escape the judgement day, heavens & hells. Paradises (heavens) & hells fit/match the 7 superimposed multiverse (7 Heavens) concept. Paradises (heavens) & hells also fit/match the parallel & anti-universe concepts. We can imagine wormhole (Einstein\u2013Rosen bridge) as the supersonic++ elevator to interconnect the 7 heavens. Whoever fall from the bridge will end up in one of the hell fires. The further you fall, the punishment will be heavier. If you successfully cross the bridge you will happily end up the eternal paradise/heavens. The higher you climb, the reward will be superior. All these fit & match the 7 superimposed multiverses. Furthermore please refer to: Surah Al-Jathiya Allah has created the heavens and the earth with just purpose, and so that everybody is recompensed for what he (or she) earned, and they will not be wronged. (22) So, have you seen him who has taken his desires as his god, and Allah has let him go astray, despite having knowledge, and has sealed his ear and his heart, and put a cover on his eye? Now who will guide him after Allah? Still, do you not take lesson? (23) And they say, \u201cThere is no life but our worldly life. We die and live, and nothing destroys us except time.\u201d They have no knowledge about that; they do nothing but make conjectures. (24) When Our verses are recited to them in all their clarity, their argument is none but that they say, \u201cBring our fathers, if you are truthful.\u201d (25) Say, \u201cAllah gives you life, then makes you die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Judgement in which there is no doubt, but most of the people do not know. (26) To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. The day the Hour will take place, it will be the day in which the adherents of falsehood shall lose, (27) And you will see every community kneeling down. Every community will be called to its book (of record). Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do. (28) This is Our book that speaks against you with truth. We used to get recorded all that you used to do. (29) Then, as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His mercy. That is indeed the achievement, visible to all. (30) And as to those who disbelieved, (it will be said to them,) \u201cHad My verses not been recited to you? But you showed arrogance, and you were a guilty people; (31) And when it was said to you that Allah\u2019s promise is true and there is no doubt in the (arrival of the) Hour, you used to say, \u2018We do not know what the Hour is. We do not think (about it) but as an assumption, and we are not sure.\u2019\u201d (32) And revealed to them will be the evils of what they did, and encircled they will be by what they used to ridicule. (33) It will be said, \u201cToday We will forget you, as you forgot facing this your day, and your abode is the Fire, and for you there are no helpers at all. (34) That is because you took Allah\u2019s verses as a laughing stock, and the worldly life deceived you.\u201d So today they will neither be brought out of it, nor will they be asked to repent. (35) So, to Allah belongs all praise, who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the worlds. (36) And to Him belongs majesty in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Mighty, the Wise. (37) ",

The true and complete answer is that the only heaven or hell that any soul-being attends upon its mortal demise is the one he or she creates for itself; the choice is theirs. There is no one central divine location where all souls congregate. Each mansion-world has its own recovery facility. I will provide substantiating evidence after you learn who I am and how I obtain the information I use to answer your question. Who is Rani -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Abaris is a Master Melchizedek teacher who is also our spiritual guide who provided us with the celestial answer to where one goes and what to expect at the time they return to spirit state. Life after death, and beyond. This next bit of divine knowledge should even make the devout happy. Did you know that everyone has, and has had since before birth, a Personal Guardian that guides and protects them as they traverse their karmic path of destiny. If you are an animal lover, there are also spirit guides for them as well. Non-willed Guardians ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Whenever I receive a question from anyone who is concerned about Spiritual matters, I consider it my privilege to provide them with more information than they requested. My website which you have seen bits and pieces contains Universal Knowledge beyond that which you ever learned in school, university, church, or the Bible. Everyone should be knowledgeable of this Celestial information, but it was the Calagastia rebellion, and the fall of Atlantis that has deprived you and everyone on the planet access to this knowledge. If you do not know of what I speak, you are in woeful need of the educational material posted on my website. Everything is there, but it will be up to you to take your next step toward  Celestial Knowledge and the multitude of information it provides. ",

            "answer_text": "If it's real of course it exist. 1) Real Life, Self Inside Flesh 2) Soul Inside and Outside the Body 3) Youth Qur'an 8.24; Why not respond to that which gives life \"O ye who believe! give your response to Allah and His apostle when He calleth you to that which will give you life; and know that Allah cometh in between a man and his heart and that it is He to whom Ye shall (all) be gathered.\" The One Who gave you your life knows how to compliment your life, praise be to Allah (swt). And I have complemented your life with your Religion, the Religion of your own nature, Al Islam. And what is wrong with you that you don't respond when you are called to that, that gives you life? Real life, self inside flesh The world wants to give you death, really your life is not the life of an animal, flesh and blood, your real life is your higher self inside the flesh, your human intelligence, your spiritual life and nature, your moral life and nature etc., that's your real higher self. And this Religion you know all of us will admit this Religion addresses the need for our moral life, our spiritual life, our rational life etc.. Its not addressing the need for flesh and blood except as flesh and blood embodies the human spirit, the human moral life, the human rational life and the social life, praise be to Allah (swt). Well I could talk on peace for a long time and I don't want to because its after 10 O'clock, its 10:20 almost soon to be 10:20, I'm going to change the subject and try to finish in about 10 or 15 minutes. I think that's enough for peace. Soul inside and outside the body Qur'an 57.21; Garden heaven earth ; \"Be ye foremost (in seeking) forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden (of Bliss) the width whereof is as the width of I heaven and earth prepared for those who believe in Allah and His apostles: that is the Grace of Allah which He \u00bb bestows on whom He pleases: and Allah is the Lord of I Grace abounding.\" Its clear to you that Peace a power that was implanted in our own bodies, peace in the soul that's in the body and outside of the body, did you know that? I want you to know it if you don't know it. Your soul is not only in your body, your soul is in your body and outside of your body and just like they don't know how to map the dimensions of this creation, they cannot, I can't and nobody can't map the dimensions of your soul. And G-d says He has given you the whole universe, all the space there is and the earth as your garden. The soul lives in that big garden so G-d has told us that my soul has been created to live in that much, in that big space. The space that is in terms of its dimension is the extent of the heavens and the earth, this is what Allah (swt) says plainly in the Qur'an. So if my soul, I said if, why? Because I'm speaking to you, I'm telling you I'm not forced, I don't want to force you to believe this. If my soul or your human soul is as big as G-d said it is in its power to be in touch and do work in space, He's going to give us a garden the width, thereof will be the expanse of the heavens and the earth, that what Allah (swt) says. That means I can get in touch with it, why give me a garden I can't see or reach? That would be ridiculous, see stay with intelligence no matter what you're trying to work on with your mind stay with intelligence don't become foolish, alright, ok. Souls all human occupy same space If that's true then my soul is in the space of your soul and your soul is in the space of my soul and the souls of all human beings are occupying the same space at the same time. So there is one great fluid ocean of souls that is singular only as I see myself but are singular in its plural body also, Adam, singular in its plural body also. Clairvoyance Esp man same one soul Qur'an 33.6; Prophet closer than own self \"The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves\" Therefore its possible rationally for me to know what you're feeling because we are one in sensitivity or in sensitive body. And its possible for you to know what I'm feeling and it possible for you to communicate on my behalf and its possible for me to communicate on your behalf. So when you see the Prophet (pbuh) see him as you speaking for you as well as himself above you, praise be to Allah (swt). Qur'an 3.68; Muhammad follow order of Abraham \"Without doubt among men the nearest of kin to Abraham are those who follow him as are also this Apostle and those who believe; and Allah is the Protector of those who have faith. This is rational I don't speak until its rational for me I'm a follower of Muhammed (pbuh) the order after the order of Abraham the upright in faith peace be upon him, yes. I'm in accord with this Religion not out of it and whenever I think I'm getting out I pull back, no I can't get out of this Religion. And I ask Allah (swt) see I'm successful because I don't trust myself with myself. I tell Allah (swt) I trust myself with You, please I say please, I use English, there's please in Arabic but I say it in English I say \"please my Lord, please Allah (swt) Highly Glorified, Perfect above all imperfections and I am not perfect my Lord I am limited. Please save me from myself'. Isn't that what Abraham in effect when he said \"Enne thalamtu nafse\" surely I've wrong my own self, \"and I expose my faults to You my Lord, I confess my faults the language says. Forgive me my defects my faults all of them. And he asks \"Wahdene fe ahsane akhlaaq\" and guide me to the best of my own creation. They translated and I'm translating it too. And guide me to the best of my own creation, You have created me G-d I don't know how to guide myself to the best of what You did. Forgive me, change condition in my creation. So G-d my Lord You give me to the best of my creation for surely none can guide except You, first he said none can forgive faults except You. Because forgive is not only to forgive, forgive is to forgive the bad action or the bad condition of the person that's praying for the forgiveness but also to change the condition. Forgive it means to remove that problem that was there. Not just forgive me for what I've done G-d but forgive my creation and the only way for you to forgive my creation you have to take this out of my creation. So the Forgiver has not only the power to forgive your conscience or your act, He has the power to forgive your state of being. And He can't forgive your state of being until He take out of your state of being that, that causes the problem, alright praise be to Allah (swt). And He says He will change your state to a better state and you'll be pleased, praise be to Allah (swt). Peace is agent in life of the universe Peace is agent in life of the universe and peace is the agent in the life of all creatures and man the highest of the creatures that He made from the earth. It's the most powerful agent in you. Criminal not as powerful as righteous That's why I use to say when I was a young man fighting the darkness I knew I had to go to the night and I knew I should fight the darkness. I was fighting the darkness and you know fighting darkness you can sometimes hurt yourself, you're fighting darkness. I didn't care if it destroyed me, fighting the darkness and I said to you all \"you think you're powerful, you think you're bad because you have your muscles and you don't have any respect for anything, you're a criminal, you could kill me. I said yes you can kill me but you think I'm afraid of you, I said \"look no criminal is more courageous than the true peaceful servant of G-d. And no criminal is as tough a fighter as the true peaceful servant of G-d.\" I said \"come on bring it on\". I said that in the spirit of a servant of G-d knowing that where I fail G-d is going to take over and not in no spooky way and I let you know that because you didn't believe in spook. You were a spook but you didn't believe in spooks, you believed everything was material. So I made it clear to you that this aint no spooky thing, I said the forces that you know, the forces that you respect G-d will have them on my side not on your side, that's what I told you back then I had to pull that Sonny Listen and Muhammad Ali thing on you, you were threatening. So I had to get my bluff in first and get it in strong then I could float like a butterfly and sting like a bee. It's a lot of truth to that now, praise be to Allah (swt) so lets see can I conclude right away here. Clock human soul wants universal peace not war So lastly what I want to say to you that we're living in the time for peace, that's the hunger of the souls of nations now. Not in their leaders but in their people. The hunger is the hunger for universal peace, they don't want to be at war with themselves inside their countries and they don't want to be at war with other people or other nations. They want peace for the whole community of man so we can spend this energy for constructive things and not destruction. That the time on clock of human soul in this day and time, that's what time it is on clock of human soul. And G-d says wait until I bring My clock, Peace As Salaam Alaikum and may G-d forgive us our errors and guide us ever and give us His mercy Ameen. Youth As Salaam Alaikum we need to speak to the youth that have come if everybody could sit down just for a very brief moment. Youth if you're outside of the area could you come back into the area quickly, you could stand right in the door the youth. Now would the youth stand only - the youth, when I say youth I'm not talking about somebody 40 yrs old only the youth. Now alright so the youth I have asked you to come to these sessions and I'm making you welcome just as all others, your welcome is the same welcome I give to Imams no different. My interest in you is our interest in you, the leader's interest in you, our interest is that you be better than us for the future, that's my interest in you. That you be better than us for the future because the future will ask more of us than the present and the past of us and we want you to be better than us for the future. Dead living are here in one place Qur'an 77.25-26; Earth draws living and the dead 25. Have We not made the earth (as a place) to draw together 26. The living and the dead Qur'an 2.154; Dead not they're alive you perceive not \"And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah \"They are dead.\" Nay they are living though ye perceive (it) not I've told you about my philosophical mind, my mystical side and I see myself tomorrow living in you, I won't be dead, I'll be living in you so please give me a nice future yes give me the future you know I want Because I won't be living after I die here on this earth I won't be living anywhere except in you. So please give your Imam W. Deen Mohammed a nice future! you won't be able to talk to him, but he'll be with you living in your time too, so please remember me that I'm with you. I'm not speaking Bible I'm speaking from Imam Warith Ud Din Mohammed's soul, my soul knows where its going to be and I follow the guidance of G-d to know my soul and its nature and its possibilities. Body dies soul lives move to those love most Qur'an 13.21-23; Families will be together in hereafter \"Gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter there as well as the righteous, among their fathers their spouses and their offspring: and angels shall enter unto them from every gate (with the salutation):\" So I'll be with you and you will be with me, we all will be together we aren't going anywhere, the body dies, and if you think scientifically when the soul dies it hasn't any more body to live in, no more world it can relate to, material world it can relate to. If it has movement after the death of my body, where is it going to want to move? To those that I love most, that's where it is going to want to be. It want to be with those I love most, though it has no body to communicate anymore with my loved ones, its going, yeah brother I feel just like you feel, it is going to be with those that I love most. So we're going to be together and this is not said by me for the first time this is said in Scripture and even Muhammad the Prophet (pbuh) said that yes ''you will be together and with your wife and with your loved ones. By: Imam W. Deen Mohammed (raa) ",

            "answer_text": "A place, no. A state of being, yes. Heaven exists without place, much the same as hell. Both are unique to the individual that experiences heaven or hell. The idea there exists a place where souls and spirits go after death as an eternal reward or punishment is a product of humanity's wishful thinking and sense of justice. We expect that a person who commits atrocities and gets away with it here on earth would get punished in some way after they pass, and those who have needlessly suffered and still do good for others and lead exemplary lives (or those who follow Jesus if you\u2019re Christian) would go to heaven\u2026but it ain\u2019t so. Everyone is awarded eternal rest after life has left them. The murderers and the rapists and the saints and do-gooders all have the same exact thing to look forward to. This idea makes people angry of course because a deep-seated sense of justice exists in many people. Our beliefs inform our ideas about what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is not - but even these are only opinions - no one knows what is good and what is not, but we all have ideas about it one way or another. Many others will agree with our ideas, but there will always be those who do not because it\u2019s not based on fact. The best thing we can do for ourselves, in order to attain a real sense of lasting peace on earth is to acknowledge this fact and abandon your own ideas and sense of what is good and what is evil - they are nothing more than lies we tell ourselves and attempt to force others to live by. The idea of good and evil is the only true Evil, the absence thereof is the only true Good, God\u2019s peace is found in death, but also when one abandons the nonsense of their own personal ideas about good and evil, heaven and hell as well as their egotistical self-centered narcissistic ignorant sense of justice.

            "answer_text": "Of course it does. But like so many things in life you must have faith that it does. How many things in life you know exists, but you have never seen? Too many to list correct? If the critics want to disregard the New Testament where it talks about heaven and Jesus Christ, then they must also disregard other ancient writings by Plato, Aristotle, and Homer. This is because the New Testament documents are better-preserved and more numerous than any other ancient writings. Because they are so numerous, they can be cross checked for accuracy . . . and they are very consistent. Plato existed 427\u2013327 BC the earliest copy of the original manuscript is 800 AD. That's 1200 years difference. There are 7 copies. We believe Plato existed based on what? Faith. The New Testament was written 1st century AD 50\u2013100. The earliest copy of the original manuscript is less than 100 years old. There are over 5500 copies of the original manuscript with 99.5% accuracy. If your going to place your faith in something you have not seen, then evidence makes it easier to believe. ",

If we mean by saying \u201c Heaven to mean Paradise\" then this is a different meaning. I believe the heaven refferences to here is toean Paradise and thus where is Paradise located would be the right line of questioning. Another point worth noting is in Islam we believe in that Allah the supreme creator the God of Adam and Noah and Abraham created 7 Heavens\u2026meaning 7 levels groups or layers each layer having its own Galaxies and constillations, the lowest is the seventh (7th) heaven and the Highest is the 1st Heaven. The lowest heaven which Earth belongs to and all other such as the solar system and the Milky Way is called (Dunya) mean (The Lowest) and many times verses reffer to life in the lowest heaven to mean indirectly as life on earth. So this world we live in not only the earth but with all the starts within our heaven is called (The Dunya) Thus Paradise exists either after the first heaven or within the first heaven, ii can't remember but to answer your question it exists above .

I consider this evidence much more reliable then sense reality because it speaks directly to the mind.

If we accept his testimony, then Heaven is not the spirit world, to where souls go after the bodies die (where you have gone, my dear). Heaven is above the spirit world, though spirits can, under certain conditions, become angels and ascend to Heaven. The angelic state is the heavenly state. There is a beautiful sentence by Swedenborg that summarises the conditions to access Heaven. It says: \u201c...a way stands plainly open into heaven; but none can enter the way but those who have heaven within them.\"[i] Spirits can go down into Hell too, according to Swedenborg; both ways are open. I am sure, though, that is not your case, so I will leave out that second way. Every angel in Heaven was previously a man. While still being a whole, Heaven has countless divisions and subdivisions, about which I will tell you later.  ",

There is a scene in which one of the fish students asks Dory that if she suffers from short-term memory loss, then how can she remember them? To which Dory replies I don't remember who they are but I know everyone has a family so naturally I must too. What I meant by this is that we haven't seen and observed heaven and hell from up close so we should deny them\u2026 But there is something else that we know. That our mind can't comprehend everything in the universe. We cannot enter some realms of science and we probably never will. Therefore we go to our God and ask him, and God sends prophets with their holy books like Quran and Bible and etc to teach us, to enlighten us. Conclusion: We can't get scientific proof of afterlife because just like Dory's memories, they don't exist anymore. But like her we can deduce by other facts that there is something that we belong to it which we haven't seen (or think we haven't). Surely you don\u2019t think the awards and punishments for our deeds in this world can be rewarded completely in this fragile and soon-to-end world!!! ",

John 14:1-3 even says that Jesus is in heaven preparing a place for us to live. In heaven, those saved by God will have new bodies without the curse of sin! There will be no one who is blind, deaf or lame in heaven (Isaiah 35:5, 6 and Philippians 3:21). Although Jesus builds houses in heaven, the Bible also says that those saved will also build their own houses and inhabit them as well as plant and eat from vineyards (Isaiah 65:21). Most importantly, God will be in heaven and He wants to be your friend. He wants to dwell with you and wipe away all your tears (Revelation 21:1-4). Revelation 22:1-5 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 2 through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. 3 No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. 4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. 5 And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever. To answer your question yes I believe in heaven. ",

We hear so many things from so many different people, in order to know what\u2019s what, we have to do our own \u201chomework\u201d so to speak.

I preach the gospel that is my only duty, the rest is not in my hands. I doubt it before, I was agnostic. I searched high and low, I found Jesus is God almighty by that obvious that there is a heaven,. He did not die on the cross just because he did not have anything better to do in Heaven and became man to be crucified. No he was crucified to take on him our sins, prophecy of the old testament written 700 years before him, read Isaiah 53. Jesus saying he came from Heaven, and that he shall rise the dead ones on resurrection,( he resurrected by his power appointed by the father), read John 10 with that he showed he is God almighty. Back to the claiming that Jesus said he came from Heaven: 26Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled. 27Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed. 28Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? 29Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent. 30They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work? 31Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat. 32Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. 33For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. 34Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. 35And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 36But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 37All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 38For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. 40And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

He had the Damascus Road experience that caused him to change course and begin the steps to conversion that turned Christianity\u2019s worst nightmare into its most prolific defender and apostle. Others have claimed to have had the experience. I don\u2019t believe most of them based on their descriptions, a bit fanciful, and the words, quite sectarian - supports fringe group theology, and sometimes motive - selling books, speaking engagements, etc. That leaves a few who have believable stories. But as for scientific proof, you might as well be attempting to prove a Flash series Earth 2\u201323 or a Star Trek parallel universe. Not saying they are not there, just that they are not accessible to most people if they are. (Has it ever amazed you just how easy it is for Star Trek vessels to travel through time or to other universes that are \u201calmost\u201d perfect replicas of our own, including the English language?). So with some testimony, a few hints, and the only real alternative being another unprovable situation, that there is literally nothing after death, we realize that everyone, Buddhists with nirvana, Christians and Muslims with heaven/paradise, spiritists with their ethereal afterlife and atheists with their nothingness (who comes back to tell us there was nothing?) is taking a leap of faith, (comments will be disabled - atheists are so predictable). Those of us who have experienced collateral revelation that supports the Bible narrative have all the proof we need, but since it is subjective, it will never be enough for someone with no experience. I consider that fair enough. Christianity can be studied intellectually, but it cannot be received that way. Even defining the word \u201cspiritual\u201d is elusive. It is like air.

The \u201cproblem of evil\u201d - or theodicy or whatever you want to call it - relies upon a high level of emphasis on the suffering we encounter in this life, without regard for what comes afterward. Many point to Christ\u2019s miracle of raising Lazarus from the dead and say that it was ultimately pointless. Lazarus still died later. So where is the significance? The significance was in the symbolism of it. Christ performed that miracle as a physical manifestation of what He could do to our spirits. That is, He could save us from all the woes of this world - not just sin, but suffering as well. Those who are overcome in the suffering of this world can be lifted up and revitalized as if that suffering had never occurred. And the glory to follow will eclipse that suffering and swallow it up such that it seems like a trivial thing in hindsight. Those who would have us believe that there is no God to make all things right in the end will often say that they are champions of justice. However, in truth, they are, at some level, demanding that we accept injustice. They are positing for us an imbalanced universe in which the equation does not balance - a universe that has a fundamental flaw, an irrational and contradictory facet to its natural laws. In this universe, there is a child who is born to poor parents who disown him due to accusations of witchcraft and leave him all alone to starve. And he does. Many will hear of this story and assume that this child will never attain the real justice that comes only through recovery. They will then naturally feel that something is wrong with this picture. Because there is something wrong with it. To say that justice will not be delivered at some point is like saying that gravity works sometimes but not at other times, occasionally \u201cshutting off\u201d for no apparent reason. Yes, as with gravity, the effects of justice can seemingly be suspended for a time, but its natural laws are nevertheless constant. The obvious rebuttal to that will be to say that justice is not *real* in the way that gravity is, but that it is instead a concept that humans have made up, and so we should not expect the equation to balance, as it exists outside of natural laws. But if that is the case, then it is as meaningful as the existence of an imaginary deity, so why are we getting so worked up about it? It does not make sense to invent a concept and then angrily demand that the universe revolve around this concept you just created. But justice is a real thing, and that is why it will be delivered. Whether in this life or the next, it will be delivered. The equation must balance.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is odd because what you're defining as 'heaven' is really a very complicated and diverse subject that's not only confined to the grasp of religions. Many secular-minded people accept there's more life after this life is done too, and I'm one of these people myself. I'm not sure how to give you advice for denying the existence of something that I accept as a likely fact myself. I'm not sure how to answer the request you're given since it's coming from the mind of a sceptic who obviously doesn't even have the most basic grasps of mediumship, psychic phenomena, survival evidence, the fundamental nature of the latter things mentioned here, etc. He devised a question about a topic he obviously has little knowledge about, and wants you to learn to debate to support a bias it seems. I'm not sure how you could debate such an argument because this is such a narrow-minded request to a very complicated subject. The only real chance you would have here is to maybe look up near-death experiences, look for flaws with them being used as evidence for survival and to use logical arguments themselves. Logical fallacies can easily be found on the internet so I'd suggest looking these up too. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the question asked was whether YOU should believe in Heaven. It is your choice as to what you want to believe. You can choose, like James McNiel, that there is no such place and content yourself with the joy of a morning walk, a nice breakfast, and a good nights rest (for as long as you can) and then give it all up for a cold and very dark grave until your dead body, and all your loving relationships, disintegrate into nothingness. To me that is a pretty short sighted and gloomy view of what can become eternal happiness. On the other hand you can choose to believe in all the wonderful things mentioned about what heaven is like and pursue a life of goodness and fulfillment with hope in your heart which can develop into faith. As you do so you will find peace and joyful life. The \u201cfruits of the spirit\u201d as mentioned in Galatians 5:22 can be yours as you apply the teachings of Jesus Christ in you life to generate a life of \u201clove, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, and faith. But choice is eternally important, and everyone does make their choice and act accordingly, I suppose, but can repent as needed as we learn more about life and eternal existence. To put that choice in perspective, let me quote a Book of Mormon prophet who addressed those choices. Best wishes on yours. Here\u2019s what the Lord told him: \u201cWherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.\u201d (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 2:27.

For others it is simply being around the ones you love, knowing that they too love you back. As much as many would like to believe it is not being able to be reunited after you die with those who have passed however it is the memories that one has of those who have passed that prevents them from ever really being gone.

And if a tyrant \"escapes judgment\" by swallowing a painless poison, to our mind it is axiomatic that his tribulations have just begun. God is just (Deuteronomy 32:4). The existence of a spiritual place or places in which the souls of the dead are treated in accordance with their behavior when alive (reward or punishment), is a tradition of mankind, which finds expression (in differing details) in various religions. It cannot be conclusively proven as long as we're alive; and that's the whole point: God tests us as to whether we will live in a way that demonstrates that we're aware of His presence, even though His presence is not readily visible.

            "answer_text": "Hell, Heaven and Kingdom Of Lord This universe is infinite. I am unable to show the existence of these super worlds to you. I accept my incapability. But you are also incapable to prove directly the non-existence of these super worlds. Have you taken all over the universe and said, \" Here ends the universe. Beyond this point there is no universe. This is the compound wall of the space. Your super world does not exist anywhere\u2019\u2019. Therefore, there is equal chance for the existence and non-existence of the super worlds according to the theory of probability. Now let us analyse of our cases. Both of us are eating to live. The basic needs are satisfied in the cases of both of us. You have spent extra time also in earning more money, which may give you some problems of health like sugar, B.P etc., due to over enjoying. I have not earned more money and I am healthy due to normal food. None of us will carry the money with us after death. The money given to the children may also be lost in several ways. Therefore, I do not find much difference between us, once the basic needs are satisfied. I am poor because I have spent my extra time in the service of God. Suppose after my death, you are correct and there are no super worlds. In such case what I have lost? There is no loss for me. But after your death, suppose I am correct and there are super worlds. You have lost every thing and God will not save you. Thus, even on accepting your argument, based on the equal probability, it is better to serve the Lord by sacrificing the extra time and energy for the Lord after earning the basic needs. You must read the theory of probability, which is perfectly a scientific theory. The hell exists in the space far above our earth, which can be seen only by the grace of God The hell exists in the space far above our earth, which can be seen only by the grace of God. The reason is that the souls embedded in the energetic bodies reaching hell for punishments and the divine administration staff including the entire hell is made of energy, which has frequency far above the reachable frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum. The concept of hell will give some control on the sin, which is very much advantageous to anybody. If the faith on the existence of the hell shades away, your future will be very serious and I assuredly tell all of you about this point. You may argue that I cannot take you into the space and show the existence of the hell to you. But, at the same time you cannot also take Me into this infinite space up to its boundary and show Me the non-existence of the hell. In such case, the hell may exist or may not exist. Both the options have equal probability. In such case, a wise person will select the probability of lesser risk, which is to believe the existence of hell. If you are careful in not doing the sins, based on your faith in the existence of hell, nothing is lost even if the hell is absent. If you take other option to disbelieve the existence of hell and go on doing the sins, you are lost if the hell exists. Therefore, the first option is always far better than the second one. You need not believe that much only whatever is seen by you. Inference is also an authority of the knowledge in which you believe in the existence of something, which is not seen by you. The miracles exhibited by the devotees in this world prove the existence of unimaginable areas. The Veda says that the past memory of the hell or previous birth is nipped off with the nails of God (Paraanchi Khaani...). This means that the memory in us is lost by the will of God only. The reason is that if the memory of the hell remains, the individual will just shiver with fear and will be unable to do anything or even to read the scripture. This is not desirable to God, who likes the soul to start a fresh life forgetting all the past and achieve not only the worldly goals but also spiritual goals. Similarly, if the memory of the previous births exists in the mind of the human being, such a human being will utterly confuse due to millions of family bonds that appear whenever it goes out of the house. In such a confusion, the human being will become mad and the same situation of inactivity results. Hence, everything set-up by God has its own meaning and do not criticize God in hasty manner. A passenger suffering with heat in summer came under a huge Neem tree to rest for some time. He thought that God is foolish because the huge tree is having tiny fruits where as the tender pumpkin creeper is loaded with very big fruits. Thinking like this, he slept for some time. He awoke after some time and found the tiny fruits, which have fallen on him from the tree. Then he realized his mistake thinking that he was foolish where as God is very wise. If the huge tree has proportionally huge fruits, his head should have been broken by the fruits, which are fallen on him! Therefore, patience must be the first quality of the spiritual knowledge as said by Shankara (Shamadamaadi...). ",

            "answer_text": "The best argument FOR the existence of God is \"you can't prove otherwise\". That is the hardest to counter because it is true. So concede that point.  Seeing as how God can neither be proven nor disproven, you're stuck arguing likelihood.  Your conclusion will be along the lines of \"God MUST not exist\", rather than \"God DOES not exist\". Read the Bible. Find discrepancies.  \"The Bible says X! But X is not true! Therefore the Bible cannot be used to prove the existence of God!\" The default fallback argument for the non-existence of God is as follows: IF God exists, He is both omnipotent and benign. (As the Bible says) IF there is an omnipotent, benign being, then that being would not allow suffering in the world. THERE IS suffering in this world.(like bone cancer in children) THEREFORE there is NO omnipotent, benign being. THEREFORE there is NO God. That is as much as I will do for you; you will need to do the rest of your research yourself or with your group. ",

I don't know if it takes up all of the volume which the journey of the Earth around the Sun describes, but it might. After that, as you are talking about ever more pleasant places, they have to get further and further away, quite simply because the Earth itself has a huge spiritual stink, and you can\u2019t have a real heaven close. The First Sphere is not classified as heaven, and at its best (at the top) its described as like California. It also contains the many levels of hell. The highest heaven in my guess would be beyond our possibly to reach by technology such as we can imagine. Because in Spirit you can travel instantly, where needed. Low level spirits do not, but I was talking about more advanced spirits. Low level spirits certainly travel fast, as fast as \u201cthought\u201d. And there are means for transporting spirits fast, if needed. So thats as much as I can share about location. ",

I am a mystic, 30 years ago I experienced a spiritual illumination in the hitherto unconscious mental image of the Father and I ascended into the city of God, so I know Heaven exists, but you have to be a Hero to find it as it means freeing yourself from your shadow, your darkside, and if you have any doubt that your darkside exists, try putting the creation of beauty before anything else and love all beings unconditionally, the reason you can\u2019t or won\u2019t is down to your darkside. Heaven is real for me but not for many people, as Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, it is wholly within you, within your sub concious mind. And for what it\u2019s worth what Christ called the Kingdom of Heaven, William Blake called Golganoosa, land of artists, poets and musicians, and what he called Golganoosa Jung called the Collective Unconscious, what the Red Indian people called the Great White Spirit and the aboriginal people called the Dreamtime, you are more than flesh and blood, at your deepest level you are Spirit, you are everything, you are in everything, your are in Heaven now you just need to realise it.

I'm going to refer to 3 movies and if you can take a little from each one, I think we can come to a happy medium. 1, 2001 and 2010 these two movies are long and pay attention to details. It's worth being patient. 2. Contact with Jodie Foster. pay attention to details. 3. Mission to Mars with Don Cheadle, Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise. pay attention to details. I incorporate these 3 with my biblical learning and believe that this is where heaven is and where we really come from. FYI. Even though I enjoy some SiFi movies, I'm not a fanatic where I'm obsessed with X files kind of conspiracies. I was raised in Catholic school all the way to high school and many times have spoken people from different religions to get a general perspective but, again if you keep a open mind. I'm always looking for the truth. I believe that my suggestion May help clear up alot. Feel free to give me your opinion or comments. ",

The head injury change his character and he is now hostile to everybody around him. 10 years later he commits suicide angry and bitter. Which personality will he bring to this supposed afterlife - the likeable or the hostile? Our personality is coupled to our brain. If you change the chemistry of the brain you change the personality. For example if you take steroids it will make you more aggressive. So a soul without a body and a brain doesn't make sense. And this is the reason why soul-wandering, reincarnation and all the other fairytales about an afterlife is just wishfull thinking. They doesn't add up. ",

But the fact is that the world is a very surprising place to be in. If this (being in this world) can happen to you, then anything likely can. I believe in the existence of soul and respect the notion of justice. This makes me believe that reincarnation and taking birth in different animal bodies is possible. After all, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution is real and undeniable. If we believe in this theory then we have to believe that animals also have soul, or else it could not have entered humans at a certain stage of development. There have been people who have experienced switching bodies, and getting out of their bodies and seeing the world outside of their body. There may be other places besides the earth where souls take birth. Those are more likely to be the real heaven and hell. But you never know until you know. ",

So when the body is gone what we are in essence remains and the tendencies imprinted in the soul go to make up the experience of heaven or hell, suffering or happiness of future lives. We keep being pulled along by the karmic wheel of living and dying until the soul awakens to its true nature. With Liberation good and evil and all dualities are transcended., it is then the end of rebirth into the world of Samsara and of being subject to birth and death. It is then we dwell in the true heaven of Moksha or Nirvana where all causes of suffering are extinguished. ",

You probabaly won't have to sit in heaven forever, ignoring the screams of everyone you know burning for eternity in hell.

He wants you to be there with him, but he is also is looking for followers who are humble and kind. Those who offend and enjoy doing so will be shut out, even though they might cry out for mercy. Jesus also said, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.\u201d Ask Jesus what that means for you.

The loving feeling grew stronger as I was led nearer to my destination. I couldn't wait to get there. Then, God stopped my spirit abruptly. He talked with me (telepathically) and sent my spirit back to my earthly body to live again.

What I would rather like to know is what purgatory looked like before Divine intervention in this world took place, and returns to when it leaves. I cannot help but think that purgatory somehow is almost the equal opposite to heaven, yeah a dirty filthy rotten place fit for its inhabitants, including you perhaps? ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you define heaven and what you believe about it. Heaven has been defined in many different ways. When Gen 1 says God created the Heaven and the Earth, heaven could refer only to the visible celestial realm\u2014stars, sun, moon, etc. Elsewhere, however, it is described as a place where God and the angels reside. Nowhere in the Hebrew Bible (OT) is it described as a place where human beings live after death. The idea that righteous people could live in heaven after death entered Judaism in post-Biblical times, though it was not emphasized strongly. However, Christians made it a central tenet of their faith. It is thus possible to believe that there is some non-material realm outside of the material world in which we live, but not necessarily to believe that you will live there someday. In any event, there is never a \u201cshould\u201d in questions of belief. You believe what you honestly believe. If, as many religions believe, God is omniscient, He will know whether or not you are faking your belief. ",

We are all different when it comes to such topics; for they are so complex that one cannot say whether it is true or is not. One must decide for themself. I believe in God and thus it is true for me that heaven is for real. Plus there is also the fact that in my life I have had many experiences that are both good and bad, together; they have cause me to believe in heaven and all that goes with this place.

No, it is a false doctrine believed as part of a package of teachings that came from pagan Rome. Once the immortality of the soul was adopted it became necessary to also take the logical step of one\u2019s soul going to heaven or hell. The gospel hope is a resurrection from the dead, as taught and demonstrated by Jesus. He was raised then after a time departed to be with his father but this was in his capacity as king of the new order to be established at his return. Going to heaven is in conflict with the Bible. The gospel is based on the promises to Abraham and if you read them you will see that heaven is never mentioned as a destination. ",

I guess the inclusion of the word \u201cstill\u201d in the question implies that something has changed\u2026. that something could be more science discovery, more distribution of information via internet, mobiles and such. So more people are seeing more information than ever in the world. I\u2019m a scientist, and also believe in heaven. At the same time, I have a huge respect for people that don\u2019t, and that arrive at their conclusions through rational, well thought through argument and debate. The terrible things that have been done in the past by people claiming to represent God, or God\u2019s will, must just strengthen the belief that the whole thing is some big scam designed to get power over people and take their money. So it is a rational conclusion. No scientific proof really exists, no evidence, that shows that heaven is really there. So how come people like me, supposedly rational, believe in it ? The answer is that at least in my case, I don\u2019t believe that something has to be measured, or proven, just for it to be true. I can\u2019t measure how much I love my family, but I definitely do love them. I don\u2019t measure the feeling I get when I hear a song I really like, but I definitely feel it. I can\u2019t prove that I like Wasabi. I could be faking it. Can it be objectively and independently measured ? None of this is proof of the existence of heaven. I only use it as an example to show that there are many things in life whose existence cannot be proven by science, but that doesn\u2019t mean to say that they don\u2019t exist. ",

Those who have somewhat deeper understanding still doesn't comprehend it fully and unable to give a proper definition of this thing. I can say only this: it is nowhere to be found until you die. Atheists will dismiss even this, but that's what free will is for. ",

The Bible is where we learn about Heaven and God and what we have to do to have eternal life. There is plenty of good evidence for Scrioture and the God of the Bible, but there is no proof. The gap between evidence and proof is faith. But atheists can't prove God doesn't exist either. They, too, have a gap between evidence and proof and believe in no God by faith. At the end of the day, you have to search out the matter for yourself. ",

The place i am referring to is the last habitable village on the Indo Tibet border and is called 'Chitkul. The village is based on the shore of river \u2018Baspa' and is literally called as the 'Land of Gods' . Although I realized it when I was leaving that place but believe me folks those were some breathtaking scenic views that I saw there. The village is approximately 600 kms from New Delhi, however there are no Volvo's after Shimla to accommodate you. The village lies on the chilly baspa river overthrowing one of the best views that I have witnessed throughout my journies. It gives you a perfect combination of lush green grounds with a sweet rivery chimmer and along with an aura of fresh fauna. It is one of the things that almost challenged me as I did my most of the journey on a roadways bus but there are no forced rules as being a rider myself, I know that a motorcyclist would love this journey. So, if you want to witness heaven on earth then do visit the land of the gods (Chitkul) and do share your queries or experiences with me.  ",

However, we can get glimpses or hints of Heaven here on earth. Perhaps this is what is meant by \u201cthe Kingdom of God.\u201d There are moments of joy, peace and love in this existence that seem to defy logic and come from a different place. The bible calls these \u201clove that surpasses knowledge\u201d and \u201cpeace that transcends understanding\u201d. There can be a sense of joy that underlies the pain of loss and moments of quiet faith and appreciation that non-believers cannot grasp.

I'm guessing part of their arguments will be personal experiences of people who say they were clinically dead and saw Heaven (there's at least one Quoran who experienced this), so was that real and true or the unconscious/brain at work or what? (By the way, there's a book (2010) and movie (2014), Heaven Is For Real. http://www.notjustanotherbook.com/isheavenreal.htm) I suggest you read up on arguments FOR Heaven and then list point-by-point the arguments against it. Also, a number of Quorans will give you additional ideas on how to effectively debate that Heaven doesn't exist. ",

It is not that I am Indian so I am promoting that place. People from all around the world come here to get that mental peace and divine energy into their soul. There is a state in India called Uttrakhand, which is also known as Dev Bhoomi. Dev Bhoomi means Land of Gods. There are many heavens in Uttarakhand but there is ONE absolute Heaven in Uttarakhand which is KEDARNATH JI. Kedarnath is a town in the Indian state of Uttarakhand and it has gained importance because of Kedarnath temple. Kedarnath temple is the residence of Lord Shiva and it is one of the Char Dham in India. Kedarnath is located in the lap of Himalayas and has an altitude of about 3583 Metres (11755 feet). Behind the temple there is a huge Glacier which is called Chorabari Glacier. it is the source of Mandakini river. It is flanked by snow-capped peaks called Kedarnath mountains. I visited this place on 23rd September 2020. I have to say Just One Word: DIVINE. I don\u2019t know what type of Divine Energy is there but once you will go there, You will not come back again because of the Stunning Views and Mental Peace. This place is a heaven on earth. After 16 km of trekking, you have glimpse of this old historical and religious place. No words can express the beauty of the place and surroundings. Weather is cold and rain can come at any time. at one time there is heat from the sun and another moment, fog(clouds) will cover you. I will say one thing: If you Want to see Heaven Alive, Go To \u201cKEDARNATH\u201d I also went there in 2020, I will attach the Vlog that I made of there so that Everyone can see the Heaven On Earth while sitting at home. Vlog No.1 -  Vlog No.2 - EDITING IN PROCESS Thanks For Reading. Kindly Upvote The Answer. ",

People claiming such places do exist fail heavily on logic and rational. This is not always their fault. They have been raised with presupposed ideas from a religious viewpoint which contains control structures that require such ideas as punishment places and lofty places. But they fail to recognise these things were made up by the leaders of their faiths approximately 1500 years ago ( that is why such thing doesn't even get mentioned in the OT/Torah). ",

But it has always been thus, so what may have changed?

Try to avoid reading what are other people's ideas such as commentators on the Bible. Their arguments will seem to make sense until you read another commentator with a different idea. Most importantly you should first decide what source of information you believe is the most reliable. Unless you have a solid reason for your beliefs you will be easily swayed in another direction. One day someone will knock on your door and have everything laid out for their belief system but if you follow my advice you can stand firm in your beliefs. Persons who don't have a solid basis for their beliefs often wind up in cults and get led around like sheep without a shepherd. Good success in your endeavor. ",

The unicorn is a meme: a cultural entity created by us. But it is a real cultural entity, unlike the frmxklijs, which I just made up and is not a real cultural entity\u2014certainly not like a unicorn. Heaven has that sort of reality: it\u2019s a cultural construct, and you won\u2019t encounter it outside of a cultural construct, but it\u2019s a real cultural construct and is for many quite important.

Like soldiers, thay live for us, our army die for us, they will be awarded in afterlife. This is what makes me believe in heaven and similarly those who do something bad and are not punished in this world,they will be in hell. This makes me believe in hell. People of Kashmir and Palestine tell me what have they done that they don't deserve freedom and we do? There has to be a place where life would be fair!

But it actually depends on which religion you come from, some say you stay in the grave till the day of judgement, but who knows. How does the universe and heaven relate? They don't. Obviously, since you live there forever, there is no time in heaven which leads me to assume that heaven \u2014 if exist\u2014 is outside of the universe. ",

There is no harm to you in believing in it nor it will cause economic crash.
