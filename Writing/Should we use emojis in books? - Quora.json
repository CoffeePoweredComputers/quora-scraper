Unless you are doing something special, specifically related to emojis or the use of them or the culture around them, or even a kids\u2019 book made out of them, I would not. If I were to pick up a history book that was written with emojis, I would immediately put it back. Same for a math book, a current events non-fiction, or anything that wasn\u2019t supposed to be frivolous. There is already a feeling by many people that today\u2019s culture is one of, shall we say, ignorance? For lack of a better term. It seems that not only do many people no longer know how to write in a formal or proper manner, but that they don\u2019t even care that they do not. I would read a short story with emojis, if it were well done. I don\u2019t think I could tolerate a novel. I would not read a news article or anything supposed to be informative. I know this is a bias, and I don\u2019t like to have those, but that really, to me, screams that the writer thinks they are too good to learn how to do things the right way, and they don\u2019t care what other people think. Now, in my defense, there is a problem with emojis. They don\u2019t mean anything specific. Or rather, they mean whatever people want them to mean. It is like abstract art. What exactly does an $1.4 million dollar painting automatically going into a shredder upon purchase mean? I\u2019m pretty sure it doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to the artist as it did to the buyer. Watch This $1.4 Million Banksy Painting Shred Itself As Soon As It's Sold The same can be said of emojis. My daughter asked me why I kept sending her \u201chugs\u201d. I told her I thought it meant \u201cexcited\u201d. There are more examples, but I won\u2019t bore with them. My point is, they mean different things to different people, which means you cannot communicate clearly with them. At least not until universal established meanings are set and agreed upon. It may be fun to play games with emojis, but I\u2019d hate to try to argue a case in court with one. Clearly conveyed complicated ideas are not only not guaranteed, they are not likely between strangers at all. I wouldn\u2019t recommend using them in most kinds of books. ",
