            "answer_text": "One rule of thumb when diagramming sentence is to assume that, if it looks like an ambiguous phrase might either be adverbial or adjectival, the normal default is to place it under the verb as an adverbial modifier unless the sense of the sentence clearly shows it modifies something else. So, which is being modified here\u2014the verb combination \u201cdon\u2019t have\u201d or the \u201cmoney\u201d? Here, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s adverbial, telling me about how you have or don\u2019t have something. Instead, it appears to be functionally adjectivally, describing the type of money you don\u2019t have or the intended purpose of the money. So, yes, I think it is modifying money based on the sense of the given sentence. ",
