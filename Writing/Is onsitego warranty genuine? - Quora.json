            "answer_text": "I would like to give -ve review for onsite go. I would not recommend onsite go for any of your electronics for extended warranty, its waste of time, your energy and money. Always better to go extended warranty with brand itself. Let me share my experience and reason in detail. When you purchase electronics from Chroma, please note these points. 1. During billing, Chroma sales guys will ask for extended warranty with Chroma, they will not inform you about the extended warranty is with 3 rd party which is onsite go. 2. Chroma will give false commitment on extended warranty will cover same as 1 st year warranty, but its not in the reality 3. There are lots of hidden terms and conditions which you will get to know when you talk to onsite go. Now I will talk about why you should not go with onsite go for extended warranty Vs why always better to go with company 1. Onsite go will not call you for periodic service check for your device whereas in company warranty, service engineer will schedule a service visit and come to your home based on your convince. 2. Onsite go is having tie-up with third-party vendors for servicing and they are not brand authorized service people. But in company warranty, service engineer will be from brand authorized service person. 3. Since they are not brand authorized service people, they don\u2019t have any knowledge about the product and repair. But in company warranty, they know in and out of the product With respect to my LG water purifier, I raised the service request on 4 th July, now I am writing this review on 8 th August, still the service is not done, and I am continuously following up with onsite go without any proper response. My humble request. Never ever choose onsite go for extended warranty. Better to go with company extended warranty. ",
