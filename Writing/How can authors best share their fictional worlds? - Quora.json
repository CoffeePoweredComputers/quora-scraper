            "answer_text": "Would I be correct if I reworded this question as \u201chow do I dig my world out of my brain-hole and share it in a way that makes readers think it\u2019s as cool as I do?\u201d If so, here\u2019s the best advice I can give you: Engage all the senses. What does the air in your world taste like? Is it hot there? Cold? What smells are there? What foods? What do the foods smell and taste like? How does the ground feel? how does the architecture feel? is it rust and rough edges, or smooth and well-kept? are populated areas covered in pollution? what does that look like? taste like? smell like? what are the sounds of the average street? If you want to share your world the best way possible, the best way I know how is to use your words to engage the reader\u2019s senses with such detail that they can tell someone exactly what your world smells like. If you want to do a little research into how authors accomplish this, I highly recommend you check out this book. Without a doubt, S. A. Chakraborty builds the richest world I have ever seen.

            "answer_text": "Looking at your name, I imagine that you\u2019re in the business of marketing? So the answer you want is, \u201ca good cover is essential\u201d. Loathe as I am to promote such a devious way of promoting your own interests, I have to say that a good, eye catching cover is one of the key elements to enhancing readership. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover? Silliest proverb ever. Of course you do. Apart from that, the best way any author can share their own world is by getting as many readers as they can. And once enticed, keeping them! And how do you grab them in the first place? Tell everybody your book is out there. Get as many reviews as you can. Write a good, attractive blurb. Oh, yes. And create a good cover. Done all that? Why, the rest is easy. All you have to do is fill the space between the cover and the last page with, say, 70,000 plus words that are going to delight your readers and keep their attention from first to last. And then do it again, and again and again. There is a reason why I love writing, but just as this moment it escapes me entirely\u2026\u2026.. ",
