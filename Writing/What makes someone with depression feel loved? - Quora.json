            "answer_text": "Honestly, consistency. As it can be a very confusing time where, regardless of the severity of the depression, the person will start questioning the loyalties of those around them, the best thing you can do is be consistent with how you treated them before. This will not only reduce stigma around it for that person, and actually make them more likely to talk to you, but it will also mean that in the midst of the chaos that they feel the world is like for them, they have something they can depend on. Don\u2019t get me wrong, depending on your relationship with the person, it can be very hard not to jump into a caregiver role and want to look after them like they are physically ill. It is far better for the person if you keep, say, inviting them to social events if you are their friend, than for you to give up on them - especially if you have never had depression and think they should just \u201cget over it\u201d or \u201cbe happy\u201d. If they say they don\u2019t want to come that day, that\u2019s fine, and tell them that, just invite them otherwise they\u2019ll feel ostracised which will only make things worse for them. Being a consistent friend or family member does not mean that you should neglect or reject their depression though. It can be a thing that you ask generally about \u201chow have you been today?\u201d but if they say \u201cfine\u201d just take their word for it. They will come to you when they are ready to talk more about it. The worst thing you can do is probe. If they do come to you about it, then normalise (telling them how normal it is to feel depressed - 1 in 4 of us are experiencing it at any one time) and acknowledge that it can be hard for some to talk about it. If you treat the person exactly the same as before you found out about the diagnosis, then you\u2019ll be playing your part. Their therapist should be the one concerned about how quickly they are recovering - it\u2019s your job to make it easier for the person to be by not making them feel any worse. Hope this helped! ",
