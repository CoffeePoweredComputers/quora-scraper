            "answer_text": "Concrete details are specific examples. If I were writing about dogs, for example, I could resort to a generalizations: Every kid should have a dog. A dog can be your best friend. and being a pet owner teaches responsibility. OR, I can use concrete examples : From the moment my brother laid eyes on the beagle pup, with her big brown eyes and floppy ears, he never felt alone. He ate with her, played with her and slept with her. A hyperactive kid who seemed to glory in the destruction of our toys and dolls, he was surprizingly gentle with the helpless puppy. She was totally dependent on him, and he never let her down. . . Hope that gives you some idea of the value of concrete examples. ",
