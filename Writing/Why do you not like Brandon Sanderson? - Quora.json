            "answer_text": "I read the Mistborn series on the recommendation of someone whose judgment in books I no longer trust (both for this recommendation and for other reasons). I attempted to read Way of Kings and sixty pages of that drivel put me in a black fury for the rest of the day. His books are just so disappointing: interesting ideas ruined by tired tropes, meandering, tedious writing, and insufferable characters. It\u2019s bad enough to suffer through the drone of his mind-numbingly irritating characters\u2019 thoughts and actions the first time through, but the pages and pages of \u201cdebrief\u201d explaining what they did, and why, and what they thought about it directly after you just read about them doing it are salt in the wound. As for the writing, I find Sanderson is a clever worldbuilder whose books would be a delight to read if you\u2019re the sort of person who likes to have plot points, character development, and interesting information explained to you in an obnoxiously smug and condescending manner over and over as if you\u2019re too thick to understand and too dim to remember from when he explained the same thing to you five pages ago. He is marvelously impressed with his own astounding amazingness and takes literally every opportunity to expound his cleverness to his reader, at length, ad nauseam (does ingesting metal let you use your magic powers? I\u2019m so glad you reminded me of this, since I must have forgotten the last hundred times you told me!). I wouldn\u2019t even mind this if the tedium of progressing through the plot didn\u2019t also make me want to weep with frustration. You could not pay me to read anything with his name on it ever again. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you're looking for something that is large in scale, has unique magic systems, has good character work, has a kinda good story - haven't completed stormlight yet - and you don't really care for the beauty of words then I would say it's good. Go for it. But if you're someone like me who likes great prose with amazing storyline, then please don't. I wouldn't say his writing is the worst but yeah it's not good as compared to the likes of Patrick Rothfuss, Martin, Ursula, Stephen King, Steven Erikson or JK Rowling. Sometimes all it does is it sends me into a frenzy of disappointment and frustration. I want to throw and burn the book after reading a chapter but then I remember how the story progresses and I keep it put for a little while longer. My brother is aspiring to become a writer and literally his prose is a hundred times better than Sanderson in Stormlight The way of kings. Sometimes he just seems to overuse words and at that, his sentences feel picked up straight from a Thesaurus. And another thing. The Way of Kings starts with a prelude that takes place 4500 years in the past. And in the last 4500 years there is not a reasonable amount of history in the world of Stromlight-ROSHAR. Some would say that it's because I've read just one book in the series, then really man, if it takes a book the size of The Way of Kings (1011 pages), with really terrible writing to go through it easily with a certain satisfaction, then Sanderson\u2019s not worth the fame that he is getting. ***Now don't take me for someone who doesn't like to challenge oneself with longer books with humongous scale. I love reading them. I've read Erikson and you\u2019d agree that his world is much humongous in scale and story than Sanderson. But the thing that drove me was his beautiful prose. And that is what I had expected with TWoK.*** That said, I don't want to judge him by a single book but yeah in regards to this book, these were my views, my preferences. ",
