            "answer_text": "To an extent, the role of \"voice\" varies depending on what kind of writing we're talking about. Essays? Journalism? Fiction? But the answer is basically the same: voice makes things more interesting for the reader. At some basic level, it tells the reader who you are and where you're coming from.  This doesn't have to be YOU, the writer; voice in fiction can be manipulated in all sorts of ways to create a compelling narrative, and many of them have nothing to do with expressing any sort of truth or anything at all about the writer himself (or herself).  But in personal essays, and blogging and that sort of thing, finding a voice that's true to you helps readers feel like they're connecting with a real person. One of my favorite voices is Jennifer Wiener, who writes what is sometimes called \"chick lit,\" and also contributes Op Eds to the NYT. She comes across as funny, sharp, honest and wise, and strikes me as someone with a lot of wit and intelligence. That's who she is in her \"essay voice.\" Her fiction is pretty light fare, so her use of voice in fiction is a little bit different than her use of voice for essays. In fiction, her characters can't be as wise as Jennifer Wiener herself, because otherwise they would never be clueless enough to fall into all the traps that characters in a good \"chick lit\" need to stumble into!  But even though her use of voice varies, you'd never think of her as someone who hadn't found an authentic voice. Nora Ephron is another example of a writer who moved across various media (she wrote for magazines and also wrote screenplays), but who had a really solid understanding of the importance of voice.    Anyway, bottom line, finding voice is just a way to make sure you're connecting with readers and showing them something that feels authentic.   ",

            "answer_text": "I was going to decline answering this one but I just needed to say that every single writer has a style and that style should be easily recognized if you have read enough from that person.  You are also able to tell if the writing is from a man, a woman, or other, as well as ascertaining the age of the writer.Understand writing in this fashion:  It is telepathic communication based on symbols strung together in the form of words that convey a particular message.When you read someone who is clear and concise, and has a way of turning a phrase or presenting an idea in an unique manner, this is the voice that is spoken about. After all these years of writing I would suppose I would have a \"voice\", and I am not totally certain that a \"voice\" is something one can construct, unless they are totally in tune with their own heart, mind and soul.As to \"why do you find your voice when writing,\" I am going to go out on the cliched limb and say that the \"voice\" finds the writer.
