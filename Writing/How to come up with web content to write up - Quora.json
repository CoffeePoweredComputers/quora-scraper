            "answer_text": "Content Writing is one field that is really filled with money and need to tap in the right way. All you need to do is be strict, disciplined and true towards the work. I started content writing on freelance basis. There are websites that you can get registered as writer and start with small work so that you get hang of it. Start with job search as there are many companies that solely work on content basis. Content writing can also get you into digital marketing as you can write for press releases and social media articles. In short, if you are new to this, then you have to create a profile for yourself so that you can get a permanent employment in this category. Being prepared and trained will help you land in better spectrum of content writing. So, here are seven essential skillsets that any good content writer needs to have and continue to hone over their career. 1. Adaptability This might seem obvious but I see a lot of content that falls flat because the tone and style doesn\u2019t fit the purpose of the piece or the culture of the brand. For example, a landing page should probably contain copy that is short and designed to persuade the reader to take an action. In contrast, a white paper will likely work best with more details to explain a more complex issue. In terms of tone, blog posts for a scientific equipment company targeting medical researchers will likely be much different from posts for an organic food shop targeting a wider range of health-conscious consumers. The more styles you can learn and the more quickly you can adapt, the more valuable you\u2019ll be as a content writer. 2. Researching your way to good content Good research is key for good content \u2013 it adds credibility and, most importantly, value. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to find trustworthy and interesting information from reliable sources online. Experts are especially great resources if you can effectively get the right information with good interviewing skills. 3. A good understanding of SEO Great content writers stay on top of SEO trends \u2013 after all, even the best content won\u2019t be effective if readers can\u2019t find it. It\u2019s important to know how to craft SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, use keywords effectively and keep up with Google\u2019s latest algorithm changes. 4. The ability to get focused Writing requires focus which can sometimes be hard to find. When it\u2019s time to work, get rid of distractions and focus on one task at a time. Sometimes to get the ball rolling, you can start with a few smaller, easy-to-complete tasks before launching into your larger projects. 5. Time management Your clients have deadlines they have to meet. Delivering high quality content in a timely manner will show that you are not only professional, but also reliable. This means good time management is essential to help you realistically determine how many jobs you are able to accept and reject and deliver it on time. If you find yourself struggling with time management, check out these 14 writing and productivity hacks. 6. Editing, editing and more editing A lot of writing is rewriting. First drafts are rarely perfect. Editing skills require patience, discipline and a good eye for detail. In addition to grammar, spelling and punctuation, look out for redundant points and overused words. And don\u2019t be surprised if you spend more time editing than writing. 7. Staying in demand You may be an excellent writer, but if you don\u2019t stay up-to-date with the latest trends, your job opportunities will be limited. Join writing and freelance communities, improve your online profiles, be comfortable with cold emailing, leverage different social platforms and market examples of your work. Maintaining an active presence on a few social platforms will not only make you more likely to get certain writing jobs, but you\u2019ll also make valuable contacts. Clients are always looking to boost their reach so if you can offer to share content with your network, they will have an added incentive to hire you. There\u2019s more to being a writer While it\u2019s important for a content writer to have a flair for the written word, it\u2019s only one piece of the puzzle. Research skills, SEO knowledge, adaptability and staying current are the ways to ensure that you continue to find success as a content writer. Take the time to continually develop these skills and you\u2019ll find yourself able to craft the kind of content that\u2019s both easy for readers to find, compelling to read and in demand. ",
