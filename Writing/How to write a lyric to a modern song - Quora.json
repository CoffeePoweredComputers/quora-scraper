            "answer_text": "Although I treat lyrics as the last step in the process, it is somewhat there in the beginning because I make up \"non-\" words alongside the melody and instruments playing in my head.   I've recorded a ton of different melody-word variations on my phone when the inspiration hits.  They all sound like I'm singing actual words on them, but they're really just \"murmurs\" that sound like they make sense when said in a sentence. One good example of a song I did in this fashion, was \"Undying\" -   It started out as a bunch of verse and chorus melodies with lyrics like - \"Erfin steep and nowry blue\", \"The cliers firing\", etc.  They were just words (and non-words mind you) I used to fill the melody.  In the final version they ended up as \"I heard your footsteps on the ground..\", \"The sun is shining...\" I do think however that I am limiting myself with this process in terms of writing a totally-out-of-this-world-but-still-universally-appealling-song .  I've learned of songwriters who started out with a poem, and wrote melody over it, and they were awesome. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the genre. Generally speaking try to find words that rhyme with fun, party, girl, beautiful and love. If it's a party song then aim your lyrics around topics such as: I like partying I've been partying for ages now and I'm still not sleepy Look at me and how different and crazy I am I like girls when I party Or if you are a girl: I am a princess... And so are you, and every other person. If your writing love lyrics for a ballad: Your not like other girls (but keep it non specific so that it applies to all girls) I like you because you are pretty I like you because you are smart I like you because you are pretty and smart  If it's a rap: You hate the police You hate the government The world is corrupt You love girls You have money and can afford to buy non essential items Hope that helps ",
