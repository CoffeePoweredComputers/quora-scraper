In the following, italicize the commas separating the emphasized words as well as the exclamation mark belonging to the third \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d, but do not italicize the exclamation mark at the end: She said, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t have another candy bar \u2014 you can\u2019t, can\u2019t, can\u2019t! have another candy bar!\u201dIn the following, italicize the second comma because it\u2019s part of the foreign phrase being used by the speaker, but do not italicize the final period, because it pertains to your quoting of the speaker, not to the italicized passage within her speech: When we arrived, the hostess insouciantly signaled the state of the cocktail party: \u201cHowdy, y\u2019all, and lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch\u2019entrate.\u201d",
