            "answer_text": "Components of a Successful Essay  1. Thesis:  an essay\u2019s main proposition. A thesis should not be confused with a topic, which represents only the subject area of an essay. A good thesis must be arguable; there must be intelligent ways to disagree with it. Arguability distinguishes a good thesis from a fact (clearly demonstrable in the text) or an observation (an interpretation so obvious that no intelligent reader would challenge it). Although writers often wish to delay announcement of the thesis, good academic writing generally states the thesis explicitly on the first page, then returns to a more nuanced and complex form of it later in the text. 2. Problem or Question:  the intellectual context inwhich your thesis matters. In academic essays, the problem usually arises from a current misunderstanding of an important issue. The author of an essay promises to clarify something that would otherwise remain obscured or mistaken. Establishing the problem or question is the primary role of an essay\u2019s first few paragraphs. If it doesn\u2019t promise to illuminate, deepen, or solve a problem, an essay risks irrelevance. 3. Evidence:  the material a writer works with in exploring a thesis. Evidence that has been overlooked or previously undiscovered may serve to prove a thesis. Frequently, however, academic writers re-examine evidence that others have looked at before, in which case the evidence is more likely to suggest or persuade readers that the writer\u2019s approach is a fruitful one. Since a good thesis must be arguable, academic writers are especially obligated to consider counter-evidence, to grapple directly with facts, patterns, or passages that resist or complicate the essay\u2019s main argument. Writers must orient readers to the source of the evidence, which must be cited. 4. Analysis & Reflection:  the work a writer does to turn evidence into argument, to show the reader how the evidence supports, develops, or extends the essay\u2019s thesis. Since a thesis must be arguable, no evidence in a good academic argument can speak for itself\u2014all of it must be processed by the writer. Typical moves of analysis are to highlight significant details of the evidence and to name patterns that might otherwise be undetected. When working with written evidence, it\u2019s good to observe the rule of two: the writer should supply at least two words of analysis for every word of a citation, and usually more. Analysis generally refers directly to the evidence (\u201cDescribing his actions with such words as \u2018growled\u2019 and \u2018stalked\u2019 suggests an underlying animal savagery\u201d), while reflection builds upon analysis to support larger claims (\u201cThis imagery seems to contradict thenarrator\u2019s stated assessment that Paul is a \u2018gentle soul\u2019\u201d). Other moves that indicate reflection are consideration of a counter-argument, definitions or refinements of terms and assumptions, and qualifications of previous claims. Reflection is important throughout an essay, but should be especially rich and full in between sections of the argument and in the essay\u2019s conclusion. 5. Structure:  how the sections of an essay are organized and stitched together. College essays are frequently organized either by repetition (where each paragraph develops evidence of the same proposition: \u201cX is clearly present\u201d) or by chronology (where evidence appears in the essay in the same order that it appears in the text): both of these patterns are inadequate. Sections of a good argument proceed in a logical way, but also develop the implications of a thesis more deeply as the essay progresses. The reader should understand how each new section extends the argument that\u2019s come before and prepares for the argument that\u2019s still to come. Reflective sentences at moments of transition often guide this review/preview, and complex essays frequently include 1-2 sentences of this type in their introductions. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many different kinds of essays. Some essays we could call pseudo-essays, or essays that are not genuine essays. These essays pretend to explore ideas but their length is so curtailed, so short, that they can only served the function of introducing and defining the more significant or obvious elements of any particular topic. These essays are usually around 250 or 300 words long. Other essays, ones on the other end of the spectrum, are destined for the desks of highly trained specialists in particular fields: lawyers, psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists in the soft sciences; chemists, and mathematicians, for example, in the hard sciences; and historians and literature experts, for example, in the humanities. These essays would necessarily use vocabulary of a highly specialized kind, only understandable to those in the field of study to which they are aimed. These essays can easily be four to ten pages in length. People on both ends of the spectrum (and those in between, like thoughtful high school and undergraduate students) ask themselves a number of questions that are quite similar. Does my topic address issues that are relevant? Have I defined my topic adequately? Have I been honest, fair, thoughtful, and unbiased in my discussion? And have I contributed to a discussion of a topic in a way that makes, even a layman, sit up and ask questions based on the ideas in my essay. In other words, is my essay worth the time and effort of sitting down and reading it. If all of these conditions are met, your essay is good. ",
