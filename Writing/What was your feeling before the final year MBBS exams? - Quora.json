            "answer_text": "3 days before the exam The first theory paper was Medicine and Allied Subjects Paper 1. You know the saying \u2018The calm before the storm'? Well those three days were precisely that. On the first day I spent an hour going through an existential crisis and wondering for the umpteenth time why,out of all the branches in the world, I chose MBBS. Having done that, I pulled myself together and made a time table for those 3 days. I put in a good 15 hours on day one. Then it was time to sleep. But my brain was in overdrive. Thoughts were racing through my head. \u201c Oh no! I forgot to read Lymphoma. It's an important question. I have to remember to read it tomorrow\u2026what were the ECG changes in pericardial effusion?..I need to look at that again\u2026..Did I remember to take my allergy medicine? Otherwise I'll get a sore throat\u2026Forget it,I'm not getting up now\u2026..I should stop thinking and try and go to sleep\u2026..pericardial effusion\u2026..remember to read Lymphoma\u2026.pericardial effusion\u2026what if they ask a brand new question that has never cone in previous years? Then I can't afford to leave that topic\u2026.pericardial effusion..ok that's enough! Stop thinking!\u201d Eventually I went to sleep. The next 2 days passed the same way. At the exam centre, it was utter chaos. I picked what I thought was a secluded spot. I don't like revising \u2018last minute\u2019 as I feel all jumbled up. So I was just sitting quietly and staring at nothing in particular. \u201cAnannya, did you read cardiomyopathy? It's really important.\u201d I hadn't read it but I knew enough from my previous preparation. And cardiomyopathy wasn't even an important question. It had been asked once 15 years ago. This type of person is the rumour spreader. I started to feel nervous and looked at the scene around me. Some were frantically turning pages. Then there were the loud mouths who recite things out loud. There are the busy bodies whose sole aim is to be panicked and make others panic. There are the know it alls who will recite any answer to you at top speed and make you feel dumb. Finally we were seated in the exam hall. Strangely I felt calm. I felt that I had prepared honestly and all I could do was my best. No point in being nervous and scared. Once the papers were distributed, I jumped into the \u2018storm'. After that each paper just keeps coming and you start taking it as it comes. But the bliss that you feel after the exams is just wonderful! ",
