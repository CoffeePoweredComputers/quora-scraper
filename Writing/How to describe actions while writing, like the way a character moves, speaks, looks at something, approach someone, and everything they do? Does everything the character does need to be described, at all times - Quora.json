            "answer_text": "Most things a character might do in the course of the story need never be shown. Only the things pertinent to the story. If, for example, your character is going to meet somebody important in the plot, you needn\u2019t explain how he gets out of bed, gets dressed, goes to the place where he meets somebody unless it is pertinent to the story. Let\u2019s say your character is going to meet his friend. It probably would not be necessary to say how he got up, got dressed etc. He would go to meet his friend. You could say something like, Charles waited on the corner, shuffling his feet and looking at his watch. No sign of George. That would indicate that he is impatiently waiting. You would not say, Charles was impatient because George was late because the reader likes to see what Charles is doing and imagine his motives for himself. Now let\u2019s assume that Charles is going to meet his future in-laws. You wouldn\u2019t need to say how he took the train, got off at the stop, walked up the road to their house because that is boring and not pertinent to the story. However, you might say, Charles thumbed through his collection of ties over and over again. Maybe the red one, no the blue one would probably be OK. He thought about buying his future mother-in law some flowers, he could call in at the flower shop on the way to their house. He stopped. What on earth should he buy? Did she like daffs, or maybe chrysanthemums? He chewed his lip, and felt a queasiness in his stomach. He considered all these options, then decided it might be better to get her a box of chocolates. Now the reader knows, without saying anything, that Charles is really nervous about meeting his in-laws. What do you say when he gets to his in-laws house? Charles stood on the door step, but was hesitant to knock too loudly. Then on the other hand, he wanted to be heard. He needn\u2019t have worried because his future father-in-law opened the door and asked him to come in. Charles rushed forward, hand extended, and said, \u2018I am so pleased to meet you, Sir\u2019. His father-in-law jumped back, alarmed, and Charles could feel the blood rushing to his face. Now we know that in his nervousness to make a good impression on the in-laws Charles has made a complete buffoon of himself , without telling the reader anything. And so on. If you remember the old adage SHOW DON\u2019T TELL you can\u2019t go wrong. (I have treated this as a first draft, so would need to go back and edited it several times if it was my story). ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not everything the character does needs to be described at all times. You want to show details that are important to plot, to mood, to the feel of the character and character\u2019s attitude. You don\u2019t just include details for the sake of it. Think about the way you tell a story to a friend, you have a purpose to the parts you tell and leave out the boring parts. Also, in novel writing, beginners are told to show don\u2019t tell and that\u2019s good advice for a beginner, but as you progress, sometimes \u201ctelling\u201d is not just okay, but preferable. Exposition is useful if the writer is trying to, for example, convey necessary information that just isn\u2019t scene worthy - or transition through time periods. ",
