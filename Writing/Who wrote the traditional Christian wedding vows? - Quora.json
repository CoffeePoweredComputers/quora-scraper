            "answer_text": "I believe OP is referring to the traditional wedding ceremony that says, in effect: \"I, _____, take thee, _____, to be my wedded Husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to . . . Wiki, stated the ceremony may be from Book of Common Prayer, by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury: the manuals of the medieval church. Also that in England, there were manuals from the dioceses of Salisbury and York. The compilers of the first Book of Common Prayer, published in 1549, based its marriage service mainly on the Sarum manual. As an officiant, traditional ceremony or a variant is requested in about 12% of my couples. Now, church weddings, may use the traditional\u2019s more often. The trend in Austin Texas, appears to be away from traditional to more unique and personalized ceremonies. Discuss with your officiant, their willingness to have a custom ceremony. Always discuss your wants prior to choosing an officiant.  Areas of concern may be the ceremony, photographers and videographers, music, clothing of officiant and guests. Time, date and place of the wedding and rehearsal, receptions and availability to answer questions or to help with a concern. Most professional officiants will be good with your concerns. Oh! There is this. Feel like you connect, with your officiant as the ceremony and it\u2019s performance can make or break the entire wedding. Whatever you do, solemn and romantic and fun. Take good Care . . . ",
