            "answer_text": "Here are a few tips on improving employee performance:1. Make the goals very clear and measurable. For example, \"Increase sales\" is not a measurable goal. If you change that to \"Increase sales 20% by the fourth quarter,\" then the employees have a clear idea of what needs to be done. 2. Make sure every employee knows what his or her role in achieving this goal is. Using the example above, give each sales rep or account executive a sales revenue goal, and then a stretch goal. If they hit the first goal, they might get their regular commission. If they hit the stretch goal, they should receive something extra, such as a cash bonus, or in some cases, a trip or other incentive. When people see exactly where the finish line is and see their way to it, they are much more likely to reach it. If there is a reward there, even better. 3. Recognize good performance. When your employees do reach that finish line, make sure they get recognized, whether it's a simple \"great job\" face-to-face or a company-wide email. There are also many software platforms that provide things like leaderboards and badging, social recognition in the form of encouraging posts, or even monetary rewards for achieving goals. All employees will be more motivated if they truly feel like they can make an impact on your company's performance. If they can actually see how their performance is moving the needle, they will go that extra mile.

            "answer_text": "The 3M Company encourages creativity from its employees. The company allows its researchers to spend 15% of their time on any project that interests them. This attitude has brought fantastic benefits not only to the employees but to the 3M Company itself Many times, a spark of an idea turned into a successful product has boosted 3M's profits tremendously. Some years ago, a scientist in 3M's commercial office took advantage of this 15% creative time. This scientist, Art Fry, came up with an idea for one of 3M's best-selling products. It seems that Art Fry dealt with a small irritation every Sunday as he sang in the church choir. After marking his pages in the hymnal with small bits of paper, the small pieces would invariably fall out all over the floor. Suddenly, an idea struck Fry. He remembered an adhesive developed by a colleague that everyone thought was a failure because it did not stick very well. \"I coated the adhesive on a paper sample,\" Fry recalls, \"and I found that it was not only a good bookmark, but it was great for writing notes. It will stay in place as long as you want it to, and then you can remove it without damage.\"  Yes, Art Fry hit the jackpot. The resulting product was called Post-it! and has become one of 3M's most successful office products. Source: Internet ",
