            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Both writers have styles that never go out of style so, in that way, writing like them is always a good idea. But today\u2019s readers want fast-moving plots and offhand I can\u2019t think of any writers of past times that write in that particular way. A better way of looking at style is to sort of copy their style \u2014 writers do copy other writers \u2014 while at the same time keeping in mind that your story should move quickly. One last note: even if you deliberately try to copy another writer, you won\u2019t, because your own individual way of thinking and writing will creep in and the result will be uniquely your own. That\u2019s a good thing because, copying great writers while putting your own stamp on your work is what will make your writing stand out from all others. ",

            "answer_text": "Imitations of Hemingway\u2019s style grew so pervasive that a parody contest was started: Also known as \"The Bad Hemingway Contest,\" The International Imitation Hemingway Competition is an annual writing competition begun in Century City, California. Started in 1977 as a \"promotional gag\", and held fsor nearly thirty years, the contest pays mock homage to Ernest Hemingway by encouraging authors to submit a 'really good page of really bad Hemingway' in a Hemingway-esque style. International Imitation Hemingway Competition - Wikipedia My advice is to read Hemingway and Fitzgerald and absorb their styles while trying to separate the wheat from the chaff. Do the same with as many other writers as you can as you seek your own style. Become yourself as a writer and follow your muse wherever it takes you. You can learn by imitating in literature, music and other arts just don\u2019t try and call it your own. Incorporate, move on and grow. ",
