            "answer_text": "The right side of the brain, like the left side, is always active. It\u2019s true that the right hemisphere predominantly controls the left side of the body, so that using the left hand will cause activation of the motor areas of the right hemisphere. But contrary to myths, individual differences in personality and abilities are not caused by being \u2018right-brained\u2019 or \u2018left-brained\u2019. Writing with the left hand may improve the motor skills that you have practiced, but it won\u2019t influence your abilities otherwise. ",
