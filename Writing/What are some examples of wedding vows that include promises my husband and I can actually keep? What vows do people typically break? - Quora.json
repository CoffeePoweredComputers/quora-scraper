            "answer_text": "In my first ceremony, in 1976, neither of us vowed obedience to the other. A vow of obedience is one that is difficult to keep. However, the fact that I refer to it as my first should give you a hint how well that worked. I will only say that it was that lack to which I personally attribute the ultimate dissolution of the relationship. The actual loser in that situation was my son, to my eternal shame. In 1996, my second wife and I had our wedding, her first at 44, me at 41. The judge who performed the wedding was a wonderful, tiny lady who asked if we would be writing our own vows or would use the \u201cstandard\" set. We told her that the normal set was fine, then, without discussion, I told both the judge and my fianc\u00e9 that I would be taking the second set. Both ladies' eyebrows headed towards the ceiling in unison. Without having told Andrea beforehand, I had determined not to make the same mistake twice. Here's how I exlained my decision then, and it stands to this day. In any relationship between two people there will inevitably arise situations where the couple disagree, and there is neither compromise nor resolution available. It is a tie, but the tie must not, nor can it, stand as the final result. The traditional vows assume the husband will break the tie, as he does in my friend, Vicki Pickering's relationship. For Andrea and I, that was not a solution available. Andrea, whom I have loved to distraction, is a wonderful but ultimately a very controlled and controlling person. I knew that for certain, as I had spent 18 months working for her as her Chief of Staff on a complex and nerve racking project. At the point in her life we met and came to love each other I knew that it was both unreasonable for me to expect her to change, and beyond her to do so. Even if she gave a vow of obedience, it would be beyond her to live it when the crunch came. It could only come from me. Thus my decision, and its delivery. I gave her no time to try to talk my out of it. So, on the 29th of November, 1996, we surprised our gathered families when Andrea took her vows first, and the second set I took included the words \u201cand obey.\u201d I have lived that vow, not as Vicki Pickering does, but in a more traditional sense, every day since given, and it has served us well. The best example is our home. When we married, Andy had bought a wonderful 2,800 square foot home in Lakewood, Ohio less than two blocks south of Erie's shore on a lot so small I could cut the grass in 20 minutes after work, including a change of clothes. It was close enough to my ex that our shared custody worked well for us, and my son. Two years later, shared custody had broken diwn, but my son had graduated from High School, and was off to college. We no longer needed to be close to his mom, and my Ukrainian wife caught a bad case of land fever, common in those of her roots. She started dragging me to open houses. Three acres and up, which meant that we were moving out of town. She learned to inspect the basements for her husband's nonnegotiable requirement, a home for his railroad. Then, since I was working full time, and she had left the workforce, she had taken to looking during the week. When I got a call at work telling me she'd found the perfect place, I knew the inevitable outcome. When I saw it, I had to admit that absent the finishing of the basement, it would make a fine roof over my railroad room. When I had expressed my reservations about 5 acres and country living in Medina, Ohio, she made the call. If you have read my profile, you know the call she made. For the last 20 years, we have lived with about 3 1/2 acres of woods and ravines, and 1 1/2 acres of country lawn (green = cut it, brown = cut around it, grass semi-optional). I have come to love my woods, creeks and hills. My barn became the temporary home to a mobile model railroad layout, that I and some friends had taken over from a club that had lost their home. Not an uncommon occurrence, but we saved the layout and all the work which had gone into it, an uncommon outcome. My time in the country is coming to an end, as many here know. When Andrea's cancer takes her from me, the plan is to sell the place, take the proceeds and move closer to my son and DIL, both for their support as I age, and to support them as they adopt a young boy named Logan. But she was right, despite my objections, and I am both glad and proud that when she decided, my response was an absolutely appropriate, \u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d When Andrea leaves me on my own, I shall take no small measure of solice in the fact that I have lived my vows exactly as given, including the last one. I obeyed as and when it was required. Even when I loved our Lakewood home, and had no desire to leave it. Even though I hated cutting grass, and the thought of clearing snow from 500\u2032 of drive induced some small measure of fear. Her decision has left me with a new appreciation for the land, a new understanding of its cycles and moods, and a quiet love for my stewardship of this small piece of my Earth. It is my reward for this promise: I, Jeffrey Pinner, take thee, Andrea Johanns, to be my wedded Wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, cherish, and to obey, till death us do part. Thank you, my love. Promise freely given, scrupulously kept, and sorrowfully outlived. Note to the folks who read the early draft of this, published by accident: I hope you'll read it as finished, and taking back your upvotes as you see fit is not an insult. I appreciate the support for an unfinished draft, even if you dislike the finished product. ",
