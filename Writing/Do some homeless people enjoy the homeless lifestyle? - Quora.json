            "answer_text": "In my experience I would say there are some that choose it, and many that don\u2019t exactly \u201cchoose\u201d it, by default end up choosing it by life choices, etc. Sadly I have not had too many experiences helping people that have ended successfully, but have had a few. I have worked with many homeless over the years, in different capacities. My first real experience was as a young pastors wife. I was all of 20 years old. A family came to the church looking for help, and I went to our board and asked for more assistance than our normal, which was a few food vouchers, vouchers for a hotel for 3 nights, and some bags of food. This was a mom, dad, three children, and mom was pregnant. They had traveled several states, and they were out of money, and car was broken down. Dad seemed willing to work. Mom was clearly not 100% with it mentally, but cleared loved her children. She received social security due to her handicap, but had not been receiving it due to having no address. Our group took special offerings, collected enough money to set them up in an apartment, nothing fancy, but not roach infested. We put down first and last, set up all their utilities, groceries, etc. People donated everything to set up household, furniture, bedding, kitchen, some men in our church repaired their car. Mom especially was thrilled, even though everything was used and mis-matched, it was the nicest she had ever had. I was helping them daily get things organized, set up, doing shopping, taking her to a doctor, getting her social security disability payments set up so she could receive. We found the dad some day work, just families hiring him for yard work, etc, and trying to help him find a permanent job. We did not hand them the money, but took them shopping when they needed things. This bothered them, you could tell they wanted to have control of the money. They knew we had not spent all we collected. We told them we planned to pay the second months rent, but they would need to be prepared by the next month to pay their rent and utilities, which was a reasonable expectation. We stressed they needed to be saving what money they had coming in for that. Mom was keeping the apartment up. She had never really learned to cook, so I was helping teaching her some cooking skills. She could not really read, so recipes were difficult. We spent time working on budgeting, and how to determine what they would need to save to pay for rent and utilities, etc. We were wrapping things up with the family as my husband and I were moving soon, and someone else was going to be taking over helping the family. They were becoming a bit more independent each day. I had been assisting daily, and my husband and I took a day off to go to Disneyland before we moved. I made sure they had what they needed for the day, telling them we wouldn\u2019t be by that day. The next thing we knew, they were calling the church and claiming that we took \u201ctheir\u201d money and went to Disneyland!! Of course they knew we had not, and calmed them down. Fast forward husband and I moved to another state, and another church member took over overseeing the family. The husband got a full time job, and things appeared to be going okay. Of course once they were making their own money, we had no say so over that, but they were encouraged to be sure to put away for the upcoming rent and utilities. As time went on, they were no longer having daily help, but mom would come by for help getting to drs. appointments, etc, while dad was working, and they were still being given some groceries to help out. Sad to say, I get a phone call about a month later. They never paid the 3rd months rent, instead using the last month that we had paid. The local liquor store let the dad run a \u201ctab\u201d, and he rang up quite a beer bill. By the fourth month when next rent was due, they had skipped town, leaving a trashed apartment full of beer cans, trash, and a big mess. They took whatever they could fit in the car. It was so terribly sad, as I\u2019m sure it was the first chance this mom would ever have to have a home for her family. I really felt like it was a family that we could help and make a difference in their lives, and maybe break the cycle, but unfortunately they were unable to make the changes needed to change things. So while they would probably say they didn\u2019t \u201cchose\u201d homelessness, their lack of discipline, choices they made, addictions, and disabilities all played a part in their choices. ",

            "answer_text": "Melinda's answer hits the nail on the head as always, and I think I add only a little perspective from personal experience. Enjoy is generally the wrong word for the way the homeless feel about their lives, but there is a real sense of pride and dignity attached to it. Being homeless is terribly hard and those who have the strength to endure it with dignity have reason to be proud of it. A few years ago I was doing some volunteer work for the homeless outreach program at my father's church. One winter night the temperature in New York was dropping down to around 0\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a local church turned their auditorium into a makeshift shelter for the night with cots and blankets. I helped go around to try to convince any homeless people to come in for the night, for their own safety as much as anything else. When it gets that cold, frostbite and hypothermia become serious and pronounced risks for those on the street. When I set out, I knew that I might face some level of resistance from the people I was trying to help. Many who are homeless have been abused and mistreated in the past and I was aware that they might not trust that my intentions were pure. I had a whole speech ready about how we would absolutely not charge them any money, take anything from them, or force them to do anything against their will. Many didn't need such convincing and were instantly grateful for the offer. Others were very skeptical, but managed to be convinced. Then there was Lawrence. I had met Lawrence a couple years previous while busking in Central Park. He had been very friendly and had sat and sung a few songs with me on that occasion. He had a beautiful tenor that worked really well with my baritone voice. When he left, he\u2019d refused my offer that he take some of the money I had made while he was singing with me, instead insisting that he put a dollar in my case. (As a street/subway performer in New York, it is amazing how common this is. Homeless people frequently give me donations despite the fact that I normally play in a tie and often have a sign saying that I am employed and not at all desperate. I have learned to just say thank you and accept it.) I had seen Lawrence several times since and he always greeted me with a smile. On the frigid night in question, I was very happy to find him. He had constructed a cardboard wall to protect his spot from the wind and he was only wearing a sweatshirt with a blazer over it and jeans. I was certain that he'd accept, given the fact that we had a previous relationship and that he was so ill-equipped to make it through the night. I was wrong. He greeted me by name and with a smile as he always did. I will never forget that conversation and I will try to convey his exact words in bold. I informed him that I had a free place to spend the night inside and that it came with two complimentary meals and a shower as well. With a big smile he just said, \u201cNaw man, I\u2019m good. That's really nice of you to offer, though. Thanks.\u201d I think my face must have shown how confused I was. I went into my whole spiel about how I wasn't trying to take anything and all that. He simply replied, \u201cThanks but I\u2019m okay. I've been cold before. I'll make it through this.\u201d I asked if there was anything I could do to prove my good intentions. I also asked if he remembered having sung with me previously. \u201cOf course I remember, Tom.\u201d He then proceeded to sing the chorus of \u201cAin't No Sunshine\u201d, one of the songs we had sung together. \u201cI know you ain't trying to do nothing, but I'm alright out here. I don't have much but what I have, I earned. I never begged for nothin\u2019 and I ain't planning to now.\u201d I asserted that this was not begging but rather I was making an offer to a friend and there was nothing pathetic about accepting a gift. I reminded him that I had accepted his dollar before and that, if anything, I owed him one. \u201cNo, you earned that dollar. I ain't earned what you're trying to give me. All I got in this world is my dignity and this corner of the sidewalk. Won't never be cold enough for me to give that up.\u201d I continued to explain that there was nothing undignified about accepting help but I realized that it was futile. I had a couple blankets in the car and insisted that he take one, but he refused saying that he had one already. Even after my insistence that this would be a \u201ctwo-blanket kind of night\u201d, he still politely refused, smiling all the time. Lawrence was stubborn as shit. I finally left the blanket folded near him and said that if he knew anyone who needed it he make sure they got it, and he was willing to agree to that. That experience taught me a lot about the homeless. Anyone who says they're all just lazy and looking for a handout has never taken the time to interact with them much. Enjoy is the wrong word, but many homeless are proud to have the strength to endure their daily struggles. They often have a great deal of dignity and a serious moral code. I hope this helps you to understand them a little bit better. ",

            "answer_text": "I see that the question has been changed since I answered it. I did not answer a question so stupid as to ask whether homeless people enjoy being homeless; I answered a question asking why homeless people would refuse assistance. Most homeless people don\u2019t choose to be homeless. Even addicts, who allow their addiction to override everything else in their lives including preventing a descent into homelessness would probably rather have a real home than to be sleeping outside or in a homeless shelter. But do they refuse assistance? They don\u2019t refuse assistance without good reasons. Often the so-called assistance comes at a cost. Staying in a shelter means they must share a room with dozens of other homeless people and risk being robbed while they sleep - if they can sleep with 30 other nearby people snoring, farting, talking to themselves. To stay in that shelter, they may have to put themselves in a sleazy part of town (because shelters aren\u2019t in nice, safe neighborhoods) near nighttime with no guarantee that they will get a bed. They may have to turn in their personal possessions for \u201csafekeeping.\u201d They may be expected to shower in the same room as others, giving up their privacy. They may be charged money to sleep in these places. They will be locked in all night, and they\u2019ll have to leave at daybreak. Then they\u2019re stuck in the same crappy area all day unless they walk a far distance to get to a better neighborhood. When night comes, they\u2019ll only have to walk back again. Some communities require staying at a shelter before they will provide any services at all to a homeless person. Someone unwilling to do this won\u2019t be referred to transitional housing, won\u2019t be helped to get on waiting lists for public housing, etc. Most people and places offer food. Of course, homeless people have nowhere to store and cook food, so they can\u2019t carry much with them, and what they do carry needs to be edible without refrigeration and cooking. Food offered isn\u2019t always of the highest quality, and when a person needs a shower or just a place to lie down, food isn\u2019t a substitute for that. What else are homeless people offered that they might not accept? Younger women might be offered a place to stay - in exchange for sexual favors. Or that might not be explicitly stated, but since such offers generally come from men, they risk rape and abuse for going off with them. Religious salvation is another \u201coffer.\u201d This certainly occasionally gives comfort and hope to someone, but it\u2019s not a place to sleep, a shower, a change of clothes. Help getting government benefits is another one. You\u2019d think a homeless person would want money for disability, food stamps, Medicaid, but some are definitely on the run, avoiding criminal charges and maybe collectors or their families. Underage teens are an example of this last one. And often the things offered aren\u2019t in good condition. Yes, there\u2019s a room or an apartment, but it\u2019s infested with roaches, bedbugs, mice. Yes, there are donated clothes, but they\u2019re in poor condition and may not fit properly. Yes, there are free government cell phones, but to get one you must give your personal information to someone overseas and who knows if your calls are monitored? (They may not be, but someone may be paranoid about this or may have a legitimate fear.) I\u2019m not saying people should refuse assistance, but usually when people do, it\u2019s for a good reason.

            "answer_text": "Do some homeless people enjoy the homeless lifestyle? Found this question via Julia Pugliese's answer to What was your biggest \u201cI never thought of it in that way before!\u201d moment? (Thanks to Melinda for your help in correcting the link to Julia\u2019s answer!) Originally I posted a long, too long!, comment to Julia\u2019s reply, but then thought perhaps I had relevant thoughts to answer this question, \u201cDo some homeless people enjoy the homeless lifestyle?\u201d (EDIT: initially I intended to excerpt the bulk of my comment here, but decided to just go with freshly written reply, instead.) Here goes!  My background and understanding of homeless people is based on a combination of past volunteer work with clients of various homeless services organizations plus having an extended social circle that included several different individuals who struggled with various combinations of drug addiction, incarceration, poverty, (severe and untreated) mental illness, as well as homelessness. What I write here is primarily on my personal experiences and relationships, however limited and relevant. The short answer is that none of the homeless persons I\u2019ve dealt with enjoy homelessness. It may appear that some may seem comfortable, or confident in their homeless state. For the most part, the sense of being comfortable for those who are chronically homeless, it is a mental and emotional adaptive change that is an indication they are coping to homelessness. Being (or at least appearing) confident is an inherently important survival tactic, if not necessarily conscious and deliberate in some situations; homeless persons that are clearly anxious or unstable can become easy prey to violent and malicious predators, as well as strangers in general who perceive homeless persons with poor attitudes. A tangential issue that I think is an assumption made by the initial question: do homeless individuals deliberately choose to be homeless? Given an option, most all homeless would not be homeless, but it is the least heinous choice based on whatever seeming options they may have. What have been the options of some of the people I\u2019ve known? Typically their options are: Public Shelters - typically overcrowded and well-reputed to be poorly supervised and dangerous. Even if someone can get a bed, they are run not much better than a jail at times and any (perceived or actual) infraction can have a shelter resident kicked out.Hospitalization - whether for psychiatric, or medical condition. Our public hospitals and emergency rooms are typically overcrowded and booked and are well-known for turning away - especially indigent people with no medical insurance (typical for homeless, poor, or disenfranchised) excerpt for truly immediate and life-threatening conditions and, even then, often well be released prematurely to supposedly \u201cat home care\u201d for longer-term treatment etc.; an option a homeless person does not have.Jail - not really a feasible option at all and an absolutely stupid one for anyone who has no idea what jail really is like.Family, if they have any - often they have left abusive families for a reason; if they were young and still living with their parents or caretakers, often they may have been abused (physical, mental, sexual, or often a combination), or thrown out. If they were adults themselves, typically an adult woman that is married, or had a long-term partner, they were sometimes a domestic violence victim and they escaped/ran away to survive.For some additional background about homeless people. Many people who don\u2019t really know or think about homeless issues may not realize how sadly democratic the homeless population is. Homeless people don\u2019t just include young, able-bodied men. Homeless people include elderly men, elderly women, single women, full families INCLUDING even children and infants, disabled persons, and various different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Some excerpts from our local NYC Coalition for the Homeless website Basic Facts About Homelessness: New York City - Coalition For The Homeless In September 2016, there were 61,931 homeless people, including 15,691 homeless families with 24,148 homeless children, sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system. Families comprise just over three-quarters of the homeless shelter population. Based on this, a full 39% of the current NYC homeless population are CHILDREN. One question I can\u2019t even attempt to answer is \u201cwhy is there such a large homeless problem and what can we do about it?\u201d There are so many contributing factors, causes, and issues involved and I frequently still puzzle over the dilemma, this crisis, of homelessness. The plight of the homeless is real, worse than most people can imagine (or understand, including me), and much more horrific at multiple emotional and mental levels than most can accept, at least in the beginning.  ADDED. This from comment to Melinda\u2019s answer, but I think it is relevant point to include about why some homeless people seem to be \u201cproud\u201d about being homeless. Excerpted from my original comment. To be clear, they weren\u2019t proud about suffering as such, but proud about being able to withstand it and become a survivor, a.k.a. somewhat like the old cliche, \u201cwhat doesn\u2019t kill you, makes you stronger.\u201d It makes them tough, they develop street instincts, hone their sense of alertness and awareness, just generally learn to adapt fast.

She stayed with me most of that day. I was there for a reunion and she came along with me. Afterward, she said good bye and went away in her car. A few days later I got a phone call that this \u201chomeless\u201d woman would be moving to my town and could she stay with me a few days until her place was ready. I explained that my house wasn\u2019t ready for visitors (still recovering from tornado damage). She decided she could stay in my driveway in her car. It was more than a week before the call came that her place was ready. In the mean time she decided to \u201chelp\u201d me by cutting down my historic plants, and running water under my front porch (mold). I was irked that she was killing so many of my plants. She did get a job but it lasted only a few days and she quit. She claimed she was being harassed by the other workers. She got another job, but complained that the police were following her. She was fired after the first week for \u2018making mountains out of mole hills\u2019. She complained that the people in the trailer court where she had been placed were \u201clooking at\u201d her. I had been there- I didn\u2019t get that impression. Then she said she had to leave because the person in the home service office had given her husband her telephone number. In the mean time she asked me for money \u2014a car payment , a new cell phone card. Then she was gone. She didn\u2019t repay the money. A few weeks later I noticed a front window was open. She had been in my house. She left things I recognized that the home service supervisor had given her: pajamas from the recycle shop, flip flops. I slowly noticed that things were missing. An arrowhead that my brother had made before he was killed. A finial was pryed off an antique secretary. And my first edition copy of The Origin of Species had been thrown on the floor with a pile of human feces on it. Other things were broken \u2014as if she had fallen down over them. And there were books that weren\u2019t mine. They were mostly bible stories. Are there people who want to be homeless?. There are people who know the homeless game. They know how to play you so you will help them out \u2014 get them a place to live. Steal what you have so they can re=sell it. She as much as told me that she didn\u2019t mind trading sex for dinner and a good night\u2019\u2019s sleep. For some people, homeless is just a game. She was looking for a \u201cfisherman\u201d who would be a good target. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I have been homeless for a better part of the the last 35 years. Why? Experienced homelessness for the first time in 1970, and 4 or 5 times from then, on until 1977. Watched my mother suffer a mental crisis on multiple occasions. The first one caused me and my brothers to be placed in the county juvenile detention facility. Was placed in foster care, and ended up attending over 20 schools from kindergarten up until half way through the 11th grade. (Have names, addresses and phone numbers of all the schools). Anyway, watching what society and the status quo did to my mother (she died shortly after her 59th birthday). Having practical experience of how things like minimum wage can and does lead to homelessness. Well, to make an exceedingly long story short, I chose to be homeless. Why? Excellent question. Here's some of the reasons: Don't have to be stressed about not being able to pay rent. Won't be evicted. Never have to be concerned about home invasion. Won't lose anything in a fire, not worried about having anything of value stolen from me (I have crappy stuff). ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard it said often that this is true, but I just don\u2019t know. My grandson was involved in a study of homeless teens in our area while in college and it turned out that something like 96% of them DID have homes to go to, but preferred the streets because they didn\u2019t have to deal with parental rules. Who knows the validity of that study\u2026it wasn\u2019t a huge study. I frequently help a homeless man who lives in our area. I started seeing him on the streets more than 10 years ago. Sometimes he looks as if he hasn\u2019t seen a bath in years, but other times he has a fresh haircut, clean clothes and appears to have bathed. I\u2019ve learned over time that he has parents who want him to live with them, but he can\u2019t handle the idea of being cooped up in a house and prefers the streets. I assume the times he appears cleaned up is when his parents are able to convince him to come home and get cleaned up. I\u2019ve also learned that, when he was young, he basically fried his brains on drugs, and really isn\u2019t capable of doing much except sit on a street corner holding a cardboard sign. There have been investigations done in our area of people who stand on street corners and hold signs saying they are homeless and asking for help. They found out that for a large number of these people, this is their employment. They receive donations from people who feel sorry for them but go back to their homes at night knowing they just \u201cearned\u201d enough to support themselves for the day and didn\u2019t have to pay taxes. It seems this is a chosen lifestyle for these people. Because of situations like this, I find it very hard to know how many are actually homeless\u2026and how many are actually in need. It saddens my heart to see someone who looks down and out, BUT I can\u2019t afford to help someone who is scamming me\u2026and those scammers prevent people in real need from getting help. I know drugs and alcohol and mental illness are reasons many people are on the streets, so I think we need to re-institute mental institutions for these people. Not old-style mental institutions where they\u2019re just housed, but places where they are cared for, given drug/alcohol-addition treatment, given the right medications to deal with their mental illness, counseling, and perhaps trained for jobs. Homelessness is such a complicated situation, and frankly, I think it requires a case by case investigation to see what can be done to help the individual. ",

            "answer_text": "There actually ARE persons like that. I don\u2019t know if it is MANY. But the few who are definitely like that, are often very visible to everyone. and known to everybody in the area. The reason why they are known about is people know them. Often they have been offered help already and have turned it down. So that is how people know their names. The \u201cLady of Monte Vista\u201d comes to mind. If you live in Albuquerque you might have heard of her. Because she is like a local legend. She slept on my father's lawn for 10 years. In the winter she slept covered in snow. When it snowed. And she is definitely mentally ill. Hers is not a case of drugs. Once they did haul her in and did a fingerprint scan and she remains unidentified. Definitely no criminal history. It is believed she was raped a lot when a child and is therefore really uncomfortable being behind four walls of any sort. She might associate four walls and a roof with all kinds of horror. That is speculation. The city actually gave her a free apartment. But she left it in 3 days. She is definitely one who doesn\u2019t want help. I mean she will take handouts and stuff but won\u2019t move indoors. And it is not for lack of trying either. She\u2019s got a grip of persons from various walks of life including professionals chasing her down trying to give her more blankets and offers to move to a better climate etc. Now you do have to realize this is a case of mental illness, not drugs. She\u2019d probably rather die then live a standard life, and if people stopped helping she probably WOULD die. It\u2019s not like if they stopped helping she\u2019d finally go to rehab or something like that. So people help. God bless those people If you are reading this and you are one of those people and you for some reason googled \u201cLady of Monte Vista\u201d God Bless you. ",

            "answer_text": "No, most people do not choose to be homeless. Believe me it was not a choice for me or anyone I have met on the streets. Catastrophic events in peoples lives. That is what causes homelessness. Loss of a job. The average person is not prepared with savings and resources to maintain their current living conditions for more than one or two months. The majority of working class people live paycheck to paycheck. Unemployment insurance usually takes a month to begin, if you are found eligible. Even then it wont be enough to pay your bills and you will be lucky if your landlord will work with you.. Medical problems for you or one of your family. Watch the movie \u201cQ\u201d and you will see how quickly you will be faced with losing everything. Say you are on welfare get money for housing. Your landlord dies and the building is up for sale. You have to get out. The amount of time is not enough for you to find a place that will offer you the same arrangement. You too are on the street. Mental health issues? Your family set you up with a motel room and meds after your last hospital stay. Within the first two days you are robbed of everything even your id and meds. There is no inpatient hospital to go to and your meds will not be replaced. ",

She didn\u2019t infringe upon the hospitality of her friends, and she didn\u2019t go back to her abusive father with her tail between her legs. She didn\u2019t like having to sleep on the streets, but it was the best option available. This requires a great deal of pride, and I doubt the phenomenon is common, but it happens. When it does happen, it\u2019s almost certainly among people who are only on the streets for a short period of time. Being homeless sucks. Having a character that can be brave in the face of that is admirable, but there\u2019s not anything to enjoy in the experience. The only reason anyone seeks it out is if their situation is so bad that sleeping on a park bench sounds like a better idea in comparison. That involves some pretty severe misfortune no matter how you assess the situation. No one should ever have to make that choice, despite the fact that some people do. ",

Some days I was a scout looking for new places to sleep any place that may throw out food for my crew to eat. Other days I was keeping tabs on who was in the community using my friendly style to talk to them and my lack of drama to get them to trust me and where they were and if they had any new tips they picked up in their own adventures. I felt satisfied pretty much every day never alone usually had someone watching my back as much as I watched theirs. I was trusted and counted on liked and respected at times even. Ya I did enjoy that and I miss it to this day. I did more then that I have ever since. I really feel close to the story that Tom wrote about the man he knew. I had a great deal of pride in myself for surviving every day and felt powerful and smart knowing what to do and where to go at nearly any time. Lawrence is such a good man and he was able to explain what I struggle now. \u201cI know you ain't trying to do nothing, but I'm alright out here. I don't have much but what I have, I earned. I never begged for nothin\u2019 and I ain't planning to now.\u201d ",

I have met very few that wanted to be homeless. For nearly all it wasn\u2019t a choice. Of those few that didn\u2019t want to find a place the reasons primarily revolved around a few causes. The most common was that they just couldn't adapt to living in an environment where they had to follow rules. A couple were vets with PTSD and had resigned themselves to avoiding people at nearly all cost. Another was a guy in his late 20\u2019s from a wealthy family who resented his family and all the trappings of wealth that her grew up with. He lived in stairwells, laundry rooms, hallways, etc and was a general nuisance. His family tried to reach out to him from time to time but he continually refused any help. I never met a woman that voluntarily lived in the streets. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t happen, just that I\u2019ve never met any. ",

I had to make a long and hard decision if I wanted to spend what little money I was earning on rent, or on tuition as I went back to college to finish my bachelor's degree. I had a job, so I had an income, and the college had places I could shower, shave and do laundry. I would spend my time in the library studying or in the gym working out, small naps in the student activity center, or watching the local news at a nearby Burger King. Then about five hours of sleep on the streets and I could face the next day. I hated living in the streets, but I'm glad I finished my education and got better paying jobs as a result. But now, homeless-but-employed is becomming more and more common in California. I may have been among one of the first, but I'm most assuredly not the last. ",

He told me that he had \u201cgone forth to homelessness\u201d. He said that was the term that was used \u201cin the East\u201d for those who chose the life he had chosen. Apparently, there are spiritual reasons for \u201cchoosing\u201d homelessness in some societies. This man was at least 60 years old, but was extremely \u201cfit\u201d and clean. I sometimes saw him meditating on the beach and running along the sand by the water early in the morning. He told me that he had traveled all over the world and studied sacred texts. I can tell you this with certainty: His teachings were remarkable and profound and have sustained me in a spiritual sense for the last 50 years. And in his presence I experienced a transcendental moment that lifted me out of my body and filled me with \u201cmusic\u201d. ",

My friend Paul is in my bedroom at the moment; if he wasn\u2019t he\u2019d be on the streets with or without his wheelchair or in a homeless shelter without it. Paul has problems dealing with money so I\u2019ve got access to his bank account. What he really wants is his own place and a life free of money problems. Sticking him in a flat now wouldn\u2019t help, he just wouldn\u2019t be able to cope, get evicted and end up back on the street. In the old days, families took care of their own; OK there may have been some itinerant (usually men) around but they were few and far between. They chose their lives but I suspect that the majority of today\u2019s homeless needed the support systems that have been systematically shut down and dismantled. Whose to blame for the homeless crisis? We are; we allowed it to happen. ",

There are regular stories of tech engineers in the Bay Area who choose to save the rent money for their startup or travelers who just leave for a while. If you mean people sleeping on your local street who don\u2019t get to use showers or bathrooms, I think it\u2019s less common, but the answer will always be yes for some people. There will always be nonconformists resisting the pressure of a settled life - but more are there because they\u2019re unlucky and housing is crazy expensive. ",

I would see him a few times a year, his hair mussed by the wind, his face red from the cold and he always looked so happy. He would spend weeks on the train, riding a predetermined route, always with a goal in mind. I have known a lot of people in my life, but I have never again met someone that happy. He\u2019s settled down now, with kids and a wife. But for a few years he was ok being homeless. I guess there were times in the beginning where I was happy, but they were short lived for me. I had a tendency to focus on what I didn\u2019t have, what needed to happen next. I was always planning and it was stressful. Through the years of my drug addiction, that became my sole focus. I always wanted out. But people like my train hopping buddy? They never worry about anything. They move fluidly through the ebb and flow of life, always with optimism. I\u2019ve never been that way. Maybe in the end it\u2019s a good thing. I may have never left the streets if not for my anxiety. ",

It is a desperate, desperate thing to have to be homeless. There would be a constant or continual fear of every possible means of harm to the homeless person. This could mean a lack of meals, exposure to the elements, targets of scamming and so on. Being homeless is not a lifestyle, it is something of which persons are forced into and can be a source of deep depression and anxiety. Wow. What fun that \u201clifestyle\u201d is! We should be building people up and not labelling them as homeless. Help, not homeless. ",

Let's take the NAXALT (Not All X-type Are Like That) formulation and slip Homeless people into the X variable. So, take it from an Itinerant Mendicant, NAHALT is the short answer. Most people that find in the condition of suffering from a dearth of shelter are generally not homeless by choice. Not all, not all, not all, but most.

Loss of a loved one, injury, happenstance. Sometimes a job just gets downsized. Or the economy shifts, and an entire industry is decimated.

            "answer_text": "Is it true that homeless people are homeless because they choose to live that way? Absolutely not. While many homeless people are homeless because they want to be, I would say most are not. Most are homeless due to circumstances within and without of their control. I was homeless for a period of about 22 months. In 2003 I had surgery on my low back. It felt so good to be without pain. It was unbelievable \u2026 for two whole days. Then I sat up from a lying position and felt a sharp pain. For five years after that, I was in excruciating pain. It finally became too much for me mentally and emotionally, and I burned out at work. That started a slow slide in to homelessness. Eventually the pain more or less dissipated, but it was damn difficult pulling myself out of homelessness. At around my mid-50s no one wanted to hire me in my field (computing). I lost my house, then lost my apartment, then lost my lodgings, and finally ended up in a series of shelters. There were many men I met along the way who were educated and lost everything due to job loss. It was about this time that Mark Zuckerberg said that age 30 is the new 40. Many men in their mid-40s and up lost jobs after the Bush years and were not rehired in their fields. Many people lost their homes that they had worked very hard to maintain. Businesses like Facebook wanted new faces, young faces. Pure and simple age discrimination. Impossible to prove. I ended up working for a large retailer know by their blue and yellow color scheme for less than a third of my previous was. This happened to another guy the I worked with at the big blue retailer.

There are different kinds of homelessness. Voluntary, involuntary, temporary, long-tetm, unsheltered, sheltered, couch surfing, etc. There are different reasons for homelessness. Financial problems, divorce, death, drug/alcohol addiction, mental illness, etc. So there are different attitudes towards being homeless, as well. Some, like my brother, don't really care one way or another. He preferred living behind a dumpster, exposed to the elements, criminals, etc to having to get a job. And once he'd been homeless for a while, he couldn't get one. He had a dumpster-buddy who chose to be homeless because it meant he could spend his entire $1300/month disability payment on beer (and later, on meth). Many of the involuntarily homeless are not \u201cok with being homeless\u201d. Many have children. Who wants their kids to grow up like that? They will move heaven and earth to get out of the homeless cycle. ",

And while that may be true to some extent, it\u2019s a massive oversimplification. I can use myself for an example. I did all the things I could when my disabilities started getting the better of me. I had better than average medical care for a poor person because I was a veteran. I worked as much as I could, but it ended up being less and less. I tried being self-employed so I could set my own hours to work around my disabilities, but couldn\u2019t work enough. I moved in with other people to reduce my expenses. But all the while, my physical health was disintegrating, and my mental health was in an even more rapid decline. Eventually the people I was living with determined that I wasn\u2019t safe to have around them or their kid, so they had little choice but to kick me out. Looking back on past me, I fully agree. But yeah, there are always those who will reply \u2018if you just did *this* you never would have been homeless\u2019, to which I generally have to ignore because they don\u2019t have the background to understand what actually happens to people like me.

I know a lot of people who get a disability check of $700 and they want to sleep outside or in a shelter so that they can have that whole amount all to themselves. Imagine that you can have $700 a month all to yourself to spend any way you want. Sure they can go to a soup kitchen when they want and go to a shelter to take shower any time they want , but all of the other times they can sleep outside if the weather is good. As others have said they like the freedom. ",

There was maybe 5 people that I knew that were there for YEARS and three of them didn\u2019t have any medical, mental, or other reasons as to why they were staying there.

My home, my security, my place of safety. But recently the local council after a item in the local press about my living situation, ordered my car towed away. So the police came and said I would be arrested if I didn't leave my car, so I left. And now I'm back in the uk with a 60 litre ruck sack, back in a homeless hostel waiting to see if I can get any money from welfare because they now check to see if you are who you are. Immigration.
