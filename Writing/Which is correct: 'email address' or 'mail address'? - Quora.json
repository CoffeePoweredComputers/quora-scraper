If you are writing about a physical address, accessible through a map, and the country\u2019s postal service, then it would be a \u2018mail address\u2019. If you are referring to an electronic message, it would be an \u2018email address\u2019. The term \u2018email\u2019 is short for electronic mail; messages accessible through a computer or electronic device. ",
