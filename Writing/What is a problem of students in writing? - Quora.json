            "answer_text": "Hi, thanks for the good question, I used to ask them often since I have been writing research papers for students for more than 5 years and I was always wondering what makes them turn to me for help, why they can't get together and write their work themselves, really is it lazy? But after talking with students a lot, I can explain what it is. It is no secret that while working on a scientific article errors can occur. This is a normal phenomenon, in fact, this is the learning process in order to obtain the necessary knowledge, which will be useful later in the work. Because of what there are the most typical errors when writing: Plagiarism. Everyone can download work from the Internet, but if the teacher decides to check the work for uniqueness, a student may have big problems.The theme of the work is not disclosed in the process of writing. Students who do not want to attach due attention to their work can often get confused in the process of presenting the material and this leads to a mismatch of the topic and conclusions at the end of the work, such work will not deserve a good grade.Wrong design. Even if we assume that the text is written perfectly, but it does not meet the requirements of the teacher, then the work will still be returned for revision and sometimes redoing is not easy.Disproportionate presentation of the material. It happens that one section takes up the entire amount of work, and the other is barely enough for one page, this option also rarely satisfies teachers.I hope I fully answered your question. Thank you for your attention and good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Writing takes time and practice and few, if any, papers are ever written from start to end with a crystal clear introduction, well-reasoned analysis, and compelling conclusions. No. Papers are born from middle to outside, they are edited, revised, scrapped, rearranged, edited, and revised, many times before they are even sent out for peer review. Most students make the mistake that their audience is fully familiar with all the latest literature and jargon. Rarely is this the case.Many theory students think they need to impress or saturate the reader with big hairy and complex equations thinking that the reader will actually go through and work out all this math themselves.Many first time writers will talk around their work and not directly state what they\u2019re doing or why it\u2019s significant.and my biggest gripe: PASSIVE VOICE. Use the ACTIVE voice when possible. Every student should get a copy of Strunk and White and read it cover to cover 100 times.",
