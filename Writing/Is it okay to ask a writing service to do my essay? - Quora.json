            "answer_text": "Q. \u201cIs it okay to ask a writing service to do my essay?\u201d Dear Anonymous, it is definitely cheating. Lying about this is dishonest and shameful. Therefore, it is not okay to ask a writing service to do your essay. It is also not okay to ask a friend or other person to do your essay even if you do not pay them. It it is also not okay to copy somebody else's essay either from an online source or from any other source. You have been asked to write an essay to demonstrate how you can write, not how well someone else can write. In the long run, you will never learn anything from this exercise, and if the teacher discovers your deception, you will have ruined your reputation and probably fail the class. (A good friend of mine lost out on her PhD because she plagiarized part of her dissertation. This was in Germany a couple of years ago. The school used simple software to determine what had been plagiarized, and they did not give her a second chance to make it right.) How much is a good grade worth to you? Think long and hard about the many negative consequences to doing something like this. It sets you up for failure in school, college, work, and life. If you are too busy or too lazy to do this essay yourself, perhaps you should drop the class, or get reassigned to a lower grade level. \u2014Sarah M. 1/30/2018 ",

It depends what your intentions are and what is your overall objective to get it done from others.  The practice of paying another writer to write for you has been going on for centuries and is not illegal. Is it unethical? Even presidents of countries hire speech writers to write their famous speeches to the public. CEOs of large corporations hire writers for their speeches. University professors hire students to do research and writing for them which eventually goes out to the public in the professor\u2019s name. How to Write an Admission Essay for your Phd Online webmasters use this same system to keep their websites updated with fresh content. Most site owners don\u2019t write their own material but use a freelance writer to write it. The freelance writer gets paid for their work and the owner puts their name on the content. Colleges and universities may frown upon the practice of students hiring writers to do their coursework and essays, yet in all fairness if they were to forbid this practice, they would also have to find a way to forbid students getting help from real people for their essays. Most students already do this. It makes sense for a student to do as well as possible in their schoolwork so they earn the grades that will get them into higher places of learning. In short,if you intention is to get admission and want to give a professional look to your statements then its not unethical to hire someone for you because he will add your achievements in professional way that you can\u2019t add it yourself.

It you are afraid to get caught on cheating, try to look at this situation from another angle. If your order a draft, you have all rights to edit and rewrite it and finally you submit your professor a 100% unique paper. There is no possible way to trace the fact that you ordered a paper, not written it on your own because mostly all top writing companies keep their cooperation with you in 100% privacy. ",
