            "answer_text": "As simple of a question as this is, I think more people need to ask it. A resume is NOT the place to put everything you\u2019ve ever done, every skill you have, and every trait you possess that might help you get a job one day. Too many people make this mistake. Don\u2019t do it. A resume IS a single page that represents all your most impressive skills and qualifications, designed to secure an interview for your very next job. This means if you want to move from a sales rep to a sales manager, this is not the time to put that you speak beginner german or took a class in HTML in high school. I hope the difference is obvious. Only put the most relevant things that position you for an interview. The hiring manager is going to skim this and say \u201cdoes this person sound like they can handle the job? And if so, are they worth taking up 30 minutes of my time for an interview?\u201d If you aren\u2019t answering one of those questions, you\u2019ve gone off course in the resume. This is a long winded answer, but the point is this: Only put things they\u2019re actually going to care about. It\u2019s tough when you are first starting out and you don\u2019t feel like you have much accomplishment to show to the world. But a half-page resume that is straight-forward and plain-spoken will perform better than 2 pages of fluff and bloat that only make you sound out of touch and insincere. ",
