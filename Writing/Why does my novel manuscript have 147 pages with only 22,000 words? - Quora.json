            "answer_text": "So where does this 147 pages figure come from? Pages in digital books is a nonsensical figure, because each platform calculates the number of pages differently, and each device is configurable by the reader which changes the number of pages dynamically. 147 pages for 22k words is excessive. But it can be legit if the chapters are short. This happens more in non-fiction where a given topic has a lot of short explanation, all separated by a page feed. Novels, not so much. The thing is, if you\u2019re getting the pages from word, and you have it set up on say A5 page size, and using 14pt font, then you\u2019re going to have a lot of pages. Reset it to letter or A4, and go down to 10pt, and you get a lot less pages. And even then, the number of pages in Word has no relationship to the number the book will be shown to have on a platform. You can manipulate pages by putting in a lot of page feeds, larger fonts, wider margins, double spaces between paragraphs and all sorts of things, but at the end of the day, you only hurt yourself by doing any of that. Kindle Unlimited\u2019s KENPC value will simply remove all any attempts to manipulate it. Amazon learned that the hard way. And in the process, the book will get rejected as being an attempt to manipulate page reads. This can get you banned from KU, and lead to getting you banned from Amazon. Don\u2019t. As you keep getting told, 22k words is not a novel. But the Trad idea of a novel length is based on the needs of a hardcover or paperback, while Indie expectations are different. So as Ms Lackey points out, Trads want 80k, but Indie expectations on the other hand are 40k on Goodreads, 50k on Amazon, and vary between genres. Some prefer short, some prefer long, some prefer epic. The Indie preference now is dictated by long series, and as long as each book has a completed plot with an overriding plot, readers don\u2019t care too much how long each book is. A lot of Trad trilogies could be re-released these days as a series of 9 smaller books, and probably do better for the author in terms of earnings. Not that Trad authors will even consider that. Going back to the question, you need to answer the why is the page count so high question yourself. Because unless you link to it, all we are doing is guessing. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps you have failed to choose a font such as Times New Roman 12 point, and have also set your manuscript to single-spaced lines instead of double-spaced. Try changing both of those and see if you come up with more pages than the 147 you state in your question. However, doing so will not increase your word count beyond 22,000. The only way to do that is to write more words. You can achieve this by adding scenes and action and dialogue that advance your plot and give your story more \u201cmeat.\u201d There is also the possibility you have not written a novel, but a novella, or even a short story. If this is the case, trying to lengthen it simply for the sake of having a higher word-count may not be your best option. If you feel you\u2019ve told it all, to the best of your ability, then there is nothing wrong with accepting it for what it is\u2014a short story or a novella. ",
