For example, if you wrote a pirate story and they\u2019re publishing a pirate story soon, they wouldn\u2019t want to publish two similar books that would be competing with each other for sales. The editor\u2019s response doesn\u2019t mean that their book is so similar to yours that you should be concerned. Just try other publishers. Most of them will have different sorts of books that they are promoting. Good luck! ",

Publishing is a slow business and it takes roughly two years from a contract being signed to actually holding your finished book. I\u2019d start submitting your story like crazy to other editors or agents and see what happens! All the Best! ",
