            "answer_text": "Five paragraphs are possibly five too many to describe a TV show. If I were you, this is how I will write it. The first paragraph goes to the main anchor or main characters of the show. Say something about them. Who are they in the TV show business? What were their past TV show jobs? The second goes to content. Describe the content of the show. What is it about? What do they do? The third goes to the audience. To whom do you think does the show sell? Who is their target audience? The fourth to your personal evaluation. Do you enjoy watching it? Why or why not? The fifth to your recommendation, that is, recommendation to the producer of the show. How can the show be more interesting and more fun to watch. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously you begin with basic research. What is the central putpose/premise of the show? Who are the writers? The directors? The advertisers? What is the show\u2019s main story arc? Some arcs are openly stated - remember Star Trek? Do you see your paragraphs emerging yet? Once your research is done, you must organize the resukts into the type of essay it suggests. Is it instructive, in which you encalsulate and share your learning curve? Argumentative, in which you urge that a critically panned show deserved better? What does the research suggest to you? If you feel you need to learn more about essay writing and your textbook is insufficient, read Montaigne. Or research the word \u201cessay\u201d on the net. These are just tips. No one here on Quora actually writes essays for another. ",
