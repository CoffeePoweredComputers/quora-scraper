            "answer_text": "No, it actually seems far weirder to me that someone can watch or read a thing and profess to be a fan of it and not engage in what-ifs or worldbuilding off an idea or do a deep historical dive or throw the characters into another universe and wonder how they\u2019ll react. It\u2019s much like reading about a historical figure and wondering how they\u2019d react if it was only fifteen years later, or fifteen earlier. And then you write it down, so you can share it. Rather a lot of fanfics are better edited than published works, and have more worldbuilding, and actually patch up some of their canon\u2019s plotholes, or in some cases, steaming hot mess. In others, the canon falls away and starts doing really bizarre things, while fandom generally agrees, and has a number of brilliant fanfics to show it, that the canon should go another direction if it wants to keep up with the feel of the original. Of course, this is not even talking about fanfics that had the serial numbers scrubbed off and then were published and went on to have great and very popular series. Nor is it mentioning when fanfic writers have actually published work, and then just use their same editor to beta for them when they write fanfic. (Also, most historical fiction is actually fanfic of a historical era - there is no difference between French Revolution fandom and the meta/historical section of the Les Miserables fandom). A couple very good fanfics are: seperis\u2019 Down to Agincourt. Technically a Supernatural fanfic, but that introduced more characters, more diversity, more of a plot arc, and more worldbuilding than the original canon had. It currently has four books up in the series, the first of which is Map of the World. nirejseki\u2019s Countless Roads and her The Firebird. Both are DCTV The Flash/Legends of Tomorrow fanfics. Both are book length and are beautifully beta-ed and magnificently written. ",

            "answer_text": "Not weird, no. Given to enthusiasm? Oh yes. I must admit that I have never read any fan-fiction that I found at all tolerable. Nevertheless, writing such things can get some writers started, and they learn to discard the inventions of other people and invent their own characters, milieux, and stories. There is a curious species of fan-fiction that I have observed that might be an exception. The fan-fiction I am thinking of occurs when a reader immerses himself in the work and universe of a particular writer because he loves the work \u2014 but he gets an overdose, starts looking at the work with sarcastic humour, and starts writing devastating critical parodies. Work of this sort can be really funny, and it may be a means for some writers to purge themselves of the influence of that writer they felt the need to parody. To use a metaphor, writing a devastating literary parody is somewhat as if you have become bored with a certain performance, so you decide to throw a stink-bomb or roll a grenade into the middle of the performance. You enjoy the chaos that ensues as much as the performance. However, be cautious. Parody as a literary technique is very valuable, but parody as a literary genre does not have legs: if your parody is longer than about 5\u201310 pages, you run the risk of the parody starting to pall on the reader due to what a friend of mine called \u201crepetitive joke failure.\u201d Quite. I always suspected that Jane Austen\u2019s Northanger Abbey started life as a literary parody of this sort \u2014 Jane Austen may have loved those Ann Radcliffe gothics, but after ingesting a few, she had either to write a parody or explode. At a certain point, she seemed to realize that a novel cannot rely on parody alone, and she started introducing other elements than simple parody. ",

They\u2019re very creative people with a penchant for writing and storytelling. They take an existing story and add their own creative elements to it for other like-minded fans to enjoy. I remember reading a really good piece of Death Note fanfiction which served as somewhat of a good commentary of the entire anime.[1] In hindsight, it was actually somewhat similar to the conclusion of the live action film, Death Note 2: The Last Name. This piece of fan fiction really did a lot to point out just how unethical Light was while using the Death Note to create his ideal world. If anybody still had any sympathy for Light\u2019s goals before reading this fanfiction, they\u2019d probably feel strongly compelled to oppose Light after reading it.

            "answer_text": "It really depends. I write it myself still pretty actively, but mine is pretty tame and reads like a shoujo manga or a drama/mystery series most of the time. I've been doing it for a really long time though, and just like to explore the characters and the world more with the characters that have less screen time. I do think people that do self-inserts where they have sex with the characters is a little weird. That sort of fantasy shouldn't be published. Everyone has had a crush on a character before, but it takes a certain personality to write up a sex scene with them and a character and then post it for the whole world to see. I also get super weirded out by the amount of rape scenes in the yaoi (homosexual) stories. There's a fair bit of rape in fanfiction already, but it's super prevalent in yaoi stories for some reason and in all fandoms. I'm the hetero stories, they usually keep it at just saying the character was raped and then all of a sudden that character wants to hang someone else. Yaoi stories go into some really messed up explicit details that are super unnecessary. So yeah, that type of writer definitely weirds me out a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the type of fanfic they write. If its a story in and of itself, like say, Batman fighting another criminal or following the gaps between the times we see Future Trunks, not really. That kind of story is a simple expansion upon already established stories, or deviating from established stories to make a crossover (like many people using the Gohan vs Cell fight to send Gohan to another universe). If what they write is all about a slashy ship of theirs, putting together two characters that have no business in such a relationship (the Winchester brothers from Supernatural for example), then yes. As the characters tend to deviate, often times heavily, from how they normally act. Making them not only badly out of character, but possibly making them self-inserts at points as well. ",
