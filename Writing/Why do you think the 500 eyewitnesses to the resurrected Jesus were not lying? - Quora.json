            "answer_text": "The reference to 500 eyewitnesses to the resurrected Jesus was made by Paul and is not attested in the gospels, none of which makes room for so many eyewitnesses. Apart from Paul\u2019s epistle, Acts of the Apostles is the one account that makes so many eyewitnesses a reasonable possibility, but only because it says that Jesus remained on earth forty days before his ascension to heaven. Paul tells us: And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: after that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. Everything points to Paul passing on hearsay that there were 500 witnesses, just as he did not realise that there were then only eleven \u2014 not twelve \u2014 disciples. He was simply too far removed in time and place from the resurrection to be sure of anything he passed on to the Corinthians. If indeed there were 500 witnesses,we do not know what they said about their experience, so we can not establish whether anything they said was true or otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Why do you think the 500 eyewitnesses to the resurrected Jesus were not lying? The premise in the question of a supposed \u201clying\u201d or not is nowhere even applicable. First of all, there\u2019s no good reason to believe that the 500 referenced in 1 Cor were ever an \u201ceyewitnesses\u201d to a physical, bodily appearance by a supposedly resurrected Jesus. Second, even if the reference in 1 Cor is authentic to Paul, there\u2019s no good reason to believe that it\u2019s a reliable recounting of an actual historical event, whatever was the nature of the event. If the 500 are authentic to Paul and not an insert, did he embellish the numbers of an event the nature of which he is highly ambiguous? And if he\u2019s just repeating a second or third-hand account, was his source reliable and unembellished? We simply do not have a eyewitness report of the supposed event, of what it was, if it even happened at all. Finally, since none of those supposed 500 left a personal report, nor a personal, first-person claim to have physically seen a bodily resurrected Jesus, the premise in the question of 500 people maybe \u201clying\u201d simply has no validity, in any case.
