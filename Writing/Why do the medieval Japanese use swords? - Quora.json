            "answer_text": "An elite member of the Japanese military, samurai were fierce warriors who followed the Bushido, which means \u201cway of the warrior.\u201d This code of ethics was a moral compass for samurai and consisted of several values, including courage, integrity, loyalty, compassion, and respect. They were armor-clad, civil-minded savages who made it their goal to live and die with honor. Their main weapon, the katana, was thought to be an extension of their soul. Indeed, a sword was considered such a crucial part of a samurai\u2019s life that when a young samurai was about to be born, a sword was brought into the bedchamber during the delivery. When the time came for an old samurai to die \u2014 and cross over into the \u2018White Jade Pavilion of the Afterlife\u2019 \u2014 his honored sword was placed by his side. Even after death, a daimyo, or nobleman, believed he could count on his samurai who had followed him into the next world to use their keen blades to guard him against any demons, just as they had wielded their trusty weapons to defend him against flesh-and-blood enemies in this life.  In a samurai family, the swords were so revered that they were passed down from generation to generation, from father to son. If the hilt or scabbard wore out or broke, new ones would be fashioned for the all-important blade. The hilt, the tsuba (handguard), and the scabbard themselves were often great art objects, with fittings sometimes of gold or silver. ",

            "answer_text": "Question may be malformed. If you mean why did the Japanese samurai use swords. Their first preference was bows followed by lances and swords came in third by preference in my understanding. But in every day activity carrying a bow with the needed arrows or a lance was somewhat impractical whereas a sword can easily be carried as an accessory. And it\u2019s pretty reasonable for use in close combat. Now on the other hand if it was meant why was it necessary to have some means of personal protection. I\u2019ll leave that to others to address. ",
