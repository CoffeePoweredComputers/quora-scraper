            "answer_text": "Absolutely no question, beyond all others the strongest and hardest strategy is to attack the strongest form of your opponent\u2019s argument. You can also lay traps in your case, confuse your opponent, and otherwise abuse the rules of debate to win without satisfying the spirit of debate. Richard Epstein from the Hoover institution said in one of his podcasts \u201cThe Libertarian\u201d that he develops his opinion as he writes his piece. He attacks strongest opponent\u2019s strongest contentions and wins or loses (probably wins) in a way that is totally above - board. A prolific and well-learned scholar, we would do well to imitate him. Who can you defeat by confusion, or other lesser tactics of argument? Only opponents weaker than yourself. To become better do the hardest thing and take the more honorable path by attacking your opponent\u2019s strongest argument. ",
