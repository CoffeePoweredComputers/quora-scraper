            "answer_text": "The good ole libel and slander question. You can google these subjects on your own. I\u2019ll give you 30 seconds or so. Can you get sued? Yes, if your literary work gets noticed by the famous person you can get set up for a slander suit. The real hurdle is your literary work has to become important enough to get noticed. Legally does the suit have \u201clegs\u201d? The real answer is it depends, but the correct answer is probably no. The more famous a person becomes, the more public their lives becomes and at that point the first amendment freedom of expression comes in conflict with a person\u2019s general right to privacy. The more famous the person the lower the privacy expectation and the higher the freedom of expression. See \u201cOur Cartoon President\u201d as an example. It\u2019s clearly about President Trump. It\u2019s clearly an unflattering portrait of the President. However this lampooning is allowed because the president has a much lower expectation of privacy than a normal American. If you were to take the same basic premise and make it about your neighbor, the show would infringe on the person\u2019s basic rights of privacy and a lawsuit would become more viable. I hope this gives you a 30 second answer without me writing a treatise on libel and slander law. ",

            "answer_text": "Not a lawyer here. But IMO, people do this all the time. SNL, Robot Chicken, South Park, Family Guy, Stand Up Comedians, etc. They usually have a disclaimer like \u201cany names or likenesses of real people are fictitious\u201d Country laws may vary so check that out. But I think it\u2019s only an issue if you\u2019re leading people to believe that it\u2019s true. These days even that\u2019s getting a pass in many cases. ",
