            "answer_text": "Here is the thing. Unless your blog is getting huge traffic, it isn't sensible to assume you will make a lot of money from it, and that isn't the name of the game, unless the traffic becomes enormous. Sure you have the Huffington Post that makes 2M a month or something silly, but 80% of blogs make almost nothing. However, most blogs aren't looking for direct monetization from Google. They are hobbies or looking for business leads. Take my blog. I didn't monetize it at first. It wasn't even my aim. This month (27 days so far), it has gotten 76,500 page views, and made about $430 for the month. as below (British Pounds is showing). 76,500 views is much more than average, and I never dreamed I could do that after only 100 days or so. So unless your blog traffic is crazy high, it isn't possible to make a living from blogging from direct traffic, but it is a passive income and it gives you other opportunities. The point is, I think I would never have gotten to 80,000views a month after only 3 months if I had aimed to monetize on day 1, rather than just having a genuine passion for the subject, because I would have given up too soon in the early days.  Moreover, I didn't monetize my Youtube despite having 1,000+ followers. I didn't even know you could monetize it directly until somebody told me about it 6\u201312 months after I started. `Hey Adam you should monetize considering you now have 500 followers and will have more soon`. I just enjoyed creating content. I did start Patreon recently though (Adam Fayed is creating Videos and podcasts about financial freedom and passive income | Patreon) but I decided on day 1 I would create even if only 1 person signed up, because I enjoy it. So my advise would be choice a subject you are passionate about. Something you would do for free. Create good content. Then people will come, and you will get a side income after 2\u201312 months. Then over 5\u201310 years, you could make blogging a full-time thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmmm\u2026! Let\u2019s see. How much do I earn from my blog? Well, I\u2019m 4 months shy of full 2 years. I started blogging in 2016. There was a gap in between though and then after some time, I resumed again. I use a single domain, Blog - The Usual Stuff to blog in multiple niches which are: Accounting and FinanceTaxationBlogging Tips and TricksOnline Money MakingBooks ReviewsSEOa little bit of Gaming as well.Programming such as Javascript, NodeJS etc.In my personal opinion, it\u2019s definitely not a good move to blog about multiple niches using a single domain. Hampers your image in becoming an authority blogger. But I cannot help it. That\u2019s who what I am. I do not want to juggle between different Wordpress accounts and keep checking traffic stats of multiple blogs. This will eat up my whole day and when it comes to checking the blog traffic, I suffer from OCD. Any ways, in these 1 year and 8 months, I\u2019ve been able to amass 10,000 to 12,000 visitors a month. Though I haven\u2019t kept any tabs on my earnings because I don\u2019t believe in sharing my earning details because I think it attracts the wrong kind of visitors (No offence, even I pry a lot about how much other bloggers earn). So I\u2019ll give you rough idea. According to my estimate, till date, I\u2019ve earned just over $1,000 in these almost 2 years. Still too far from achieving my dream of making a living from a blog but I believe that I will eventually reach there. I just have to keep going while improving at the same time. I don\u2019t use Google Adsense as I was banned a long time ago. I believe back in 2008/2009 due to some shenanigans that I\u2019m not that proud of. So I use Media.net instead along with the affiliate offers relevant to the niche that I blog about. I hope this answers your question. Oh and by the way, do let me know what you think about my blog: The Usual Stuff UPDATE Well, I just checked. I started blogging back in April, May 2017. So it\u2019s just been over 12 months. That\u2019s not much time. Right? ",
