            "answer_text": "Jose Rizal is a hero, yes, however there are manytracks of Rizal's life were untouched as the way the school teachers the young generation are too over-simplified and it didn't covered enough facts about Rizal. As I read from the books of Historian Ambeth Ocampo (Looking Back Series), I discovered more facts about our national hero and it's unseen and untold aspects heck even there was this story that there's a connection between him and the infamous Jack The Ripper. There are many things that students hasn't uncovered in terms of our history and our history is too vital for our country as it's part of our panitikan (literature) and culture. For his works, on the other hand, people I are required to read his two famous books, Noli Mi Tangere and El Filibusterismo, during highschool as it's part of the high school curriculum. People often think that \u201cOh god why is it so long? Ugh it's boring!\u201d, but they're wrong because it shows that his works aren't only for entertainment purposes but a message to us on our struggles during the Spanish Era of the Philippines despite that Jose Rizal was abroad dating many girls.

            "answer_text": "My first thought was why not study Rizal? But I know that\u2019s not what you are looking for in an answer. The reason to study anything is to broaden your education and Rizal is an extremely important individual in Philippine history. It is said that his writing influenced the drive to independence in that country. He was not physically part of the revolution but he was still executed because of his influence.I also wondered if your question had to do with a homework assignment so I\u2019m limiting my answer because I don\u2019t want to do your homework for you.
