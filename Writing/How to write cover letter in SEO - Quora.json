            "answer_text": "Not only for SEO you can use the below formula for any JOB profile cover letter. 3-4 paragraphs of 2-3 sentences each.Paragraph 1: why you are applying. Give a reason and note exactly what you are applying for. You want to mention the role specifically to make it easier for recruiters who receive applications for multiple positions. This it the paragraph where you demonstrate your enthusiasm for them specifically. You think the company is the best in its space, you have tons of experience in the space, you've been targeting the industry/role in your career, etc. Be specific to stand out.Paragraph 2: who you are. Name drop good companies you've worked for, summarize your experience briefly only including roles and tasks that are specifically related to the open position. This is the paragraph where you communicate you are a qualified, experienced worker.Paragraph 3: what you can do. This is like paragraph 2 but the goal now is to indicate that you've read their job description and match your specific experience to their specific asks. If the job description asks for everything and the kitchen sink, pick two or three things you feel are the core of what they need and address that.Paragraph 4: what you're like. This is the closing paragraph or sentence and you want to say more than just \"look forward to speaking with you!\" Give them an idea what that might be like. The content of this paragraph is less easy to describe because sometimes you may know the company's business well enough to say \"look forward to hearing more about your plans for [whatever challenge they face as a business] and how I can help!\" In other instances you may want to fall back on your enthusiasm and why you want to work with them.",
