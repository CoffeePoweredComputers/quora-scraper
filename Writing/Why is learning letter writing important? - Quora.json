            "answer_text": "Even in today\u2019s fast-paced society, I think letter writing still holds an important component in our communication. Here are a few reasons why: Letter Writing Requires Thought Opposed to texting or even talking on the phone, letter writing allows the writer to have time to think about the content they are writing. One of the best features when it comes to writing a letter is being able to sit down and process your thoughts before actually putting pen to paper. For someone like myself who is not quick on their feet, writing a letter allows ample time to make sure I am saying exactly what I want to say. If I make a mistake, I can scrap my thought and start over again! Tangible Communication Unlike a text message or a phone call, a letter is a tangible piece of communication. We can actually hold on to the pen and paper, and we can read the letters we have received over and over again without the fear of them being deleted or forgotten. We also have more control in how we communicate with our letters. There\u2019s no frustration spurred from autocorrect or accidentally hitting send when we are not finished with our thought. ",
