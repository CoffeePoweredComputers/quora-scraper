            "answer_text": " \u201cShe always comes\u201d Always! You are probably confusing the \u2018s\u2019 in always with the \u2018s\u2019 in 'comes'. The \u2018s\u2019 in the verb depends on the noun or the subject of your sentence. The \u2018always\u2019 will not make a difference. Consider the following answers: * She never comes. * She seldom comes. * She comes often. On the other hand, read the following examples: * She always comes. * They always come. * Sam always comes. * Meera and Jaya always come. * It always comes. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is correct! Rule for life: 3rd singular form in English as it is in French ALWAYS conjugate differently from the rest. EXAMPLE: I eat You eat She/he/It eats \u2014see how there\u2019s an S st the end. It also changes the pronunciation. We eat You eat They eat I could do that for every verbs and third singular form will always change. In French Both the 3rd singular form and 3rd plural form changes but in English only the 3rd singular form changes. Caution: there\u2019s always an s or es at the end of each verb at the singular form with irregular verbs. Example: verb to do When conjugating: I do You do He/she/it does \u2014see the changes We do You do They do Hope that was as detailed and elaborated enough! And that it makes sense ",
