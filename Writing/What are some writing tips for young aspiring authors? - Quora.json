            "answer_text": "Hi! I\u2019m a young writer myself, though I won\u2019t share my age. I\u2019ve recently been struggling with this question as well and received some excellent advice from older and more experienced writers. I\u2019ll rephrase what they said as well as what I\u2019ve learned here. The first thing you want to do is reach people. The younger you are when you start this the better. You should never be in the mindset of \u201coh, I\u2019ll wait til I\u2019m older.\u201d NO. The sooner you start, the more likely you are to be successful. Think about how many people read your work each month. Is it less than 100 people? Less than 50? Less than 10? Whatever number is okay, but you want to grow that. Create a website/blog. This is a bit of advice I received from an experienced individual. I just recently started my writing advice based website Write Up My World, and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the decision. The trick is to put your work out there so that people don\u2019t have to be told about your work by you directly. Get it? It\u2019s all about easily expanding your circle. Also, be active on social media, but not just as yourself. I\u2019m talking be active on social media as a writer specifically. Don\u2019t use your accounts for personal things, use it to get to know other writers and get them to notice you. Keep working at it. One day it will pay off! Good luck! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few: 1) Prologues are not a way to dump information on readers. This is a common scenario in fantasy and science fiction books. All the extra details and important facts are plainly written down in the prologue. Sometimes, the entire structure of a dystopian world or society is explained in the prologue. This is a good way to make sure that most readers do not read past your prologue. Yes, this is a serious concern. You have to understand that prologues are snippets that will capture your readers' attention and make them want to read ahead. The above mentioned details and information should be disclosed bit by bit as the story unfolds. Most authors advise to skip prologues altogether because of this misuse. However, if you use prologues the right way, then you can absolutely go ahead and use them. 2) Spend a significant amount of time writing the opening paragraph. Write down a number of openings and select the one that appeals the most to you. This opening paragraph is the one that basically makes a reader decide if the book is worth the time or not. Some overused openings to avoid are weather descriptions, alarm clocks, dream sequences, flashbacks, and waking up scenarios. 3) Keep filler chapters to a minimum. If possible, avoid them altogether. Filler chapters are those that do not really contribute in moving the plot forward. They exist solely to increase the word count of the book or to simply engage the reader more with the characters, the setting, or the plot. 4) Avoid overexaggerating descriptions and excessive use of figure of speech. As opposed to what most aspiring authors believe, complicated vocabulary, fancy descriptions and excessive figure of speech do not impress the readers. These things annoy the readers because reading such writing becomes a chore. The book will most probably be classified as boring and kept aside. 5) Don't fall in love with your words. Of course, you should be your biggest fan and you should write only what you love. But don't let the words become so special to you that you can't edit them. Your heart might be clinging onto them even when your mind clearly tells you to get rid of them. This is what editing truly means. Editing is basically getting rid of all the words that were once special but are no longer so. Edit ruthlessly. 6) Endings can make or break your book. Once a reader finishes reading the book and the last page is flipped, it is the ending that stays with the reader. They will remember the story because of the ending. For this reason, do not make your ending too complicated, do not haywire it to surprise the reader, do not leave the reader hanging (unless there is a sequel), and do not elaborate the moral of the story or the lessons learnt. 7) Lastly, do not lose hope. Writing a book is a long process. Getting published is an even longer process. Marketing to make your book sell is a neverending process. So to survive as an author, stick with just two things; patience and perseverance. I hope these tips will help you in polishing up your book. Remember that writing is a beautiful but painful journey, littered with shards of glass and rose petals. Be patient and persevere and you will soon transform from being an aspiring author to a published author. All the best for your first story. ",
