Writers with a story to tell  These guys are everywhere, including right here on Quora. You might even be one of these, Craig. A lot of people liked Fifty Shades for the story, not the writing itself. This is how you get popular. Writers who excel at the writing itself  These guys probably have a couple degrees, and might work in the field. They\u2019re a bit more serious and a bit less fun, but they know a thing or two about grammar, spelling and punctuation. This is how you get true fans and followers who want to be like you.
