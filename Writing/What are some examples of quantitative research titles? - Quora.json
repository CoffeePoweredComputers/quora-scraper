            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. There are many different types of research projects in many fields. The kind you are interested in, quantitative research, involves counting things and numbers (as opposed to explaining or describing them, which is qualitative research). It\u2019s hard to give you an answer that explains everything, so lets look at an example about pizza. Imagine you were doing research for a new pizza store and you wanted to find out what topping people liked. Since you know you need numbers and are going to count things, you conduct a few different quantitative studies. You do a survey where people are asked to check off what toppings they like, how much, on a scale of 1\u20135 they like each topping, and give us some demographic information (age, sex, postal code). From this, we could map where participants are (based on postal code) and decide if we are going to include them. Only those close to the store, or in the same town, really matter. Next we will build groups based on age and gender and try to identify if we are missing any important part of the population. For example, males aged 18\u201345, who do eat pizza, were not included because everyone we asked to participate was female. This could be a problem. Finally, we use all the numbers and preferences given to us by the participants to decide what are the best toppings to have on hand and what there might be the most demand for. We wont know why they like those toppings without talking to them (for example in a interview or a focus group), but we will know how much demand there is based on our sample. We could compare this to other data we have, such as the population of the town (and decide if we need to use a power calculation to scale our sample to be representative, if possible), and other factors, such as how many residents there are in our delivery area. We can then decide, based on the numbers, what toppings to carry, how far we should set our delivery area, and many other factors. ",
