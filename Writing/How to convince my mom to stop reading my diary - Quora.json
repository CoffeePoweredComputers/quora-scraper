            "answer_text": "You probably can't. Either treat her as a hostile party and approach it with counter intelligence strategies (misinformation is a great suggestion), stop keeping a diary, keep 2 diaroes, 1 more hidden than the other, etc. If talking doesn't work (I'm a fan of confrontation first, to resolve stuff like grownups), here are some additional ideas you might try: Passively mention a secret hiding place where you're hiding something salacious (though not illegal), and leave a note there that says \u201cstop reading my diary\u201dStart writing in code\u2026 in a fake diary. Feel free to be creative about what the encoded messages are (something about how you don't feel like you can trust your mom may work)Write very detailed accounts of how you've observed your mom involved in illegal activities (misdemeanors, not felonies) and how you're thinking about turning her in. (Be sure you stay on the right side of the law yourself, to be safe)Coat the outside of your diary with ink on one side (same color as cover) \u2014 some inks take days to wash off. Say nothing about the ink, but allow others to ask the questions for you on their own.A lot of those are really petty and aggressive. The general drive is that there should only be consequences if she continues to read it, and choosing to not read it anymore should end the consequences. The best solution is to talk with her, explain how you feel, and explain that it undermines your trust in her. If she won't find common ground with you, then stop keeping a diary or keep it somewhere she can't get to it (eg. In your locker at school or something) ",

            "answer_text": "My mom was overly respectful of my privacy. She really shouldn't have been, I was NOT being good in any way. She wouldn't even open my bedroom door to toss something in if I wasn't home. So I can't speak from direct experience, but I do maintain a diary & have for the past several years consistently. (Actually, I've filled 12 notebook's in that time) When I started keeping a journal, my husband and I had started having problems & I started losing my mind over it! (The worst thing you can do in reaction to your man pulling away suddenly. In my defense, he had never done it in 11 years together & 9 married) Anyway, I didn't want to hide my notebooks, I didn't want him to feel like I was keeping secrets or badmouthing him in those pages either. Also, I wanted to remove the thrill of \u201cspying\u201d or the rush of doing something you shouldn\u2019t; I told him to feel free to read it at any point, cover to cover, no need to wait till I leave the room or quickly throw it down when I come back in. It really removed the curiosity and appeal, plus, he didn't really want to, \u201csee behind the curtain\u201d Most men don\u2019t, understandably so. I never hide my notebooks, I never think twice about leaving it right on the bed, even while he's laying there & I'm off to take a shower or the like. It's really a liberating feeling, being an open book. I understand your situation is different since it's parental and not a significant other in a relationship between 2 adults, but this may be helpful down the road. Giving \u201cno holds barred\u201d access lets a person see that you have nothing to hide and no issue owning your feelings, opinions, thoughts, etc. They think if it was any juicy info, surely you wouldn't give them unfettered access or leave it lying around, right? My husband bought me a big, leatherbound journal with a legit padlock on it from Amazon for less than $20. It's funny though, I never write in it. I found some amazingly secure journals on etsy, it was made with super thick leather and a steel spine and mechanism to hold the lock, which was a full size padlock. It was almost $200, but the paper is refillable and it looks so awesome! I still want one! In your situation, I would go for the decoy diary with PG rated entries and keep your uncensored diary hidden. Maybe even make both notebooks identical so she doesn't get a chance to ever see one that looks unfamiliar, thus piquing her interest. I would hope after reading the decoy for a while she would see she can trust you and not feel the need anymore. A diary is worthless if you always feel you have to write what someone else finds acceptable. ",
