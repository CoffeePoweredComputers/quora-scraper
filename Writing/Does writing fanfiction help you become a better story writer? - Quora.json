            "answer_text": "Yeah, I guess. As others have said, any writing at all helps. However, if you're going to get your start that way, here are a few tips: Don't be discouraged: The biggest thing that I have to deal with in my writing and just my life in general is feeling that my work doesn't matter, that nobody cares about it, and thus there's no point in making it. I've quit once already, and am currently struggling to stay motivated to write, which sucks, since writing is like my favorite thing to do. Look, maybe you won't get that many views, but if you make good stories instead of just rehashing others work, you'll probably make a name for yourself pretty fast on http://Fanfiction.net or a place like that(y'know, since you really don't have much competition). If your first few posts don't get any views or comments, don't just give up. Keep going. Maybe don't throw your whole life into it, but keep doing it, and hopefully your incredible talent will be recognized. And once it is and people like what they see, they're going to start asking for-nay, demanding-new content. And while I've never quite experienced that yet, I can imagine it feels pretty good.Don't just stick with the status quo: I saw how the other writers mentioned that a downside to writing fanfiction is that you don't get any experience in writing characters from it. I don't really think that's the case, or at least it shouldn't be. A lot of fanfiction has things like alternate timelines, alternate universes, OC's, or original characters, that sort of thing. I absolutely agree with adding your own original characters to the story. Now, of course, you shouldn't insert yourself into the story, but maybe you could look towards yourself or people you know when creating the character's personality, backstory, flaws, etc. Look at some guides on characterization if you feel your characters are too bland or uninteresting, or you just can't come up with a good motive or something. I'd also try branching out a bit further, maybe filling in gaps in the canon lore or new obstacles the characters have to overcome. And, of course, you have to create a whole new plot for your fanfiction. Which leads us too...Follow the canon: I cannot stress this enough. The worst fanfics ever made are the ones which have no relation to the source material whatsoever. Don't make that mistake. In order to write fanfiction, you've got to know everything about the series. You've got to be familiar with the lore, the characters, the tone, the atmosphere, the themes, and, most importantly, what makes the thing great. If you can figure out why people love a show or book and apply it to your fanfiction, you'll give the readers a sense that they are reading an actual episode based on the quality of your work, which results in a lot more attention and appreciation for it. In addition, and this is more of a personal preference thing of mine which I think works fairly well, I believe it would be best, if the series is ongoing, to begin slightly before, during, or after the most recent chapter or episode. What this does is it allows you to explore and create the plot based on how you believe the story will play out from the most recent point in the canon. This offers a lot more creative storytelling opportunities, especially if the thing you want to write about is something which still has a lot of mystery surrounding the plot, such as Steven Universe or Rick and Morty. Plus, no one can give you crap about it playing out differently than the canon because it was created before the canon caught up to it and followed the established canon exactly up to that point. You might not find it all that important, but I personally prefer writing fanfics that way.Well, I hope that can be of some help to you. Good luck in all your future endeavors, and may the odds be ever in your favor. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this is both a yes and no.How it helps: It's a good writing practice. It is a universally accepted fact that writing more helps you improve your skills and fanfiction definitely helps you achieve that.You learn to come up with novel ideas and plots. Setting yourself apart from the vast volume of fanfiction out there requires you to do something absolutely new and it becomes second nature to you the more you continue along this path.Most sites allow their users to comment on the fanfics. This helps you get constructive criticism on your writing. Some also offer beta reading services to provide feedback even before you publish online, which will most certainly encourage you to improve in the areas that you are weak in and make you a better writer overall.How it does not help: Characters and settings are already given to you. You will have insufficient knowledge on how to create your own major characters and places, even accounting for the fact that many fanfics introduce new characters or maybe set in an alternate universe.You will never be considered as a serious writer if you write only fanfiction. It is more likely that you will incur the wrath of the author whose works have inspired your stories in the first place.Actual stories do not become popular overnight like fanfics do online. Hence, fanfiction authors will be less prepared to handle rejection and criticism once they make the switch to original fiction.To summarize, writing fanfiction improves only certain aspects of a writer while it totally blindsides you in others. Starting off with fanfics and jumping to original fiction when your ideas are mature enough is what I would recommend. ",

Fanfic has a weakness in that it doesn't teach you world building or character development, because you're writing in someone else's world with someone else's characters.
