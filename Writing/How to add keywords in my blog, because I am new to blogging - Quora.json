            "answer_text": "New? Don't worry! I too got the same experience on your stage. You are looking for the techniques how to add the keywords in the post or page you got or selected through keyword research tools. How to Add Keywords: Suppose you have selected a keyword \"weight loss foods\", now you'll have to add this in your blog post. Go to your post page. And use the following tips to optimize the page: Add \"weight loss  foods\" in the beginning of the page title. Add \"weight loss foods\"  in the url of the page. Add \"weight loss foods\" in an H1 heading ( be noted, 1page 1 H1 tag). Add \"weight loss foods\" in the ALT text for your photo ( if there is an image). Add \"weight loss foods\" in the image filename, (in case of image). Add \"weight loss foods\" in the body text max 5 times according to your content length.   But never use keyword (weight loss foods) as the anchor text. And you should input the keywords quite naturally so that the whole content value doesn't get harm, rather it improves content value. It's better to use the keywords from your mind map during your content writing. However, get the right way to use keywords in your delicious content for readers first, then Google.  ",

First of all, search the keyword that is relevant to the content and has a good chance of ranking high in the search results. For this purpose, you can use Google keyword planner, semrush, ubersuggest, or any other keyword planning tool.Add the keywords in the title of your post.Use the keywords in the search description and first 150\u2013200 words of your content because Google mostly crawls the first few lines of a website and if it finds correct information according to the query the page is ranked in the search results.Do not stuff the keywords in the content because it will make the content uninteresting for the users to read and they will not stay on your website for long.I think it answered your question.

            "answer_text": "All you need to do (in terms of keywords) is to learn a proper structure. 1. Learn how to write a proper <title>. Try to include you blog's name in your titles eg <title>Article About Carrots \u2013 Carrotmaniac Blog</title> Title is what will show up in google when I search for your article (it's often different from the heading). Size of a title is 512 px or approx 55 characters, while your actual article name can be a lot longer. 2. Compose a proper heading <h1>This is the name of your article, that may or may not be the same as title</h1>. It's what shows up as a title when I open your link, by clicking on the <title> These are the only places where you need carefully selected keywords! The rest will come naturally. When picking keywords for your title and h1 heading pick the most efficient ones, there are plenty of tools to help you with it, including serpstat, or it's free version sg.serpstat.com 3. Just make a good content and it will be filled with proper keywords, it's unavoidable. Don't plaster different keywords all over your text, it will only hurt. Write a text that reads nice and holds necessary information. ",

But you can use keywords depending on content length. It means, over optimization is really bad SEO. And also try to find similar keywords to your main keyword and add those keywords on blog posts. And also it's importance to use LSI Keywords on your content You can find LSI keywords when you search a keyword on google and come to bottom of Google result page and see Related search .  when i searched the keyword \u201cLifestyle\" i got these LSI keywords on Google. And you can use three or four keywords on your content. And one thing you should always remember that don't use your main keywords everywhere in blog posts, because it will quality of your blog post.
