            "answer_text": "Dear ________, I need to discuss something with you that is very important to me: I\u2019ve decided that I want to study abroad next [summer/semester] in [chosen country]. I\u2019m incredibly excited about this opportunity to study abroad and to explore [chosen country], as I think it\u2019ll help me both personally and academically. I\u2019m not just asking you to let me travel abroad for a few months. I\u2019m serious about this decision and I want to have a meaningful experience that will enhance my education. By studying abroad, I\u2019ll also be boosting my resume for the future! Statistics show that 97 percent of students who study abroad find jobs within a year of an employee when only 49 percent of college graduates found employment in that same period(let me do the math for you \u2013 that means that study abroad students are twice as likely to get a job within a year of graduation). I understand if you\u2019re worried about safety, but I hope you trust me to make smart decisions no matter where I am. And if you\u2019re still concerned, we could set up a lunch to chat with [insert name of family friend/fellow student who has studied abroad] and ask them to talk to us as a family about their experience abroad. I\u2019m passionate about studying abroad in [chosen country] because [be sure to tell you, parents, what is motivating you to study abroad in this country. Is it a passion for the language? Your goal to someday work abroad? A love for Brazilian culture? Whatever your reasons for studying abroad, be sure to express them clearly to your parents so they understand how and why this is so important to you]. I can\u2019t wait to talk about airplane tickets with you! Love, Me ",
