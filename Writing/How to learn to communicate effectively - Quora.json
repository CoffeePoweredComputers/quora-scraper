            "answer_text": "Hi, \u201ccommunication\u201d is a huge topic. There would be a lot to talk about. Communication online, communication face to face, on the phone, via letter, email. etc. Different approaches need different attention. You communicate well if you consider these points: a) Try to always maintain positive facial expressions and body language (non-verbal language is very important). Bear in mind seeing someone in person gives you the advantage of using your body language which in written communication or over the phone is unfortunately not possible. b) Listen carefully to what the other person is saying (by nodding, keeping eye contact, once in a while repeating/acknowledging what they are saying, asking questions) c) Be focused on what you are saying and try to express your thoughts in an articulate way. Don\u2019t use 3 sentences if you can say the same in one sentence. d) Learn to distinguish assertive language from aggressive (more direct) language. Imagine you moved to a foreign country and there are two people\u2026. One person tells you \u201cYou MUST learn the language!!!\u201d The other person tells you \u201cYou will realise by yourself that learning the local language will benefit you in many ways.\u201d Which approach do you think is better? Obviously version 2, it\u2019s less direct and sounds friendlier. e) Be always respectful towards the other person, no matter whether you communicate orally or in writing. Also remember, you don\u2019t write the same way as you speak. (Unless, you want to write an engaging blog post and apply a conversational writing style.) f) If you get feedback from others, never take it personally. Look at it as an opportunity to improve. If you on the other hand need to give someone else feedback, start with a positive note, mention points that need to be changed/improved and end again with a positive note (it\u2019s known as the \u201csandwich\u201d method). g) Make sure your spoken word and body language are in sync. If they are not, people will trust more your body language rather than what is coming out of your mouth. Words can lie but body language is difficult to manipulate. Tip: Watch videos and observe actively how others are communicating and take notes, what are they doing so well. Watch some discussions, shows, speeches, etc. There is lots to learn from others. Good luck, Karin ",

            "answer_text": "When it comes to communication we often forget it is a two way thing and think communicating is talking as clearly as possible. It is more than that. one of the best practices in communication is listening attentively. Listen more and speak less. You need to be able to give your full attention to your audience. This will permit you discern what the communication is centred around and give responses that are clear or refrain from talking unnecessarily. Another one is body language. Your posture should say you have my attention. For example folding your arms when talking or listening to someone talk is interpreted as defensive. It is said to be a form of saying I don't agree with you. To avoid such interpretations, you would want to refrain from folding your arms. eye contact too is important. They say the eyes are the door to the soul. When you make eye contact with your audience it is said you see deep into the soul. It also build a connection, warmth, confidence and eventually trust. For most public speakers it can be quite intimidating because you might meet a stare that is somethings intimidating, judgemental etc.. But as a trainer and coach by profession, I realise when I make eye contact with the person before me, I connect with them more. touch is also important but you don't want to go about touching people. You might be mistaken for a pervert! But there are some moment where a simple pat on the back, a soft touch on the hand, a hug, etc say much more than words. communication isn't only verbal, there is non verbal and this is where we fail most of the time.
