Be sure, however, that you genuinely mean \u201cbad attitude,\u201d and that your thoughts in this regard are not actually reflecting an underlying bias due to protected classifications like sex, race, color, religion, national origin or family status. We employment lawyers don\u2019t call that \u201cfire at will,\u201d we call it \u201cemployment discrimination,\u201d and it costs employers money. ",

            "answer_text": "In the US, unless the employee has a union or personal contract, you can fire an employee for having a bad attitude, for having a good attitude or having no attitude that can be measured at all. Most jobs in the US are at will jobs. This means that an employee can quite at any time without any notice and can be fired at any time for a good reason, a bad reason or no reason at all. Unless the employee is fired for a good reason they should be able to collect unemployment benefits. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely! If you have a poor attitude, your motivation and productivity can be significantly affected. You can also have a negative influence on your teammates and their morale. So, a bad attitude is not a good chemistry or fit for the company, and everyone will be better off if that attitude is gone. Of course, your manager should initially try to understand where the attitude is coming from and try to address it. But, at some point, it's better to part ways. ",
