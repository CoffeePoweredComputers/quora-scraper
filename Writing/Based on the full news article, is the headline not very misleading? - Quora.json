            "answer_text": "Based on the full news article, is the headline not very misleading? NY Post headlines, and articles, are always very misleading. (I remember it like this: If it\u2019s New York, the Post is a rag and the Times is real journalism; if it\u2019s Washington, DC, the Post is real journalism and the Times is a rag.) In this case, the Post is presenting in the headline one of two opposing stories contained in the body. In the family\u2019s story, the airline told the child\u2019s carer they were going to charge a luggage fee for a small lovey, then told them they were going to inject the child with a sedative. In the airline\u2019s story, the child became agitated, was sedated, and the carer opted not to fly. The child never made it to check-in and so the lovey was never an issue. I\u2019m not inclined to believe the airline. People who aren\u2019t trained in caring for autistic people tend to flip out when faced with autistic meltdowns. They get aggressive and use inappropriate extremes to try to somehow force the person in crisis to just knock it off. They escalate the meltdown to the point that their extreme measures start to look reasonable. I\u2019m not inclined to think the carer just went \u201cOh, he\u2019s having a rough day, so I guess we aren\u2019t going to fly but also let\u2019s sedate the kid.\u201d I think the carer made the best choice they felt they could, while everyone around them was pitching a fit and trying to force them to make bad choices. What a miserable day. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not in this case. While the NY Post is known for it\u2019s (sometimes) misleading and bombastic headlines that doesn\u2019t always reflect the true nature of events, in this case they are actually quoting in the headlines \u201cMom\u201d as to say that is her version of the event. Obviously the airline is saying otherwise, as mentioned later in the article, but there are always two sides to a story. The point of the article was to highlight the hardship that parents of autistic children face when being in the public arena, and that they often get mistreated by strangers who aren\u2019t sensitive enough to their situation. The headline shines a light on that sad fact. It doesn\u2019t matter now if the airline staff actually charged for the doll or not, or were they trying to sedate the boy, the fact itself that the mother went out in the open to express her outrage, that itself is worthy of mentioning, as she probably had good reason to do so. When a family is in distress and nobody comes to their aid, that should be a basis for Public awareness. Pointing that out in a news headline is not \u201cmisleading\u201d, even when there may be a slightly different version of what actually transpired. ",

This is a case of \u201che said, she said.\u201d I find it extremely hard to believe that the airline was going to charge a baggage fee for a doll. Baggage fees are just that\u2026baggage fees. I\u2019ve dealt with some crummy airlines. But never one that would deny a kid his doll. Being in PR and communications for a very long time, I could spend and eternity listing the times someone made an accusation and went to social media with it\u2026only for it to be completely untrue. Sorry, while there may be some bad handling on the airlines part, I think this may have been WAY overblown. Just my opinion. ",
