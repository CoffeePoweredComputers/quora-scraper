            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t really an average time because each type of article demands a different time investment. If you are writing about a topic you know well and the work doesn\u2019t require any outside research, then your completion speed will depend on your typing speed. If, on the other hand, you are working on a piece that requires you to perform significant research, you may find yourself spending 10 hours gathering information before you begin to type. I will say that being able to mentally compose your sentences and paragraphs while typing will speed your production process. The more you can think in complete, well-composed thoughts, the less editing you will need to do later. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been an editorial person for 40+ years. The time it takes me varies \u2014 it depends on a number of factors such as background research, interviews, my base knowledge of the topic, and time taken to fish around for illustrations. If all things are held constant, I tend to spend about 30\u201345 minutes per 1,000 words for the pure writeup stage The fact that I\u2019m a trained touch-typist also helps in the matter. The fact that I\u2019ve been doing editorial work for so long is a tremendous help. Professional writers write what they think rather than think about what they write (or should write or how to write). They get the writeup done first without agonising over word choice, spellings, grammar or whatnot, and then double back to revise and edit. ",
