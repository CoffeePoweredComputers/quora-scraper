            "answer_text": "I would suggest you to focus on one topic and explore various aspects of that topic to write on. Writing on newer topics every time will bore you, instead write on topics which interests you. Example, if you love writing on food, write on various types of food across India/ Globe. Interesting foods, weird foods, types of sea food, traditional food so on and so forth. This way it won't become monotonous for you, and you will have loads of ideas to write on. Have a great day! ",
