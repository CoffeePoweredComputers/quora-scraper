            "answer_text": "No one is born an expert. Just because someone goes to school and gets their papers, doesn\u2019t mean they really know what they are talking about in their field. This all depends on whether they are brave enough to think outside of the Academia box, and risk losing funding or teaching tenure, or the like, by offering new and inovative ideas about their chosen discipline. The best nonfiction writers are those who develop an interest and perform their own deep, and motived research, to learn all they can about some subject or topic. Their minds are not muddled or calcitrated with Academic indoctrination, and a personal imagination and willingness to present an alternative to the established line, makes these writers more interesting, and seriously more knowledgeable than someone who bought and payed-for a receipt known as \u201ca degree\u201d. I say this because, in the end, when writing a nonfiction, both the degreed and the non-degreed will research the same source material to back-up, as references, what they are presenting in the books. The main difference is the degreed will always present references to bolster the Academic indoctrination and the non-degreed will present a more honest view, on the same topic. I will get all manner of argument over this, but understand when I claim to be well-read, what that really means. I have often found books, especially those of a historical nature, better researched from writers not degreed by some learning institution who survive on funding which promote the status quo viewpoints. I am an expert on a variety of subject but I am not lettered, and I cringe at the notion of what my views would be if I were. There are already too many books on the market which pertuate the lie about things, and turn a total blind eye to truth because it is not what the institute that favored the writer with their degree, like or promote.

            "answer_text": "When I was running a pharmaceutical production team in an American Big Pharma in Singapore, I was not a pharmacy graduate but a mechanical & production one. So in some sense, I am not an expert when it comes to pharmaceuticals especially in asthma inhalers which we were manufacturing.  A Dry Powder Inhaler : I was manufacturing something similar. \u00a0I decided to spend my down time reading all the journals of how the drugs was discovered, the validation documents on how to bring what was discovered in the lab to scale on the factory floor and read more about asthma patients. I believe I arrived when I was questioned by health authorities one day. The question was a hypothetical one, basically , the auditor asked me , what would happen if one of the variables in manufacturing went out of control. I was able to answer firmly on the consequences it will do the drugs produced and how we can avoid it. So, how to know if you are an expert, you ill know when you have come to a point, where you know if you change something of a subject/product/solution, you can predict to a certain level accuracy its outcome. Then your writing will truly be engaging. ",
