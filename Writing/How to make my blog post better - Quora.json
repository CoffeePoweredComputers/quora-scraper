            "answer_text": "Today, good enough simply isn\u2019t. Not when millions of posts are published daily. Not when today\u2019s average post is 1,054 words; requiring anywhere from three hours to an entire day to write. Yikes! Ain\u2019t nobody got time for that. But, you still need the results, and you still want that powerful post that comes once in a blue moon. Here\u2019s the problem: Likely, your information is great, facts all check out. BUT: it\u2019s boring, it\u2019s not compelling enough to get people to sit up and take notice. Here\u2019s a few ways to grab the reader by the horns and truly connect them to the piece: Tip#1: Include a compelling \u2018hook\u2019 The pretentious-sounding \u201clede\u201d in a good article is what gets people to take the bait. A compelling narrative, fact, stat or fable at the beginning that literally hooks people into reading your post. Anecdotes Jon Morrow of CopyBlogger does this better than almost anyone. I find myself weeping like a little baby after reading his content: On Dying, Mothers, and Fighting for Your Ideas.  Reading the introduction of this piece feels like a story. It\u2019s about the doctor telling his mother about his condition, one that he\u2019ll be facing his entire life, bound to a wheelchair. Ingeniously, he builds incredible suspense, adding awkward pauses and intriguing dialogue before finally tying it back to the topic of the piece. As a result, you get lost in story, you get literally hooked into reading. It becomes a battle to stop reading and you can\u2019t close out now. Start on the Opposite Side of Where The Post Ends In this example above, Jon also delivers on this approach to writing his crafty hook. It starts in a vastly different place from where it ends. Misdirection becomes the norm. You expect one thing, only to discover the exact opposite, smashing any expectations you had, keeping you interested. Sometimes that could mean striking unlikely comparisons between two subjects, like Professional Chefs + Sales. The point: Misdirection catches the reader off guard, nearly forcing them to keep reading, and eventually, sharing your content. Lean On Your Angle What\u2019s an angle? Isn\u2019t that just my post topic? Let\u2019s get this defined, since it\u2019s of utmost importance. Topic = what you\u2019re writing about Angle = what side you\u2019re picking / how you convey the current topic of discussion Good? Good. Here\u2019s an example: This post: 5 Reasons No One\u2019s Reading Your Blog Posts. The topic is about blog post mistakes. It\u2019s about why people aren\u2019t sharing your content, and why they aren\u2019t sticking around for more than the first paragraph. BUT, the angle is about how YOU can\u2019t afford to be making these errors. Based on stats, evidence and proven examples, the angle hooks you in to care about what it says because there are consequences if you don\u2019t. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 You can check out the other 4 tips/reasons why people aren\u2019t reading or sharing your post (and how to fix them) here: 5 Reasons No One\u2019s Reading Your Blog Posts ",
