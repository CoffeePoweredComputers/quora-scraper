            "answer_text": "I am a big fan of Medium. Since the beginning of my career, I am reading various posts here. But I never had the courage or encouragement to share my views. Today, I am going to talk about why I am writing on Medium. To use it as a journalI need a place to write and share my experiences? Every day we go through several instances when we encounter good and bad experiences. I want to share those lessons with people who go through the same thing. Because it\u2019s good to learn from your mistakes, but it\u2019s excellent to learn from others. I have planned to write a story once a week and gradually increase it to once a day. If you are also planning to start sharing on Medium, talking about your personal and professional experience can be a great start. It will solely base on the audience you are targeting. 2. For Satisfaction Being a Content Writer and Marketer, I write on various topics. But when it comes to writing for my own, I always procrastinate or write on vague things. I have always loved writing. It gives me a sense of achievement. Writing for myself means I don\u2019t have to look out for any reference, no research required, and no word count foundation. 3. Reach out to like-minded people I always believe that if people are engaging with your story, it means they resonate with what you say. There is no rocket science. I don\u2019t write for 100 people. I write for that one ideal person who can take benefit from it. It can be your friend, a stranger, or someone who follows you dearly. If you engage with this post- highlight a phrase, give a clap, and tweet about it, I will instantly know that I address one of your pain points. You can also leave a comment to share what you liked the most about it. There is no right or wrong when you share your story. It\u2019s just the mindset that you have while writing. Not every day, I will feel the need to share such thoughts with you. 4. Improve my writing You must have understood by now that I make mistakes in writing. I am not ashamed of it because I learn daily. Medium is a great platform to share your thoughts in writing, and if I will leverage this free to use the platform to improve the way I write. If you are a writer or want to become one, start today. There is no wrong time to do the right thing. If you like the way I write, leave a comment, and clap for me to let me know what you liked or didn\u2019t like about my writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Medium is one of the best blogging platforms I have come across in recent years. The content is high-quality, you can write about literally anything, yes anything! No censoring or content monitoring that excludes certain topics. Also as it has probably the best SEO among blogging platforms in the business today- you can increase your rank and views of your post really quickly. I use Medium as a great tool for getting backlinks to my Quora profile or blog or anything else that I want to draw my audience to. The clapping system is really cool other than the comments editor which is the best I have seen so far. Most people, even if they have a blog, repost articles from there on to Medium to get more traffic. So go on and start posting! ",

When you log into your account, you see the posts of the writers who you follow. You will see their latest articles in your feed as and when they post. But that\u2019s only a part of it. Medium also allows you to follow categories of your interest. It offers you a range of categories to choose including Productivity, Startup, Podcasts, Art, Social Media, Science, Religion and whatnot. So, when someone publishes a story in the category that you follow, Medium will present it to you. What else? Well, I wrote about a few benefits in one of my articles.

            "answer_text": "No need for a website setup may be the first reason for being attracted by Medium, but the real benefit of Medium is another one. You\u2019ll soon notice that the problem number one, with writing, is getting read. Medium provides you an audience. Not a large audience as it may seem. A few readers will see you, at first. But story after story, you\u2019ll gain readers, and they will interact with you. This won\u2019t happen with an independent website unless you\u2019ve already a massive online reputation. At the same time, you need to grow as a writer, and by reading the stories of the others, and getting their feedback, you\u2019ll get in touch with different perspectives from other authors. This will help you as a writer and will help the growth of your audience at the same time. In a words, all of the Medium benefits boil down to one: the community. ",
