            "answer_text": "This is a not-fully developed question. If you mean on what surface can you write handwritten letters, well, pick any smooth surface that is about elbow high. If you mean in what noise conditions can you write, that is up to your own sense of discipline. Can you write in high-noise areas? Do you need quiet? Do you need music or the television playing? Or do you mean something else? More clarity would be nice. ",
