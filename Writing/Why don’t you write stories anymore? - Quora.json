            "answer_text": "I used to write a crap ton of weird-ass stories on Quora because I loved to write and I love giving a little bit of entertainment for those who read my stuff. Honestly, it was probably one of the things that kept me happy back then. It was just me, my keyboard, and my weird-ass brain thinking of some crazy fiction to write about. But then, it just wasn\u2019t fun anymore. It lost its appeal. It wasn\u2019t entertaining anymore. It felt like a chore to write. So my writing became a lot less frequent. I spent more time looking for questions that sparked my want to write than actually writing. Eventually though, I just stopped caring to write. The answers I wrote were not answers I really felt proud of writing, or felt anything about, really. And I didn\u2019t really have much of a reader base anyways, so why should I work to write for 3 hours straight so almost no one will read my work? Today though, after almost a few months since I stopped writing, I decided I wanted to write something. Something that I just wanna write. I already knew today that pretty much no one would read it, but I wanted to write for the sake of the art. So I looked for questions, but if anything, there\u2019s no questions even worth looking at from my recommendation. I looked at other peoples accounts, even willing to steal questions that they answered so I could just write something. But alas, nothing. Not a single question. I almost just exited the tab, about to give up, when I though about something I wanted to write about. I wanted to write about why I don\u2019t write. Why I don\u2019t really care about my following, or anything related to Quora. I\u2019ve been so inactive on Quora, I\u2019m surprised I just haven\u2019t deleted my account. I look on Quora to read once in a while, but I\u2019m greeted with some answers I really don\u2019t care about, like always. The quality never seems to really be there. I don\u2019t know why I even bother looking for something to read anymore. I wish I could just write about whatever the hell I wanted without feeling like it was pointless to write. \u2026At this point, I\u2019m rambling. No ones going to read anyways, so I don\u2019t even care to apologize. But the reasons I don\u2019t write anymore: Little motivationLittle rewardTime consumingBad questions don\u2019t spark any creative writingMore entertaining things to do (like talk to my fellow humans, watch anime, play games, be alone literally looking at a damn wall)More productive things to do (like homework, Japanese practice, practicing my instruments)I think that\u2019s enough reasons to explain why I don\u2019t write. Well yeah. Thanks for reading if you did. Also send questions you think are good if you think I\u2019ll like them. Only if you feel up to it though. Thanks in advance. Cya. ",
