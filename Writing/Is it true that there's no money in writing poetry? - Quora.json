            "answer_text": "In my honest opinion I believe there is a lot of money in writing poetry; when you think of that type of literature, your mind almost instantaneously go to the traditional foundation of the art. -When there are various ways of poetry, it can be expressed musically, as a short story, a diary entry, even using the prose technique. It\u2019s up to you how interesting you want to be; and usually when you\u2019re telling a story that is misunderstood and hard to interpret in a way that it becomes so intriguing that - the literature itself, turns into many interpretations - is how you know you found yourself a winner! Not only is it your story - it brings that saying, \u201cyou had to be there, you can't make this up!\u201d out in your craft of what your perspective was in whatever moment you experienced in your life. If that it is priceless to you, imagine how much you're worth to someone who\u2019ll never understand? This was an interesting question no matter how simple it may have seen to the single-minded lol no shade just a joke! =) -Ki Wi ",

            "answer_text": "I hope it\u2019s true that there\u2019s no money in writing poetry: that means that my poetry is not so bad. Otherwise, with all the money being made by good poets, I must be really bad because I\u2019m not getting it. If you want to see what\u2019s not making money you can look at Back Door Poetry - Kindle edition by Douglas Gilbert. Literature & Fiction Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. or a really good failure to prosper: The Murder of Asperger's Last Poet: The Poetry Legacy - Kindle edition by Douglas Gilbert. Literature & Fiction Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. I\u2019ve read poetry on the street, at open mikes in bars, I\u2019ve given away books, I\u2019ve donated books, and like a gambler I\u2019ve spent more money than I\u2019ve taken in. I\u2019ve written tragic, happy, romantic, satiric, philosophical, frivolous, free-verse, unfree, under and over a tree, a moon, a sun, a puddle of blood. None is money. ",
