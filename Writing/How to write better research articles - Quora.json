            "answer_text": "I find that a lot of writers, especially ones new to writing, are concerned with how to get words on to paper, especially for the initial draft of an article. The article can seem especially daunting when the writer outlines the paper by writing the headings, like \u201ctitle, \u201cabstract\u201d, \u201cintroduction\u201d, etc., and then tries to start filling in the blanks. This tends to lead to a lot of mental agony, because it is extraordinarily difficult to start writing a research paper from the beginning. Instead, I learned that it is always easiest to write from what you know best. It will help you put pen to paper, and it will help you craft a well-rounded document that includes just the right amount of scope at the beginning and end to first interest a reader and then leave them satisfied with your conclusions. Another bigger benefit of writing a manuscript in this order is that it will help make sure the flow of your writing is well suited to attracting and keeping a reader\u2019s attention. (If you are instead looking for tips only on improving your writing style, see point #8 below on a \u201cso what\u201d test you can walk yourself through to edit your own writing.) Recommended Manuscript Writing Order: Therefore, I recommend writing manuscripts in the following order, which starts from the most familiar parts that are the easiest to write. It then builds on what was already written to make the parts with a wider scope easier to think about and manage. Figures \u2013 Starting the paper with the figures forces an organizational structure and a story. By first assembling data into 4-8 concise figures that follow a logical order, the story and scope of the paper is set.Materials and methods \u2013 With the figures in place, it now becomes simple to write the first section of paper text, which will be the materials and methods required to collect the data that compose the figures. Conveniently, this is also the part of the work that should be the most familiar and therefore easiest to write, as it is the hands-on part of the work that you did and were intimately acquainted with on a daily basis.Results \u2013 Following logically from the materials and methods, the results describe what was seen and discovered when performing the experiments discussed in the materials and methods, and writing this section flows easily from that. I have some tips on writing up your results here: Results need context, too! How to maintain interest in the details.Discussion \u2013 Often drafted simultaneously with the results section, the discussion provides the reader with a sense of what your results mean and how they fit into the context of the field \u2013 widening the scope of the paper back out to the field as a whole. For that reason, after a section of the results are written, it is then much easier to ponder these results and draft a brief description of what they tell you and why they are important. You can find very detailed tips on writing the discussion here: Kaycie Butler's answer to What are the simple tips for writing discussion part of the scientific articles? Is it needed to summarize results in the discussion section?Introduction \u2013 After the discussion is written, it becomes obvious what the key points of the research are, what background of the field is required knowledge for the reader to understand the research and place it into context, and what competing or corroborating results in the field have recently shown. This makes writing the introduction AFTER the discussion is already composed a very simple exercise of essentially filling-in-the-blanks, which consists of inserting details about the relevant information required to understand the discussion.Conclusion \u2013 The conclusion is written after the discussion had been laid out, and this section does not summarize the results but tells the reader exactly why this research matters and why it is important to the field. It should take what the information from the discussion and show why those discoveries are important and the impact they have on science\u2026ie., why is it worth publishing and reading this paper? Additionally, the conclusion should flow smoothly from the introduction, showing the reader how the questions about holes in the field that were posed in the introduction were addressed in this paper. I wrote a lot of details about what to think about when writing a conclusion here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I write a conclusion for a research paper?Title and Abstract \u2013 These parts are the final touches of the paper \u2013 essentially a cover sheet to the manuscript that is designed to attract attention and interest. The most effective way to write them, therefore, is after the manuscript is finished such that they best reflect the story that is contained in the manuscript and all of the details about the story outline and relevant impact on the field have already been worked out. You can find a detailed formula for how to choose a good title here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I create a research title?. You can also find a formula for writing an abstract here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I write a research abstract? or go to my website (link in abstract post) to download a very detailed guide to writing an abstract.Editing using the \u201cSo What\u201d Test - Finally, after you have written a draft and are editing your work, address your writing by asking the following questions: Does this sentence add to my paper?, What does the reader learn from this sentence? Is this knowledge relevant for understanding my work as a whole?, Is the point of this sentence clear, or is it too convoluted and vague?, If I removed this word/phrase/sentence, would the meaning of my writing change? OR, how does my story change when I remove this sentence and is that acceptable?, Is this point understandable for my audience, meaning are the terms and concepts either available to the common base level of knowledge available to my readers or have they been appropriately explained? You can find more details about the \u201cso what\u201d test here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I make my writing more clear and concise? My writing is horrific in my opinion. In my university, we (my peers and I) were encouraged to use Joseph Williams' style guide to help with our writing.Feedback - Science doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and neither does good scientific writing! Never forget to get feedback on your writing early and often. It can help catch mistakes, both major and minor, can point out areas that are confusing or difficult for a reader, and can ultimately greatly improve the quality of work you are putting out in the world.Best of luck improving your writing in research articles. Improving your writing is a a journey - it will get better and easier the more you do it. So\u2026write, write, and write some more. And remember to appreciate how far you\u2019ve come! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! Writing Research papers is a daunting task and something that just gets better with practice. The following would be my suggestions to ace writing a good research article: Have a central (overarching) research question. What question does your research mainly answer? It is fine to have multiple questions that you answer but it should ideally all tie back to a central theme.Correct Structure. Typically, you have Abstract > Introduction > Methods > Results > Discussion. If you are publishing in a peer-reviewed journal, I like to see a detailed methods section for reproducibility of the results.Avoid Verbosity. No one wants to read long, winding statements. Keep it short. Keep it simple. You can use software like Grammarly to ensure that your sentence structure is right.Keep it simple, baby! Tying up with point 3, remember that a scientific research article is not a Liberal Arts essay writing project. Do not use complex vocabulary if not needed. This is not the place to let all your GRE/TOEFL skills out. Otherwise, reviewers might just label your writing as \u201cDense\u201d.Plagiarism? No No No. I think one of the easiest ways to do an academic suicide is to plagiarize. Most institutions have a zero-tolerance policy to that. Before you write your paper, note down bullet points of what you actually want to say. Close or hide your reference articles to avoid subconsciously copying their language.Cite, cite, cite! Make sure you cite every reference and almost every scientific fact that you put in there. Also helps with point 5.Proofread, multiple times, multiple eyes. When I write papers, I think they\u2019re the best. Until I have my post-doc read them. She just edits the crap out of them. The point being, we tend to overestimate our work. So have multiple people read your paper (of course not the kind of people that want to scoop your every idea) and suggest edits. It might also be a good idea to have someone junior in the lab read it as if they can\u2019t understand it, you might want to make your paper easier to read.That\u2019s all that I can think of.
