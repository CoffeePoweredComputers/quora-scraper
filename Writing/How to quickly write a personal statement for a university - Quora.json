            "answer_text": "Your personal statement is really a true story about yourself, written in a narrative style. It\u2019s not an essay like you write in high school, with intro, supporting paragraphs, and conclusion. This is creative non-fiction. All of the elements that apply to writing a short story apply to writing a good personal statement. Things like having a punchy opening and \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d will demonstrate your good writing ability in this situation. In terms of content, there is obviously a \u201cquestion\u201d or \u201cprompt\u201d that you\u2019re answering, and it should absolutely answer what they\u2019re asking. But as I said, you\u2019re going to share a story from your life with them that illustrates that answer, you will NOT say, \u201cThe person who influenced me the most in my life is\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe time when I learned something that changed my view in life is\u2026\u201d NO! Aside from answering the question and showing them you have good writing skills, you want to try to incorporate details that demonstrate personal characteristics that a college would want you to have as a student. Colleges want students who are goal-focused, independent, and can work well with others. There are many other characteristics, too. I\u2019m sure you can think of some I didn\u2019t mention! So if you can subtly incorporate elements into your story that show you possess these kinds of traits, that makes it even better! ",

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by quickly? Is it 1 hour or 1 day or 1 week or more? Whatever may be your definition and speed of generating a personal statement, please keep in mind that you need to produce a comprehensive and coherent personal statement. A good personal statement requires considerable thought and it takes more than 3 or 4 iterations before it reaches the desired level of quality. Do not be hasty, there are no shortcuts here without a \u2018cut\u2019 in the desired outcome. ",
