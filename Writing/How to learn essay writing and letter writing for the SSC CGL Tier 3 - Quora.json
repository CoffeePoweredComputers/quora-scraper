            "answer_text": "I have given SSC CGL tier-3, 2017 and managed to score 70. Also, I wrote CGL tier3, 2018.. result of which is yet to be declared. Honestly, I just practised few essays and letters on A-4 sheets before appearing both times in CGL tier3. But I won't suggest you to do the same as amount of effort needed to get a required output varies on individual basis in exams. I won't emphasize here on the exam pattern as that info can be easily accessible on google. So, I would simply put it in a manner which I think can be proved helpful. 1- Read instructions on the first page of your answer booket very carefully to save yourself from getting out of the exam process even after scoring decent marks. Especially the line \" Candidates are advised not to mention any personal details (real or imaginary) in the answer booklet otherwise their answer booklet won't be evaluated and will be awarded zero marks for using unfair means i.e UFM to pass an examination\". According to SSC, this means you're not supposed to write anything in 'Letter' apart from what is provided in the question. So let's just say if sender's address given in the question is incomplete, don't try to complete it by adding any imaginary details like - 116, ABC colony, or anything. If receiver's address is not given then skip it , Don't write it by adding any imaginary receiver's address from your side just to complete the format of a letter. Otherwise, you'll given zero marks on the basis of UFM(unfair means). (It may sound absurd here but this is what happened in SSC CHSL tier2 this year as 4500 candidates of CHSL got disqualified on the basis of UFM in this manner and result of CGL tier-3, 2018 is yet to be declared). Although issue got resolved lately and since this wasn't notified to the candidates in the notification or admit card, also it's difficult to define what detail is imaginary in the answer booklet. SSC has given one time exemption to these 4500 candidates after thousands of grievances were sent by Candidates of CGL and CHSL to the respective authorities, multiple twitter compaigns were done and representions were sent to SSC HQ. Anyways that is another story. 2- Divide the topics of essays in categories like- social issues, Popular govt. schemes, Technology, Environment conerns, et cetera. And then write different topics for essays in their respective categories. Also mark the topics, which you think are 'very important' and these topics could be as basic as Education, Employment,Corruption, some very popular govt. scheme like Ayushman bharat , etc. 3- Start collecting information on these topics and note down only important points..as you just have to write 250-275words. 4- For Letters, Format is very important part. Just go through some formal letters on some important matters and have different introductory lines in mind which you can use while writing letter for different purposes and practise few. Again, here too you have to write just 150-175 words , so make it succinct . 5- Now very important , which can fetch you those extra 8-10marks overall in tier-3. Try to write your Essay and letter in neat and clean handwriting, try not to over write and cutting. As content matters but you can't neglect the presentation as well. Topics for essay asked in previous CGL tier-3 exams-2016- \"In the event of an earthquake, for your safety, what you should do and what you should not do\". 2017- \"How far demonetization has achieved its objective\"? 2018- \"Importance of education in present time\". Lastly, I would say if you have prepared well for English until tier2 then you need not worry. It's just one another paper and you will easily get through . Some topics I note down for CGL18 tier3 back then.  Hope it helps.",

You have to read and write and the process should go on till you find ground beneath your feet. Let's discuss how one can improve writing essay and letter for CGLE tier III. Starting with essay, decide a topic and brainstorm your mind on that particular topic, jot down all the details that you can recall and try to arrange them in a logical order. Make an outline of all the details. Generally, an essay is divided into three parts and they are Introductory part, main body and conclusion. The outline should follow this order and after doing this start writing. After you have written your essay read it again and make all the necessary changes. Now google the same topic and compare how logical and effective your essay is and what changes/improvement you could have made, this is how you can improve your essay writing. Coming to letter. It is of two types, namely Formal letter and informal letter. I hope you are aware of the formats of both these letter. Now read 10 to 20 varieties of each kind of letter and then start writing you will automatically feel the difference. For your help you can take the help of books such as *151 essays* authored by S C Gupta of Arihant Publication and *A handbook of letter writing* authored by SC Gupta of Arhihant Publication.
