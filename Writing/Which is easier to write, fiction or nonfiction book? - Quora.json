            "answer_text": "non fiction is the easiest to write, and by far. Because when you are writing non-fiction, no one will accuse of being a boring, grey, annoying writer in \u2018literary\u2019 terms. Writing fiction (\u2018literary writing\u2019) works through \u2018contagion\u2019, not content. Meaning that if something is chilling inside your mind (and you have very good writing skills), that very same thing will be chilling inside the reader\u2019s mind (soul) too. And so, having feelings inside of you while writing a fictional story - and getting those feelings on paper for real - is the real deal. Original ideas? Ideas are original if you think they are while writing them down (and your style is so good to infect the reader too with your own feelings). Unpredictable? A novel is unpredictable if it\u2019s unpredictable to YOU while writing it down, but you need some balls to improvise a 200 pages, one-year-commitment complete novel. On the other side, while writing non-fiction if the content is interesting, the read will be interesting. If the content is boring, the read will be boring; as easy as that. Do some searches and publish the result of your searches to a public interested in them and not knowing about them. In other words, while writing non-fiction you won\u2019t need to mess with your own unconscious (which is barely impossible by definition, or it would rather be conscious, and thus unconsious not) and while writing non-fiction, you won\u2019t find yourself struggling for getting your unconsious on paper (which is so extremly difficult most writers just can\u2019t stand it). Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Neither is easy to write - both require style and both require research - while Fiction need not relate to fact - non fiction books are about facts and real time events. Test yourself - write a 500 word short story - Fiction - I am the last man on earth when there is a knock on the door Non Fiction - One day in my life See which of them is easier to write and at the same time is a 5 Star Short Story and you will see for yourself.
