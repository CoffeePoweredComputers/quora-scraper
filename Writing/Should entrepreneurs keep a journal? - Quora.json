            "answer_text": "If you are a leader in any capacity there are typically many balls to juggle, people to lead, strategies to develop, problems to solve, and opportunities to tackle. The pace is often fast and the demands are unyielding. Unfortunately, carrying so much weight on your shoulders alone can feel like a lot of pressure and cause intense physical, emotional, and intellectual strain leading to overwhelm, exhaustion, frustration, and poor decision-making. In circumstances where the responsibilities are great and the stakes are high, it can be extremely valuable to slow down, take a breather and collect your thoughts. A \u2018time out\u2019 will help you take a step back and examine the direction you are heading and assess your progress. This kind of mental break will allow you to figure out what you want and how to get there. The question is \u2013 what does an effective mental break look like? How can taking time away from the workload, actually provide relief? The most effective executives turn to journaling as a powerful tool to help them work through some of the challenges they face and use journaling as a mechanism for efficient and rapid personal growth.
