            "answer_text": "I think the most annoying thing that happens when someone comments is a clear lack of actually reading the article. I have one post that people come to from Google and ask to have their link added to the post, which I don\u2019t mind at all because I want that post to be an amazing resource. But the problem is, people come, post their link, and usually make some comment that shows they didn\u2019t really read the article to begin with. So here are my top 3 suggestions: Use the writer\u2019s name. Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s the owner of the blog either. It might be a guest post. Take a few seconds to view the author\u2019s name or check for a notice that the post is a guest post.Actually read the article and comment on a specific point. Shows you actually took the time to read it and you\u2019re not just there to drop a link. Especially useful if you\u2019re looking to work with that blog in the future.Continue the conversation. Ask a question or share a similar story from your own life. This promotes engagement from other comments and the blog author. It\u2019s a surefire way to make sure your comment is noticed. is a sea of others.Those are my best tips, but if you\u2019d like, you can check out my full list of ways to write better comments. Hope this clarifies the process for you! ",
