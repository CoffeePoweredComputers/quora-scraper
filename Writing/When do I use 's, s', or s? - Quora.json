Here are a couple of web references that may help you: Apostrophe Rules - English Grammar Rules & Usagehttps://grammar.yourdictionary.com \u203a punctuation \u203a apostrophe-rules Apostrophe Rules for Possessives Use an apostrophe + S ('s) to show that one person/thing owns or is a member of something. ...Use an apostrophe after the \"s\" at the end of a plural noun to show possession. ...If a plural noun doesn't end in \"s,\" add an apostrophe + \"s\" to create the possessive form.Rules regarding the formation of plurals - English Grammarhttps://www.englishgrammar.org \u203a rules-formation-plurals Some singular nouns ending in \u2013o, form their plurals by simply adding \u2013s. Nouns ending in a consonant + -y, form their plurals by changing that \u2013y into \u2013i and adding \u2013es. Most nouns ending in \u2013f or \u2013fe form their plurals by changing \u2013f or \u2013fe into v and adding \u2013es. ",
