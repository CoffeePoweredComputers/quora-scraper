            "answer_text": "I think maybe some answers are using kindness and gratitude interchangeably - though the way it\u2019s described sounds more like kindness to me. I think practicing gratitude really could have revolutionary effects on someone\u2019s life - effects that never end. But I don\u2019t think it will happen the way people currently practice it. See if you feel bad, because maybe you feel like no one loves you, or you don\u2019t love you, or you feel like you never got your chance, or didn\u2019t live up to your potential, or failed - some people will say to make a list of everything you have that you\u2019re grateful for (a gratitude list), and that soon you will see how much you really have. I think there may be a better way. Instead of making a list of everything you have, make a list of the good things and the good fortune that OTHER PEOPLE HAVE. Whether it\u2019s your neighbors new car, or the person who got promoted over you (even though you think you are better), or the newly elected politician that you spent months hating and campaigning against. Eventually, add in the types of people you think are \u201cbad\u201d and corrupt - maybe even someone who stole directly from you - and list the good things and the joys they have. Now be grateful. NOT FOR YOURSELF, BUT FOR EVERY OTHER HUMAN BEING. Feel so much happiness for these other people that every fiber of your heart and soul wishes with all its might that they have the happiest of lives and that they get everything they ever felt they needed or wanted. Wish them Love and peace and perfection. Now, who could feel like they were a failure or not enough after that (might take some practice ;) )? Our happiness comes from rooting for everyone else. We no longer need to be in the race because we are good, we are strong, we see that nothing we ever had made us feel as good as wishing other people had all that they dreamt of. Never or rarely before have we felt the emotion of beauty overwhelm us as we do then. Make a list about what you have, and every year it will get smaller and smaller until, like my 98 year old grandmother, you\u2019re just grateful to wake up another day. Make a list about what everyone else has, and it grows and grows and grows, just like our hearts. Love, Nick ",

            "answer_text": "Gratitude simply is nothing but conveying thanks to people. It suffuses humility in a person. It makes one down to earth. If you see it as a task it seems tooo easy to thank people, however it is something that most people tend to ignore due to some or the other reason. These reasons are mostly conmected to ego and pride of the individuals.  Expressing gratitude has a lot of pluses. Many times people connect it with their superiority and drop the idea of thanking. But, I am of the opinion that one should thank every possible person for every small part they play in your life, even if it is for few seconds. \u201cI have a habit of thanking everyone and trust me, it feels so good after that. Whether I ask a friend for a bottle of water and he throws it at me, a waiter who serves me with food, a random guy who explains the route or a cab driver who has picks and driops me safely to my house late night, I never forget to thank these people.\u201d If you start doing it you will find a difference in yourself too. People around you will get a positive vibe coming from you and it feels good if you can emit some optimism in your nearby surroundings. ",
