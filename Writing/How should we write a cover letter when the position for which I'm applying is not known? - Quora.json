            "answer_text": "When you start applying to jobs, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the process of putting together a cover letter. Unlike your resume, you should be sending out a different or slightly modified version of your cover letter for each separate role. After all, a tailored cover letter can be what separates you from your competition for the role! However, having to constantly write a new cover letter can feel tedious over time. This is where having a cover letter template to refer to can be helpful. By having one, you\u2019ll be able to act more efficiently during the application process. Here are 3 elements of a cover letter template that can make a difference: Have a tailored opening statement When putting together your cover letter template, you\u2019ll want to reserve space for an enticing opening statement. This could be the first impression a hiring manager will have of you, so the hiring manager might not even make it to your resume if your letter isn\u2019t compelling enough. To get their attention, put your company research to use and make a connection between yourself and the organization. This way, the hiring manager will know you\u2019ve taken the time to learn about the company and that you\u2019re genuinely interested in the position. Make a clear pitch Since your resume is where you\u2019ll be highlighting your technical skills, you should use your cover letter template to pitch your soft skills. In other words, this is the part of your job application where you can make a case for yourself as the best fit for the role. To do this, reference back to the job posting and see what the company is looking for in the job description. If they say they\u2019re looking for a good problem-solver, use your cover letter to talk about past experiences where you had to address an issue, how you approached it, and what the end results were. End with a strong closing statement As you finish putting together a cover letter template you can always refer to, it\u2019s important to show your commitment to and desire for the role. To do this, be sure to include your intention of pursuing next steps by saying you look forward to scheduling a time to interview, further discuss the opportunity, and how you can contribute to the role.

            "answer_text": "I assume the cover letter is to go with an email resume or application. Where, in a formal business letter, you would put the recipient\u2019s company name and address, just put whatever information you have. I assume you know the company name, and perhaps the name or title of the person to whom you are sending your resume. So just write something like: Ms. Jane SmithHuman Resources ManagerABC Companyapplications@abccompany.com Even if you don\u2019t know the person\u2019s name, you obviously will be applying to the HR department so either \u201cHuman Resources Manager\u201d or, in the case of a small company \u201cHiring Manager\u201d is good (without the name, if you don\u2019t know it.) Even if they don\u2019t have a designated hiring manager, someone is doing the hiring so at that time can be addressed as hiring manager. ",
