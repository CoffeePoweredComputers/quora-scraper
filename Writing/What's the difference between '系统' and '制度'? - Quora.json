            "answer_text": "Both could translate as \u201csystem\u201d in English \u7cfb\u7edf is same as the English word \u2018system\u2019, but Chinese prefer to use this in engineering, biology, technology, computer\uff0cmathematics etc. For example, \u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08eco system\uff09\uff0c \u5b89\u5353\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Android OS\uff09\uff0c\u6d88\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08digestive system\uff09. However, is also okay to mean a social system. For example, \u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf \u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf \uff08\u6559\u80b2\u5236\u5ea6 \u533b\u7597\u5236\u5ea6 are also right\uff09 When you use \u7cfb\u7edf or \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 as an adjective, it means \u201cmethodic\u201d. \u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002 \u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002 \u5236\u5ea6 is only used in social science field. It means \u201cInstitution\u201d. And \u5236\u5ea6 is somehow more official. For example, \u793e\u4f1a\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5236\u5ea6\uff0c\u5730\u65b9\u5236\u5ea6\uff08\u5730\u65b9 means local\uff09\uff0c\u201c\u4e00\u56fd\u4e24\u5236\u201d\u5236\u5ea6 etc ",
