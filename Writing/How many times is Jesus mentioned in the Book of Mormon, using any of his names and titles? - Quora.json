            "answer_text": "I actually did a read through once where I underlined every reference to Jesus Christ as I came across it and circled the page total in the bottom outside corner. I never tallied all my page totals (project for some future day), but I have some observations on the number of references: It\u2019s easier to count the number of pages that don\u2019t contain a reference to Jesus than to count the actual number of times His name or Person is mentioned. There are less than five. If memory serves accurately, the highest count on a page was 53.The figure commonly given\u2013 3,923ish, is not concrete. The ambiguity arises in the famous \u201cIsaiah Chapters\u201d of 2 Nephi. In these (and other passages) the Book of Mormon prophet Nephi (and others later) quotes(s) the Old Testament prophet Isaiah extensively. (I\u2019ve done word-for-word comparisons of these versus the corresponding chapters of Isaiah in the King James Bible and they are NOT the same, although a study of the differences is worth a write up of it\u2019s own.) Isaiah employs myriad titles and symbols to reference Jesus in His role as the Messiah, and it\u2019s not always clear if he\u2019s talking about the Savior or someone else, or someone who serves wholly or partially as a type and shadow in similitude of Jesus. How do you count something like that? Does every reference to the individual who prefigures the Savior count as a reference to Him, or does the whole passage count as one reference to Jesus because it\u2019s about one person who prefigures him? There\u2019s also some dizzying use of the term \u201cthe LORD.\u201d LDS theology holds that the Jehovah of the Old Testament is the pre-mortal Jesus ordering the work of Salvation and Exaltation for this world in advance of His advent here. As any Jehovah\u2019s Witness (with whom The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is NOT affiliated) will quickly tell you, when one encounters in one\u2019s reading the word \u201cLORD\u201d in all capitals in the King James Bible, it is a reference to Jehovah and is rendered so in other English translations. (The actual name Jehovah only appears 4 times in the King James translation.) One infers the same meaning behind the term in the Book of Mormon quotations. However, there are a handful of cases where following the winding trail of pronouns and details of certain statements in these passages leaves a person with some suspicion that they may have encountered an exception to the rule. In both of these situations, the reader who wishes to make a count has to make a call based on their level of education on the subject and their impressions from the Holy Ghost. For this reason, although I find the foregoing figure useful, I don\u2019t consider it or any other to be definitive.",
