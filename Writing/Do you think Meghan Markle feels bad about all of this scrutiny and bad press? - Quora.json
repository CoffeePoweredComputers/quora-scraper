            "answer_text": "Where do these people come from? We have one person answering who says the Duchess is \"defiant and obstinate.\" She also says again, after being called on it before, that the Duchess did not offer to pay her father's expenses and provide housing at the wedding. Hey, do not let the truth stop you! That is, to put it bluntly, just fiction. The Duchess had arranged, before her father sold staged pictures to the press, to give him the same help with travel and housing she had arranged through the Royal family for her mother. The exact same. So the answer saying \"Poor Thomas, mistreated and ignored\" are based on fantasy. More fantasy - that the Duchess is the only royal whose staff leave. The Queen lost her entire kitchen staff recently, plus others, but you do not see the haters or gutter press mentioning that. The truth is, working for the royals is prestigious, but does not pay well, and the hours are terrible. So people come, work and gain entry to that world, and then go find more lucrative employment. And the weepy answer that says: \"a grandfather deserves to celebrate his grandchild,\" should mention how poor Thomas (I don't care about any of my children or grandchildren) Markle has five grandchildren already. And he sees none of them. And he has a relationship with none of them. Not even a card on their birthdays or a Merry Christmas kid! Nor are those the only family members Thomas (If I cannot sell something about you I don't bother with you) Markle doesn't speak to or bother with; WRONG: he does not speak to his first ex-wife, his second ex-wife, his son, and all five of his grandchildren. Let us say that again: he does not have anything to do, not even speaking to, or sending a card, to two of his own children, and all 5 of his grandchildren. So for the weepy questions asking \"Will Meghan Markle\u2019s father be allowed to meet his grandchild after she has the baby?,\" they should mention he already has 5 grandchildren he ignores. Why would he want to meet his new 6th grandchild since he ignores the other 5? MONEY. Thomas (I don't give two dead flies about my pregnant daughter OR her soon to be child) Markle wants money; all the money he can get from selling his daughter out, and if he could sell his grandchild yet to be out, he would; he tried to extort a photo out of the Duchess in his answer to her letter imploring him to stop lying about her so he could sell that! Thomas (I would sure love to sell an interview about my grandchild, and God I would get a million for a picture of the little money maker!) Markle has no relationship whatsoever with any of his 5 grandchildren now, why would any sane person invite him to sell the new baby's toys? Then we have the Narcissism loons. They don't know the woman. They never met the woman. They only know what you can read in the Mail, or saw on the tube. They have absolutely no training or expertise in psychiatry, but feel entitled to make a diagnosis about someone they never met and never spoke to. They ASSUME a lie based solely on something the media printed. The media prints many things, at least a significant portion of which are absolutely untrue. Their lack of anything approaching knowledge is simply staggering. Further, not that the facts faze them, every single person who worked with the Duchess, every neighbor she had, was questioned by investigators for the Daily Mail and other media organizations. They, unlike the haters, actually know the woman, and not one had a bad word to say about her. What they are doing, is bullying. I have seen bullying go from interpersonal bullying to a particularly vicious kind of anonymous kind of bullying done from the safety of one's home. I am sorry you folks making up mental health diagnoses cannot see that making assumptions about someone you never met, and don't know, and attacking them with a phony \"diagnosis\" is not just wrong, but despicable. She should mention that ",

            "answer_text": "No, I do not. She is defiant and obstinate. Another longtime staff member resigned today. She also asked the Queen if she could have her own separate charity enterprise, Meghan-style. She was denied. Meghan refuses to read what is written about her. \"It's just noise,\u201d according to her. It is reported that The Queen has requested that Meghan fix things with her father. She refuses to even consider doing so. I, too, had a complicated relationship with my own father. I remember him making his way into Boston to see my newborn son at the hospital. I was moved and transformed by seeing the love he had for my son and his grandson. I hope Meghan does not deprive herself or her father of this healing moment. If William and Harry can forgive Camilla for her role in destroying their parents\u2019 marriage, I don\u2019t understand why Meghan cannot forgive her father for falling on hard times. He had never met Harry and was not helped with the expenses that would be incurred in attending such a glamorous affair. He was set up to fail. It\u2019s too bad Meghan does not have the generosity of spirit to have a heart to heart with her dad. Harry has had to make peace with his father\u2019s mistress. His mother died at 36, partly because she was forced into the single life. If Harry has the strength to be in Camilla\u2019s presence, perhaps Meghan should learn from him. Harry did not suffer from hurt feelings as Meghan is doing, he actually lost the most central figure in his life at age 12. Mother-Love is magnificent and irreplaceable. I sincerely hope that Meghan gives up the notion that she\u2019s perfect. None of us are but a grandfather deserves to celebrate his grandchild. ",

            "answer_text": "I think she finds it abhorrent. For people who didn\u2019t follow her prior to her romance with Prince Harry\u2026there were those of us in the US who were a fan of the TV show suits and for the seven consecutive seasons that she played her character she did a good job and her character was a favorite character in a highly successful TV show on the USA network. It was one of their top rated shows. Prior to that she had starred, I repeat starred, in two Hallmark movies and was in a third British made movie called \u201canti-social\u201d which was very edgy and the public didn\u2019t take to the film very much because of that, however all three stars one of which was Meghan Markle played the roles very well. she has also had guest star roles in single episodes of various successful television series here in the US. She still collects royalties from all of her past acting work\u2026 She made an excess of $5 million off of \u201csuits\u201d alone and is estimated to be worth quite a bit more than that just in her own right prior to her marriage to the prince.She had a very successful lifestyle blog which made her a lot of money from affiliate advertising that attached itself to her blog. And her father Thomas Markle tried to claim that he put her through college. However, documentation shows that she had earned scholarships and worked two side jobs to pay for her college education\u2026 All by her self. She earned a bachelors degree with a double major in international studies because she considered working in politics on behalf of women, and theater. She scored, on her own prestigious internship in the US Embassy in Buenos Aires. She went on to lend her voice to the united nations on behalf of the clean water project and became a respected spokes woman in the United Nations for gender equality and was a 2015 keynote speaker to the UN assembly on gender equality and female empowerment. And she came to the table with the royal family financially independent, confident, and a self-made woman who was beholden to nobody. She had no problem admitting where she came from, where she had been, the fact that she had been married before, and felt no need to apologize for having a voice. Up to that point she had been very proud of her father and grateful to both of her parents\u2026 But she did not foresee that her father, who owed thousands and thousands of dollars in back taxes & had bolted from the United States and was living across the border in Mexico would see her as a golden goose to profit off of her. That\u2019s a fact that all these people pitying Thomas Markel never touch on\u2026 He cheated on his taxes and had to run across the border. The so-called family that claimed that she was now disrespecting them because she was becoming Royal were never family to her when she was growing up\u2026 Her sister deeply resented Thomas\u2019s marriage to a black woman and deeply resented Thomas\u2019s love of Megan. Megan made a point of being present when Samantha graduated with her degree but Samantha did not return the favor when Meghan graduated. This shady family that wanted no part of her suddenly came out of the woodwork and have been making money from the price on Megan\u2018s head ever since making claims that cannot be proven in any way shape or form and why can\u2019t they be proven? Because Megan was never really allowed to have a relationship with them because they didn\u2019t want it. I really believe that a lot of the negative press that Megan and Harry have had to deal with owed its roots to her money grubbing family. And Thomas needs to get his story straight. Right after the wedding, he appeared on good morning Britain and was interviewed by Piers Morgan and he readily admitted he had screwed up with the press but that Harry and Megan had forgiven him, and desperately wanted him to come to the wedding, and had made elaborate preparations to fly him here and grand accommodations for him during his length of stay that was planned. And they continued to talk regularly on the phone up until Thomas announced he was not coming because of a heart problem. Prince William and another member of the royal family actually stated that Megan and Harry were both in tears that Thomas was not coming to the wedding. People have questioned why Harry and Megan didn\u2019t postpone the wedding until Thomas could be here\u2026 That\u2019s a ridiculous question. Royal weddings take a lot of planning, guests are invited, the chapel was booked,Frogmoor had to be booked for the reception, and another royal wedding was going to be coming up months after their\u2018s, which takes enormous planning. But they did plan to change their honeymoon plans to include a trip to the west to see Thomas but then Thomas couldn\u2019t stop talking to the press and making money off of Megan and Harry and the stepsister or half sister got in the act and stirred the pot and making the trip became out of the question. At this date and time so much as happened and the decision has been made that they want to step back and start an independent life. But in the days between the wedding and present day the palace Internet security and their mainline security had to spend a great deal of time carefully going through all of the racist threats coming through the royal social media aimed at Meghan which included threats to her life and the Neo-Nazi assassination threat made against Harry because they viewed him as a race traitor. And you can Google all of that because it is well documented in reliable mainline main stream press. The neo-Nazi group plotting Prince Harry\u2019s assassination were actually discovered, prosecuted, and jailed. As for Thomas Markle and everybody pitying him I don\u2019t understand why the British people pity a man who says that the \u201cRoyals owe me and I need to receive a reward\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to keep doing interviews and making money \u2018cause it\u2019s time to take care of Daddy\u201d. Her half sister Samantha loves to appear on good morning Britain as this demure disabled woman who comes across as well spoken and apologetic for her evil sister Megan and her half brother is giving interviews all for money\u2026. it\u2019s all about getting paid because they want their pot of gold. Piers Morgan never bothers to ask Samantha Markel, the half-sister, why she dared to attack Queen Elizabeth for not giving her father his own coat of arms. When Megan was officially married to prince harry the queen issued her her own coat of arms as a member of the royal family. That is the protocol and tradition. Kate, Duchess of Cambridge was also given a code of arms and because her family are British citizens who have done charitable work in the U.K. they were also given their own cost of arms. But tacky Thomas and Samantha are not British citizens and they have done nothing positive for the United Kingdom and there is no protocol, no precedent whatsoever that the queen could find to justify giving them a coat of arms. So Samantha went on television and then distressed and attacked Queen Elizabeth for that but Piers Morgan never addresses that because it doesn\u2019t fit in to his narrative\u2019s main motive which is to get even with a Meghan for moving away from their friendship. She was encouraged by the RF to cut her Media ties and only go through the royal ROTA. Piers should know that. And Piers Morgan gets on television and talks about his great affection for Queen Elizabeth and how concerned he is for her yet he adds to the tremendous angst of her and the RF with his persistent and extremely raging attacks on Megan and even invites people onto his show who are experts on racial bias in the UK\u2026 He specifically invites them for their credentials on the subject and then as they are speaking to the subject that he\u2019s brought them for he persistently cuts them off shouts above them so they cannot be heard because he doesn\u2019t want to admit that there is racial bias in the attacks on Meghan Markle\u2026 but when your newborn who is only a few days old is compared to a chimpanzee that is racism. Comparing people of African heritage to gorillas, apes and monkeys is a centuries old racist theme. And then there was the BBC caricature of Megan entitled \u201cthe angry black woman\u201d and the caricature image showed Megan as a very dark skinned with very big red lips\u2026 Clearly not true to her appearance and clearly racist\u2026 She was compared to straight Outta Compton, they claimed that her mother lived in a gang war scarred house in the ghetto\u2026.none of which is true. I watched Megan\u2018s face as she carried out her duties in the United Kingdom and in all of these public appearances she has that same very fixed smile on her face at all times which is the mark of a woman under great stress but determined to maintain control and be graceful under pressure. But other people refer to that smile as arrogance because they\u2019re shallow. I was appalled when Prince William came out after the announcement that Harry and Megan wanted to step back from senior royal positions and stated \u201cI can no longer put my arm around my brother\u201c\u2026 What a horrific thing to do and say. Harry has always supported and backed Willam no matter what even when he knew that Willam wasn\u2019t playing straight up with Kate\u2026 Harry may have said things to Willam in private about those issues but he always had his back in public\u2026 But if you want to talk about arrogance that would be William at a time when his brother needs him the most when he is receiving death threats and his wife is receiving death threats and his child has been compared to a chimpanzee \u2026to come out in public and say I can no longer put my arm around my brother\u2026 It\u2019s disgusting and it was hateful. I am so proud of Harry . I am very disheartened that they aren\u2019t even a full two months into their decision to step back from senior royal duties and are just now trying to start earning money to repay Frogmoor, via Home, security, travel expenses, and contributions to help support the patronages that they\u2019ve given their hearts too. I\u2019m proud of Prince Harry for partnering with Bon Jovi for the Invictus games. But I think it\u2019s really sad that just a little over two months in to this new life scenario that the royal family had to snatch the word royal from the brand\u2026 they could\u2019ve given it a little time to see what they were going to do and done a royal audit of their finances to make sure that they were not adversely profiting off of the word royal. When you set up to protect the brand you do it by attaching it to various items and purposes which makes it harder for other people to come in and usurp the brand name because it\u2019s of its popularity to use for their own financial gain. It was too soon to just assume that they were actually going to sell hoodies and notebooks with the Sussex royal brand and if they were going to sell notebooks and hoodies with the Sussex royal brand most likely the sale of THOSE products would\u2019ve been contributed 100% to their charities whereas their speaking engagements would\u2019ve covered their personal living expenses and their security and the repayment of frigmore. But they didn\u2019t even get them a chance to get off the ground. While I can see why people feel that Harry attacked his grandmother in the statement on their website I don\u2019t think it was an attack. I think it was a statement of commitment to move forward no matter how many words got taken away from them. The Earl Charles Spencer, brother of the late Diana princess of Wales, said in his eulogy of her that in the last year of her life she showed that she needed no royal title to carry out her particular brand of magic. Neither to Harry and Megan\u2026 They are already well known and most of the people around the world love them except for the crazy fringe\u2026 They can still carry out their own particular brand of magic and be true to the causes they\u2019ve taken up because of what they believe in. It\u2019s clear to me that when you look back at past press coverage of Diana where she expresses concern for how Harry will be treated and find a place to be true to himself within the royal family she was concerned and right to be concerned\u2026he\u2019s no longer even \u201cthe spare\u201d. He can be sacrificed his camouflage for Prince William and the stuff nobody\u2019s allowed to talk about. I\u2019ve watched as he and Megan were left dangling out there and not once did the RF come out from behind their cloud of mystique to defend the truly egregious attacks on Archie and other over the top things\u2026 they don\u2019t learn from their past\u2026 They keep going back to the same old tired \u201cnever complain, never explain\u201c \u201ckeep calm and carry-on\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not always the right thing to do. Sometimes the father needs to be a father and come out and stand up for his son. And that is in essence what so-called \u201cMegxit\u201c is really about\u2026 Harry and Megan were bright with hope for the future on their wedding day\u2026 And then the so-called nonexistent racial bias in the UK took over and it created great sensation in the social media and the YouTube channelers and that made money and the tabloids kept it alive because it made money and Piers Morgan kept it alive because it increased viewership. They became a commodity for the worst of humanity. I imagine every night at home was painful trying to go to sleep and not think about what the day has been like. The breaking point was their newborn son being compared to a chimpanzee and no one from the royal family came out on that child\u2019s behalf\u2026 No one\u2026and one day Archie will do a little research and he\u2019ll realize that and I bet he\u2019ll feel compelled to ask why. Anybody with a reasonable mind who stands back and looks at this whole scenario would certainly understand why they wanted to step away and try to gain a little control over their own lives\u2026 Because as senior royals their hands were tied behind their back\u2018s while they were literally being pummeled to death in the public arena on their own. But \u201cthe firm\u201c is already intervening and trying to make it hard for them to succeed\u2026 So when Harry says just call me Harry he\u2019s just getting prepared for whatever else they\u2019re going to throw at them. All the royal family would have to do is call them to a meeting and say \u201cwe don\u2019t feel complete without you\u2026 We are your family, we love you and we want you here with us. Come back and we will have your back and we will stand beside you and we will face it all together\u2026 Because that\u2019s what families are supposed to do and if Harry and Megan came back and the royal family made it clear that they were welcomed back with open arms and that the assaults and attacks must come to an end and then do a big round of appearances and engagements with them showing unity\u2026 They would probably be OK but that isn\u2019t gonna happen. Their loss. ",

            "answer_text": "Duchess Meghan is a Black woman with a white father who has two other children from a previous relationship who clearly had no relationship with her. I don\u2019t even want to speculate on how they treated their little Black sister. Fortunately, despite growing up in a fractured family, she was loved and raised to be an educated, strong-willed, independent, nurturing, happy, young woman who did things her way and became a success in her own right. Unfortunately, she\u2019s also very empathetic. Because her fractured family - including her loving father - who now only sees her as a meal ticket, along with racists and people who feel like the most eligible bachelor in the world should have married an English Rose, are attacking her from all sides, I\u2019m sure she feels sad about it. Seriously, who wouldn\u2019t? But the poor man\u2019s National Enquirer gave her a taste of what was to come when she was described as \u201cstraight out of Compton\u201d when their relationship became public, followed by a nephew she doesn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t point out of a lineup deciding to sell marijuana and name it after her to make a quick buck. Of course her loving and fiercely protective husband prepared her as much as he could, so she had a pretty good idea of what she would be dealing with. So while I\u2019m sure she feels sad about this sordid mess, she doesn\u2019t feel bad, because she has nothing to feel bad about. Her distasteful family, the racists, yellow journalists and miserable people aside, and if what we\u2019ve seen so far is any indication, the rest of the world approves. I applaud her. ",

I would hope that the Duchess would be able to brush it all aside, or most of it at least, and take heart in the fact that it is the gutter press and not the real, decent people who are causing this situation. However, we saw, in the past, what this type of scrutiny and bad press did to the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York, the media are, shame on them, attempting to repeat that history using the Duchess\u2019s of Sussex and Cambridge as their targets. I sincerely wish something could be done about this disgraceful behaviour, it is not freedom of the press, it is not in \u201cthe public\u2019s interest\u201d unless the public means evil ghouls that thrive on making decent people miserable and wrecking marriages. I think you can tell that I am quite upset by, mainly, the bad press, I have seen little in the way of good press for many years now sadly. ",

I think, her ego aside, she must feel frustrated in many ways. People thought it odd she only invited 1 relative and a handfull of actors to her wedding (not even 1 Ragland aunt to keep her mother company?). That was already a bad sign. Her wedding was only appropriate in the U.S. where we can do whatever we want. Yes, she has no Tig anymore, she must feel frustrated and angry to be holding it all in (her crazy 1/2 sister especially) and not be able to make her own statements. All we see is a woman who must\u2019ve been ashamed of every single relative on both sides. Severe separation disorder but bad press she must hate. Her whole career was made on good press. ",

No-one has denied the story about \u201cPP\u201d upsetting Kate either over Charlotte\u2019s wedding outfit. She was also 100% caught out when she lectured saying she worked p/t to pay back her school fees or at least there has not been a credible denial yet. Her poor old Dad. Comes over as a simple man easily manipulated so why haven\u2019t they given him some help I have also heard a whisper that Harry has changed as well since being married which is incredibly sad as he has so much credit in the bank with the British public. Finally\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..why Morocco I do not understand why they went there - no historic link no new major trade deals if she wanted to lecture to Muslim girls why not go to Bradford. Things will settle with the birth of the baby but I fear they will start up again pdq as she demands more & more. Remember \u201cPP\u201d your role model is HM not Kim Kardashian. ",

She had more than enough advance warning when she was dating the prince, and now she has the entire staff of the Palace to shield her from unwanted scrutiny. Myself? I have an entire life to live, and cannot work up the energy to be concerned about some woman I shall never even meet. There are more than enough people in my town, and in my life that have serious problems that God is asking me to do something about. To waste any of that time with her would be sinful, I believe, in the extreme. ",

While it may cause 5 minutes of consternation, she has a lot going on right now. She is still a full-time Royal, she\u2019s heavily pregnant, and she\u2019s recently flown from London to New York and back again, then onto Morocco. She probably hasn\u2019t got enough hours in a day to sit and fret about rumour and gossip. She has recently married a British Prince, earning the status of HRH, has a husband who very clearly adores her, and will be giving birth to her first baby very soon.

And she's had a psychotic famiky for years, so she knew ehat they were like. There's a reason she hasn't had any contact with her half-siblings in 10 years, after all. Since the hatred started even before the wedding, the Duchess had a taste of it and could have walked away. I'm sure no one would have blamed her. But she's made of sterner stuff, obviously.

She has been met with warmth and support whenever she has been out on official business so no, why should she care, even if she is aware? The gutter press are what they are and are aptly \u2018named'. ",

She is made of sterner stuff, which is why Prince Charles refers to her affectionately as \u201cTungsten\u201d. She recognises that this kind of thing comes with the job, and I think she will handle it just fine. Her biggest challenge may be to curb her high-spirited nature and continue considering her wardrobe choices when in public and amongst the other royals. Hers was a quick courtship and short engagement - she didn\u2019t have the benefit of several years to prepare for this, as did the Duchess of Cambridge. But I think she\u2019s off to a good start and I wish her the best. ",

If something that could threaten their security or the children are being targeted, that\u2019s usually when the Palace makes an official comment.
