            "answer_text": "Not only in UPSC but in other competitive exams of descriptive nature as well, the introduction needs to be strictly dispensed. Your first line is the indicator to the examiner where do you stand as a competitor among many others whose answer books he has been checking. So first line should be the best. It should squeeze all the background in erudite and lucid manner so that everthing is clear. My suggestion is to begin with the central theme of the question and elaborate its related aspects in subsequent paragraphs. Remember , reading first few lines the examiner will decide a set point as to which bracket of the score your answer falls. It will determine his psychological make up. All the good writing is nothing but to carry the reader along in an interesting conversation. ",
