            "answer_text": "How many can you introduce gradually, in a way where the readers can keep straight who is who?  There is no exact answer: with more than one character the risk of readers getting confused rises. That said, there are ways to make it easier on readers, and in so doing raise the number of POVs you can have without confusing the reader: 1. Start with a POV that can introduce, directly or indirectly, the basic points your reader will need to understand the setting and characters.  2. If possible, show the other POVs prior to switching to their viewpoint. If you have Sam as your starting POV, have him meet Alice before you use Alice as a POV.  3. Use chapter breaks and other obvious visual cues to make it clear when you are changing POVs, as you would with changes in setting. Ex: Chapter Two: Alice: Paris, France. The easier it is for readers to tell which head they are in, the more they will tolerate a lot of POVs.  4. Avoid similar names, and try to give your characters distinct voices, traits, and ways of looking at the world. If Alice is assertive and Sam is shy, then it is easier to keep straight which POV is which than if your characters act and speak the same way.  5. Never switch POVs within a scene. This is extremely confusing, and gives readers head whiplash as they struggle to understand which head they jumped into.  6. Try to minimize the number of jumps between POVs, settings, and time early on. If you wait until halfway through the book to start with the POV of Mary who is Alice's sister and lives in Africa, it is less confusing than if you jump around in location, time, and POV early on (I'm looking at you, Steven Erikson).

            "answer_text": "Yay! You\u2019re a writer after my own heart. I love to create a rich tapestry of vivid characters and change points of view between different sections of the story from one character to another. It makes sense if you\u2019re going to a subplot where the main character is not present at the moment; you have to then tell the story from some other character\u2019s point of view. I\u2019ve been told by authors who were first readers of my work and by teachers in writing workshops that switching PoV in a novel is a bad thing and a writer should maintain a single PoV throughout the book. I find that difficult, awkward, and artificial. Lots of good authors agree with me apparently because I note that most best selling authors switch points of view in their novels. It makes the story more lively by populating it with more realistic characters \u2014 people who have their own thoughts and feelings and let the reader know about those thoughts and feelings. It has to be done correctly though and it is possible to have so many characters that readers will be overwhelmed trying to remember them all. I use devices to avoid that. If I have lots of characters in a long novel, I include a Dramatis Personae in the book, listing all the characters with a short synopsis of who they are. Also I have started to not name every character who appears in the story. If they are just a bit player they don\u2019t need a name and the reader need not keep track of a name for that character; s/he can just be \u201cthe guard\u201d or \u201cthe cook.\u201d Also, never switch point of view from one character to another in the middle of a section. Use section separators and make a new section when you want to change point of view. This will prevent the reader from getting dizzy trying to keep up with whose head they\u2019re in. Switching PoV too often is called \u201chead bopping\u201d and it is bad. How many characters is too many? That reminds me of a story about Mozart\u2019s operas. He had a rich patron who produced his operas. The man was kind of a moron and often felt he had the right to critique Mozart\u2019s work. For instance, he told Mozart that one of his operas had \u201ctoo many notes.\u201d Ha ha ha. ",
