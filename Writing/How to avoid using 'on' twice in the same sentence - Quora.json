            "answer_text": "How do I avoid using \"on\" twice in the same sentence? Why would you want to? Prepositions are virtually invisible to readers. I could write, for example, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go on the hayride, so I put on my down parka, strapped my skis on top of the car and went on a cross-country drive to a ski slope where I stood on line to ride the ski lift to the top of the mountain, only to crash into a tree on my way down. Now, my sentence might attract criticism for being too long, but no one is going to complain about my having used \u201con\u201d six times. Sometimes repeating a word can be effective, even poetic. Consider \u201dOn Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "To give you a concrete suggestion for this, you would need to tell us the sentence you wrote, and then we could suggest some alternative words. If you think the sentence sounds awkward because you\u2019re using \u201con\u201d twice, you need to look in a thesaurus and find a synonym for one of the expressions you\u2019re using. It\u2019s not necessarily wrong to use a preposition twice in a sentence. He sat on the bed and put on his socks. If that\u2019s what happened, there\u2019s really nothing wrong with saying it that way. ",
