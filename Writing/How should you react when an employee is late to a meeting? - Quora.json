            "answer_text": "How should you react when an employee is late to a meeting? Thank you for the A2A. There are 2 different answers to this in my opinion: This answer assumes that the rules apply to everyone, including the manager: After the meeting, discuss with them individually that being on time is important. Ask them why they were late. If the answer isn\u2019t something that is truly out of their control, remind them that everyone else shows up on time. Don\u2019t make a mountain from a molehill, but do call out the behavior.This assumes that the rules don\u2019t apply to everyone, equally; including the manager: You say nothing. If the rules don\u2019t apply equally, then they are not rules. They are simply guidelines and those who choose to show the disrespect of being late are simply illustrating their lack of character.Being late is such a small thing that signals so much more. Again, I am assuming that the person had control over being on time. (FYI: I err on the side of \u201cyes, you have time.\u201d Traffic, a phone call that ran long, etc.: You have control to be sure that these things don\u2019t interfere with you.) When someone is late, they are showing that they don\u2019t respect the others in the room. They don\u2019t respect their responsibility to be on time, and they waste the time of everyone in the room. ",

            "answer_text": "Suggestion, don\u2019t climb of the ladder of inference too quickly. The employee may have a solid reason for being late. I personally observed a COO chew out an employee in the presence of others that actually cause himself more embarrassment than the employee; especially when he discovered the employee had to take his 5 year-old-son to an emergency room for a very serious acute illness. It was touch \u2019n go for the kid for a few days. Hum-mm - if a bull-shit reason, I would privately have words with the employee for disrespecting the other team members. ",
