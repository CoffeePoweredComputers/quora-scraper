            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Among those they work with and for, they definitely feel appreciated, not the least of which is how much they get paid. Editors acknowledge one another in a number of ways, personally, institutionally with organized awards, and when people in other crafts recognize their contributions. With the wider world, editors are not appreciated so much. For some time the Motion Picture Editors Guild, the post production union local that represents them, and the American Cinema Editors, an association of Hollywood\u2019s working editors, has had a campaign to have editing awards be a part of the major film festivals. Most festivals honor cinematography, but not editing, when editing is the most unique role in filmmaking, and is always the key part of completing any project. ",

A young starlet was walking up the red carpet at the Oscars and was stopped for a quick interview after which she said \u201cI must hurry now or if I\u2019m unlucky I will find myself sitting with a bunch of editors!\u201d Doesn\u2019t the silly bitch realise that they can make or break her career? When she thinks she has made her best scene, it could wind up on the cutting room floor because the editor might decide on a cutaway instead. Have respect for the entire crew when you are making a film. They are part of a huge team and you are only a tiny bit of it. ",
