            "answer_text": "If U is an open subset of X then X-U will, by definition, be closed. The interior of X-U will be the largest open subset that is disjoint from U. To see this, let V be any open subset of X that misses U. Then V is an open subset of X-U and, therefore, a subset of the interior of X-U. ",

Take any open set of the form  where  Its complement is  which is not open. The interior of  which is  is the largest open subset of  that misses  In general, the largest open subset having an empty intersection with a given subset of a topological space is the interior of the complement of the given subset.
