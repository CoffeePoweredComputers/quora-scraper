            "answer_text": "If I had to guess, I\u2019d say you fear judgement of others, which is why you\u2019re holding yourself back. Just write. Start writing every day. I suggest finding someone like Seth Godin who is an author but he provides great information for those starting out. At first, just commit to writing some quantity of words per day - 500, 1000, or whatever. Pick a topic and write about it. Make it a daily habit to write and you\u2019ll find that your confidence will grow and you\u2019ll build it into your daily routine. Build your confidence and you\u2019ll be less apprehensive. ",

The more you write the more confident you\u2019ll get and before too long you\u2019ve got a story. Writing is hard work and anything good to create doesn\u2019t happen on the first attempt. Keep going. Hope that helps. ",
