Some parts of Tiruvallur district like Avadi, Madhavaram, Ponneri, Manali, Puzhal, Cholavaram and etc. are under Chennai Metropolitan agglomeration. Tiruvallur town is just 5- 10 kms away from the urban Chennai area. Metropolitan transport Corporation - Chennai(MTC) offers frequent bus service from Koyambedu, Avadi, Madhavaram, T.Nagar, Poonamallee (Poovirundhavalli) to Tiruvallur town( 153A , S597 etc.).
