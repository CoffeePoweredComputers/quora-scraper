            "answer_text": "It's the age-old story: you need  have done work in order to get work. Been there :)  Im assuming you want to spend 0-only a few dollars, so I'm going to approach this from that angle. First of all, WRITE EVERY DAY. You may have heard the expression \"good marketing makes a bad product fail faster.\" From now on, your writing is your product. It needs to be top notch.  Here are some things you can write about: 1. Call up a local businessman and write a profile on him/her. Pitch the piece to a local publication.  2. Write an opinion piece on a popular topic. Post it on Medium.  3. Cover local sports if you're into that sort of thing.  4. Become a film critic. Review everything in theatres or on Netflix. You'd be  shocked how much attention something like \"6 most underrated Netflix movies\" can get.  5. Find your niche and write about it from every angle - science, religion, technology, nerd culture, politics. Whatever floats your boat.  NOW for the portfolio part.  1. Grab a portfolio website, using something like wordpress, and grab  free theme. You don't have to spend any money to set that up.  [Alt: just go to Medium and create a profile. No setup time, no picking out themes, and you can literally just start writing. That's what I did at first] 2. Throw on your best shirt (maybe a jacket too) and use the self timer on your phone  a camera if you've got on to get a good headshot - you're looking for something shoulders up, with you smiling or looking thoughtful. [Alt: find a professional a get you several shots. May cost a couple hundred bucks]  3. Compile your stuff!  There's not really a right or wrong way to do this. I'd suggest putting your best piece right up front, you resume and published works somewhere in plain view.  Remember, keep moving forward every day. consistency and momentum are very powerful things.  Stay Balanced. Stay Focused. Learn, and most importantly:  Do.   ",

            "answer_text": "I depends on what kind of writing you do. Some writers have a broad and comprehensive portfolio, others narrower backgrounds. Nothing in your question addresses this aspect. It also depends on what the intended audience for that portfolio might be. For a general audience, introducing yourself as a capable writer, you could cite areas of experience and expertise under separate headings: technical writing, promotional writing, speech writing, business-project writing, magazine and newspaper writing, novel and nonfiction writing\u2014this will permit the reader to acquire an over-all understanding of your capabilities. For a specialist audience, for example in a job application, you could cite specific examples of the kinds of work done in that writing category: for example, in business writing, you could cite kinds of work ranging from advertising/marketing projects to proposal writing to speeches to preparing annual reports. For another example, in the case of journalism, you could cite specific publications and, if you have space, summarize the scope of the specific project: news reporting, op-ed work, specific subject covered. If you are trying to establish yourself in the mind of the intended recipient as a book writer, you could cite the books you have written, with a brief (2\u20133 lines) summary of the subject, perhaps subdivided into fiction and nonfiction. It will all depend on the audience: who will read your portfolio and what you want them to \u2018do.\u2019 For most readers of writing portfolios of any kind, less is more. One can discern whether a writer is competent, or not, in a very few lines. An interested recipient will ask for more if they need it. For example, agents and editors looking at books seldom ask for more than 20\u201330 pages, most for far less. Appraisers of writing portfolios may be seen as akin to casting directors, who will look at 100 composites of the talent, dump 75 instantly, give slight attention to 15\u201320 more, and concentrate on the most likely candidates. It\u2019s the same with books\u2014reading \u2018submissions\u2019 (writers, groveling) is a speed sport. Many are called, few chosen. Did I help? I hope so. ",
