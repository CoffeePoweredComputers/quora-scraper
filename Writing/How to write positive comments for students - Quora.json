            "answer_text": "I assume this is for report cards? We\u2019re told to avoid unquantifiable claims, things like saying the student is \u201cgood natured\u201d \u2014 what the heck does that mean? We\u2019re told to be precise in our praise and in our \u201cnext steps\u201d section. For example: instead of saying, \u201cAmir is a great help to his classmates\u201d I would write, \u201cAmir consistently volunteers to help his classmates, particularly in math class, by not giving the answer but instead by showing his notes and actually bringing his classmates to the board to look at the explanation closely.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s much larger but it also is far more specific and precise. It also avoid words like great because those are really hard to quantify. I can however factually state that he helps his classmates because I have seen him do it and how. ",
