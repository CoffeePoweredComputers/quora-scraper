            "answer_text": "The notion that it happens by signals or telepathy or any such stuff is not my experience of how relationships start. In my experience, if a person is interested in someone, the best course of action is for that person to say \"hey, I'm interested in you and I'd love to get to know you better. Would you like to go out to dinner/drinks/whatever?\" If the other person isn't interested they say no. If they are, they say \"sure!\" Then the two of them go out, get to know each other better, and decide if they want to continue going out. Doesn't matter if the people are men or women or somewhere between or non-binary. If you're interested in someone, don't waste your time driving yourself insane with \"does she like me? Doesn't she like me? Does she like me?\" nonsense or waiting for the other person to make a move. Say something.  If you don't say something, don't get upset and jealous if someone else says something while you're dithering. ",
