            "answer_text": "Modern ways to check things There are websites like Turnitin - Home that you can have students turn in work. It will tell you if any parts of the work come from any source in your school or posted somewhere on the internet, what percentage, and what the website or address is. Then it highlights the passages and color codes them. Sometimes it is a very short part that really wouldn\u2019t be written any other way or a definition of a term or a quote from someone that is cited correctly, but those are easy to spot and can be marked \u201cok.\u201d I\u2019m sure there are other resources available, but I wouldn\u2019t trade this one without some great convincing. Shifts in ability level and vocabulary out of reach Before there were computers, a lot of the checking was done mentally. You may not know where something came from, but the context, vocabulary, and writing style would not match the rest of the document or the student\u2019s ability level. That is easy to tell. The magical fantasy world of \u201clooks similar\u201d As for essays that \u201clook similar,\u201d I have found that even in a modest 1000 word essay, the chances of a student using even 10 words in a row that are the same as another student, and in the same paragraph, are really astronomical. It would never happen unless it is copied or shared. People who are thinking and writing in their own words just never use the same words. It is statistically as close to impossible as you can get. So \u2026 unique writing products that are directed to be \u201cin your own words\u201d will never \u201clook similar\u201d if the students followed directions. Students need support, not \u201cgotchas\u201d To take the students\u2019 side for a moment, many of them have not had the proper instruction or guidance yet to get confident enough to produce unique work. It is important to do a rough draft, let them grade each others\u2019 with a rubric you provide, a 2nd draft with titles, format, and works cited done. Then a 2nd peer review. Please save yourself the headache and use modern technology Only after that should you have them turn it in to Turnitin - Home, where it will be very quick and simple for you to grade 100 of them per hour while leaving comments and marking things on the personalized rubric you setup. It is important to remember that this is a difficult skill to master. For a college educated person, I could write a 10 page paper on many topics, with references, within 30 minutes, starting right now. I had practice. When I started college, I was not nearly as comfortable. ",

            "answer_text": "Like several posters have suggested in this thread, changes in style from the student\u2019s voice is a dead giveaway. Sometimes, that might be dramatic changes in punctuation and sentence structure from the students\u2019 earlier essays or earlier parts of the same paper. Sometimes, in freshman composition papers, it is the use of advanced terminology that I wouldn\u2019t expect in an 18-year old. (For instance, in a freshman composition paper based on their personal experiences, I wouldn\u2019t expect to find references to typological readings, as most 18-year olds have no idea what medieval typology is.) In my own case, I have a little bit of background in linguistics, so it\u2019s a dead giveaway when one of my students who speaks in class with Appalachian dialect traits submits a paper with linguistic markers that I would expect in a speaker from New Jersey or London, and that leads me to check the paper more closely. Whether a student calls the same outdoor activity, hiking, camping, ambling, or wood-walking is a bit of diction that links them to specific regions. The same is true for dash box, glovebox, or jockey box as a term to apply to the part of a car where you store the owner\u2019s manual, or whether the student drinks pop, soda, fizzy water, carbonated bevs, or \u201ccokes\u201d as a generic term for all brands. When a student points out a yellow jacket swarm in the classroom, did the students call them bugs, pests, insects, stingers, wasps, or use the common Appalachian word waspers? If so, did the student\u2019s word choice indicate a dialect that matches what I see in this particular paper? That diction sings out on the page as I read it. Out of four classes and maybe 90 students in my classes each semester, I pretty reliably catch about four students each semester who plagiarize, and usually it\u2019s diction choice from a dialect that first makes my spider-sense tingle. Once the spider-sense tingles, it is usually less than five minutes to identify a passage from an online source by some quick Google-fu. This is why I usually don\u2019t bother with Turnitin.com. It\u2019s an excellent resource, but for me it\u2019s been redundant compared to just knowing the student\u2019s voice. ",
