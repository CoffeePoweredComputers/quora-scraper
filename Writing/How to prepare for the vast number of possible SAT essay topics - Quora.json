            "answer_text": "Since it is virtually and humanly impossible to prepare for all the topics for SAT essays, I suggest that you do the following two things.  1. Prepare a standard template that you can use for any essay topic. This must be the basic skeleton that helps you just fit in sentences so that you can just write the essay.  2. Have a set of examples that you can use for any essay - Something about 2 leaders, 2 books and 2 historic instances - Make sure that these examples can be tweaked into any essay topic. Once done, you shall be able to write any kind of essay :) Make sure you write a couple of essays and get it evaluated by someone to be on the safer side :) ",
