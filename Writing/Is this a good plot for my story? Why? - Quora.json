            "answer_text": "At this point, I don't think the plot make much sense to me.  First of all, people hire assassins because they either don't have the skill or resolve to kill and/or they want the deniability when things go wrong, they can keep their hands clean. We don't know much about Jace and his background, but I feel that if he has the skill and resolve to kill, he won't be under his father's thumb; and if his father want the deniability, he won't hire his own son to be the assassin.  Rich people, especially self-made rich people are often very smart and capable. One thing I don't like about regular plot is that they dumb down the bad guys just to make the good guys look good.  There're so many ways a father can keep his son under control without actually hiring him to do dangerous illegal works that can be easily traced back to himself. For example, if his father is really rich and powerful, he could make sure his son never find a job in other companies, and have to crawl back and work for him (unless he's willing to do minimum wage jobs like working at a burger joint).  On top of that, what's the theme of your story? what's the primary conflict? What is Jace's motivation and what is father's motivation? His father's motivation can't just be \"I want to make my son's life a living hell\". That's not a realistic motivation, and does not lead to realistic character behavior and development.  Overall... I'm just not feeling it. The story doesn't sound exciting enough, the characters doesn't look like multi-dimensional characters. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing you should ask yourself is:  Is this character capable of supporting this plot in a believable manner?  Does your main character have the skills, morals, and motivation to make sense in the story you are envisioning? If not, then you need to change the story or change the character.  Your core idea makes sense, but I would change the way you are presenting it. You can eliminate the money and job aspects and keep the father-son relationship as the core basis for bringing the characters together. The father wants to bring the son back into the family, the son wants his father's approval but has moral conflicts about his father's work, the son accepts his father's proposal and thinks he can change his father... these are just a few directions you can go with.  The moral of this post is to keep your character's morals and motivations in mind! ",

            "answer_text": "Your plot has compelling conflicts, but you're competing with stories told in movies and TV.  Do you know enough about the kind of people who employ hitmen to pull the story off? I would suggest dialing back to a situation you might be able to describe more convincingly, maybe a son working for his father's business, a son who has been forced to compromise his principles because his father is selling a defective product, or has instituted production shortcuts that result in an unsafe product or safety hazards to production workers. I could imagine, for instance, a business that has installed thousands of furnaces in people's basements, and then learns that the company they bought the furnaces from has gone out of business because of product liability litigation.  Do they go back and inspect all those furnaces free of charge, or do they pretend nothing happened?   Maybe for a whole the son was willing to go along, but he doesn't like it, and the strain causes him to lash out. ",
