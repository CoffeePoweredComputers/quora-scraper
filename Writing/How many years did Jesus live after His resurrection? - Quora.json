            "answer_text": "Original Question: How long did Jesus remain on Earth after the resurrection? Why oh why do people keep asking this same old question about an impossible event which stories tell happened to a mythical character? There is no evidence outside the Bible itself which confirms any part of the stories about Jesus, none whatsoever. His biblical character was almost certainly based on a real person, but he would have been nothing more than a radical preacher who might have started to gather followers but who was crucified for what we\u2019d call sedition. There is no possibility that a resurrection or any so-called miracles can happen in real life. They\u2019re nothing but theological constructs which were designed to attract the naive, superstitious, and scientifically ignorant people of the time to the religion which made the claims. The entire New Testament is a collection of what we today would call marketing material designed to promote the then-new religion of Christianity to the predominantly Jewish population of the time in a way which would be understood and believed by them, given the significant limits of their knowledge and understanding. The Bible claims that Jesus was on Earth for 40 days after his resurrection. The number 40 was important to the Jewish people of the time because in numerology it represented a new beginning and in this context, the unknown writer of Acts used it because it would have had meaning to the Jews of the time; this new beginning being Christianity. You see the number 40 being used over and over again in biblical stories, over 150 times in fact - Noah\u2019s Flood, Moses\u2019 time in the desert, Jonah\u2019s warnings to Ninevah, Ezekiel lying on his right side, Jesus\u2019 fasting period, Elijah\u2019s walk to Mount Horeb\u2026. They\u2019re not factual, they\u2019re allegorical, fictional stories attributed to fictional people which conveyed a religious meaning appropriate at the time. The Bible is not a history book in any shape or form, it\u2019s nothing more than a collection of mythical and allegorical stories which represented the naive and ignorant religious beliefs of certain groups of people several thousand years ago, nothing more. There was no biblical Jesus, and when the unknown person on whom his character was based, died, he would have remained dead\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally, he stayed around for 40 days before ascending into heaven. He said he must leave so that the Holy Spirit could be sent. The Holy Spirit descended on the Apostles on Pentecost (Shavuot in Hebrew - Feast of Weeks), which was 50 days after First-Fruits during the week of Unleavened Bread. One tradition is that First-Fruits is the day after the High Sabbath (first day of Unleavened Bread), another is that First-Fruits was the day after the weekly Sabbath, so it was a Sunday. The Dead Sea Scrolls calendar scroll shows that in the 1st century, First-Fruits was the Sunday after Passover/Unleavened Bread ended. If that\u2019s the case, then Pentecost/Shavuot would be 49 days later than First-Fruits, but as many as 61 days after Passover meal on 14 Nisan/Abib. Before I read about the DSS calendar scroll, I had heard that the majority belief was the day after the weekly sabbath during Unleavened Bread, making it the Sunday during the festival, which puts Pentecost 50 days after the weekly Sabbath, meaning Jesus would have to leave before Pentecost so the Spirit could come.
