            "answer_text": "I have a friend who, at the age of 9, wrote and published a book, but not anyone can do it. In order to publish a book you have to do extensive reasearch on publishing procedures, but that is near the last step. If you want to convince a publication company that you are the new writer they need you would first have to find an editor. Your best friend will not do. Only certain editing and writing styles are used in the professional writing world, and you have to find someone to edit with practiced mannerisms. Overall, yes, you technically call be published, but the odds are small unless you have skill and put hard work into getting it done. ",

            "answer_text": "Your age won't matter if you have a firm grasp on the English language. First decide what type of writing you want to do - there are many types of freelance writers. Are you doing it for money? You'll need to learn SEO and how to write web copy/web content, then. Do you want to get a book published? Do you want to write press and news releases?   Once you know what type of writing (see the source for tons of info) you want to do, create some samples. You should almost certainly set up a blog (they're free, and with the right template you can make it look like a professional website) to hold your samples, your fees and outline the types of services you'd like to provide.   You can get jobs fast (for commercial freelancing) by creating an ad and posting it on Craigslist & other free sites; you can also place a free classified ad in the paper. ",
