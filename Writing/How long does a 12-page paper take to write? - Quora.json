            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on you, your circumstances, how well you know your topic, and how comfortably and fluidly you write. My personal completion times for an approximately 12-page paper would range from a few hours to a few months - depending on the topic, how much research is needed, and how exacting, precise and accurate the paper needs to be. If you are a student working on a term paper, for example, it depends on the topic, how critical the paper and its grade is for you, and how well and much you can focus on it - in this case probably a day or so for an average student. If you are a researcher and writing a paper for journal submission or a conference presentation, it depends on how much research, testing and analysis is required - and also how well-explored and written-about the topic already is (what\u2019s published and available in the public domain). If you are confirming the known or adding a unique perspective, it might not take a great deal of study. If your research is breaking new ground, plan on it taking additional time - maybe a lot of additional time, that\u2019s where the months (or longer) can come in. If this is more than idle curiosity on your part, I hope you\u2019ve been working on it while you\u2019re waiting on Quora responses - which probably won\u2019t help you do your paper anyway. Time\u2019s a wasting! ",

            "answer_text": "As so often, the answer is: it depends! If you have planned your paper thoroughly and know what you want to write it should not take long. However, if you have yet to complete research and, possibly, analysis and have not planned the paper then it will take longer. My rule of thumb for planning and writing a document is that (assuming you have done all the actual work - research analysis, etc.) the planning and structuring should take at least as long as the actual writing. I like and use the approach of The Pyramid Principle, by Barbara Minto, as the way to do the planning and structuring and thoroughly recommend it. ",
