            "answer_text": "Whether you create a lot or little, content isn\u2019t useful if it\u2019s poor quality, so this answer focuses on how to create high-quality content at scale. To do that, we\u2019re going to break down the content lifecycle into different stages and look to optimize each one: Content StrategyContent ResearchContent CreationContent OptimizationLet\u2019s use a real example using MarketMuse and data from the MarketMuse blog. You can try it out for yourself (using your own data) right here: MarketMuse | Enterprise Content Planning. Content Strategy Scaling content means scaling your content strategy. So, you need to quickly determine the best opportunities for creating new content and optimizing existing pages. Ideally, you\u2019re using personalized metrics to bring greater predictability to content assessment and planning. Here\u2019s what I mean. This screenshot shows me the topics around which the MarketMuse blog should consider focusing. For some topics like \u2018competitive gap analysis\u2019 and \u2018user intent\u2019, we have a decent competitive advantage based on authority gained through all the content we\u2019ve published. The Personalized Difficulty score is unique to my site and its contents. So it let\u2019s me quickly determine how likely my content is to perform well in search.  For some topics, like \u2018technical seo\u2019, we have no advantage due to our lack of authority on the subject. We just don\u2019t talk about it that much. The fastest way to build authority is to work from a position of strength. That\u2019s why I like to build out content around topics for which we already have an advantage. You need to do this at scale, but traditional keyword research tools won\u2019t help. They know nothing about your content, and can\u2019t make any predictions. Knowing what topics to write about isn\u2019t enough. You need to figure out whether you\u2019re better off optimizing an existing page or creating new content. Clicking on any of those topics in my inventory shows what pages (if any) are ranking for that topic, along with their content score and other metrics.  Here I can quickly figure out whether to create new content or optimize and existing page. If there are multiple pages ranking for the topic, I\u2019ll know which offers the best opportunity to optimize. When you\u2019re talking creating content at scale, you need to be highly organized. That's why every time I find a topic to write about or optimize, I throw it into a plan.  This is just one plan. You can organize across multiple plans, which is useful when you\u2019re focusing on specific topics or areas of your site. As you can see, I like to make notes in my plans as well. In this case it\u2019s a reminder that once the content briefs are ready, I want to use MarketMuse First Draft natural language generation to create preliminary drafts. I don\u2019t want us to get ahead of ourselves, so more on that later. Content Research Best-in-class content requires in-depth research. MarketMuse Research allows us to accomplish that without spending a lot of time. Give it a subject and in less than a minute it returns a list of 50 semantically related topics sorted by relevance. Here\u2019s a partial screenshot for the topic \u2018glucagon as a non invasive treatment.\u2019 The \u2018Suggested Dist.\u2019 indicates how often experts mention the particular term when writing about this subject. \u2018Variants\u2019 indicates how many variations there are for a specific term. Clicking on it reveals a list of variants that you can use to enhance your writing.  With topics in hand, it\u2019s time to figure out the most important the content should address. For that we\u2019ll turn to the MarketMuse Questions application. Type in a topic and MarketMuse quickly analyzes all the competitive content to determine the most relevant questions.  The key to creating high-quality content that performs well lies in way links are used. Finding the best internal links and appropriate anchor text is a challenge when you have hundreds or thousands of pages. It\u2019s the same thing with trying to find authoritative, relevant, yet non-competitive sites for outbound linking. MarketMuse Connect application removes that concern. Give it a topic and it quickly finds the most relevant pages along with appropriate anchor text selected from the topic list.  It employs a similar process for outbound links, using anchor text that\u2019s lower in relevance than that used for internal linking. In this way the links remain relevant yet not to the point that they compete with your page. Content Creation With all this information at hand, it\u2019s time to package it together into a content brief that a writer can use to quickly create expert level content. Here\u2019s an example of a MarketMuse Content Brief created in the platform. It\u2019s highly structured and contains everything a writer needs to craft high-performing content. Alternatively, you can take that content brief and let MarketMuse First Draft create an initial content draft using natural language generation. Here\u2019s an example.  Of course, you\u2019ll still want to edit for style and correctness, additional links, image, video, quotes, etc. Content Optimization Not every topic requires new content. Sometimes a little refresh is all a page needs. MarketMuse Optimize application updates in real time as you type your content. Paste in an existing page and see what topics are missing from the narrative. Fill these in and watch your content score increase. When you\u2019re finished, paste it back into your content management system and hit publish.  Summary Smaller websites can get away with a lot of inefficiencies that traditional tools cause. Not so when you have a large site producing equally large volumes of content. Creating quality content at scale relies on efficient workflows for the entire content life cycle. The workflows in MarketMuse are designed specifically for this purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "Two common ways to create content at scale are using user-generated content and working from templates. User-generated content (UGC) is content that your customers and broader audience create for you. This can include product photos, reviews, testimonials, unboxing videos, blog posts, and so on.It\u2019s easy to imagine what UGC for a video game company, a toy manufacturer, or a makeup brand looks like. Think: unboxing videos, tutorials, lifestyle photos, etc. Consumers will often create this type of content organically.But what if you sell something less visual, like B2B software or kitchen appliances? In this case, you can host a contest/giveaway that requires entrants to write a review, give a testimonial, or even write a how-to guide for your website in order to be entered to win.Templates are also an excellent way to create content at scale. You can search online for video templates, blog post templates, gift guide templates, social media templates, and so on \u2014 or you can create your own. When you have a clear formula to follow, it\u2019s easier to create a high volume of content.Here\u2019s an example: Let\u2019s say you sell video conferencing software. If you know your target personas, you can write a series of blog posts titled \u201c10 Free and Low-Cost Tools that Make a [Persona]\u2019s Job Easier.\u201d Do this for each persona you sell to. Include your software on the list, along with a few general products that are useful to all professionals, and a few products that are unique to each persona.Now, all that said, the answer can differ depending on how you define \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201cscale.\u201d Both could be interpreted broadly \u2013 but I hope my response is useful!
