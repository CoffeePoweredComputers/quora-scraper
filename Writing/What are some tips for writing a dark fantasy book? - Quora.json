            "answer_text": "Since I write mostly grimdark fantasy, here\u2019s what I typically follow as the \u201crules\u201d. Bear in mind, there really isn\u2019t any hard and fast rules and what you read below may or may not be all-encompassing toward the sub-genre. There is no such thing as good and evil. Morality is relative to the situation at hand. In my story, Daughter of Darkness, the main character is part of a sacred order of holy knights of the Lord Justice. The story opens with the order finally defeating a temple of night elves dedicated to the vile Goddess of Lust and Pain, the Tri-Headed Queen. However, the holy knights celebrated by raping the surviving priestesses of the temple before their execution.Happy endings are rare and if you have them, they should come at a severe cost or a pyrrhic victory. Typically, the \u201cgood guys\u201d don\u2019t win in the end. However, if you do have a victory for the hero of the story, it comes at too great of a cost. In my fairy tale, Straying, the Big Bad Wolf in this story is a pup. He encounters a sadistic and grown Red, her sister, Snow White, mother to seven inbred boys, their father the Ax-man, and their granny, who is a witch about to cut up two abandoned children lured to house with sweets and candies. Wolf is rescued by his mother, but she is killed and the story ends with the litter starving to death as eagles circle their den.Noble or characters of good principles die. It often serves as their fatal flaw. Just like Eddard Stark whose own honor became his undoing in Game of Thrones, if you have any characters who truly are honorable and decent beings, their high character is actually a flaw in a world of power, vice, and stark violence. In my story, Daughter of Darkness, you discover Rhain\u2019s merciful nature led to his exile from the heavens and forced him down a path of questionable actions that resulted in his own wife hunting him down and killing him.Cruelty is based on real-world motivations and quite complex. In typical fantasy, villains have cliche motivations for slaves, world-domination, and seeking gold. In grimdark fantasy, their cruelty is inherent in their personality and is an extension of their power and desire for more power. Other times, they have \u201cgood\u201d goals that justify the actions they do. In my short story, Thela\u2019s Angel, Bastion, an Angel of War, knows only violence. He uses Thela to restore her fallen bloodline as a means to get back in the good graces of the heavens who have exiled him as a punishment. He is contemptuous of the human and main character, Thela, and even rapes her because of his impatience for her to produce a child.",

            "answer_text": "Write a realistic world. Bad things happen to good people. Your main character (or some of your main characters) should be moral people who always try good but are desperate on reality and always wonder if it is worth it. After all everyone else does not come up at their high standards- and keeps winning. It is about the road not the destination. Alternatively you might go for a redempted \u201cgray\u201d character who tries to be good. Makes a very realistic touch. Someone \u201ctainted\u201d trying to be a hero. And no prophecies and chosen ones!!!! Of course your villains should mainly be gray. There might even be a point were the true darkhearted evil comes out and the hero needs to work with the former villain to prevent a greater evil. and letting the main hero sacrifice himselves for common good in the end might be an idea. The \u201cfirst half of the book\u201d villain gaining redemption (and proving true black and white does not exist) another. Do not deliver simple answers. A character who is \u201cnot good\u201d like in Lawrence\u2019s \u201cPrince of Thorns\u201d might also be an idea.(note i have not read this book yet, still on my to read list) Check \u201cEchoes of the great Song\u201d by the late David Gemmell as an example of such a dark book. Or his Waylander books. Or \u201cDark Moon\u201d. Moorcocks Corum and Elric books are also fine examples. ",
