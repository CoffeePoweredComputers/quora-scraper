            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s a vague question. How is the paper clip to be subjected to the load? What size is the clip? I have at least six sizes in my bureau drawer\u2026 as a paper clip, holding paper, say, how much load is required to pull a single sheet of paper from the clip\u2019s grasp?as above, but holding multiple sheets of paper as the actual load, which will affect the clip\u2019s ability to grip, dependent upon the thickness of the sheaf of sheets? What paper size and weight is to be used?With the clip forming a link in a chain, then loaded?with the clip loaded in shear or double shear, loaded until failure?With the clip held in cantilever and loaded until failure?Assuming it\u2019s 1. or 2., the best way to find out is by practical experimentation, and then, only after you\u2019ve established what the questioner meant, or how your tutor suggests you interpret the question. Really, when given a brief, the one giving it needs to be precise, and if they\u2019re not, deserves to be bombarded with questions from those who need to know how to interpret the brief before wasting their valuable time doing the wrong thing.
