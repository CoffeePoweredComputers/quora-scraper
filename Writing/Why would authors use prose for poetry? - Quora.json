            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question. Prose is fluid and connected with specific grammar rules and conventions. The logic and concept is defined through the use of words in a specific sequence. Readers are accustomed to this style of understanding. Sentences have structure and sense and follow each other in an ordered way. Far easier to understand prose. Prose tends to be concrete Poetry uses a different set of figurative language which is not always easy to understand. The use of symbolic language and another type of structure the sense it portrays comes out in various ways. The same line comes out in different ways and meanings and far richer for its complexity and construction.The rhythmic pattern is subtle, subdued and symbolic. Different types of poems give different meanings to the words. Poetry tends to be abstract. A cross-combination of prose and poetry is newly termed as prosetry. In this style of writing a mix of simple prose and a sliver of metaphorical language heightens the beauty of the words. From this you can see extremely rare insights into what the writer is saying. Poetry is the pinnacle of any language. Once you master the art of mixing both forms of language you express a thought in beautiful ways. A novel written in pristine prose uses a set of mechanisms to convey the message. Very rarely does a novelist switch into prosetry because it distorts the fluid meaning and texture of the language. Description of the characters, plots, locations, themes, concepts, is best served with writing in prose. If you read Vikram Seth's Golden Gate you will immediately notice how he has used prosetry. Yet in writing A Suitable Boy he has used pure prose! John Steinbecks books use pure prose and they are enormously satisfying. Stephen King scares the hell out of you because he uses a type of symbolic language that re-creates simple scenes in terrifying symbols. That stays on your mind for a long time. Tagore uses metaphysical language to great advantage. I could go on and on\u2026. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Storytelling is deeply embedded in human DNA. But often, prose or poetry as storytelling vectors are inaccessible to everyday listeners, or readers, for different reasons. Enter prosetry, a new art form that is greater than the sum of poetry + prose, and more like storytelling and art than prose, because of its metaphorical content. ",
