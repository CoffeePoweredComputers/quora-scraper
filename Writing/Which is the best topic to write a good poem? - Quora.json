            "answer_text": "Okay.. So the answer is going to vary for every person! For me poem is the way I take out my pent up emotions.. So topics on social issues work for me! I have tried writting about love, but it just doesn't work for me\u2026 Also I can't rhyme things.. I just can't! To me the actual message is more important than the rhythm! So here are a few examples! \u00a9 primrose12051999 NOT A DOLL I was playing with my favourite doll, the one with big eyes and painted lips, I wanted to be a princess, To wear a dress of silver and crown of gold, I can make you a princess, A voice whispered, I can give you a throne of glass, I walked behind the cloaked figure, I will be your soldier, He had said, I walked inside my Kingdom, roses and candles scattered around, Is this mine to reign, I had asked, He gave me a bed, where the princess lay, torn and battered, tied and abused, A princess with a traitor soldier, A princess who never wanted to be a doll... WAITING FOR THE NEXT SUNRISE He spilled water on me, I forgave him, He is only a human I thought, Next week, He spilled ink on me, Tiny rivulets made way across my dress, colouring my body blue, I still forgave him, It's okay to make mistakes I thought, I laughed it off, Until I had tears, A few weeks later, He said he loved me, I looked into his eyes, And laughed like it was the funniest joke I had ever heard, He never said anything, A few weeks later, I walked across the street, My hair flowing wildly against the wind, I never saw it happen, When my hair smoked like there was a fire around me, and the smell of the burnt flesh hit my nose, My body boiled like it was on fire, I still didn't understand what happened, I didn't understand when they did a plastic surgery, I stand across the balcony, facing away from the wind, I wait for the next sunrise, for the day I could forgive myself, for trusting the boy who wore a tag of feminism, and made rape jokes... By this poem I want to tell you that people who do acid-attacks or rapes  are not unknown people most of the times, they are the same people you once trusted, never trust anyone so much that you end up getting in a situation you could avoid ",

SAD OUTCAST\u00a9 In darkness, he stood and watched time rush by Not knowing how to change things or if he should try Friends were but false images his own pride let him see Thus he never knew just how things were meant to be In sunshine, he stumbled and staggered over golden rays Blinded by the glittering smiles of everyone's \"happy days\" A step to slow, he was always lagging farther behind Yet he talks to fast so the right words he never could find Always looking for the answers to questions he dare not ask While trampling on his only means of accomplishing the task Lost in flight on a journey searching for all that's unknown Hiding from normality an outcast to which he can never atone Rickey Gage FUNNY FIRST DATE\u00a9 I was, broken by my own self-doubt and fears Not knowing how to show I am more than it appears I was, then transformed in the blink of an eye Because you said yes to a date with a hug then kiss goodbye I was, lifted on waves of emotional bliss An electrically charged by your passionate kiss I was, lost in a memory of a hot fevered embrace And the stunning rapture of your beautiful face I was, lost in the moments between ticks of the clock Trying to answer the mystery so your love I might unlock I was, treading in water well over my head Living up to a first date already had me wishing I were dead Rickey Gage DEEP JUDGEMENT\u00a9 In conversation on a dark and dismal wintry night Set two lonely souls debating life's saddening plight Sinking deeper into their depressive melancholic mood Wondering why man is so selfish, careless and rude The one, a lady of ivory skin and wheat yellow hair Said \"Everyone calls me a dumb blond, so why should I care \"The other, an aged man of mystery with skin dark as coal Spoke in a commanding whisper that reached into the soul \"Simple the mind that can only see the color of hair or skin\" \"For human perfection is unseen coming from within\" \"But judge not others by your own phobia, faults or fears\" \"Less my friend you be judged in kind by your own peers\" Rickey Gage DARK SAVING GRACE\u00a9 With the morning light, she drifted away Never looking back with anything to say Determination and bad intent on her face Her purpose was a kind of saving grace He had pushed her once too much this time You see the way he treated her was a crime She turned the other cheek and had it slapped She spoke up and to her face, his fist went smack She had always fallen back into his way of thinking And into the depths of hell, she was surely sinking But when on her little sister he had set his eye There was no holding her back she didn't even try No self-respect due to the touch of too many hands He had let other men have her right where she stands But her sister would not live the whore's life she had And it would be the last time he would ever get mad It didn't take much for her to point and shoot they say Two shots and it was over, free of the pain she drifts away Rickey Gage SPIRITUAL SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN\u00a9 On the wings of hope and prayer, they fly in total bliss These soldiers of heaven who in plain sight we miss They mark the actions of all who walk this earthly plain Good marks and to the gates of heaven one might obtain So to are marked the cruel, crooks and killers in kind But in a much harder and hotter place, their end will find To hide in plain sight with wings every color under the sun They sacrifice all but honor, valor, and duty, just to be one From the sky, they descend in a line of astral splendor As we remain unaware the judgment on us they might render Beauty unsurpassed they seem to have us under their spell These soldiers who mark whether we will go to heaven or hell Fly free heavens sentries, butterflies in armor of color and light And pray they mark well the many things in life we've done right Rickey Gage ROMANTIC THE DANCE\u00a9 Pounding hearts heard clear in the night Sets the rhythm for the dancers in flight Round and round like the turning of a wheel Their bodies keeping time with what they feel She is the ecstasy and he the pain of passion He is the force and she, his desires fashion Savage his efforts to reach as deep as her soul While she thrashes wildly trying to stay in control Bittersweet the moment, mentally frozen in time Trying to hold onto a climactic feeling so sublime Then hearts so fast they sound as if one long beat Echoes the cries of passions dance, now complete Rickey Gage I hope this was helpful.
