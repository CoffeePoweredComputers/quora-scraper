            "answer_text": "First let me quote Guy Clark from his song, Cold Dog Soup. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no money in poetry, that\u2019s what sets the poet free. I\u2019ve had all the freedom I can stand.\u201d You can make a little money submitting to paying venues but contests are a wash because you\u2019re never going to win enough to cover your submission fees. You can self publish a book but unless you\u2019re getting out there doing readings, going to festivals, teaching workshops on writing, you\u2019re unlikely to sell many copies. I do all of those things but I do it because I love it and my living comes from other sources. If you are good at reading and good at teaching the craft of poetry and are free to travel you might be able to put something of a living together by making enough connections in the poetry world and in educational settings that you have a lot of invitations to come read and teach. I know a couple of poets that make that work but it\u2019s hard work and a lot of travel. Check out the Austin International Poetry Festival (on line) for a way to start making connections and learning what it\u2019s like. ",

            "answer_text": "Transactionally speaking: By publishing. At face value I'd say you can't. Being a \"poet\" is not a profession like being a lawyer, architect, plumber, or physician, or a journalist. A poet is a type of artist whose craft, no matter how idiosyncratic, is one of self expression (regardless of what specifically a poem might in fact express). While a poet may publish (paid or unpaid) and consequently achieve financial success usually after a published collection in the form of a book can return royalties, it is less common. Most poets who identify significantly as such also have other primary means of earning income. Jobs can be in closely related disciplines such as poetry criticism or comparative literature, or as journalists and historians, or in less academic pursuits such as plumbers or lawyers or architects. If you have something to say you can be a poet. Whether or not you're any good is another story (based on your self evaluation of your craft and the reflection on your writing by readers and other factors out of the scope of the question and which I won't get into).
