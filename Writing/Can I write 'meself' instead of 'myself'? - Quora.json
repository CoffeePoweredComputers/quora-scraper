If you are writing in a particular dialect in which \u201cmeself\u201d feels more appropriate, then people may appreciate the \u2018colour\u2019 of the spelling. As an alternative spelling in formal writing I would suggest steering clear of it, as doing it consistently is likely to make a reader consider you to be lacking in formal education, or at least that you have some peculiar axe to grind.
