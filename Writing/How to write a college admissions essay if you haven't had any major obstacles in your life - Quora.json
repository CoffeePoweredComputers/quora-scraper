            "answer_text": "None of the college admissions essays  require you to discuss \"major obstacles in your life\". In fact, the only prompt that is similar to talking about \"obstacles\" is the 2nd one of the five: Some students have a background, identity, interest, or talent that is so meaningful they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?Describe a problem you\u2019ve solved or a problem you\u2019d like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma-anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.The most important thing to do is talk about something that matters to you, not what you think the college admissions officer will want to hear about you.

            "answer_text": "I can't speak for most colleges admissions offices, but I think the better essays come from people who take regular, everyday scenarios and learn from them. It means that you don't have to go through a tragedy in order to grow as a person. If not done well, writing about a major obstacle can make the applicant seem like they're looking for pity points.  I know you've probably heard this before but, you have to, have to, have to, include your own voice in it. They don't want to hear about you going through a personal loss, because odds are, there are thousands of people that are also writing about that. Make it your own by adding something silly, adding personal anecdotes, or making it humorous.  I once read one written by a girl who loss a major swimming competition. She kept going even though she knew she was going to lose. That doesn't sound very interesting, does it? But it was good because she was able to learn that winning wasn't everything. Not to mention, it was really well written. I could just imagine her character and her personality through her essay. I was rooting for her throughout reading it. She was likable because she was so honest.  It doesn't matter what you write about as long as it jumps out. Have teachers and friends read it. Revise it over and over again. Add metaphors to what you like. Also, try going through college websites. They have pretty good samples of what they're look for. ",
