            "answer_text": "It depends on the perspective. I am a Chelsea fan and I will always say they are the best team in the premier league. But for answering this I will not think as I am a Chelsea fan. I will try to be neutral. Squad Size :- If you see the squad Size and the quality of players in the squad you may think of three or four teams.Manchester United:- Probably united has the biggest squad of all the premier league teams. Even last season they had to bench some of their quality players. And this season they have added 3\u20134 more signings!Manchester City:- The other side of the Manchester also has great squad depth. They literally had to create new locker room for that type of squad (just kidding). But this thing is a worry for them since Pep never focuses on the winning combination and tries to give each of his players playing time and hence they drop silly points.Arsenal:- If you have watched the community shield match between Chelsea and Arsenal you might have noticed the squad difference. They have got such a good strength but irony is that the players don't want to play for their manager.Quality starting eleven:- The quality of the starting eleven matters more than your bench strength since the substitutes mostly come after 60 minutes of the game. It is your starting eleven that has to play the most part of the game.Chelsea:- I still think Chelsea have got the best starting eleven in the premier league. They have got a good manager in Antonio Conte who can change the formation according to his strong players. They have got the best players in the premier league playing in their respective positions except for the goal keeper where I think DDG is better than Courtois but it doesn't matter since they don't concede many goals or face more shots on target.Manchester United:- Manchester United found the missing part in their last season's starting 11 in Nemanja Matic who can break play and allow Pogba to run freely. They also got rid of misfiring Rooney and Ibrahimovic (though they have signed Ibrahimovic, he would still be benched for Lukaku) and have brought strong Lukaku!Manchester City:- Even Pep Guardiola doesn't know his starting 11. He keeps on rotating his players and the players themselves get confused in which position they have to play!Liverpool:- Liverpool still have the best attacking players. They have successfully kept Coutinho and have added Salah and Solanke. But honestly they suck at defending!Spurs:- One of the best starting 11 in the league. This year they may face problems at Wembley. But still one of the strongest side with a young, intelligent manager. Not to forget they finished second last year.Arsenal:- The problem isn't in the quality of players that start the game but the problem is the formation and lack of passion shown by them towards their manager/board.Considering above two points Manchester United seems to be the strongest side but you never know what surprises Premier League will give this season.

            "answer_text": "One would say that Manchester United is the best team in the premier league right now. On papers, yes they boast a fleet of world class players such as Pogba, Mata, Mkhitaryan and in addition to that they have signed Ibrahimovic again. Not only that and they have splashed a hoard of cash on Lukaku. But as a team, Manchester United look a little shaky with the recent run. An away draw to Liverpool might seem a happy result for few. But as a team who is giving title challenges, you never should look for a point as a big thing. On the other hand, Manchester City has been phenomenal and clinical in terms of their game and as well as producing results. Easily scoring 5 goals game in game out. At the start of the season, Pep and Manchester City were criticized for spending hell lot of money on their defense. But their performance says it all. They have conceded only 7 goals so far in the league sitting behind Manchester United who have conceded only 5 goals. But it is not only that They have scored 38 goals in just 11 games, averaging 3.5 goals per 90 minutes. They offer a complete treat, with Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings from the behind, Sane and Sterling causing menace in the wings and Aguero getting his goal scoring form back, Silva and Fernandinho doing whats the best they can. Arsenal has bought Lacazette this season as their record signing. But all Arsenal fans want to see Sanchez, Ozil and Lacazette in their starting eleven and unfortunately it has happened only once. Utterly humiliating loss to Liverpool, almost humiliating loss to City and not to mention the 90th minute disappointment in Watford, they have dropped many points early which is very well a difficult situtation in the context of Premier League now-a-days. Premier League is known for its unpredictable nature, as to who will clinch the precious league title. But with City looking as a team which is almost impossible to beat, I would rather say Arsenal will be fighting for the top 4 finish as usual towards the end. Chelsea, the defending champions had a shaky start to their campaign with a loss to Burnley at their home, has advanced well. With just 1 point difference between them and the 2nd and 3rd placed Man United and Spurs respectively, they are expected to progress well. Morata just rekindled his goal scoring eagerness in the last game against United. Being said that Kante returning back, they boast a very good chance for challenging City. Liverpool \u2026 - never mind. Being said all of the above, it is The Premier League. As Alex Ferguson said, \u201cFootball bloody hell..\u201d Let us see at the end of Gameweek 38, who is the ultimate best. ",
