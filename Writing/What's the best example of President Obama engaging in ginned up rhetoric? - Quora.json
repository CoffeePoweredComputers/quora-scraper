            "answer_text": "While running he demonized sales people on an incentive trip.  Calling them executives ruining the economy.  Said people met a quota of sales to earn this trip.  It's common in sales.  It's considered to be income, and it's no different than anybody else's paycheck coming home.  Had the company ripped said trip they could have been sued over wage theft.  Had they canceled the trip and given the cash value they'd have spent more on lost deposits to hotels, etc. etc.  I have no doubt the President understood this prior to his demonizing.  It was an example of him wishing to use populist rhetoric. ",
