            "answer_text": "When we learn how to write essays, we learn how to organize our thoughts in a cohesive manner, so that we can communicate effectively. This is a skill that we will use throughout our lives, in school, at work and elsewhere. If we do not learn to communicate clearly we are likely to face difficulties later on. When we compose essays we follow a logical structure. We are taught to begin with a premise and end with a conclusion, while we justify our argument logically along the way. This structure makes it easy for others to understand what point we are trying to make and why. It can be applied to anything from a business memo to a Quora answer. If we can\u2019t order our thoughts upon the page we can cause confusion. For example, some years back a colleague from work asked me to read a letter she had written to the mayor of her town. I read the letter but didn\u2019t understand what it was about or what she wanted the mayor to do. I had to ask her to explain the situation. As it turned out she\u2019d been given a ticket for not stopping at a stop sign in her neighborhood. She told me that the sign was hidden by a tree and couldn\u2019t be seen. Additionally she thought that the sign was not needed at that particular intersection. She had two goals: to get the sign removed and to have the fine waived for her ticket. Her verbal explanation made sense, but her letter did not. The mayor would not have understood her goals any more than I had. I suggested she re-write the letter, but she thought it was fine as it was. As I recall, the sign remained and she ended up paying the ticket. Would a better letter have changed the outcome? I don\u2019t know, but a more clearly written letter would at least have given the mayor the opportunity to consider the matter. That is just one example, but we can easily imagine similar situations. Imagine if your employee misunderstands your email instructions and makes a costly mistake at work. Imagine the babysitter trying to puzzle out which food is for the child and which is for the new puppy. If we\u2019ve learned how to write an essay then we can apply that skill to other formats and thus reduce the risk that we\u2019ll be misunderstood. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the obvious reason is to give the student practice in basic writing skills, such as spelling and grammar, which one needs before attempting to write anything more complicated than a grocery list. Then there are some skills such as how to structure sentences and paragraphs in order to use active voice and emphasize what is important in each. And the hardest skill of all is editing, because that usually requires you to delete much of what you wrote and rewrite the rest. Why would you, wearing your editor hat, decide to delete anything you, as writer, felt strongly enough about to put on paper in the first place? That ties back to the most important part of writing that should have taken place before the first word was written. The writer has to know the purpose of the writing. In school, of course, the student just wants a good grade, so figure out what the teacher wants and do it. But adults write for other reasons. They may want to convey their opinions to the President, Governor, elected representative or government official, hoping to change the mind of the recipient or obtain help of some kind. We can call this persuasive writing. In other cases the object may be merely to explain something. Journalism is an example since the purpose is usually to tell what happened to whom, where, when, and sometimes why. Scientific papers are another example where they describe an experiment that was conducted and what the results were. Sometimes both types may be combined. Opinions are rarely persuasive without some background explanation. Journalism may be \u201cslanted\u201d by subtle elements designed to persuade the reader rather than merely inform. Scientific papers may present a theory to explain why an observed phenomenon occurs. A good writer has identified the purpose before starting to write, and thought about how to accomplish that purpose. Maybe a formal outline has been drafted, or some notes jotted down, or maybe just a few thoughts organized in the mind. Then later, when reviewing a draft, the writer analyzes each paragraph, sentence and word. Does it advance the purpose or is it a distraction? Can it be made clearer or stronger? Is the tone right for the audience and the purpose? (It would definitely be counter-productive to include curse words in a letter to the Pope, or threats to the President, or tell the teacher the essay assignment is stupid.) Then there are some considerations for the reader. Should the conclusion be a mystery until the end, or should it be stated first and then logically explained, step by step? Is it so long that beginning with a summary would be appreciated? Good writing is a skill that takes a lot of practice to acquire, and a well-written piece takes a lot of work and thought. Readers can tell. ",
