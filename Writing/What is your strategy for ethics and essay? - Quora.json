            "answer_text": "Copying an answer I've written for a similar question on quora. It's for the essay paper but largely applies to the ethics paper as well. Understand that essay paper preparation is not like other mains papers since it doesn't have a set syllabus. You should prepare for essay along with your general preparation for the exam. Here is are some things you can do: Step 1: Get acquainted with essay themes UPSC asks questions on certain themes such as education, technology, foreign affairs, religion etc. It is a good idea to first go through previous year's papers and make a note of general themes being covered.Once you have made a list of themes, make notes on examples, statistics, quotes, issues around those themes as you prepare for other papers.Make sure to understand and cover arguments/views from multiple angles around the themes you are studying.Step 2: Writing practice and feedback Writing practice is imperative if you want to write good essays. Make sure to practice as much as you can.Feedback is important as you write, so ask someone to review your essay, join a test series and/or get a book about essay writing to see where you can improve.Know that even if you are good writer generally, essay writing for the civil services exam is different so you will need to prepare yourself.Step 3: Improve finer points Once you get the basics of essay writing right, you should focus on other areas such as presentation, handwriting, including holistic arguments etc. All the best!

            "answer_text": "First of all, you do NOT just prepare for one essay or ethics paper. Not if you want it to be good. Just like you do not prepare for one football game, you should practice, read, study, and develop a style that will allow you to focus on the subject of your essay and not the mechanics of it. Good Luck. ",
