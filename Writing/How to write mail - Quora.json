            "answer_text": "Write a meaningful subject line. Before you hit \u201csend,\u201d take a moment to write a subject line that accurately describes the content, giving your reader a concrete reason to open your message. Keep the message focused. Why are you writing? Are you responding to a request? Apologizing for an error on your part? Asking for the recipient to take some action for you? Purpose: Any textbook on business and professional writing will include examples of complaint and adjustment letters, proposal letters, progress reports, application letters, and so forth.Directness: You probably don\u2019t need to open with \u201cDear Ms. Jones,\u201d engage in personal chit-chat, and close with \u201cYours Truly.\u201d (If you really want to be that formal, send a letter on paper instead.)Organization: Readers will often get partway through a complex message, hit \u201creply\u201d as soon as they have something to contribute, and forget to read the rest. That\u2019s human nature. Number your points in more complex message. (Start with a clear statement of how many parts there are to your message.) Split unrelated points into separate, purposeful emails. If you send all your employees a message that only relates to some of them, a lot of people will waste time reading the whole thing, in order to determine whether any part of it applies to them. Other people will give up as soon as they find any detail that does not apply to them. (Again, this is human nature.)",
