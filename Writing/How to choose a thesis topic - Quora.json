            "answer_text": "The most important variable in choosing your thesis topic is whether or not the topic is something you are really, truly, deeply passionate about. If the answer is no, move on to something else. The easiest way to write a good paper is to write it about something you love. Once you have found a topic you care about, find an aspect of it that you would like to learn more about. Find something that interests you enough that you can spend the next several months researching it and writing about it. If you don't know whether or not this would be the case, try researching it for a couple of hours or a couple of days. If you're bored stiff, find a different aspect to focus on. Alright! You have now found something you care about, that you would also like to expand your knowledge of. At this point, you're probably going to want to narrow down your topic a little more, preferably to something that would contribute valuable knowledge to your field. For instance, I may be really passionate about computer security, and I'm curious as to where end-users get their information about it, so I decide to research how topic distribution varies across computer security news articles, stories, and education documents. It's no thesis, but choosing the topic follows approximately the same pattern. So, in order to choose a great thesis topic, or a great topic for any paper, you need to 1) find something you care about, 2) find an aspect you would like to learn more about, and 3) find a facet of that which would be interesting and relevant to your field. Thanks for the A2A! ",
