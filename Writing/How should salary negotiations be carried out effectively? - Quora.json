            "answer_text": "Salary negotiations are always tough, because often times merit doesn't come into play as much as \"playing the game\" does. But I'll try to give you a few tips:  1) Try to get them to put a number out first. These people negotiate salaries all day long, so they know exactly what figures are reasonable. The last thing you want is to put out a number you think is \"fair\" and have the HR person jumping in his seat because you lowballed yourself (doing his job for him, really). Ask him to make you an offer three times before you give your request.  2) Don't tell them outright what you currently make, or what you made at your last job. Instead, give them a range of the absolute lowest you made (usually, just your \"base\") and the amount you made with all factors included (such as bonus, insurance, expenses, etc.). This helps set a \"negotiation range\". In your case, you're hurt by the fact that they know what you made (before you resigned) and can use that to justify their offer.  3) Don't be afraid to request an \"unreasonable\" amount. As I said, these people negotiate salaries all day long, so they know exactly what sort of number to work towards. You don't, so you have to get them to tip their hand as much as they can. If you're talking about salary they're serious about hiring you, so you don't have to worry too much about making an outrageous request. They understand your motivation. What happens is when you make your (outrageous, but not completely offensive) request, it's basically telling them that it's their turn to give you a number. This does two things: forces them to give you an offer, and if the request is high enough it'll adjust the scale so they make a higher offer.  4) Pull out your credentials, and do some comparison shopping. Point out your experience and your education. Do a salary lookup and get the \"standard salary\" for somebody with your experience and education in the position (like in the link below). Any company will have to at least give you a reasonable market rate, or else they won't be able to hire / keep their employees.  5) Don't be afraid to walk away. There will be other opportunities and if they won't address the issues you had previously to your satisfaction, you *will* leave again.  Personal anecdote: I was hired out of school (after the bust) into San Francisco in a development / QA role. I made $45,000, which is seriously below market, especially in a city as expensive as SF, and the job required long hours and weekends. I simply sat down with my manager and presented salary comparisons and got $15,000 in raises within 2 months. Managers understand what they're dealing with. (I ended up leaving briefly afterward anyway).  And be confident and calm. This is like any other person to person interaction. If you appear confident and look like you'll stick to your guns, it'll sell it in the negotiations.  Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Money, benefits, and vacation should be negotiated at the end of the job interview process  after a candidate has received a written job offer. The written offer should be viewed as the beginning of the final phase of the hiring process.  More than likely, given today's job market, the written offer will come after a series of interviews; both sides should have used these sessions to figure if there is a fit between them. For the candidate, these early round interviews are tryouts, and the beginning of how an \"internal reputation\" is created. Or not.  The candidate will probably be asked during this process what his (her) expectations are concerning the big three of money, benefits, and time off.It is incumbent upon the candidate to handle these issues skillfully, i.e., not spilling your beans prematurely.  The candidate is free, of course, to handle these inquiries unskillfully, going ahead and spilling their beans, and them finding out their \"openness\" leads to a decreased amount of respect, followed closely by a commiserate decrease in the amount of the big three of money, benefits, and time off. Unskillful is as unskillful does. Assuming that a candidate has handled himself with a modicum of skill, the written offer is then negotiated point by point. How the candidate handles this will, to a large extent, determine their \"internal reputation\" at their new workplace. Handle it well and good things begin to come right away; handle it poorly and be perceived a just another employee. Needless to say, there is lot of uncertainty surrounding the whole process. Welcome to the world. Every candidate will both feel and deal with the uncertainty. Offers accrue to those with skill. The real life example of most entry level, or non senior-level jobs will come with a fairly narrow range of money, etc is valid to a point. But, the wise candidate still wants to be seen as skillful, as competent, as a standout from all the other candidates because the first level is just that; the first level. There are more levels to come. If you're not skilled at the beginning, when do you become skilled? ",
