            "answer_text": "Marriage in the Chrstian Bible is ambiguos. There is no requirement to stand before a priest or a minister and have a ceremony. Some interpretations have it that when a man and a woman have sex with each other in the context of a loving and committed relationship they are married. Some interpret that praying together can begin a marriage. There are however legal and practicle matters involved in marriages today. Sex makes babies. That is the intended purpose of sex. People were discouraged from doing what makes babies before marriage for many reasons. A marriage provides a legally recognized stable household in which to raise any babies that are made as a result of doing what makes babies. The marriage protects the rights of the husband to his children. When a man makes babies with a woman he is not married to he has very few (depending on jurisdictions) or no rights at all to the children, though he will have to pay child support. Marriage also protects the woman's joint property rights and the responsibility of the husband to provide support for her and her child. Monogamous marriages were also encouraged because of sexually transmitted diseases. If two people who have not been exposed to or infected by a sexually trasmitted disease marry each other and remain faithful they will not have to worry about sexually trasmitted diseases. They can have all the baby making unprotected sex they want with each other. Sex before marriage has practical consequences and risks involved. Unplanned pregnancies and diseases can be devastating if you are not carefull. Mortality is another issue. You will have to search your conciuos in this matter. I personally do not believe that responsible adults in a loving and committed relationship who are prepared to deal with the possible consequences are condemned to eternal torturel if they do not wait for a formal marriage ceremony. But I am certain that there are those who disagree. They are free to make their own choices accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "There  is no Hebrew or Greek word used in the Bible that precisely refers  to  sex before marriage. The Bible undeniably condemns adultery and  sexual  immorality, but is sex before marriage considered sexually  immoral?  According to 1 Corinthians 7:2,   \u201cyes\u201d is the clear answer: \u201cBut since there is so much immorality,  each  man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.\u201d In  this  verse, Paul states that marriage is the \u201ccure\u201d for sexual  immorality. First Corinthians 7:2 is essentially saying that, because people cannot control themselves   and so many are having immoral sex outside of marriage, people should   get married. Then they can fulfill their passions in a moral way. Since 1 Corinthians 7:2 clearly includes sex before marriage in the definition of sexual  immorality,  all of the Bible verses that condemn sexual immorality as  being sinful  also condemn sex before marriage as sinful. Sex before  marriage is  included in the biblical definition of sexual immorality.  There are numerous Scriptures that declare sex before marriage to be a  sin (Acts 15:20; 1 Corinthians 5:1; 6:13, 18; 10:8; 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19; Ephesians 5:3; Colossians 3:5; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Jude 7).   The Bible promotes complete abstinence before marriage. Sex between a   husband and his wife is the only form of sexual relations of which God   approves (Hebrews 13:4). Far  too often we focus on the \u201crecreation\u201d aspect of sex without   recognizing that there is another aspect\u2014procreation. Sex within   marriage is pleasurable, and God designed it that way. God wants men  and  women to enjoy sexual activity within the confines of marriage.  Song of  Solomon and several other Bible passages (such as Proverbs 5:19)   clearly describe the pleasure of sex. However, the couple must   understand that God\u2019s intent for sex includes producing children. Thus,   for a couple to engage in sex before marriage is doubly wrong\u2014they are   enjoying pleasures not intended for them, and they are taking a chance   of creating a human life outside of the family structure God intended   for every child. While  practicality does not determine right from wrong, if the Bible's   message on sex before marriage were obeyed, there would be far fewer   sexually transmitted diseases, far fewer abortions, far fewer unwed   mothers and unwanted pregnancies, and far fewer children growing up   without both parents in their lives. Abstinence is God\u2019s only policy   when it comes to sex before marriage. Abstinence saves lives, protects   babies, gives sexual relations the proper value, and, most importantly,   honors God.  What does the Bible say about sex before marriage? The Greek word porneia is most often translated \u201csexual immorality\u201d or \u201cfornication\u201d in the New Testament. Some translations consistently render porneia as \u201cfornication\u201d in order to differentiate it from \u201cadultery.\u201d The  word  \u201cfornication,\u201d in modern English, primarily carries the idea of   premarital sex / sex before marriage. However, porneia does not  actually refer, explicitly, to premarital sex. It actually  referred to  sexual perversion in general. Greek literature from the  approximate time  period as the New Testament used porneia to refer to  prostitution, homosexuality, adultery, incest, and other  sexual  perversions. So, we should not necessarily read \u201cpremarital sex\u201d  into  every occurrence of porneia in the New Testament. The question arises, then, is premarital sex considered a sexual perversion within the scope of porneia? In  order to determine whether premarital sex is considered a sexual   perversion, it is helpful to focus on what sex is supposed to be. The   best way to recognize a counterfeit is to be familiar with the truth.   Sex, biblically speaking, is intended to be a physical union between a   husband and his wife with the goal of reproduction, and/or physical   pleasure, and/or emotional closeness. biblically speaking, though, the   determining factor in whether sex is sinful is the question \u201cwith   whom?\u201d, not the \u201cwhy?\u201d Nowhere does the Bible speak against sex between  a  husband and his wife. Everywhere sex outside of marriage is  mentioned,  the Bible condemns it. Sex outside of marriage is a  perversion. It does  not matter when, with whom, or why; sex between  anyone other than a  husband and his wife is a perversion of sex.  Therefore, premarital sex  is a perversion, and condemned every time the  Bible condemns porneia. There is also a more explicitly biblical basis on which to declare premarital sex as porneia. First Corinthians 7:2 reads, \u201cBut because of the temptation to sexual immorality (porneia),   each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.\u201d In   this verse, the Apostle Paul presents a problem \u201cthe temptation to   sexual immorality\u201d and a solution \u201ceach man having his own wife and  each  women her own husband.\u201d If marriage is the solution, the problem   logically must be extra-marital. To define porneia in 1  Corinthians 7:2 as prostitution or incest or some other sexual   perversion does not make sense if premarital sex is not also a   perversion. If premarital sex is not a sin, why is prostitution a sin?   Both involve consenting adults. It is biblically clear that marriage is   the sanctifying factor in sex. Sex in marriage is good and right. Sex   outside of and/or before marriage is a sinful perversion.  Premarital Sex - What Does the Bible Say?",

            "answer_text": "Not only as a Christian but from personal experience my view on sex before marriage is this: I will not do it, again. This has created much turmoil in my heart that I choose the path that God has designed for sex in the context to marriage. Let me explain. As a man I understand that my desire for sex is not just about physical intimacy but it is also a spiritual and emotional one as well. By entering a sexual intimate relationship before marriage it creates a need for more because it feeds not only the physical desire but also a need to be close to someone and create a bond between that person and myself. By opening this door it creates a desire that when broken hurts more than just a simple physical action creates. The desire for sex about unity, creating a bond between two people to create another life. When we view sex in this manner it gives a whole new meaning than just \u201cbasic needs,\u201d because when sex happens it creates life between the two that builds a bond, that the new life will need to grow into. We are taught that a healthy family home creates a hope for the child being raised in it. This is the new life that is created by the bond between the two spouses. By waiting until marriage your are showing you are putting your values first of loving not only your future spouse but also the life that you and your spouse will create. ",

Yes for rich and people who are in good position or who are gods servants like pope and religious people lot of stuff like these and can be forgiven but a normal man cannot do these things. sex before marriage is allowed in some situations and you can maintain sex slaves as well but only for some people not all people can do this you cn even marry your own sister if both are agreed there is no command that you cannot marry if both are ok you can go ahead sex before marriage was allowed ",

            "answer_text": "Most see it as a sin because they were taught that.  My first question regarding it was that when does the bible say a marriage is constituted?   There is only one verse that is repeated a few times and that is that a man will leave his parent and live with his wife and they will be one.    In the spiritual world if 2 became one flesh it is when they have sex. Therefore there is out of marriage sex, if you had sex with more than one person, but can't be something like pre marital sex as sex then constitutes a marriage if you know what I am saying.  God looks at the heart and your intent.  I am not for living and sleeping with every second person because you think they are the one, but if you are in a committed relationship and living together then commit as if it is a ring thing.  The ring and marriage license is a human tradition that the church adopted.  If you believe it is sin and then do it, then it is sin! My other question would be that why God chose a unmarried man and woman the to bear his child Jesus. I am not interested in all those answers that it is a holy thing - sex is not unholy, so why did God choose this couple and not a married couple? ",

It does say that sexual immorality (Old Testament, New Testament, you pick) is a sin\u2014so if it\u2019s sex for no reason other than what a dog is looking for or is without love and commitment, consider it may be sexual immorality and sinful. God does want us to reserve sex for marriage not because it's \"bad\" or \"dirty, or you\u2019d be this big person of sin\" but precisely because it's such a unique, exclusive, and wonderful thing. IT\u2019S IMPORTANT. It's a powerful event the bonds two people and affects the relationship between a man and a woman as nothing else can.Please consider reading this, because it explains this perspective so much better than I can. It explains love, faithfulness, how becoming one flesh really matters. Beyond married vs unmarried, also think about what it should mean between two people who loved each other and are committed to a life together. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking: Sex before marriage probably is considered a sin, but then, what isn't a sin according to Church Christianity? The Roman Catholic Church, for example,  considers recreational (for pleasure) sex, within or without marriage as sinful, thus the prohibition of contraceptives. What is really important is how we view sexual activity and to what extremes we go to obtain sexual satisfaction. The sexual urge is one of the most powerful instinctual forces that act on the animal body, and is very difficult to restrain. This causes many to incur in many morally deplorable, and at times unlawful, actions in oder to satisfy that urge. The sexual desire or passion belongs to the lower, animal soul of man, and hinders our spiritual development, dragging us downward to what is merely terrene, and thus, illusory. It attaches us to this world. This is the true reason why Paul recommended celibacy to those who wished to hasten their spiritual development. Socrates mentioned how he was finally free, in his old age, from the shackles of such a tyrant (sexual desire). ",

            "answer_text": "This is such an important question. Sex before marriage opens you and your partner up to so many risks, no matter where you are spiritually. Sexually transmitted diseases. Unplanned pregnancies (which lead to even harder questions dealing with adoption, abortion, single parenting, etc). Potential feelings of remorse, depression, and isolation. And the list goes on. God gave us sex as a gift between a husband and a wife. Anything outside of that structure, by definition, would be considered sin. As Christians, we are taught to wait until we are married before engaging in sex, to not only avoid the risks associated with sex before marriage, but also to keep it sacred to the covenant of marriage. And when you step back and really look at it, if you and your spouse wait for marriage, then you two will share a secret about each other that no one else ever will know, and there is something very special about that.

In my tradition, we read the Song of Solomon as an erotic love story between two unmarried persons. We do not read the Bible as condemning sexual behavior outside of marriage except for situations of adultery and coercive/non-consensual sexual activity. We frown on people becoming sexually active too early in their lives, but, to finally answer your question, in my tradition and others like it (most of mainline Protestantism) sex before marriage is not a sin and is widely practiced among those who consider themselves good Christians before marriage.

As someone who has been married more than once and now attempting to be a good christian, I see the wisdom of no sex outside of marriage. It isn\u2019t for legalistic reasons. As much as society wishes to pretend you can have casual sex with no connection, it simply isn't true. You can however, make yourself completely numb to your actions to where you feel you have no connection. Jeremiah talks about how a wife can go from adulterous to whore. As an adulterous, she feels guilt for her transgressions; as a whore she is blind to her own sin. ",

Sex unites two people emotionally and physically in such a way that it hurts when the two people involved walk away from each other. God had foreseen the dangerous and disastrous implications of sex outside of marriage and therefore commands His children to avoid it. All of God\u2019s commands are a result of His love for us so we don\u2019t do something outside His boundaries and end up hurt and betrayed. Sex outside of marriage hurts both the people involved and also God. You can choose to abstain from sex before marriage by avoiding meeting your future spouse in private and having conversations that can lead to sex. ",

Anything else is \u201cmissing the mark\u201d which is a literal definition of the Greek word we translate as sin. So no, it\u2019s never okay. It won\u2019t kill you to do it, and you will probably enjoy it, especially if you\u2019re male. But it\u2019s still wrong, and it\u2019s still going against what God meant for us. ",

There are prohibitions of any number of sexual behaviors, and there are prohibitions against \u201csexual immorality\u201d or \u201cfornication\u201d that one can interpret to be referring to anything one thinks is sexually immoral, including premarital sex. Sex before marriage is not specifically forbidden in the Christian scriptures. ",
