            "answer_text": "Firstly, I love this question - thank you for requesting my answer! For a complex, involved character such as this, it\u2019s all the more important to start at the very beginning. So. Why are you writing an autistic black character? By this I mean, why are those specific traits essential to that character? Could you write the character without them or are they integral to their personality and thus their words/actions? Diversity should never be done purely for diversity\u2019s sake; it should always be underpinned by real, fallible people. Audiences don\u2019t want a strong female character because there is a shortage of strong female characters - they want to be caught up in the individual\u2019s character as a whole, and being strong and female - or being black and autistic - are just elements of a whole colourful mosaic of personality. An example of this done poorly is Ryan, a companion of Jodie Whittaker\u2019s Doctor Who. The show takes great lengths to constantly tell us how he\u2019s dyspraxic yet demonstrates no real-world understanding of the condition. My dear friend who has dyspraxia can literally fall over whilst sitting still - I\u2019ve watched him do it. Yet Ryan can make insane, death-defying leaps that Olympic athletes would struggle with whilst mithering about his supposed dyspraxia. This shows all people who have dyspraxia, or know those with dyspraxia, that the show is essentially name-dropping diversity without appreciating why it is important to represent diversity accurately. As this example shows, it is very important to have real-world experience of a wide range of people. Do you know a lot of autistic people, not just through the media but personally? Do you know a lot of black people? If your experience is anything but firsthand it will show in your writing. As an autistic person myself, the most essential thing you can do is to make the character as plausible as possible. They should have very unique elements to their autism, as every autistic person does. For instance, my partner and my eldest son both love the sensory experience of squeezing these:  Yet they make me feel incredibly sick. Have you heard of self-stimulatory behaviour, known as stimming for short? It can take as many forms as there are possibilities. Some stim by rocking the entire top half of their body back and forth, yet I run my fingers along the webbing on my hands sporadically. Stimming helps autistic individuals to deal with the constant sensory overload that is life. In terms of hypersensitivities and hyposensitivities, we all vary wildly. My eldest son can;t cope with any bubbly drinks yet my youngest adores them (he only ever has them occasionally as a very special treat!). The trick is in the details. You need to know these little details, to include them and thus demonstrate a true understanding of the people you wish to portray. In terms of black people, you would need to demonstrate the same level of knowledge and understanding about how different cultures, different backgrounds and life experiences influence individuals and groups alike. Personally, I have had less personal experience meeting people of colour than I have had with people who have disabilities, so I would personally want to gain a lot more personal experience with POC before I would feel comfortable writing a character that is truly accurate and respectful to, for instance, African people and their culture. I could write a story about a person with cerebral palsy right now and feel comfortable about doing so because of the sheer level of personal experience I have had with a range of awesome individuals who happen to share the condition. When this varies from young gentlemen with very limited mobility and speech that I have had the privilege of providing personal care for, right up to fellow university students who barely have a limp, you can see how vital it is to have these experiences before putting pen to paper and risking creating a Ryan. I hope that this has been useful and am always open to further questions. Thanks for reading! ",

            "answer_text": "There are two things you should avoid. Stereotypes. Luckily, there is an easy and fun solution to that problem. Talk to many black people and autistic people. Join relevant online forums, follow Facebook pages, get to know and experience your character\u2019s background first-hand. After that, show your character\u2019s draft to autistic people and black people, and ask for their opinion about the representation you\u2019re giving.Defining your character by two extremely vague features.- First, autism comes in many forms, and black culture is extremely diverse. Is your character from Nigeria? Egypt? The USA? Do they have PDA, ADHD, social anxiety, or sensory issues? Be a little more specific.- Secondly, what else is the character about? Are they religious? Do they come from a poor, middle class or wealthy background? What is their motivation? What are their goals, beliefs, hobbies, quirks? What makes them likeable to some and annoying to others? Who are their friends? What are their priorities and morals? If you want a character to be relatable, give them a personality.Good luck! ",
