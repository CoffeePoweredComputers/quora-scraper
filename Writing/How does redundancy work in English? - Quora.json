            "answer_text": "Well, one example is that \u201cHe works\u201d indicates twice that it is singular\u2014both the pronoun and the -s ending cue that. \u201cThey were there last week\u201d tells us that the subject is plural in both the pronoun and the verb, and it tells us that it\u2019s past in both the verb and the time marker. This is what I think is meant by redundancy in linguistics. It\u2019s a feature, not a bug. In an oral presentation, a good speaker builds redundancy in, in order to help us form a mental map of what they are saying. They tell you that there are 3 reasons, they tell you the 3 reasons, they tell you that these 3 reasons lead to this conclusion. I don\u2019t think this is unique to English, though.
