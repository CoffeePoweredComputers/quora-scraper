            "answer_text": "How to write like and in the style of another author is easier when one is in love with the authors work/s, stories , characters, places, theme and style. Robert Louis Stevenson [1] and R F Delderfield [2] never knew each other. Delderfield as a boy fell in love with Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Treasure Island story. When he started reading the story he loved to his children he became bewitched by their questions and their shared fascination about; what happens to who after the story ends? Delderfield\u2019s children\u2019s awe and rapture over the thrilling adventures of Pirates on the high seas left poor old Mr Delderfield with no choice but to write the sequel and answer some of their questions like; What happened to Ben Gun? And so Mr D wrote the book; Ben Gun. Mr D\u2019s passion paid off in my view as Benn Gunn\u2019s story is invisibly faithful to the style and work of RLS\u2019s Treasure Island. If pirates and fuddy duddy dead writers don\u2019t capture your heart no worries. Contemporary sequel writing is a tried and tested technique of putting food on the table for writers and helps to keep their writing fresh and interesting and worth falling in love over \u266a\u25cb\u2665\u25cb\u266a. PS. I love Ernest\u2019s work also. I\u2019ve read \u201cThe old man of the seas\u201d. Three times, at least? Another favourite of mine is John Steinbeck\u2019s; Cannery row. He knew how to milk his own work in a similar fashion as he grew to love his own characters. He became frustrated for the want of having their voices heard as well. So he re-wrote it. From the beginning again using another of his characters perspectives to write; He began the follow up/re-telling of the story in Sweet Thursday with this line; \u201c If I had to tell the full story of Cannery Row I would of written it like this instead\u2026\u201d Something like that anyway both books are brilliant!

            "answer_text": "No one can help you in this, not even Hemingway. If writing style has anything to do about the life through which the writer has passed, it is absolutely true for hemingway. It is believed that he was product of World war. HenryLouis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \"in reaction to [his] experience of world war\". As a reaction to the elaborate flowery style of 19th century writing,  he came out with a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\u2014or at least very little\u2014is stated explicitly.\" Baker has commented: Hemingway learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language,how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth. Great writings may be influenced but never a copy of someone. Want to know the views of Hemingway himself: 'Live the full life of the mind, exhilarated by new ideas, intoxicated by the romance of unusual.' 'Write hard and clear about what hurts', is another exhortation of Hemingway. There is more pathos when he says: 'There is nothing to writing . All you have to do is to sit before your typewriter and bleed.' But then why copy? Your story would be different, your hurt would be different and different would be the way you would prefer to bleed.   Be original of you rather than copy of Hemingway.  ",
