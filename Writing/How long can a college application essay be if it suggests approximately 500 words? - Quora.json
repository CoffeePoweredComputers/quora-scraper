Here\u2019s how - download Mascot, search the college you\u2019re applying for and join the groups! Current college students: welcome to start your own group and help answer questions about your college! - This question always comes up by both undergrad/grad applicants and the frustration is understandable - honestly, it's like they're asking for a autobiography in 500 words, smh. But, it is a challenge all college applicants must accept and put 100% of their effort into, especially considering most people only apply to college 1-2 times in their entire life. Schools set these requirements because of the overwhelming amount of applications and simply because they don't have enough time or resources to read every detail of your life. So you need spend time thinking about what is most important about you and how you want your voice to be interpreted by the admissions committee. Sticking within the recommended guidelines helps the ad-com better identify who they are looking for out of the stampede of applicants. If you choose not to follow their requirements, say by submitting an essay of 1,000 words when they asked for 500, then you are choosing to portray yourself as someone who does not follow instructions and is inconsiderate of other people's time/work. That's not a good first impression to give in a college application and can easily be avoided by sticking to the word count! With that said, going over by a few words is something that is commonly forgiven, but still, just to be safe, you should email the admission office beforehand to ask, just to get a sense of how strict the school policy/culture is and then make your final judgement based on their response. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If the purpose of the essay question is to evaluate your ability to follow directions, then you should keep within the word limit. Some private scholarship programs, for example, will use application requirements as a way of filtering out excess applications. If you apply after the deadline or write an essay that is one word over the limit, they won\u2019t even read the application. It is easier to write long than to write short. So, an essay that is over the word limit demonstrates that you didn\u2019t take the time to carefully edit your essay. When cutting the length of an essay, you have to make choices, sometimes difficult choices. When you write an essay that is over the word limit, especially one where the excess verbiage does not contribute to the impact, it says something about you. ",
