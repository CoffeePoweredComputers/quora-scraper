            "answer_text": "Nope.  If you write what you don't know it rings false, and that transfers directly to the page, and the reader will always pick up on it. To correct some misconceptions:  How many submarines did Jules Verne ride in?  None.  But he was intimately familiar with  the French submarine experimenters of the time - including the submarine \"Le Plongeur\" designed and built by Simon Bourgeois and Charles Brun, which (gee, coincidentally enough...) just happened to be around for seven years before 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was published, and which Verne actually saw when he was writing the story.Fiction isn't about \"what you don't know\" at all.  It's about storytelling. Good storytellers write what they know.  They always have, they always will.Those who claim you should write what you don't know - using the \"crusading knights\" and \"dragons\" and \"space travel\" and all the Hogwarts stuff doesn't exist argument - clearly don't understand storytelling.  A story isn't about the inner workings of hyperdrive, the quantum physics of a witch's spell, the anatomy of a dragon or any of that ancillary 'color.'  A good story is about heroes and villains and love and hate and human emotion.  THAT is what good storytellers always write about; they write what they know.The Monomyth - which is every story - doesn't care whether you're in space, in a castle, in a well, fighting demons, learning magic, flying through wormholes or how a city can float in clouds.  It's about people.  It's about relatable experiences.  A good story is ALWAYS about relatable experiences.  The line wasn't \"when the sperm found the egg in the fallopian tube and capacitation occurred and the egg was fertilized the DNA payload was delivered\" because that wasn't the story and the writer didn't know human fertilization.  The line was was \"Luke, I am your father.\"  Why?  Because THAT was the STORY. If you don't write what you know, you'll never succeed as a writer. ",

            "answer_text": "Think it depends on your style of writing/plot. If you are looking to write, say, a fictional story based on true historical events, then obviously, yes, you need to be able to understand and have knowledge enough to make the plot engaging and realistic and characters suitable, as they would be. Also, of writing in a strong historical setting you might want to be knowledgeable on the type of language used, ie a period novel, or a medieval one. Yet, I would say, as I have written several stories in specific settings, I really enjoyed researching the subject. And even though I felt overly intellectual on the subject before hand, while writing I uncovered many tiny, everyday facts, that I had no idea about, but were key in character personalities and ways they went about things (not being overly articulate, I apologise!) But yes, I would say, generally, that you do need to know quite a lot about the subject of your novel, in order to make it realistic and effective to the reader. As, remember, primarily, the people who are going to be reading your book are the ones who are likely to be interested/ educated on the subject- so would be no use or enjoyment for them, if the author had no idea what they were writing about! You might want to look at an author such as Michael Morpurgo, who was previously interested in certain subjects that he wanted to write about, but then did a large amount of stimulating research in those subjects and was able to write compelling and magical tales, amusing and educating children. For example, he has conducted  a huge amount of research into the first/second world wars and has become an avid writer in the subject, publishing many books, ie Private Peaceful, An Elephant in the Garden and WarHorse. So in this sense it is both key and effective to know, in depth, what you're writing about. But obviously, if you're writing something totally of your own creation, then you're already as knowledgeable as you need to be! ",

            "answer_text": "I admit I always laugh in my sleeve when I hear an author proclaiming you must write what you know. This tidbit of advice is often touted as a cardinal rule of writing, with the inherent implication being that if you aren\u2019t 1) a brilliant scientist/mathematician/geologist/linguist/ tactician/psychologist or 2) an uber-wealthy jetsetter with the time and money to fly all over the place and experience everything possible then you really don\u2019t have any business writing books. Fiction Is About What You Don\u2019t KnowWhoever came up with this rule obviously didn\u2019t credit imagination too much. In fact, it would seem said person probably didn\u2019t have much imagination. Think about it. Fiction, at its very essence, is all about what we don\u2019t know. William Styron said,  Isn\u2019t all art a search for an answer to a question which can\u2019t even be spoken? I have little to no interest in writing about the things I know. Not only would that curb my pool of writing resources, it would also limit me to regurgitating my life. And that would get pretty boring pretty fast. If I wrote only about what I know, all my stories would end up being about twenty-somethings who work at their desks eight hours a day, five days a week, spend Saturday mornings in bed reading, and encounter adventure and excitement mostly through their own klutziness and occasional stupidity. Not exactly what you had in mind for your next beach read, is it? Me neither. Why You Shouldn\u2019t Write What You KnowI write about places I\u2019ve never been, cultures I\u2019ve never experienced, people I\u2019ll never meet. The last time I checked, gunslingers, crusading knights, and dragons weren\u2019t offering interview appointments. Neither can I afford to globetrot my way to Syria, Chicago, London, Nigeria, and points beyond. (We won\u2019t even mention the fact that one of those brilliant scientist people I mentioned in the first paragraph have yet to perfect a time machine that would send me back to the Middle Ages or the Roaring Twenties.) But I\u2019ll tell you a secret: I like it this way. Writing novels gives me the opportunity to experience what Idon\u2019t know. If I lived in Chicago, I doubt I would have had any interest in writing about it in my fantasy novel Dreamlander. But because I\u2019ve never been to Chicago\u2014every moment spent researching these things was an adventure. Why You Should Write What You KnowIf fiction is about answering questions, then I certainly have no need to rehash my own life on the page. I live that everyday; the answers are right in front of me. I\u2019d much rather experience the untouchable. Now, that said, let me do a major 180 and mention that I emphatically believe we should all write what we know. (Gotcha, didn\u2019t I?) Knowing your subject matter is vital. But who says you can\u2019t know it vicariously? That\u2019s where research comes into play. If I wrote about the 12th-century Kingdom of Jerusalem and referred to all the natives as Israelis, I would promptly pop any knowledgeable reader\u2019s bubble of disbelief and destroy my credibility as a writer. But, if I do my research, if I read the books, study the maps, and interview the experts, I\u2019ll be able to write both what I know\u2014and what I don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it's the fact a novelist can't write about what they don't know. It's how they use their imagination and logic sense in relation to the subject. You're going to want to be somewhat accurate, such as that Mars is red or that Giraffes don't eat people.  Unless your story takes place in an alternate universe where you can bend the laws of reality, it's a very thin line when jumping into subjects you're unfamiliar with. But if you're providing scientific facts that simply aren't true, stating you're an expert in that field, don't be surprised to find people calling you out on that. Unless there's a logical explanation for why you wrote something, incomplete ideas about a subject you're not well familiar with will do more harm to your novel than good. So whatever you're attempting to write about, ensure that you do some sort of study about it. Don't simply go off of random facts that you may have heard on television or stereotypes that aren't true.  Explore the background of your story and imagine a separate reality there. If your novel takes place in Egypt, jump into a few studies regarding the land and its culture. If you're writing about space, look up a few books about stars and the universe. People do love imagination, but only to an extent. They also need realism so they could still relate to the story and feel connected with it. ",

Write from your imagination and make a point of learning everything about whatever subject you imagine, but don't stick to what you know because the world is far too full of writers who don't know s**t but still try to write what they think they know. Become a student of the world and write what you learn and try to imagine things nobody  has imagined before. Every writing teacher I have ever had has said \"write what you know.\"  It's bull.  Telling a class full of high school or college students to write what they know is to give credibility to the emptiness of their experience.  They should be encouraged to imagine and learn and be curious, and their writing should come from their questions, not from their answers, because in the end they don't know anything, and neither do you, and neither do I.  Do not write what you know because you are wise enough to know that you know nothing.  Write from a place of wonder.  Do not be so presumptuous as to think that what you know matters. ",

If you\u2019re writing about a place you\u2019ve never been to, for example, you may include things that a person from there might take for granted. You may see things in a new light, and not be limited by the geography or the history of the place. I have one published novel and it\u2019s about something I don\u2019t know. In fact, it\u2019s about multiple things I don\u2019t know, but I wrote it from the pov of a character who is a bit of a fish out of water, which made it a little easier. I did a ton of research, however, so that my inexperience wouldn\u2019t be as obvious. ",

But that doesn't mean that someone who writes a murder mystery has to go out and kill someone. Likewise for fantasy and science fiction authors who have never been to Middle Earth or Mars.  If a writer wants to write about something they don't know, they usually research it to whatever extent is necessary. People who aren't historians write historical fiction and authors who aren't aerospace engineers write about space battles. Google and Evernote make a lot of things possible! On the other hand, there are authors who write about topics they know nothing about and they don't do any research. They guess or fill in the blanks with made-up solutions. This doesn't always mean the work will be bad, but in genres like historical fiction or alternate history, it's likely to make a lot of readers unhappy. J. PaulThird Phase Publishing ",

If you're writing about an emotion you've never felt, I'm skeptical that it will move the reader. I suspect this is is also true if you're writing about sex you've never had, especially when it's sex your readers have had. Write about feelings you know.I agree with others that fiction is about things we don't know: things that didn't happen; people who don't exist; worlds that never formed. We don't know them. You make them real for the reader, by writing about them.",

Writing a cozy mystery that takes place in a botanical garden? Talk to a horticulturalist.-------------------Edit:Look at JK Rowling. What did she write about? She wrote about a wizards' school, but it was modeled on typical British schools, so she knew something about it. She wrote about personality and ideological conflicts, which just about everyone knows about through experience with people. But mostly she wrote about an orphan, and his internal struggles -- and she did this because she felt like an orphan when her mother was dying of MS. She wrote what she knew, and any bits she didn't know, she could research. ",

The type of book, Novel, means \"new.\" Novels are characterized as covering topics that are not often explored in other genres, such as mystery and romance, or by approaching the genre in a novel way. Given this nature, it is only to be expected that many novels concern things that no one has ever experienced or done, including the author.  However, to answer your exact question, things get more complicated. Many times, when the author doesn't know what they are writing about, such as some who has never taken a science course writing Science Fiction, the quality of the work suffers. That's not to say an ignorant author will always be bad; they just have to use their imagination and reasoning to compensate. ",
