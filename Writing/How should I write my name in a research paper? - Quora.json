            "answer_text": "This is actually a rather important question since papers are usually indexed by author\u2019s name. I\u2019ve known a number of female scientists who have kept their maiden name after marrying, simply to avoid having one set of papers under her pre-marriage name and a second set under her married name. So, whatever name you use, try to stick with that throughout your academic career. As Deepak notes, you will typically use your first name, middle initial(s) if you have additional names, and surname. But then there are people who don\u2019t use their first names - if I publish a paper using my first name (which nobody uses) then people who have met me or who have heard me speak at conferences might not associate that paper with me. So for me, I\u2019ll use my first initial and middle name - thus, all of my publications are as \u201cP. Andrew Karam\u201d or as \u201cKaram, PA.\u201d And since my publishing history is a \u201cP. Andrew Karam\u201d I make sure that everything - conference papers, slides, etc - say \u201cP. Andrew Karam\u201d for the sake of consistency. That way any search will turn up everything I\u2019ve done, which might not happen if I sometimes shorten it to a simple \u201cAndrew Karam.\u201d Finally, use a formal version of your name and not a diminutive form. So even though my friends and family call me \u201cAndy\u201d my papers are all published as \u201cAndrew.\u201d Oh - and don\u2019t list your degree(s) or certification(s) unless the journal requires it or unless that\u2019s standard in your field. I know that you\u2019re proud of what you\u2019ve accomplished - I certainly am - but it can come across as pretentious or even insecure. When I\u2019m reading a paper, what I care about is the content of the paper and not the author\u2019s credentials - I\u2019ve read papers written by authors without much in the way of credentials that were far better than papers written by authors with a long string of initials after their names. Let your paper speak for itself! ",

I would usually use my official name here, so it will be easy for indexing or referencing in the CV. However I am unaware if you could use anything other than your official name. If you would like to know where to write your name, its usually next to the title and if you contributed the most, you become the \u201cfirst author\u201d which can also be shared with others with similar contribution. You could also be the \u201ccorresponding author\u201d if you have designed and conceived the work, however if you are in a lab the lab-head/Principal Investigator usually likes to be the \u201ccorresponding author\u201d.
