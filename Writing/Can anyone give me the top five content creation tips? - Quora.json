            "answer_text": "Hey there! I\u2019ll give you just three tips. They are super-practical and come from the experience of Coding Ninjas content strategist, @Ksenia. She created tons of high-quality content for us, and many of her advice does work. Content creation is pointless without strategy: you must always know who you are creating content for, and why. 1. Your content should reflect your leads\u2019 awareness levels Typically, your potential customers are located somewhere on this scale: Completely unaware \u2192 Problem-aware \u2192 Solution-aware \u2192 Product aware. \u201cCompletely unaware\u201d means they have no problems yet, or know nothing about them. \u201cProblem-aware\u201d means a lead has already faced some difficulties and is actively looking for a solution. \u201cSolution-aware\u201d implies they already know how they are going to deal with their hardships. The only thing they need is a proper tool for this. \u201cProduct-aware\u201d is the stage when a lead thinks, \u201cYep, this particular service/company/product is exactly what I need to solve my problem.\u201d Your goal is to create content that accompanies the lead in their customer journey, leads them through all the awareness levels, and incepts them with the idea that your product is what they need. 2. Maintain proper proportions between content types There is core content, and there is distributional content. The core content is unique, filled with the information valuable for your potential customers, and should be posted on your website (or any other media that you own). With its help, you persuade your TA to opt for your brand. Distributional content is how you gain referral and social traffic. Basically, it\u2019s the content you write to promote core content (and yeah, you write content to promote content). Facebook posts, tweets, Quora answers, guest blog articles \u2013 these are examples of distributional content. For each piece of core content that you create, you should also create at least 10 pieces of distributional content. 3. Design a content creation pipeline The process of creating content is extremely important. Creativity rarely has anything to do with inspiration: it is rather about hard work and organization. Hence, how you create your content is as crucial as what you produce. For starters, here is an example for you: our workflow at Coding Ninjas. Content strategist researches topics for core content and adds them to the backlog with a short descriptionOne of the content writers reviews the topic. If they have enough expertise to write the article on their own, they write a pitch. If they don\u2019t, they either ask one of the in-house experts for an interview or ask the strategist to write the pitch for them.Strategist approves (or writes) the pitch.The content writer creates the draft.Editor (or whoever plays this role in your company) reviews the draft, and highlights the parts that need to be rewritten and corrects the mistakes.The content writer makes all the necessary edits and publishes the piece.Social media manager writes the posts for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Quora, Reddit, and whatever other channels you prefer.Content writers rewrite content for guest posts and Medium publications.Check out our article, \u201cHow to Manage Content Production With Remote Teams\u201d to learn more.

            "answer_text": "Define Your Content Marketing Goal Before you look at what you're going to create, you need to answer why you're making it. All content marketing starts with a goal. Research and Understand Your Audience Once you have a clear connection to why you're making content, the next step in building out your content marketing is to understand exactly who is going to see, hear, or watch the content you create. Effective content is not produced in a vacuum from a list of topics you personally want to write or talk about, it's made out in the open with the involvement, feedback, and direction of your audience. The best content marketing strategy is designed to answer the most pressing questions your target audience has--to educate and transform them. Creating Your Audience Personas Now, let's talk about audience personas--the fictional, generalized representations of your ideal customers. These personas are constructed with the goal of internalizing who your ideal customer is, and gives you an idea of how to relate to these people as real humans. For each of the audience personas you're creating, write out their (demographic and psychographic) attributes on a bulleted list. Update Your Current Content (If You've Already Been Publishing) There's never a bad time to re-evaluate your content marketing and shift gears if something isn't working. If you've already been writing or producing other types of content for a little while, now is a great time to bring your published content into the style of your new content marketing approach. To do this, you need to know exactly what kind of content 'types' you're going to produce. Brainstorm Ideas and Do Keyword Research Alright, at this point we know our why we're creating content and who our audience is. I hope this answer has helped you. :) Connect with me on Linkedin (Aachri Tyagi) to ask more questions. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for A2A, A good website is known for its content, no matter how good your theme is if you have thin content on your website, you are never gonna rank in Google SERP. Content is a very general word because the content is of many types like video content, writing content, audio content, and I will provide you 5 tips which are going to help you irrespective of what type of content you are creating, so they are as follows:- Audience research:- One should be sorted with their target audience before creating any content and doing keyword research and should have an idea that they want to focus that audience in any particular country or targeting that audience worldwide. Let's understand this thing with an easy example:- Suppose you have a cooking blog, so if you are targeting only India\u2019s audience then you mostly focus on creating content that contains \u201cIndian Dish\u201d and If you are targeting the audience worldwide then you need to create content that focuses on dishes which is famous worldwide. Keyword Research:- Keyword Research simply means researching for the phrases or keyword your audience is using to find the solution to their query. Good keyword research is necessary for creating any type of content because there are thousands of people already creating content for the same keyword on which you are thinking of getting rank, so one needs to do an ample amount of research to target the correct audience. Strong Headline:- From the SEO point of view and from the audience's point of view, the eye-catching headline is the key if you want your website to be clicked from the bunch of websites, and it is researched thing that having a strong and creative headline reduces the bounce rate most of the time. A simple trick to create an effective headline, by using five W\u2019s (who, what, when, where and why), the trick behind it that user mostly searches their query using these W\u2019s so if he/she finds the headline matching with their query then it is a high chance that they click on your site. Create Authentic and Original Content:- One should research their topic from a trusted website before writing for their own website because lakhs of people are going to read your content so just imagine if you are providing vague and wrong information to your viewers, it would hamper your personal reputation. Original content is also an important thing if you want to gain the trust of the audience as well as Google. There is a separate penalty associated with copied content and Google crawlers will not crawl and index your website if you find copied content, so always use a Copyscape tool to check the plagiarism content. A good Promotion A Good Piece of content becomes more valuable if its promotions are done right. Promote your content on multiple channels use social media, use trending hashtags, and hashtags that complement your content. You can also contact people who are also creating the same content for your content promotions. You can also convert one type of content into another to increase your content reach. I Hope, this answer will help you in solving your doubt. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "I had to two people who are responsible to improve my writing efficiency. One of them was the manager of a corporate where I worked. His duty was to write letters to clients and reply to the letters from others. So when he dedicated his writing to me he noted that I was slow and not too expressive. he suggested that I should write at least one page a day so that my thinking can be in par along with my writing. It worked for me and today I can write three to four pages everyday. I have no less than 20,000 readers on Facebook and Quora. The other was my editor of a magazine where I work as a trainee. He used to tell that one should read 20 times more than he can write. Only then he can present his content in a very interesting manner. The best ways to write a new content everyday are- Write one page either describing a please or an event. Pick up a current issue and write one page whether you agree or disagree. Write a short story once a week. Keep compiling interesting advertisements that you and try to read draft it in your own way. Try to describe new imaginery products and Services for practice. Do it even if you don't have clients on your list. Just like sports people have to practice every day even when they do not have matches, creative content writer should also practice everyday. Do not keep on asking seniors to great your work but keep working till it is noticed. ",

            "answer_text": " How We Developed a Foolproof Process to Create Content | 60 Second Marketer @AskJamieTurner Having a solid content creation process benefits you in so many ways. It keeps your schedule streamlined, avoids missing deadlines, and help keep the quality of your contents as high as possible. Here is a good way to create your own simple content creation process: Record all of your processes. There are apps and tools that can help you such as Process Street, Wunderlist, Trello, and Airtable. But a pen and paper will do if you have no time for apps. Recording your processes means you have a document you can always pull out whenever a task of similar nature come up. Plus, processes keep the standard and integrity of your daily operation and keeps it from going down. Here is a sample of a content creation process: --Record your idea in a Trello card  Perform keyword research for the idea Fit it into the blog calendar Research the post Write the post Do an editing run Write email for blog subscribers Submit for approval If approved, schedule the post and email to go out Once you have your process, it is now time to optimize as much as you can in order to improve the efficiency of your existing process.You can add little details that will help you improve your efficiency. Such as adding a reminder or submitting your edited draft to an editor. Continue learning and stacking on ideas. It is not every day that you will have the energy to generate fresh ideas for your content creation, that is why it is always better to write them down as they come. The life of a content creator is a constant learning of new things. Get a book and read as much as possible, listen to podcasts when exercising or doing your chores, or just set up your RSS feed for your favorite authors and keep a lead on their new articles. http://60secondmarketer.com/blog/2017/03/17/how-we-developed-a-foolproof-process-to-create-content/ ",
