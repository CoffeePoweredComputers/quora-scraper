            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t lie to you, they do. But the thing is, you only make a couple of dollars. Like there is no scalable system there. If you\u2019re able to spend 8 hours a day doing those websites, then perhaps you could make $70\u2013$120 from experience, but it\u2019s really hard having to sit down doing something you don\u2019t want for money that\u2019s not even a lot. I\u2019ve read a book once by MJ DeMarco called \u201cThe Millionaire Fastlane\u201d, and it specifically highlights not selling your time for money. Because ultimately, you only have 24 hours a day, so even if you spend all those 24 hours a day you won\u2019t really get a stable amount of money. So my advice to you is make money by selling your time first, but then try to invest that money into an online business and for something more scalable. I can show you how to do that if you want to learn How I am Making $997 Commissions in 2018 So to summarize, those websites do work and I\u2019ve tried them, but it\u2019s not scalable. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there Wow! Free money? There are many ways to make money online which cost very little. Many websites would have you believe that you can press a button and your PC will start coughing up cash!! And then you have to pay them for this information!! Laughable!
