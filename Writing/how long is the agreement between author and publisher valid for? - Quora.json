            "answer_text": "The duration of the agreement with your publisher is mentioned in the publisher\u2019s contract itself. It varies depending on the terms you have agreed upon. Yes, you can change your publisher in most cases. Look for an exit clause in the contract. It will state what you have to do. I was unhappy with one of my publishers because they were horrible at distributing my book. Fortunately, there was an exit clause which said I\u2019d have to buy back the copies of my book they had in stock. I could easily do that (the publisher hadn\u2019t even printed many copies) and get out of the contract. ",
