            "answer_text": "Engagement is a big part of your committment that lies ahead, practice your partnership now before you plan a wedding. The wedding is the event, the details are about how well you work as a couple. Be yourself so you both understand who the other person is, not pretending to be what the other person tells you to be. Have an open mind, you will be courting eachother the rest of your lives to stand the test of time. Allow to agree to disagree yet remain compatible & tolerant - life will throw challenges at you. Respectfully -fair fight when those challenges occur. If your old enough to be engaged, act and react as an adult. Never be dishonest w/eachother. This is an engagement to marriage and if your not trust worthy together, do not move forward. Don't assume, and make false judgements about eachother as a couple. Set realistic goals as a couple. Ie: to save money before spending it. Most couples fight about money. Respect your privacy & Stand up for eachother to keep meddling family out of your business, by not gossiping about eachother to them. Be responsible to eachother- if you say your going to do something, set a timeline - empty promises destroy trust. Understand your partner is not perfect\u2026 you both come with good & bad habits\u2026but that is not a license to continue bad behavior. Note you will each have your own pet peeves. Make sure you keep a romantic love life\u2026date nights matter for the rest of your life. Kiss and make up - grudges do not help grow towards partnerships. Admit your wrongs and move on! Practice now, you will make mistakes. Forgive eachothers errors. Just don't keep repeating them. Talk about your individual goals: do you want children, how & where will you live, work etc. once you marry. Don't wait too long to discuss your ideas, and allow for ideas to change. Read together as a couple: \" 5 love languages\" is a good start, we are all a little different in how we express affection. Show affection, it's good for your health and connection. Be kind, wake up every day affirming you love in actions not just words. Help eachother - it's both your responsibility to grow as a couple, encourage and edify one another. Compromise, compromise, compromise! It will make for a happy spouse, happy house. Pick your battles wisely. All these things will teach your kids and others what love is really about. Set the example. Enjoy each other on your new journey. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly? Some money. Any amount is fine but cash is the greatest gift you can give someone to start their new journey. It contributes to so much of their needs and wants. I got engaged then got married in court. We weren't rich. We didn't have much in our bank accounts and we also didn't have anything other than clothes. We started by sleeping on the floor with some sheets and then a mattress and then a bed. We had a TV which we sold and bought a different one. We were able to build our home very fast because we received money from my family. They all contributed to our new home. It helped so much! Unlike us, some people decide to have a wedding which costs A LOT OF MONEY. Before I decided to not have a wedding, I started to look at wedding venues and caterers and I just couldn't afford any of it. I would have had to apply for a big loan. I would have needed help from a thousand different people to get it done and I just didn't feel good to waste money on decorations and celebration when I knew I would have nothing to go home to and a debt for my husband to pay off with his E3 paychecks from the military. We were blessed to get the support we did. We may eventually have an vow renewal but today, I think back to the amount of money I received and from who and I appreciate each and everyone of them to have been that considerate that they gave a 20 year old cash so she could at least buy a couch to sit on. To some people receiving cash is very impersonal, but for me it was the best thing people thought to do at that moment. Now I'm pregnant and I had a baby shower. Some people decided to purchase and some people decided to give money and indicated what they would like me to purchase with that money. I did as they said and used coupons and price matches to help me save some of it in order to purchase more. Cash is always a great option in gift giving, however, if the person you are gifting is RICH, I would shop for something they have interest in. Or if you give them money, I would tell them, this is to contribute towards your wedding Jewels or something. You could also get them gifts that say \u201cBride\u201d like a hanger that would help them look forward to their day. They have some of these in forever 21 (I've seen them online) and David's bridal. I wouldn't necessarily get a gift card because you never know where they want to purchase their gift from. ",
