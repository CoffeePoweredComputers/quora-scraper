            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been in the same situation and tried nearly everything to no avail. Once ink soaks into leather it is nearly impossible to get it out. The fact that you can\u2019t get the ink out tells me that the boots are probably real leather. Otherwise the surface would be less porous and you would be having more success. I can offer only two suggestions: Coconut oil can sometimes work. A lot depends on the exact type of ink.If all else fails (which so far it has) the last alternative is to paint over the ink. This is what I\u2019ve done when asked to removed unremovable ink from white leather. If you use water-based white oil paint (yes, you read that correctly\u2014see below) and blend it gently into the leather, you will eventually have masked the ink while not making an obvious mess.*Nice, relatively new technology: oil paint that mixes and cleans up with water, but dries as genuine oil paint with all the good qualities you want: flexible so it doesn\u2019t flake off the boot, not water soluble so you can wear the boot in the rain, and adds a protective layer to the leather \u201cto boot\u201d! Note: it can take several weeks for the oil paint to be completely dry, regardless of appearances.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d try the whiteboard technique: write over the permanent marker with whiteboard marker and rub it off. However, caution. With all you\u2019ve tried, especially alcohol and acetone, and still no progress, it may be that the ink has already seeped into the leather (or whatever it is), and doing the whiteboard technique will make it worse. I expected that acetone would have taken it off, or even damaged the leather (it takes permanent ink off cymbals and melts plastic). ",
