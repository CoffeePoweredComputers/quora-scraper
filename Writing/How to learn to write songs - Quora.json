            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. See Avinash\u2019s answer below - it\u2019s an excellent way to do your own songs. There are also alternatives. If you know someone who has a guitar at home, or you can get a cheap guitar somewhere, or there\u2019s a public common room somewhere, or a music room, or something similar (at a bar, a music shop, whatever) get one of those. Learn each note on each string and fret, get your hands used to it. Learn scales off the Internet. Learn chords off the Internet. When you\u2019ve gotten to a semi-subconscious level, play while you\u2019re doing your engineering study. You can point your parents to some psychology research, if you\u2019d like - outside cues help memorization by fixing them more securely into the brain. Practice specific musical scales, chord transitions, etc, for each module topic. Listen to music, listen to scales, listen to poetry and songs and writing. Hum. Get a message in your head that you want to say. Write it down. Repeat and refine. Sing when you\u2019re alone. Sing when you\u2019re in transit. Sing your own lyrics, over and over. Then put the two together. Never stop. Run into a block on one song? Write another. Sing about the most ridiculous things, even if they make you feel silly. Especially if they make you feel silly. Keep going. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an exersise you can do. Take a song by your favorite artist and use it as a template. Try and write your own lyrics to it. Once you complete the lyric, do it again. Starting out you are going to suck. Trust me. It also helps to play an instrument but not required. Of course all my answers are geared towards the lyric writer. I wrote lyrics for about three years before I decided I better learn an instrument. I taught myself guitar and piano. ",
