            "answer_text": "QUESTION: Do you need to have near perfect grammar to be a writer? Yes. A writer needs to know everything there is to know about the language being used. For the writing effort to be worthwhile, every writer must know, understand and address the following two components: Technical Proficiency \u2014 this aspect of writing refers to the correct use of grammar, sentence construction, punctuation, and phraseology.Content Quality \u2014 this component is about whether the content of the essay, story or novel has enough substance \u2014 mystery, conflict, understandable and relatable characters presented in the right or best sequence\u2014 or, in the case of nonfiction, clarity and accuracy (of the information).These two components work together to produce good and great writing. One cannot know one component, or work on one, without knowing and understanding the other. Clarity of content is dependent on technical proficiency. Quality content cannot be expressed using incorrect grammar, sentences, punctuation and/or phraseology, all of which are interconnected. Grammar is mostly about verb tenses and subject-verb agreement, so, if a writer is shifting verb tenses incorrectly and/or confusing singular and plural subjects and verbs, the piece is likely to be confusing and/or difficult to read, difficult to understand, and won\u2019t convey the message(s) as precisely as needed or desired. Thus, the suggestion that a writer forget about grammar is misleading. What that suggestion is intended to convey is that, because writing is often a difficult and time-consuming task requiring a writer\u2019s undivided attention, whenever thoughts and ideas are (finally) flowing easily from the brain, the first and best thing to do is to write a first draft of every word that flows in whatever form the brain releases it, knowing that, with each subsequent draft you edit, you will correct the typos and technical errors described above. But, a writer cannot do that editing unless he/she knows as much as possible about both components and continually takes the time to learn more. To see why the technical proficiency component of writing matters, peruse some books at amazon.com. Read a few pages from some self-published books and compare that writing to the writing of popular published writers. I don\u2019t know whether new writers believe the desire to write means they know how to write or the editor they use doesn\u2019t know English and isn\u2019t good at proofreading or they aren\u2019t using an editor at all, but I have yet to read a self-published book with writing that reads smoothly and is easy to understand. One cannot break the rules for effect unless one knows the rules. One cannot fix a broken widge-it unless one knows and understands its (original) perfect, usable construction. The only way to be a good or great writer is to write, write, write, but, if you don\u2019t also expend the time and effort to learn, learn, learn, you won\u2019t be happy with the results of your writing.

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026up to a point. Grammar is hugely important to writing, but a good writer knows when learning grammar is useful and when it\u2019s keeping them from sitting down to write. As another answer in this thread alluded to, grammar is like the bricks used to build a house. If each brick is placed correctly, you never see it\u2014you only see the beautiful house. If a few bricks are placed incorrectly or sloppily, your attention is drawn right to them as flaws in the otherwise beautiful house. If many bricks are placed badly, the house stops looking beautiful and starts looking half-assed. So the more grammar you know and the more clearly and correctly you can write, the more beautiful the house that is your writing will be. You\u2019ll also be better able to revise and self-edit your work, which will save you time and money on editing because editors work quicker and cheaper on clean manuscripts. That being said, if ALL you learn is grammar, that will not be enough to make you a good writer, only a good grammarian. Becoming a good writer involves learning the whole craft, not just one particular aspect. This is why writers spend so much time (1) reading other writers and (2) simply writing. Just as knowing how to lay bricks is only one piece of knowledge needed to build a house, knowing grammar is only one thing good writers need to know. If a contractor spent all their time learning to lay bricks, they wouldn\u2019t be a contractor, only a bricklayer. More importantly, if they spent all their time learning the right way to build houses but never actually built any, they wouldn\u2019t be anything at all, just a walking repository of unused knowledge. There is a point after which knowing everything about grammar (or tone, or flow, or clarity, or what have you) becomes prohibitive for a writer. This doesn\u2019t make grammar any less important to the book they\u2019re writing, but it does make it somewhat less important to the author, as time spent learning the most minuscule details of grammar would be better spent, you know, actually writing. Waiting to begin writing until you know everything there is to know about how to write is a terrible way to become a writer, because by not actually writing you\u2019ll guarantee that you\u2019ll never become a writer in the first place. Writers write. They don\u2019t just learn about writing. And if that means that their grammar isn\u2019t always perfect, so be it. This is where working with a good editor comes in. An editor\u2019s job is literally to know everything about writing that their author clients are too busy writing to learn. The author is an expert in their topic; the editor is an expert in how to write. So when you put the two together, you get something bigger and better than either could be alone. Good editing isn\u2019t a replacement for an author knowing the basics of grammar, but it does allow that author to not worry as much about how good their grammar may be. They know a trained professional will be there to catch any mistakes they make, and make their final text much better than their initial draft was. ",
