            "answer_text": "This is a great question. Like most people on this thread, I\u2019m not sure what kind of a book you\u2019re talking about \u2014 fiction? non-fiction? memoir? Truth be told, it doesn\u2019t matter much. Start where you are. The best place to find someone to help you write a book is to look around at the people you know. When you\u2019re starting, the best thing you can do is write something and have someone read it. This can be done online, of course, with a blog. However, your best help will come from someone you trust and who loves you. Write something and let them read what you wrote. Get their feedback. Figure out where you\u2019re week. Write something else. One last thought: Stephen King\u2019s wife reads everything he writes before it goes to beta readers. One final thing \u2014 the world needs your story, whatever it is, now. It\u2019s time to get going. Thank you for asking for me to answer your question. I hope it helps. ",

Also there are a number of excellent books out there on writing by people who\u2019ve been down the first book road. Here\u2019s a post that has a list of my favorite writing books by genre \u2014 Sandra O'Donnell, Ph.D.'s answer to What are the best books people can read if they want to improve their writing? I have a writing book as well that is targeted specifically at first time writers and those working on a story that doesn\u2019t seem to be coming together \u2014 Your First Fifteen Pages: An agent\u2019s guide to writing a novel editors will publish and readers will buy!
