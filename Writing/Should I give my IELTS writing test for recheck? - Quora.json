            "answer_text": "It is better not to go for a re-evaluation since most of my students who asked for re-evaluation were disappointed by the results. I would like to know if the test was Academic or General. If it is General, then may be you can give it a shot. There are a few points that I would like to clarify here: I think you know this by now: most of the essays in the internet or certain books are just plain cr*p and over-rated. They cannot be compared with real IELTS scores.Most people think that they can score 7 in Writing with an essay that has hardly any mistakes. But that is not the truth. Here is the assessment criteria of IELTS 7 writing: [1] It is clear that your essay must be clearly above average. Students often have limited vocabulary and their usages would be repetitive. Your essay may not have a problem per se, but it can still not reach the IELTS 7 standard. Often candidates ignore task 1 entirely. Even if your essay is good enough, if the task 1 (especially if it is the academic graph) is not approached properly, you can loose valuable marks.Getting good scores in Speaking, Listening and Reading is comparatively easier than getting the same in Writing. This is because the relationship between the amount of marks that you gain in these three skills is fairly dependent upon the amount of practice that you have done. The more practice that you do, the better it is. However, Writing Skill is not the same. The questions in writing are entirely subjective, which means that there is no correct answer. Solving previous year\u2019s questions, beyond, say, 30\u201350 essays would not increase your score. Instead, of that, focus on your vocabulary. See how native users of the language, use phrases, collocations and usages.Many people may, unknowingly, use template phrases and sentences. One out of three essays that I read start with the phrase \u2018In this modern era\u2019. Now, there is nothing wrong in it, but the language is so tepid.Writing is quite different from Speaking. Anyone can speak fluently even if they have a very limited vocabulary. Writing requires extensive vocabulary and the usage should also be accurate. So, a high score in Speaking cannot be used to gauge a person\u2019s actual language competency.A very important part of writing is the fact that you would require good topic based knowledge as well as topic vocabulary. You got to first read a lot on a topic before you write essays on it.Handwriting is usually not the issue unless it is utterly illegible.Finally, you are close to getting a good score in IELTS. If you are willing to put in consistent efforts to enrich your vocabulary then IELTS is not very difficult to achieve. Try it after 3 months. Do not go for \u2018tricks and tips\u2019. Please read my answer to a question on IELTS writing tricks, which gives a detailed method on how to prepare for IELTS writing.Moving to TOEFL would be a bad idea.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A I was in same dilemma one year back. I too got 6.5 in Writing section and was very shocked because I was expecting near 7. But, sometimes you don\u2019t get what you expect. Applying for a re-checking is all about taking a risk. If you have EXTRA money (which is kind of waste for you) to spend for this procedure, then GO for it. If your band score increases, even by a half point, you\u2019ll get your money back. If nothing happens, your money is lost. (Sounds like gambling :D) If you don\u2019t have money to spend for, then please DON\u2019T go for it. Since you have already got an overall score of 8, you are fulfilling the minimum requirement of an overall 6.0 and a 6.0 score in each module. And, after you get an admission in any university, nobody is going to ask you about your IELTS score, because they can tell about your proficiency in English language by your communication skills. After all, the main purpose of these English Language proficiency tests is to show the universities that you\u2019ll be able to communicate and study in an English speaking country. And, that\u2019s you have already proved by a 8.0 score. Regarding the whole procedure for re-checking, I don\u2019t know much. All I know is that your answers would be checked by some other examiner, or maybe by two different examiners and then they will decide if your score should be increased or not. But, the IELTS examiners are not just high-school pass outs. They are the experts in their fields, so the probability of giving a wrong score in the first place is very low. Also, I read somewhere on internet, that the answers of all the four modules are examined by 2 different examiners, and then you get an average score of that. Normally, the scores given by examiners are almost same, but if they differ, then your answers are re-checked again by the third examiner and the final decision is made. Hope this information helps.

            "answer_text": "Here, you will succinctly know about my Academic IELTS journey and rechecking of writing module (improved from 6.5 to 7, exam on 18 July 2019, New Zealand). I will also discuss some of the things to consider while remarking and some personal views regarding IELTS and its remarking process. I have decided to write this down because I struggled a lot to find valid information about remarking and there are some confusing information in different blogs. This is why people need to know what it is really, and what are the things to deem before making a remarking decision. I am more than delighted to share my rechecking story. I did IELTS academic total 4 times so far. I did two times for my educational purpose few years ago. Recently I needed a good academic IELTS score for my professional registration and the aim was overall band 7 with no section less than 7. Therefore, my third attempt (first IELTS attempt for professional registration purpose) was 4 months ago (May 2019) from Bangladesh (Home country) and I got overall 7.5 (L 8.5, R 8, S 8, W 6). Sad that when I sat for ILETS for first time in my life, I did not practice single piece of writing, did not know any tips, just read some samples and attended the exam and got 6.5 five years ago. Nevertheless, this time, I practiced all writings from Cambridge IELTS 1-13 book and read so many tips and still got only 6 this time. Anyway being honest, I did worst in exam so I knew I was not going to get 7, so did not even think about recheck because I knew that I deserved 6 only. Then I started to study more intensively with my writing practice, watched some free videos by Jay-E2 IELTS and Chris Pell-IELTS Advantage. I bought two online coaching modules by Udemy writing task 1 and 2 by Teacher called Matt, cost me only 18 dollars, it was quite cheap and the coaching slides/videos were truly helpful for me. I felt like watching videos online made me confused in many ways and it was overwhelming to see so many videos for so many tips from different people. This is why Udemy coaching was helpful to narrow everything down and keep it simple. Then I hired a professional IELTS tutor from New Zealand who is a native English speaker as well. She gave me tuition for 2 weeks and gave me feedbacks on my writings. She was the first person to figure out my major issues that confined me to get less than band 7 in writing. Therefore, I strongly suggest, a professional tutor is really helpful and paying money for this tutor is worthwhile. Anyway I did the exam again in July 2019 and I failed again as I got 6.5 in writing with overall band 7.5 again (L 8.5, R 8, S 7, W 6.5). However, I truly did better in writing than last time so I was depressed and little unconvinced. Perhaps, I did not improve much? Then I was thinking of remarking (EOR) of my writing module as I was quite confident that I might get 7. Having said that, some people say if you are confident then go for remark, but I mostly resent this statement because how can you really measure the level of confidence and what level of confidence is needed to go for remark, these are the questions that always pop up in your mind while thinking of confidence for remarking. I was 50 percent confident that I can succeed with remark. Funny thought, I was thinking what if I am stuck in 6.7 (670/900) or 6.8 (680/900) so the examiner gave me 6.5, so if it is a different examiner then he/she may give me a 7 as I am almost reaching to 7 (6.8). This is just a personally made up calculation, it does not work like that in IELTS by the way. Please do not apply this kind of calculation in your case, this was just a made up calculation that I did to push myself for remarking. Besides the level of confidence, the time factor is something that we need to consider, if someone needs an IELTS score very soon like within two/three weeks, then sitting another exam (online based, as the results get published in a week or so) is recommended as remarking may take about 4-6 weeks. Although I received my renewed result within 6 days after applying for remarking. However, no one can promise that this process will be done within or week or so. Since I had about 6 months\u2019 time so I thought why not a remark? Next thing is money, the exam fee was 385 NZD and remarking fee was 250 NZD either for one module or for all of them. 250 NZD seems too much but I think it is not. If someone can spend 385 NZD each time for several attempts then why not spend 250 to try your luck. I am not rich but the mental stress for sitting for whole exam cannot be measured by money, such stress I would say is equivalent of 1000 NZD to me so 250 was nothing in that case. I say, do not think of money, if you feel little brave enough that you can succeed, go for it. Sad to say, it is like a gamble too as you get refund if your score is improved. In addition, improvement of completely 1 band is rare by remarking, it can happen but very rare. But best chance is there if you need 0.5 improvement. In addition, never go for remarking of listening and reading, remarking is only a good idea if you are thinking of speaking and writing. This remarking is supposedly be performed by an external examiner (most probably from AUS or UK) who will not have any idea of your current score of any module/s. Therefore, it would be like a blind review and marking so that you can get an honest and bias-free remarking. While I was reading online, some blogs or articles about writing recheck had some information that was somewhat unclear. For example, \u201cyour score may decrease after remarking\u201d, I heard that this could be possible only in OET exam (alternative language test for healthcare professionals), but never saw that happening for IELTS, speaking from my experience. While reading these blogs, I also tried to go through the comments of users of different people and I have not seen any comment that said their score decreased after recheck. Everyone said, score either improved or remained unchanged, still I suggest, when contacting your test center, ask them directly, they must be able to tell you the right answer. Besides, there is no statistics of success rate of remarking in IELTS so it is hard to guess the possibility of success with numbers. Another thing is the information of a re-evaluation if your score in one section has 2 band difference with another. E.g. in my case, my writing was 6.5 and listening was 8.5 (2 band difference) and some blogs say that if this happens then the local test center will automatically perform a recheck of your module which you have the lowest band. But there is no solid reference that it is true. Even if it is, I want to challenge the skill of IELTS examiners, in a test center I arguably assume that all the writing examiners will be having same kind of training, mindset and skills while marking. Therefore, this re-evaluation by another examiner at the same test center seems stupid to me because I do not see any window for change in score. I dare to say this, because if they had done a re-evaluation of my score then how did I get a 7 by an external examiner. Although marking/grading is not an exact science and it is not an easy task, I also do mark and grade assignments for Bachelor students and I hate it when I am stuck sometimes to grade some papers. I also want to raise an argument that IELTS may have become a business these days. Some test centers might be using some tactical approach to limit band scoring so that people can be forced to sit for the exams repeatedly. So, I would say, do not be discouraged if you read the information that \u201cyou will get automatic re-evaluation if you have 2 band difference within your modules so a remarking will not help much\u201d. Either it might not be true at all or you can still get 0.5 increase by an external examiner. Anonymous user, 28 July 2019, New Zealand ",

If your overall IELTS band is above 6 and you have scored the barest minimum of 6.5 bands in writing test, you don\u2019t really need to apply for re-evaluation. If you think you could have scored better, it is better to retake the test and than apply for re-evaluation. Two expert IELTS examiners go through all your answers and based on the set parameters/band descriptors, you are allotted the marks. It is a rare occurrence that the marking done in the IELTS exam is partial or incorrect. When you apply for re-checking of the test, it is officially called an Enquiry on Results. The fee for the Enquiry on Results service is INR 6,500 (for test dates upto 31 July 2019) and INR 8,000 (for test dates from 1 August 2019), which will be refunded if your scores change as a result of the re-marking. The EOR service normally takes about 21 days from the time complete documents are received by the assessment team. The timelines of EOR service depends on a number of factors including number of sections required to be remarked. It normally takes about 4-6 weeks for end to end processing of your Enquiry on results request. Your test is sent to a third IELTS examiner who does not know about your current scores, will evaluate your answers and reallot you the marks. Once the checking is done, if there is any change in the marks, you will be issued a new scorecard which will be mailed to you. You can apply for re-evaluation within 6 weeks after getting your original test score. You can get the entire exam re-evaluated or just one section, it depends on you. The cost will stay the same. If your score remains the same, your re-checking fee will not be refunded but if there is a change in the score, the money will be refunded. It\u2019s a rare chance that your score will improve after rechecking. Since IELTS is an accredited test, which is conducted by Cambridge University along with assisting entities the British Council and IDP. The examiners appointed for the marking of the test are certified IELTS examiners and they mark the test on the basis of predefined criteria. The marking system is absolutely foolproof, accurate and there is no chance of any discrepancy/disparity. The rules of marking are well laid and straightforward, it is totally fair without any bias/checking error. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience with re evaluation with writing test went successful. I took my CD test on Aug 24 with IDP, and got my results in 5 days with the following scores : LRSW. 8.5, 7, 7.5, 6.5 Honestly, my writing have always been my stronghold and I've given ielts before so many times in the states and my average score for writing always stood between 7 -7.5. Well, this time since I took the test in India, I've read so many reviews online stating that Ielts is not providing legit scores in writing section even for great efforts in essays and task 1( Make note in general training module.) Well I guess I also fell in the same trap, however my strong belief over my writing ability urged my insights to initiate an enquiry on my results and so I did. I filed for EOR same day when I saw my results online and got my status changed from awaiting to successful in merely 6 days. Lastly, when I woke up the following day I received my updated TRF and a letter from IDP Australia stating that my band score increased to 7 and I'm eligible for a full refund. To sum up my thoughts, I'd say I was frustrated with writing score on the firsthand while my results came out. However, with succesful remarking and great speedy processing in my case with EOR, I'm quite pleased and satisfied with my updated scores. I hope sharing my experience will be helpful to someone at some point \u263a\ufe0f. At last, I'd say please follow your gut sayin and I really feel for the ones whose great efforts had been undermined for any reason there shall exist. ",

            "answer_text": "I had to give IELTS for immigrating to Canada. My scores were L 9, R 8.5, S 8 and W 7. Avg score was 8.125 rounded down to 8. I wanted to get 7.5 in Writing as that would give me the top band in the immigration process. So i paid the recheck fees of 6500/- and applied. It took about a month for them to re-evaluate but they ended up increasing my Writing score from 7 to 7.5, which was perfect. Not only this but because of that 0.5 increase my avg score increased from a 8.125 (rounded down to 8) to a 8.25 (rounded up to 8.5). So as my overall score changed from 8 to 8.5 i was eligible for a full refund, which i got after an other month. So it worked out for me. Basically Writing is the only section which u could think about for a recheck, the rest of the sections don\u2019t bother. Also refund is applicable only if ur overalls score changes, not just for section. ",

I applied for EOR on my result for the writing part . I had send them a draft of 6500 along with that as a fee for revaluation. Fingers crossed, was waiting for the result. After five weeks I received a post with my updated gradesheet. They had improved my writing band score from 6.5 to 7. I was very happy and relieved. In my opinion, if you strongly feel that the score is less than expected, then can go for revaluation. They do re-check again. Also, if the score improves they refund the revaluation fee! PS: They don't give any tracking number or ID from where you can check the status of revaluation online. In my case, they only text messaged about receiving my EOR request and that it would take upto 4 weeks. So if you don't receive any communication from them within 4 weeks, you can call their customer care and take an update. ",
