            "answer_text": "It is not really possible to say without more information. But I can give you a few possibiilities. In normal psychology children are very close to their parents and believe everything they say. In order to prevent a succession of virtual clones, nature has provided teenagers with an automatic rebellion phase. In this case a person is making their own first steps, a gamble, from the safe ways of parents. This feels very freeing. Now if you want to talk about abnormal psychology, I have read a lot as both my parents were abusive alcoholics. This builds up a lot of resentment an anger. It was helpful when I got clean and sober in 77 that my father HATED IT. Everytime I woke up another day clean and sober I thought, stick it to you dad!1! I did however miss the few rules I used to routinely break as an alcoholic and addict. Like the buying and selling of small amounts of drugs. It was difficult the first few years. I would wake up and go, who am i? As a matter of principle I always \u2018california stop\u2019 at stop signs, unless a cop is right there. I really think the enjoyment of breaking rules can get toxic. I have noticed that others like me, who had even bigger problems, could not emotionally handle the loss of the rule breaking fun. These are some general points but most people will lay somewhat between the cases. The important question for you is does the rule breaking results cause you harm or not? There is a book on how it can work against people. The book easily found in amazon is \u2018self sabotage\u2019. It can help you see what behaviors you wish to keep and which ones are costing too much. ",

            "answer_text": "It is only in rare cases that people disobey a rule out of honest civil disobedience where the rule violates conscience. The rules that people choose not to follow are reasonable and fair rules and there are four reasons people disobey them. 1). The rules are inconvenient. 2). People who know better break them because they lack self-discipline. 3). They are secure in the belief that they will circumvent suffering any consequences because either they perceive that no one who can enforce the rules is watching or the consequences are not immediate enough to provide incentive to follow a rule they dislike. 4). Because they are primarily controlled by their external environment there is no internal decision to obey a rule they know they should obey when in the external environment everybody else is breaking a rule; they succumb to Dr. Zimbardo\u2019s Lucifer Effect. 5). They have an exaggerated level of confidence that their competence, which they can\u2019t objectively measure, is so superior to that of everybody else that they don\u2019t need a rule that the less competent need. They justify breaking rules by taking recourse to emotional feelings rather than rigorous reasoning. Examples of these emotional feelings that rationalize the choice to disregard a legitimate rule include but are not limited to: \u201cThis rule is unfair because I subjectively feel that it imposes a hardship that I don\u2019t like to accept even though years ago I committed myself to obeying a set of rules that include the rule I don\u2019t feel like obeying,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been bending this rule for years and getting away with it so what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d The few times they get caught, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair and unreasonable that I got a traffic ticket for going 10 miles per hour over the speed limit; the police are picking on me because they have nothing better to do.\u201d or \u201cI almost always get away with it,\u201d and in the case of the Lucifer Effect, \u201cThe speed limits are unfair because nobody obeys them,\u201d and \u201cI can pilot that aircraft after a few more drinks than is legal because I can better handle the effects of alcohol and I know my limits.\u201d It is possible that because rule breaking is a combination of external influence and a weakness of internal reasoning that many autistic people who cannot connect to the excessively emotional and less logical social environment around them are less susceptible to influences to break unpopular rules. They have to live by internal self-discipline that the world around them does not offer. ",
