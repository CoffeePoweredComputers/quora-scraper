            "answer_text": "Brent, your question is incorrectly stated. It should read \u2018why are SOME old people so impatient? The way your question reads means that all old people are impatient and that is patently false. But, let\u2019s deal with the \u2018impatience\u2019 bit of your question. You could consider me an old person , but to me my 75 years is just a number. When I went back to university at age 47, a fellow student referred to me as old, until I put my age into context. That same student is now 47 years old, and he would be horrified if I described him as old. But, let\u2019s get back to the question of impatience. Some older people, obviously, are way more experienced than you, have an enormous store of lived experiences, lots of ideas of how to do things, solve problems etc. So, when they see younger people struggling, or messing around trying to find a solution to which they as older folk have had solutions to decades ago, they get impatient because they could so easily solve what to them is a simple thing. And you can use that example in many situations. I\u2019ve learnt to but out of offering help after someone once said to me \u2018who the hell do you think you are to think you can do this better than I can?\u2019 which I could, I walked away and decided to let younger people just make their mistakes and screw up, because it\u2019s the only way they get to learn. But that same guy came back and apologized, because he just never figured it out and lost time and money. That\u2019s another thing. When you get older, and you have the experience and know-how, it is a real waste of time and money not to get something done is less than half the time. Unfortunately, younger people look at older folk and think we\u2019re all senile, we don\u2019t have a handle on life as it now is, and should be sitting in the sun waiting to die. I recently made a suggestion to someone in a Ministry in our government. We have lots of young people coming out of trade schools after doing their apprenticeships, and they have the citations to prove that they did the theoretical stuff. But they have no experience. So, things blow up, catch fire, break down, because they do not have the physical skills. I suggested that we take on artisans, who have retired, on a half-day basis, to teach these young people what they should know. It also assists with the question of static pensions when times are tough. They thought it was a great idea, but would not implement it because it was not \u2018politically correct\u2019 to be coming from the private sector, so nothing happened. A few months later, the French government suggested exactly the same idea. I have no idea whether implementation has been commenced yet. Do I begin to make sense to you. We\u2019re not all impatient, and a whole bunch of us are very clued up. ",

            "answer_text": "not all old people are impatient. When a person gets older the body and mind start to fall apart, it\u2019s a natural phenomenon and comes as a shock. One day you\u2019re fine and the next day you find you have essential tremors, something you never heard about. So tremors make everything you hold onto rattle and you drop food on the carpet and have to clean it up. You\u2019ve spent your life being neat and clean and can no longer be so particular, it\u2019s frustrating so you get angry. Or maybe you just can\u2019t find your keys and want to leave to get groceries. So you worked a lot and did a lot of standing during your younger years and all of a sudden one day you wake up and can\u2019t walk right, can\u2019t stand for long, maybe can\u2019t use your leg or can\u2019t stand on it, and you find out your knee or hip needs a replacement, with lengthy recovery, that will put you in debt, that will change your life, that you\u2019d have to take expensive medication for. It\u2019s frustrating, you can\u2019t go anywhere like you used to, can\u2019t reach to change a lightbulb, can\u2019t take out the garbage, and you need help. Just needing help and making things wait till someone can get to doing them, when you have no one around, makes you frustrated, maybe angry when you expect that overhead light to work and it doesn\u2019t. And the list goes on. It could be heart, diabetes, cataracts, a fall, could be your teeth break off, your leg breaks and can\u2019t be fixed, could be just getting older. For some it starts at 50, others at 70, ya never know when it will hit, but it hits everyone. ",
