            "answer_text": "Here were my recent issues when writing my last novel: My time. When could I write without distraction? I picked early mornings before my family woke up and nights when they were out at dance practice.My fictional timeline. My book mostly takes place between Thanksgiving and New Year\u2019s. But what year? I picked 2015. I found I was constantly checking a calendar to ensure, say, Christmas was a Friday, and so on.Fact checking. I also was constantly researching for my book. For example, the name of the paint with the metal specks used on Dune Buggies. It seemed every third paragraph needed a Google search like that.Searching. I also frequently had to search my own novel. If I bring back a character from chapter 4 to chapter 21, how old was he, how tall, etc.?In the end, I used a private Word Press site to write the novel. I would open three tabs in my browser. One for writing, one for searching Google and one for searching my novel. ",

            "answer_text": "In my days of journalism during the mid 80s, there was a trend of publishing chapter by chapter of novels in series. Good writers were hired and paid high. Once a new writer got a chance and his story had a blind character, after few chapters the character was shown as watching a Movie. This was because the author forgot that he had kept him blind in his novel. So take care of each of your character\u2019s life style. Build climax in each chapter and let each chapter end with a curiosity to read the next one. Don\u2019t write vulgar scenes because it may corrupt young kids who are into reading novels. Don\u2019t add too much of violence. Keep you dialogues emotional and let a message of humanity and good conduct come out of each of the character. Remember that human values are more cherished than thrills for real readers. I hope this suffices you. ",
