            "answer_text": "The short answer \u2014 it costs no upfront money at all to self-publish a book through Amazon, either as an ebook (through their ADP service) or paperback (through their CreateSpace service). If you already know how to handle every other aspect of preparing a book yourself, you can do it for free and have a finished book that looks like every other trade paperback at the bookstore. When it comes to any of the steps you might not be able to handle yourself, here are typical numbers I\u2019ve dealt with as the owner of a small press\u2026 A good, thorough proofreading of the entire manuscript by a veteran professional copyeditor will cost you a minimum of a couple hundred dollars. (A full-on editor, someone who will work closely with you to get your plot, characters, themes and style into better shape, is a whole different story, at least several thousand dollars for someone who\u2019s skilled enough that they could be working for a publisher instead; as a self-publisher you\u2019re better off with a collective editor in the form of a writing workshop, favors from professors and other writer friends, etc.) To lay the paperback out in Adobe InDesign, then to output a PDF with the correct technical specs to work with Amazon\u2019s printing plant, will run you at least a thousand dollars from a reputable source. You can certainly find people who are cheaper than that, but you\u2019re running the risk of a non-working final file or at least an amateurishly designed book, one of the first and biggest things that sinks a self-published title. This is the one part of the self-publishing process most important not to skimp on. If you\u2019d like an International Standard Book Number (ISBN), so that your book can be sold at brick-and-mortar stores, that will run $125. Ironically, it\u2019s only $600 to buy a hundred numbers at once; so if you\u2019re thinking of doing at least a handful over the course of your life, you\u2019re better off buying them in bulk. (To sell your book to libraries you\u2019ll need a Library of Congress Number [LCN]; but this is free.) Amazon doesn\u2019t require an ISBN if you\u2019re planning on selling your book exclusively through them and no one else. Technically your book has a copyright the moment you put it together and start offering it to the public; but if you want a more ironclad protection that holds up in court better, and that allows you to sue an offender not just for lost revenue but also punitive damages, you\u2019ll need to register your book with the US Copyright Office. That\u2019s $35. The rates for a cover artist can be all over the place, and include many free options (such as public-domain images, Creative Commons images, a favor from a friend, etc); although be warned, the cover art is another detail that commonly sinks self-published books, sometimes notoriously (Lousy Book Covers). For an original image from a full-time illustrator who has a portfolio of professional pieces, in the US it\u2019s reasonable to expect a range from $500 to $1,500. A college student will often charge you much less in exchange for getting real actual paid commissions to add to their portfolio. And of course you\u2019ll need to pay for any copies you\u2019d like to own and sell yourself. At Amazon as of winter 2018, that\u2019s typically $3 to 5 per copy for small runs, depending on the exact page count, plus shipping. The cost per book goes lower if you buy a bunch of them at once. Before the invention of digital printing, the only way to do this was to negotiate a traditional \u201cpress run\u201d with an offset printing plant; since the process involved making traditional plates of each page and loading them into a giant machine, you would have to buy several thousand copies in advance to make the job worth it, then find yourself a warehouse space to store them, a distributor to get them to stores, etc. Take it from me, though, that advances in digital printing have made a contemporary paperback look identical to a traditionally printed one; so save yourself a lot of headaches and order no more than a couple hundred copies of your book at a time maximum, so that you can store them in a spare space in your house and not have to deal with inventory, warehouse space, loss prevention, etc. Obviously, the more of these things you can become an expert at yourself, the less the book will cost you; that\u2019s one of the reasons I decided to open an indie press in the first place, because I can do all these steps by myself when I need to, allowing me to publish books for no upfront money at all. But if you know nothing about the process other than how to actually write the book, it\u2019s reasonable to expect something in the neighborhood of $1,000 to 2,000 in order to publish something slick and professional that can be placed on a shelf next to a book by Random House without anyone being able to tell the difference. If you find your budget exceeding this, take a moment to look at your numbers, because there are absolutely places where you could be cutting costs without cutting quality. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s take a look at What a Publisher Does. I wrote an article here about creating a title P&L, which you can download and edit to fit your individual books. To properly publish each book, I would suggest having about $5,000 to cover marketing/design/editorial and paper/printing/binding. From there, you\u2019d want to calculate how many books you\u2019d want to publish per year and how soon you\u2019d begin to recoup on the books. I launched Microcosm on about $20,000 that I saved $100 per week from my job. That was more than adequate to get things moving. And you might save some money if you aren\u2019t paying yourself right away but can perform the editorial, design, and/or marketing work on your own. You\u2019ll need to work extensively on Title Development before publishing anything, in any event.  Next, you\u2019d need to consider the Distribution Question (with infographic): how you will get your books to your readers. While I believe strongly in The Economic Case for Traditional Format Offset Printing, you may not and the higher unit costs of digital printing might be worthwhile to save on having to pay out huge sums of cash for every book you do. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t believe that the book will sell a few thousand copies, why invest all of the time and energy into making it? You may have a valid answer to that question but you should at least consider it. I\u2019ve got a guides to Formatting for Print and Working with The Printer. It\u2019s vital to understand the schedules and economics of publishing. Most every small press that I meet thinks of distribution as the holy grail and they rush to secure that deal before actually finding or creating an audience for their work. Don\u2019t make that mistake. And don\u2019t believe Amazon\u2019s marketing line that their royalties pay more.  Depending on your model, $15,000 might be enough to get off the ground but more than money, you\u2019ll need a plan of how to serve a niche that isn\u2019t completely overrun. This article speaks to niche-seeking really well if you ignore the Kindle specific stuff. In any event, publishing is super fun and addiction and 20 years later there\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather be doing. ",
