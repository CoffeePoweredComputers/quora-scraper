            "answer_text": "\"At the end of a book, what are \"Acknowledgements\"?\"  It seems to me Acknowledgements are usually at the front of the book, but that's a detail. The point is to do exactly what the section title says: to acknowledge the contributions of people who helped you in some way.  I doubt most of the people who help would really care all that much about being mentioned in the acknowledgements, but it's a nice gesture. In my opinion, one of the most valuable things about acknowledging people who've helped is that it lets readers know the book wasn't just crafted in isolation.  ",

In Western books, acknowledgments are in the front (the \"prelims\"). Normally, there are no 'sections' to separate different kinds of contributors -- although there's no rule against having sections. Thanks for the A2A. ",
