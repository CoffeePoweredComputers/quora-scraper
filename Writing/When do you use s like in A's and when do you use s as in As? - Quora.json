            "answer_text": "The most usual style is A's, B's, C's, a's, b's, c's, etc. with an apostrophe. This is mainly because the vowel letters could end up being misinterpreted as words (As, Es, Is, Os, Us). There's no actual 'rule' for this matter, but the convention is to use the apostrophe. Some printed matter (e.g. advertisements) may delete the apostrophe for special effect. That is for literary purposes. In technical uses (e.g. programming), there may be rules that disallow use of the apostrophe but that is a technical matter, not a language one. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have the letter A in multiples, you use the apostrophe. This is to distinguish between a set of letters and the word \"as\". You can also use the apostrophe to indicate possession, such as \"the Oakland A's pitching coach is excellent\".  The letter A can represent many things- consult any dictionary. The word As can be an adverb, conjunction, preposition, and used in many general ways.  This is yet another reason English is a difficult language.  Not sure how this question involves computer science. ",
