            "answer_text": "Hi there.. According to Subject Verb Concord rules of English Language, we use a Plural Verb in case of addition, and in case of multiplication, a Singular Verb is to be used. Eg: 4 times 2 makes 8.(multiplication) 4 and 4 make 8.(addition) Therefore, two and two make four. (Addition) 2 multiplied by 2 also gives 4, and herein lies the trick of the question. It is safer to use make because the addition is more popular of an example. Good luck:-) ",
