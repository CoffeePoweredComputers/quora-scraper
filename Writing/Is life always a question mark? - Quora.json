            "answer_text": "In my opinion, Yes. The very premise of life is a journal of empty pages, we alone must fill. The questions present themselves as mysteries, clues to the next step. This is when we begin to fill the pages of our journals. Questions, will not always have an answer for us, even when we solve all the clues. This is where our character begins to form how we are going to handle life situations. Will we be strong? Will we be weak? Will we become someone who makes life tougher than it need be? So, life invokes questions we must always try and answer to the best of our abilities. Questions, lead us to knowledge, which gives us power, to find truth. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It doesn\u2019t matter how well you plan your life, things come up that force you to make changes. That\u2019s the joy in life. Not knowing what will happen in the future. Being kept on your toes is healthy and required to live comfortably. In spite of your efforts to plan your life down to the last details, the question mark is going to come up and throw your life into another path. This is wonderful. Knowing how your life is going to turnout would be boring. Enjoy that question mark. ",
