            "answer_text": "For the most part, if a YouTuber is reviewing something, they would have probably gotten it for free. Most likely the company of the product sent the YouTuber an email and gave them the product for free. The reason why they get it for free is because sending the YouTuber the item and having them review it, will drive the YouTubers fans to the product and give the company more money. \u2014 Usually a YouTuber will state if they have gotten the product for free as a sponsorship, or if they are really buying it for themselves.
