            "answer_text": "Generally, a report contains 3 paragraphs. 1st para should give introduction and answer 'what' part of the question-ie, describe what the report is about/ where an event takes place.2nd para should answer 'why' and 'how' part of the question,including the causes and effects- only facts3rd paragraph should conclude giving a condensed effective summary of the entire report- can include your opinions My teacher always explained that the 10 marks is divided as:Format-2,Content-5/4,Expression-3/4 Title Section - If the report is short, the front cover can include any information that you feel is necessary including the author(s) and the date prepared. In a longer report, you may want to include a table of contents and a definitions of terms.Introduction - The first part of the report needs to have an introduction.  You will explain the problem and show the reader why the report is being made. You need to give a definition of terms if you did not include these in the title section, and explain how the details of the report are arranged.(for elaborate reports) Body - This is the main section of the report. The previous sections needed to be written in plain English, but this section can include jargon from your industry. There needs to be several sections, with each having a subtitle.  Information is usually arranged in order of importance with the most important information coming first. If you wish, a \u201cDiscussion\u201d section can be included at the end of the Body to go over your findings and their significance. Summary - There needs to be a summary of the major points, conclusions, and  recommendations. It needs to be short as it is a general overview of the  report. Some people will read the summary and only skim the report, so  make sure you include all the relevant information. It would be best to  write this last so you will include everything, even the points that  might be added at the last minute.Conclusion - This is where everything comes together. Keep this section free of jargon as most people will read the Summary and Conclusion.

            "answer_text": "ALL REPORTS are based on answering six questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why and How. Whether the report is a legal deposition, or an article for a newspaper, radio or television news spot, of it you are just writing a fictional story, those are the human interest specific points that are necessary to be covered. Every report, just like any other story has an introduction, a beginning, middle and end, and sometimes an epilogue, or conclusion. If your report is something in explaining an event using facts, then you will need to reference those facts, at the end of the report. This will help any magazine or newspaper fact checkers to look into the veracity of your story, especially if the report is something timely and has known people that you are quoting. Fact checkers may be directed to contact the quoted for verification of what they said. Any acknowledgment or rebuke will still move the story forward. If you need to see examples of reports then just take any magazine and open it to an investigative article and read how the article is laid out and what is covered within it. ",
