            "answer_text": "Since, I have written a fiction novel, not a non-fiction one, so my answer might be biased. For me, Yes writing a fiction is little more difficult than writing a non-fiction if you are not a lit major, as in fiction, you have to create things. Things like, story, plot, character. dialogue, in fact almost everything. Although it is true that any writer take its inspiration from non fiction work, but still there is a lot of creativity required. Since it is all a creation of mind, marketability of the story comes in the picture. And one prefer to write on a subject which will sell like a hot cake. That\u2019s why even a 15 year old can write a fiction novel and novel like 50 Shades Trilogy are bestseller. But, that doesn\u2019t mean writing a non-fiction book is a cake walk. It is more challenging to write a non-fiction novel, if one doesn\u2019t have a substantial expertise on a subject. When one write a non-fiction, two things are must, unique observation and accuracy of the fact. In fiction novel, one can play around with facts, but in non-fiction, one can\u2019t dare to do that, else the author will substantially lose his credibility. Also unique observation is required to provide a different perspective and it adds to sell-ability. Writing a non-fiction require exceptional amount of research, expertise on a subject, and ability to narrate a different perspective. They are meant for a mature audience. That\u2019s why mostly its authors are very senior people working in to executive positions. And these books don\u2019t sell much, but are often expensive, and spark controversy. Like The Accidental Prime Minister (2019 movie) (Which questioned the credibility of our Ex-Prime Minister) or \u201cGujrat Files\u201d (Which alleges the role of our current PM in Gujrat Riot). As for me, since my novel is always inspired by real life event and have to be vivid in resembling our society, so i only read non-fiction. Yes, I write fiction. but to be able to write fictional tale, I have to research through the non-fiction work. Thanks Abhijeet ",

            "answer_text": "They\u2019re both challenging, but in different ways. When you\u2019re writing fiction, you become very attached to your creation, naturally, but you also have to complete it and present it (usually) before you get any serious feedback, criticism. As a result, rejection and requests for changes will seem more jarring. In non-fiction writing (which I\u2019ve done a lot of) other people are involved in a feedback, critique process from the proposal stage to the editing of the final draft, and then they\u2019re involved in the proofreading. Writing non-fiction, however, is not as nuts-and-bolts as some people say it is: if you want it to be engaging, you need to work on style, editing, etc., just like you would in fiction-writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Difference between Fiction and Non fiction: What is the difference between \"fiction\" and \"nonfiction\"? \u201cFiction\u201d refers to literature created from the imagination. Mysteries, science fiction, romance, fantasy, chick lit, crime thrillers are all fiction genres. Examples of classic fiction include To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee, A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens, 1984 by George Orwell and Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. Our Fiction Department also has a large selection of popular movies and television shows on DVD. \u201cNonfiction\u201d refers to literature based in fact. It is the broadest category of literature. The Nonfiction Department has books and videos in many categories including biography, business, cooking, health and fitness, pets, crafts, home decorating, languages, travel, home improvement, religion, art and music, history, self-help, true crime, science and humor. We also have a section of popular and award-winning documentary DVDs. IMO writing fiction is more tough than writing NonFiction. One needs more Imagination and Creativity to write Fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m leaning to\u2026 yes, but then I don\u2019t write a lot of non-fiction. I\u2019m just going off my own experience of what it takes to write (especially longer) stories. But. If I take a step back and think about it, I don\u2019t think it really possible to compare the two. Yes, creating fiction and non-fiction both involve the skill of writing, but other than that, they take completely different skill-sets, which to me means that this question is akin to something like: \u201cIs it tougher to write a novel than to climb Mt Everest?\u201d (To which my knee-jerk answer, not having climbed Mt Everest, would still be yes, definitely.)

            "answer_text": "Yes definitely. \u2026With non fiction it would be either facts or giving your opinion on something. \u2026Opinions can differ and sometimes we do not see something the same way as everybody else does-you might be against the popular opinion. And for non-fiction being different is a huge plus.By being different I mean that the more stir it creates the better reason to buy it\u2026But fiction -the people, the events, the timeline are all yours to play with -It all lies on how effectively you portray your characters and how well you have narrated a story-It maybe first person/third person,diary entries \u2026\u2026..Whatever it is end of the day its your storyline and style of writing that decides a book's fate. Non fiction in that perspective has the story -you would just want to set the narrative tone :) ",

Whereas a non fiction is something that has happened and we have seen it, heard it or felt it. We try to recreate our experiences on a paper. Now it depends upon you as a writer. Who you are? Whether you write from your imagination or your heart. Whatever you love makes it easy for you to write whether it's a fiction or a non- fiction. ",
