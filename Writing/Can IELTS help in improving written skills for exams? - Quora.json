            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Certainly! It would improve your written skills for any exam that requires writing skills. When you prepare for the writing module of IELTS, you learn to put your ideas in proper paragraphs. You learn to convey your thoughts in crisp and clear manner (because you have the word and time limit), you learn to use proper punctuation as they are very important and if not used correctly, can change the meaning of the sentence altogether. You subconsciously start focusing on your grammar as well. It will definitely improve your written skills. You will know how to avoid giving information that is not required and if you want to use these skills in your academics, it will help you manage your time very well. You will learn to structure your thoughts and put them to words really well if you are practicing and analyzing your write ups well. This practice will definitely help you in future as well, when you are on a job and have to mail people from global community on daily basis and respond to their emails with proper information. ",

            "answer_text": "To some extend, yes. IELTS sections do aim at testing the listening, reading ,writing and speaking skills and the practice papers to prepare for these do help. But if you are going for coaching classes where they teach you the tips and tricks to face the IELTS exAm , it is not going to help you. These classes are meant to help you specifically crack the exAm and not to improve your basic english skills. For instance, to tackle the writing section a stand template is provided in these classes to answer letter based or essay based questions. At the end of the day, IELTS coaching classes would not replace your traditional english class. ",
