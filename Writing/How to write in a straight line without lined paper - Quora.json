            "answer_text": "There are several methods for writing in a straight line without having pre-lined paper: Use a ruler, straight edge, or even better, a T-square to line the paper yourself. Use a pencil to create faint lines that can easily be rubbed out after you are done with your project.Use a light table, light box or light pad. If you have an actual light table, that is fine. If not, you can raise a piece of glass on supports and place a light source underneath. On the light table place a sheet of lined paper and put the paper you wish to work with on top of it. You will be able to see the lines through your project paper. This is the method that I use when doing calligraphy projects. This way I never need to rule out lines on the paper I am actually working on, and never need to erase or rub out pencil lines.A very old method of creating lines is to use a straight edge and a letter opener, dull edged knife or a bookbinder\u2019s bone folder to lightly engrave lines onto the paper surface.Another old method is to use a pin to prick small holes in the paper and use those as a guideline. If you look closely at medieval manuscripts on parchment or paper you can sometimes see the minute holes made as a guideline for the illumination and calligraphy.T-square:  Light Table:  Bone Folder:  Pin Pricks on Medieval Manuscript:  ",
