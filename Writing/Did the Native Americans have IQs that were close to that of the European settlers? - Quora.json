            "answer_text": "This is a bit of a trick question because our concept of IQ wasn\u2019t really pertinent to either group. You\u2019d need to come up with some other measurement for general intelligence. And then you\u2019d have to decide what kinds of intelligence would have been more or less helpful for either group at that time. Then there\u2019s a separate issue related to group intelligence\u2026 how well did individuals work together? The Europeans tended to be short-sighted as far as native peoples went. It\u2019s hard to take advantage of people without first persuading yourself they deserve to be taken advantage of, either because of your superiority in some way or because they\u2019re not fully human in your eyes. The biggest mistake Native Americans made was failing to understand just how many Europeans would come. We\u2019ve seen lots of invasions throughout history, but nothing compares to the scale of what happened in the Americas. The Europeans just kept coming\u2026 and coming\u2014and they all carried microbes. They knew more about how pathogens killed and took advantage of that knowledge. The only comparable wipe out was when people first crossed into the Americas\u2026 and promptly wiped out whole species. Yeah. People can be pretty devastating. Here\u2019s the interesting bit for me: when you realize 90 percent of American natives died in this unbelievable invasion\u2026 what does that mean about the 10 percent who survived? Pretty tough cookies, I\u2019m thinking. Tough and smart. In case you haven\u2019t looked, the invasion isn\u2019t over. We\u2019ve treated native Americans shamefully and we\u2019ve done very little to make amends. It\u2019s a stupidity on our part. Why aren\u2019t we able to see how much benefit such people could be for the rest of us? Why aren\u2019t we providing support? Too many are still hanging on to the idiotic notion that they\u2019re not quite as human as us. ",

            "answer_text": "Completely unknown and unknowable.  Even with the (probably scarce,  as it's an academically untouchable area practically)  current data on such things,  there is little that I have ever read of American indigenous peoples' IQ's.   Most of the controversial writings related to this topic have focused primarily on the alleged general trend of IQ differences (from lesser-to-greater)  between, respectively,  black Africans and descendants abroad,  Caucasians (not restricted to solely Europeans but including Middle Easterners as well),   Jewish Caucasians,  and East (though not necessarily southeast) Asians.   With the East Asians such as Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, appearing to come out ahead of all of the others in general, and Jewish Europeans excelling in certain areas where non-Jewish Europeans may not necessarily.   Of course if observable exceptions exist (they must) then it's all disprovable anyway and,  beyond that,  IQ score in and of itself need not be the sole indicator of intelligence.  Nor do we know for sure that intelligence is unchangeable throughout one's entire life (though there probably is a general baseline area from around which a person will probably not deviate greatly).   I personally think intelligence is an at least partly heritable trait, though one that can certainly be molded for better or worse by environmental and other factors.  Also, by today's standards, many of the rank-and-file Europeans who poured into and colonized the Americas hundreds of years ago (whether the English, the Spanish,  Portuguese,  French,  & whoever else) would probably appear -- and score -- markedly dumber than a counterpart with the same ethnic background today.   There are many factors at play.   Education,  nutrition,  general access to knowledge and generally held knowledge about everything from medicine to astronomy to geography.  To an extent then, almost any 21st century person is likely 'smarter' than an average person -- note,  average person -- from the 16th or 17th century. ",

            "answer_text": "You will get a lot of misleading answers to this question, largely because the entire subject of genetics and IQ has been highly politicized. The question is best resolved by comparison of carefully administered test results based on the genetic background of the individuals that are tested. There are also quite a few different \u201cnative American\u201d groups, ranging from forest-dwellers of the Amazon to the Inca, Maya, Aztec, Navaho, Iroquian tribes, Arctic tribes, etc. With enough sampling you would probably find statistically significant differences between any of these, with respect to the population mean. Around the population mean, of course, there is a lot of variation. Remember that about half of the Europeans would have an IQ below 100, half above. So you could find most likely find some people in a population with a lower mean IQ that have a higher IQ than some people in a population with a higher mean IQ. IQ is not a population trait, but mean IQ is. Biologists have no problem with the measurement of population traits and inter-population variation in those traits, but a lot of people who control the social departments and administration of universities have a vested interest in the \u201cblank slate\u201d concept that such variation does not exist. These people will always tell you that IQ measurements are flawed, unless they reveal the \u201ctruth\u201d that they espouse. So the first question for YOU to answer is simply this: Are you looking for the truth, or just trying to find a supporting opinion? ",

There were very smart Native American, and very smart Europeans. In both cases, they were few. There was a large number of both groups that had average intelligence. There was another small number of both groups that were intellectually impaired. Over and over again, we need to remind ourselves that there is no difference in the range of intellectual development by \u201crace.\u201d Native Americans may have used their intelligence differently to deal with a different life experience, but the smart ones still found solutions more quickly than most of the others, and the impaired ones needed more help than the others. Where a European might use his compass and sextant to determine his position, a Native American would use his knowledge of flora and fauna for the same purpose. The difference would be that the Native American would be able to use his insight immediately, but the European would have to plot his numbers on a map, and hope the map was accurate. ",

Inuit have the highest social intelligence of any other people I have come across.

People who are building real ocean ships (and cross the ocean) are more intelligent than people who are only building then a low-tech canoe. I think you got your answer. But being more intelligent as a person or as an ethnical group does not make you by definition superior in other fields of human behavior. To say it in a metaphor: a shepherd dog and a poodle dog are both dogs but with different qualities and both are OK. ",
