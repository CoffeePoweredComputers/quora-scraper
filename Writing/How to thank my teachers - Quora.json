            "answer_text": "This is how I did it and I am pretty sure it worked for me. At the end of the school year, after exams and on the last day of school, I go in to the classroom that the teacher teaches in. Usually, there is no one in there except the teacher. I tell them that I had a fantastic year with them and that I am thankful that they were my teacher. I tell them how I failed and how they helped me overcome any problems that I had. They tell me that I was a fantastic student and how I learned so much and how they knew that. Then, I part ways and tell them that I will come to see them again if I have any problem. This one-on-one interaction works great for me. One because it allows me to show my appreciation. To tell the people that they made a positive impact on my life and how they did it. It turns into reinforcement for a teacher and they do not ever give up teaching other students the same way. Secondly, it allows me to be a better public speaker. This may sound a bit strange as there are only two people in the room but speaking to an adult/mentor is not the same as talking to your friend. I said speaking instead of talking, remember that. As you do more of these conversations, you become better and that helps when you are presenting in front of a class and other people that are older than you. Lastly, it allows me to be uncomfortable, even for a little bit. Most people do not show appreciation because of fear. Fear that it makes them feel vulnerable and it shows vulnerability to others. Yet, you should never feel vulnerable to show your love and support and appreciation toward others. Doing so will cripple your social skills and personal/family life. The more I do it, the better of a person I become in terms of social intelligence. Anyway, this is my answer. I hope this becomes helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to comment. Good Luck!

            "answer_text": "It's been long since I have penned something down. So here it goes, A LETTER TO ALL THE TEACHERS : It's funny how large of an impression our teachers can leave upon our lives. An Inspirer, an empowerer, an engager, these are a few characteristics that a teacher possesses. It is through your milestones that we learn, It is through your experience that we earn, You led us so we may lead, You inspired us so we may inspire. To experience victory in defeat, To learn, to build, to grow and to dream. Your presence is a skeleton of our success, for you were a guide, a leader but more importantly a friend. You gave us passion, power and hope. And that is indelible mark you have left upon our characters. \"The influence of a good teacher can never be erased. They can change lives with just the right mix of chalk and challenges.\" I, along with my team, @VarSITy Care, the social service club of Symbiosis Institute of Technology, celebrated Teacher's Day, expressed gratitude and love, by gifting them words of love and respect through handmade cards and bookmarks. Teachers were welcomed with a rose, cabins were decorated. The celebration commenced with entertaining performances and fun games for the teachers in thwas a heart touching experience for teachers as well as the students. Teacher\u2019s Day Celebration :  Handmade Cards :  Welcoming the Teachers with a Rose :  The V@rSITy Care Team :  If there's anyone who is in a position to bring positive change into the world everyday, it's a Teacher. You're not \"Just a Teacher\", you are a life changer and very well might be the reason a child wants to succeed. A hundred years from now it will not matter what your bank account was, the sort of house you lived in, or the kind of car you had. But the world will be different, because you were important in the life of a child. Wish You all a HAPPY TEACHERS DAY. ! ",
