            "answer_text": "In no particular order. 1- Many cops are joining a department and upgrading from a minimum wage job, or the military. Instead of wasting your new found wealth on fancy cars and such, if you are in the US and your department has a 401K type investment, put as much into it as you can. Even if you are going to get a guaranteed pension, this 401K money can be used to pay for your kids college, pay for a care center if your parents, or spouse end up in one and if nothing else, you can spend it on anything you want when you retire. 2- also consider a Roth IRA. You pay taxes on gains from your work 401K, gains from a Roth IRA are tax free. Work 401K type investments often get a matching contribution from your employer. 3- take a martial arts class. a year of aikido taught me a lot of joint locks and come alongs, but jujitsu was my go to. After 6 months of jujitsu, I only had to strike one guy in about 25 years and I spent all of my time in patrol, so I was in a lot of scuffles. MMA and krav maga are recommended by some of my friends. 4- Take any classes your department will send you to like, Interview and Interrogation, DART, Gang school, Narco school, etc. 5- Keep a copy of all of your arrest reports and any unusual reports. 5a- Keep a diary. Over the years, you will forget a lot of the funny stuff that happens at work. One day you may want to write a book. 6- Be thorough in your report writing. The more thorough your report is, the less likely you will have to wake up at 6 AM, on your day off, and go to court. 6b- if a defense attorney asks a question not covered by your report, make note of the question and include the answer in your next report. If it\u2019s just a stupid question, just make note of it, however if you hear that same question more than a few times, maybe it\u2019s not as stupid a question as you thought and you should answer it in your next report. 7= if your department authorizes it, carry a sap. Those babies can do a lot of damage. 8 - if you have to strike a guy, the elbow makes a better fist than your hand. A kick to the lower ribs will drop a guy who is trying to get up. If you want to consider a head butt, you better learn how to do it. 9- carry a small backup flashlight. You don\u2019t want to need a light and not have one. Pelican makes very good ones. 10- Carry a backup gun. I usually approached people with a friendly smile on my face, but the fingers of my left hand were holding my backup at the top of my pocket, out of view. If I needed to shoot somebody, I could pull that and shoot faster than I could draw my holstered weapon. If I needed to fight, all I had to do was open my fingers as I lifted my hands and the backup would drop back into the bottom of my pocket. 11- Always be reevaluating a situation, even if you are in a fight. When it is time to stop, stop and stop the cops you are with. They can get your ass fired, or sent to prison if they use too much force and you didn\u2019t try to stop them. 12- Consider that what your department teaches you\u3001 as far as tactics\u3001 is probably wrong. If it wasn\u2019t wrong, they wouldn\u2019t be perpetually changing what they teach. They teach what they think is the best way at the time. You need to look for the flaws and not wait for some guy who wants to hurt you to find the flaws. 13- Live within your means. If you have to work overtime, to support yourself, you are probably living outside of your means. If your significant other is spending too much, you need to put the reins on them, or say adios. 14- If you want, not need, some big ticket item, like a computer, or big screen TV, save for it. If it takes you a year, guess what, you will have a year newer model, that is probably bigger and better and it will be paid off. 15- Call your significant other if you are going to be late and call when you are on the way home. They worry. 16- Fuck political correctness. If something doesn\u2019t feel right, it probably isn\u2019t. Your brain will pick up when somebody\u2019s facial expressions, body language, or words, don\u2019t match either the situation, or each other, way before you will be able to figure out consciously what is going on. 17- Keep your distance from people. 18- Be friendly, but be ready to shoot somebody in the face, before the smile leaves yours. 19- Always keep your cool. It\u2019s hard to think clearly when angry 20- Pre-plan and visualize. Anytime you hear about an incident, think about what you would do differently. Change the scenario a little and think of what you would do in the new situation. When you watch some cop show, think of what you would do. That way, you will react faster. For instance, scenario =\u201cWhat if somebody grabs my partner\u2019s gun and they are wrestling over it?\u201d plan- \u201cI will shoot him in the back of the head\u201d That is pre=planning Visualization - \u201cBut if they are wrestling face to face and I shoot him in the back of the head, I have about a half inch of skull and jello between my partner\u2019s brain and my muzzle\u2026 hmmmm\u201d Preplanning #2 - \u201cI can grab him by the hair, yank his head back and shoot so the bullet goes upward\u2026 or I can shoot him in the side of the head\u2026 or I can shoot down at an angle so the bullet goes through that soft part behind the neck at a downward angle toward the heart and lungs\u2026 or I can shoot him a bunch of times in the back, lungs, heart, kidneys and liver area. If the bullet goes through, my partner\u2019s vest will stop it.\u201d Now you have a bunch of plans 21- If you want to make a lot of money, promote. You probably won\u2019t have much fun, or have a lot of funny stories, but you\u2019ll make bank. Hope this helps ",

            "answer_text": "Never accept a prisoner from another officer without searching them yourself. Never accept a gun from another officer without clearing it yourself. Always stick your pinky in the chamber. You will occasionally fail to see a cartridge in there. Its not personal. Nothing anyone out there says or does to you is personal. Put money away in a 401k or 457 as well as your pension. Start now. Don\u2019t buy a $1.5m house, even if you married a cop or nurse and can (barely) afford it. The only difference between a $700t house and a $1.5m house is ego. Put the money you save away for when shit happens. Because shit happens. Get a degree. There will be a gap between when you retire and when you can start drawing your pension. If you only do the average of 20 years it could be a 16 year gap. Plus, a Public Administration or Business Administration degree is solid gold if you want to get promoted. Get access to your state\u2019s criminal jury instructions. They spell out what you have to prove to convict someone for crimes better than the penal code does. Don\u2019t treat straights like crooks. Be relaxed and show teeth when you catch Joe Citizen running a red. These are the people who tell the council you deserve a raise or need more equipment. Don\u2019t treat crooks like straights. Let your hatred show. Tell them you will try your level best to put them in prison every time you see them in your area. If you show kindness they will keep coming back because they think you are a sissy. When you have a bad guy but no proof, let them go. No one out there is worth unpaid time off, your reputation or your career. They\u2019ll still be dirty tomorrow. Try again. Have another officer read your report before turning it in. Your intent will blind you to your mistakes. You will read what you intended to write when reviewing. Learn to shoot better than the academy training. Get an 8\u2033 pattern in rapid fire. Under stress that will expand to 20\u2033 (the width of a man\u2019s chest). If you start with a 20\u2033 pattern on the range you will be lucky to score a hit under stress. You may never fire your gun, but if you do it will be a life or death situation. Wear quarter or half boots that protect your ankles. Have two pairs. In the summer heat or in the rain it takes two days for your boots to dry, so you alternate. Don\u2019t lie. Don\u2019t lie in court. Don\u2019t lie to your sergeant or admin. I have seen guys get fired for lying when the thing they lied about would have meant no more than a scolding or a day off. If any judge thinks you lied soon all the judges at that courthouse will never trust your word again. Don\u2019t lie to crooks. Crooks know what you can and can\u2019t do to them, so stick to threats you can actually carry out. ",
