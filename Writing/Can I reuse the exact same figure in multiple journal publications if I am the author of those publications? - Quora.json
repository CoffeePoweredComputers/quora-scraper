            "answer_text": "Yes. However, you have to properly ask for permission of the publisher and properly acknowledge the first publication of the figure. Generally, you have the right to reuse your original figures. I\u2019ve done this probably 100 times for review articles and books, so it\u2019s not a big deal. This is commonly done for review articles, PhD theses, books, textbooks, etc. The journal will give you the EXACT verbiage you need to include in the caption for the figure. It\u2019s important to do this so that the reader of the new work can go back to the original work for details. If you go to the journal\u2019s web-site, you should find a link to request permission for reusing a figure. This will generate an authorization form that you will need to pass along to the editor/publisher of the new piece of work. Takes about 2\u20133 minutes per figure. ",

            "answer_text": "Eric Bittner gave a detailed answer on how to go about reusing figures that include asking permission and putting certain verbiage. The easier route is to do trivial modifications to make the figures original. Modifications may include changing the placement of labels, drawings, colors, lines, etc. and submitting these without going through the hassle of asking permission. ",
