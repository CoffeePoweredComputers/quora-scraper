            "answer_text": "As a highschool student taking online classes and taking full on tests at home and teachers just trusting kids to not us the internet I can tell you that lots of people use the internet when they are taking test and it is very hard to track down someone\u2019s personal internet usage as they are taking a test, so it is very rare that kids get caught. Another things that I have seen is that with quizzes and tests online, kids can have one friend in their group take the test first, tell them what the questions are and the answers to the ones that they got right and then they all go and google the answers to the questions on the test and write them down. Never trust high schoolers to not use technology when the technology is so accessible not a days. ",
