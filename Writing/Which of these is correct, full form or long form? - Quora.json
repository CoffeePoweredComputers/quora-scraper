In the US, the Internal Revenue Service gives some taxpayers the option of filing a \u201cshort form\u201d to report their income; the form that\u2019s used by other taxpayers is commonly called the \u201clong form,\u201d although that\u2019s not the official name for it. I can imagine an industry, institution or profession having something that\u2019s customarily called a \u201cfull form\u201d by the people who use it every day. One dictionary says that the words \u201cfull form\u201d can refer to a type of insurance coverage. ",
