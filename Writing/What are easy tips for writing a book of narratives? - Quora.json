            "answer_text": "Please allow me to disabuse you of a common belief: writing a book about anything is not easy. Your book of narratives (whatever that is) won\u2019t be easy, either. No one can give you \u2018tips\u2019 to make it easy. You just have to sit down and write the damn thing. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a book off your shelf and type it. Front to back, the whole thing. See how long it takes you. And remember, doing this, that all the decisions have already been made for you. However long it took you to type this book, it will take you 5\u201315 times as long making the decisions for yourself for your own book. There\u2019s no easy way. ",
