Writers should follow a checklist consisting of: motivation, problem statement, approach, results, and conclusions. It differs from a dissertation abstract.  Once your own dissertation is finished, you will need to produce an abstract just like the ones you read in your initial search for literature, and that will be placed in the ProQuest database as well. You have already read a number of abstracts so writing dissertation abstract drafts should not be too difficult. You will be providing a future research with a solid summary that includes the following: Your research question as it was stated in your introductory chapterA summary of your design and methodologyA summary of the results and statistical analysisA brief look at any constraints and/or nuisance factorsSuggestions for further study in the research field.This is a broad question, you should read more here Dissertation abstract writing help.

            "answer_text": "An abstract paper is a summary of a longer paper. In an abstract, you need to include the paper\u2019s argument with minor detail. An abstract should be no longer than a page and could be as short as a paragraph. It should only include the main theme of the paper and the thesis statement. That is it. You have done it correctly if someone else reads the abstract and can accurately tell you what your paper is about. ",
