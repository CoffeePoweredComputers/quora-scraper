It is \u201chandwritten\u201d (one word) as in, \u201cEven though recruiters expect an emailed thank-you note after an interview, they are delighted and gobsmacked when a candidate takes the time to send a handwritten note on real paper, through snail mail.\u201d Also, when I worked as the graphics and calligraphy officer for a U.S. presidential inauguration committee, handwritten invitations, in elegant calligraphy, were the expectation for the \u201cA\u201d list (incoming president\u2019s family, Supreme Court justices, heads of state, senators, congressmen, etc.). I have done calligraphy for three inaugurations, each one is a little different, and the pressure is intense but gratifying. \u2014Sarah M. 1/11/2018 ",

            "answer_text": "No hyphen is needed when using the word \"handwritten,\" assuming it is is not due to breaking the word at the end of a line to continue onto the next. Dictionaries from online Dictionary.com to Merriam-Webster to The Oxford English Dictionary will bear this out. The question is a natural one because we often think of pairings that use the past participle as needing the hyphen. For example, \"I don't talk to that man since I learned about his ill-gotten gains.\" However, \"handwrite\" is its own verb: Do you want me to handwrite this or type it? I handwrote a note to each attendee. He had handwritten the lengthy novel until his hands were gnarled from the pain. So, even as an adjective, it works well with no hyphen: My handwritten invitations yielded far better response than the professionally printed cards did. It's noun form also lives a life without hyphens: As a child, I escaped many a teacher's wrath purely through the beauty of my handwriting, which lulled them into a false belief that I understood far more than I did. Associating \"handwritten\" with its other forms helps to remember that the hyphen gets a day off from this one. Thank you for the A2A, Megan. ",
