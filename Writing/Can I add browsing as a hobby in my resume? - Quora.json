Here\u2019s a rule of thumb: don\u2019t add things that require no particular skill or effort\u2014or, for that matter, things that almost anyone can do. In fact, you probably shouldn\u2019t be adding hobbies at all unless there\u2019s a particular reason why your future employer would be interested in them. ",
