            "answer_text": "Why are tone marks omitted? At least two reasons: (1) Inputting tones is a hassle. Besides, anybody who is fluent in Mandarin and proficient in Pinyin can easily read running text written without tone marks. Why bother? (2) Most foreigners can't pronounce tones, so why go to all the trouble of adding them? That being said, omitting tone marks on maps, street signs and documents intended for foreign audiences (passports, diplomas, leases, books, magazines, newspapers etc.) does cause confusion. Totally unrelated names that differ by tone are mixed together, thus helping to reinforce unfortunate foreign stereotypes of Chinese: \u201cThey all look alike and even their names are almost the same\u201d. Street addresses can also cause confusion. In Taipei, for example, there are two roads called \u201cWuchang Street\u201d: \u6b66\u660c\u8857 and \u4e94\u5e38\u8857 (completely different characters and different tones). I\u2019m sure there are similar examples in other Chinese cities, something that Chinese rarely notice because they only read the Chinese characters.  *Solutions* Adding numbers to represent tones looks \u201cweird\u201d, unsightly and is apt to be ignored (no other language uses numbers to spell people\u2019s names). Besides, many people are bothered by looking at what appear to be formulas in a math textbook. Augmented Pinyin, which marks tones by adding 4 letters at the end of each syllable, is an ideal solution to the problem of marking tones without diacritics (of course, teaching materials and dictionaries wouldn\u2019t need to be changed).  Mnemonic Basis for HJMN: H, M and N are composed of two vertical lines. The middle portion looks exactly like Hanyu Pinyin\u2019s tone marks, and the letter J looks like the top half of \u201c2\u201d. What\u2019s more, the syllables can be arranged in alphabetical order. \u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916 can be romanized thus   Here are four real people whose names sound quite different, but whose passport spellings would be the same. HJMN Augmented Pinyin restores their dignity while maintaining Hanyu Pinyin spellings, thus maintaining continuity: \u5f90\u5efa\u826f Xu Jianliang - - > Xuj Jiannliangj \u8a31\u5efa\u826f Xu Jianliang - - > Xum Jiannliangj \u5f90\u517c\u826f Xu Jianliang - - > Xuj Jianhliangj \u8a31\u517c\u826fXu Jianliang - - > Xum Jianhliangj  PRC National Standard GB / T16159-1996 specifies that alternative methods can also be used to mark tones.

            "answer_text": "Probably because these marks are hard to be typed on keyboard. The keyboard map widely used by Pinyin users is similar to US keyboard, which doesn't include alternative keys or AltGr kry to add marks on letters. The only way is to call an alternative keyboard map which only contains vowel letters with marks. In fact, when written on paper (especially on books targeting on children in China or on dictionaries), diacritical marks are probably always written. The diacritical marks are forced to be used everywhere proper. After all, it could be confusing when without them. Maybe you've seen that the names for regions and names are often written without marks.
