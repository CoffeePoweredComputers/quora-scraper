            "answer_text": "A key strategy in the college placement exam essay is to take full advantage of all the time that is allotted. By managing your time wisely, you can allow sufficient time to plan, compose and proofread the essay before you submit it. Typically, each student is allowed 60 to 90 minutes to read the prompt, as well as to plan, write and review the essay. Keep your eye on the clock and allot at least 5 to 10 minutes at the start and the end of the allotted time to properly complete your pre- and post-writing. Part of the score of the college placement essay is determined by grammar, spelling and clarity of structure. Once you have completed the essay, take a few minutes to carefully read through it and proofread the text for errors. Reviewing the essay before you submit it also provides you the opportunity to develop or clarify the sub-arguments. Take time to read through and polish the essay to improve your chances of earning a higher score. ",
