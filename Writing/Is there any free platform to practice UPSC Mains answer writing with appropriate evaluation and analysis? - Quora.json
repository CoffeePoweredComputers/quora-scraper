            "answer_text": "A2A. Good to see that you know the importance of appropriate evaluation and analysis. BUT No brands or person cleared mains can review answers for free as they will have many other jobs to do. If they want to spend their time for reviewing answers they need to be paid well for their time. Free shown anywhere will be just a trap to pull you to their courses. Will you get free chilly chicken or fried rice anywhere? Will you get a free bike or a bicycle? Nothing in this world is free. If shown free, its just to attract you to their product which includes price of what given free. I saw some websites offering free current affairs and magazines. But their prelims test series is double rate than else where. So you are paying the charge of those free materials with that prelims test series. Coming to mains review, i recommend civilservicelab (dot) com for monthly daily reviews at around 1000 rupees. It worth for the amount BUT review will be in 48 hours. If you are serious towards mains and willing to pay bit more, then iastoday will be the best choice. iastoday is there with daily review since 2016 and are top in class with best feedbacks with in few hours(before 5pm or 6pm daily) in detailed manner. No other series are reliable in my view towards review by team. Review from novice given free or close to free can affect negatively. Unless they cleared mains, their advice may direct you to wrong path. ",
