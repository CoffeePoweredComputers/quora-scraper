            "answer_text": "Yes, and I\u2019ll explain why. These days we see many teenagers with boyfriends and girlfriends. But most of the time, they end up with heartbreak. Leaving maybe one or both the people in a terrible state of mind. That is a very strong reason why teen love isn\u2019t worthwhile. But heartbreak has many good sides to it. How you maybe be asking? When you go through a heartbreak, most people are at the most vulnerable or lowest point in their life. Moving on is a hard thing. So when you go through a heartbreak, you learn to let go. Which is a huge life lesson? You learn to love yourself, and learn self-worth! The sadness is overwhelming but the amount of things you learn from teen love is amazing. You learn that maybe they aren\u2019t the one? You learn how to love other people, and how other people love you back. Love is love. People think it\u2019s a waste of time. But you gain so much experience! Maybe in your next relationship, you can change it up, and better yourself for you and your partner! (If you have any questions regarding this, or need some clarification, don\u2019t hesitate and please comment them down!) ~ Angie ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say any love is worth it. Teen love is special, in my opinion. It\u2019s like a whole new world that sweeps you off of your feet, the kind of thing you remember when you\u2019re old and reminisce about. There\u2019s something so sweet and innocent about young love, and I\u2019m one of the people that thinks teens have the capability of love! Give it a chance. If it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out. But if it does, it does! People change as they grow up, and they can grow apart, and that\u2019s okay. But if you love your significant other, then don\u2019t give up on the relationship just because teen love isn\u2019t \u201cworth it\u201d. Age doesn\u2019t invalidate your feelings, in my opinion. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "It can definitely be an important experience. Most relationships at that age do not last, but some do. I\u2019d wait until at least 17 though to start dating. I think it\u2019s worth it in the sense that we grow a lot from our experiences whether or not they work out and help us see things in a different light whether that ends in heartbreak 99% of the time or that 1% that doesn\u2019t. Either way it is an experience. It\u2019s really up to what that person who experiences it to determine if it was worthwhile for them. ",

            "answer_text": "No, in fact from what ive seen dating in early teen years, can negativly affect one from having healthy relationships. It seems teens have an unrealistic expectations of relationships on average, and these expectations are carried over into adulthood, things such as extreme jealously, leaving when thier partner isnt being to thier will at every moment, or the most common not loving your partner but loving being in a relationship. Of course this isnt a hard fast rule, its just been from my observation and experience that dating early in life will make relationships much much harder in the future from bad habbits, and misconceptions. And the people who i see start dating in thier late teens early 20s, generally have healthier relationships, and lives outside of thier relationship. Like i said, this is not a rule just observations i have made in my short life. ",

Teenagers do not have the skills or training to be financially independent to be able to build a lifetime commitment with someone. Consequently,falling in love is not a reasonable goal to pursue at that age. Working hard to attain the goals of independence so one can have more and better opportunities in the future is the best option to my mind. ",
