            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very good question. I\u2019m anxious to know what other authors will say so I\u2019m choosing to follow this question. I don\u2019t know how it is for others but, for me it gets more challenging each time. I have an uncontrollable impulse to try to make each book better than the last \u2014 more compelling plot, more compelling characters, more subject matter likely to appeal to readers, better spelling, better grammar, fewer uncaught mistakes when pressing \u201cpublish.\u201d Sometimes I paint myself into the virtual \u201cwriter\u2019s corner\u201d by making so many demands on myself that it becomes impossible to proceed and I stall out in writer\u2019s block. For this reason each of my books (full length epics averaging 200,000 words) takes longer to finish than the last. Some authors must not have this problem because I see some have published hundreds of books. I have two favorite authors, both geniuses in my opinion \u2014 Stephen King and Tom Robbins. King has hundreds of books while Robbins, who has apparently retired from writing, has fewer than a dozen. I see in Robbins\u2019 writing an obsession with perfection, similar to mine while executed much better (his writing tends to be free of mistakes). King\u2019s published works are full of problems, plot mistakes, mistakes in geography, misspelling, grammatical mistakes, and many more. And yet King is as much of a superb teller of compelling stories as Robbins and someone who inspires me just as much. So I can\u2019t justify my obsession with perfection. It is what it is. Thanks for the curiosity. ",

And as soon as others begin to read the previous book, it provides validation for future work. No matter how much I write, there\u2019s always a bit of fear, but it becomes easier to push that fear aside the more I write. When I first began writing, 10 years ago, I had no idea how much time and effort is put into writing a book. I wonder if I had known back then, if I still would have pursued writing. And yet, I can\u2019t stop now. LOL Dawn http://www.dawhusted.com & A Wordy Woman's Guide ",
