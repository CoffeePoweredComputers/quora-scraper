            "answer_text": "Thank you for your question, Linda and Mary. People experiencing homelessness do not have access to everyday common resources, like bus passes, meals between hours of local soup kitchen, showers and storage units for their stuff, and medical care. Cell phones are the only way they can get a call back from a potential employer or to know if their doctor\u2019s appointment was changed. Cost of cellular and WiFi data is often difficult to maintain continuous service for cell phones when you are without a steady job. Lost IDs require proof of identification, and a copy of birth certificates can cost $50. Without computers, people without houses cannot get information about local services that provide housing vouchers, food stamps, and other services. People experience tears in tents and clothing, but they have no way to repair those items. While some people are able to continue their education, they still need to access writing pads, pens & pencils, and even reading glasses. These sound like every ordinary needs that you and I depend on, and it\u2019s more a bigger need for the homeless. Shoes for families with children, healthy lunches, and even to go to a movie once a month or two \u2014 families in homelessness struggle. People who sleep in cars need fuel, or maybe oil and other automotive parts that keeps their only transportation operating. When you put all of this together, it shouldn\u2019t be difficult to figure out the gaps of services in your community. Faith base groups need to accept responsibility to help the poor and the homeless, by thinking about sharing spaces for sheltering the homeless during extreme weather. My organization, Community Compassion Outreach, Inc., has identified gaps in services and we\u2019ve used our programs to address those gaps. Resource lists and referrals to agencies that have funding to help is a critical part of helping the homeless navigate their community\u2019s resources. Another step toward helping the homeless is to influence store managers to accept the homeless in their stores. The homeless are not the only thieves in our world, so why provide them just because they look unclean or are carrying a backpack over their shoulders. We\u2019ve been aware that markets and stores will call the police when a homeless person is shopping. Many of the homeless have disability income and need to buy goods with their benefits. It\u2019s horrible to learn that store managers can be so discriminatory of the homeless and the poor. Media needs to be more compassionate when reporting incidences involving homeless people. Exaggerated stories involving the homeless is the only thing that the public remembers. Changing the message is an important step toward helping people who have experienced some form of trauma. Homelessness is a trauma by itself; when compounded by new traumas, we should not expect the homeless to change overnight. That is the final recommendation I can make. Expectations and lack of patience by the public and service providers should be more realistic in order to avoid burn-out and frustrations when the people we try to help don\u2019t change as quickly as we expect. High expectations of the population is unrealistic and unfair! ",

            "answer_text": "Because Jesus said we should. And because they were not always homeless. Many of them were poisoned by drugs. A meth addict usually can be \u201ccleared\u201d in about six months, we need more treatment facilities. The mentally ill are a bigger problem, because the liberals decided that they have the \u201cright\u201d to suffer on the street instead of being cared for in a hospital. My wife gave a homeless guy $10. He walked straight into the liquor store. I offered another homeless guy a fresh, wrapped sandwich from a high end grocery story, I had been invited to a restaurant after I\u2019d already bought it. He declined, he only wanted cash. Do you want to help the homeless? Do NOT give them cash. 1. Give to local shelters and food pantries, in Los Angeles I give to the Union Mission downtown, there is Covenant House for teenagers. 2. Stop voting for moron liberals who talk big and do nothing. Here in L.A. Eric Garcetti is a joke. I thought it was impossible that someone could be worse than Villa Rigosa or whatever his name was. I was wrong. 3. Vote for conservatives who are willing to imprison drug dealers for long terms. I myself am willing to execute them, if properly convicted and put their heads on poles on the Mexican border, I am not kidding. 4. Teach your children that marijuana is not hippie pot. It is far, far stronger and at risk of having poison in it. A recent raid in LA found that the \u201cgovernment approved and sold and taxed\u201d marijuana was full of rat poison. If you are all indignant and want to smoke pot, grow a couple of plants yourself. The government has their head up their ass because they are so greedy for tax revenue. I don\u2019t have a problem with pot if you don\u2019t drive and grow it yourself. I myself go with my gut. I put a five dollar bill in some old guy\u2019s shoe who was passed out on the sidewalk. Other guys, especially young ones who are trying to be Venice beach hipsters, I want to punch in the face and I won\u2019t give them anything. Here in Beverly Hills there is a good campaign reminding people to not give cash. There was for a long time on Rodeo Drive a guy in a wheel chair with two white rabbits, sympathy, sympathy. Someone brought him there in a van and picked him up at night. Now there\u2019s an entrepreneur. A year or two later I saw him with only one rabbit. I asked him if he had eaten the other one. Send me death threats, I dare you. Just go with your gut. The government under Obama totally abused veterans, but then there are a lot of fake veterans. What are we supposed to do? Give to the Salvation Army, I won\u2019t shop anywhere that doesn\u2019t allow a red kettle. Make it clear to the retailers. Give to the churches and missions that do this work. God help them. Most of all vote out the liberal bums who created this disaster. I thought of printing cards with the address of Eric Garcetti\u2019s mansion address in Hancock Park, but I didn\u2019t want any of them getting shot. it\u2019s very, very hard to track all this. I already posted about the new disease paradigm that is coming from illegals and homeless. Winter is coming. When in doubt, ask what would Jesus do? Help individuals when you can, and hold the money changers in government accountable ",
