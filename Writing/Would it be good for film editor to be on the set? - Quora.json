            "answer_text": "Scott Danzig's post is worth reading, but as an editor myself, I'll still put my own two cents in.  The short answer is, if you don't have a preference, let your editor decide.  I can only think of 2 or 3 reasons for not wanting the editor on set while shooting. First, some believe it provides a fresh, 'less tainted' perspective on first viewing of the footage and they're not wrong. But honestly, you should be at least having your editor available to watch dailies with you anyway, so they're probably going to hear about any baggage that comes with a particular shot regardless. Another reason, as Scott pointed out, is that less people on set can make for a cleaner, easier, less stressed workspace for the director, actors, etc. But at the same time, if your editor is fulfilling a legitimate position on set that would still be filled by somebody else if they weren't present (like script supervisor) then that point is kind of moot.  I for one love being on set for shooting when I'm able, but not just to watch. If I'm on set, I want to be doing something to assist, whether it's working the sound mixer, script supervising, holding the boom, whatever. The main reason I like to be around though (other than the fact I think it's fun) is I'm right there if there's ever any post-related questions at all. So if the director wants to know if something can be fixed in post, or whether a particular shot will satisfy what I need to produce a good edit, I'm right there. Most of my work has been on small productions where I also head up the sound team (and by that, I mean I usually am the sound team), so being on set helps me keep an eye out for both picture and sound issues that I know could be a problem and others aren't necessarily watching for.  It's especially useful to have the editor right there when the inevitable moment comes that you realize a particular scene (in part or as a whole) just isn't going to work, and you need to know if and/or how you can make the movie work without it. Maybe the editor isn't the only one that can solve that problem, but it's been my experience that editors tend to have a better grasp of the story as a complete piece, since most of the other department heads focus so much on individual shots and scenes, and produce the film largely out of order.  I recall the first production where I wasn't on set; editing was made much more difficult than I expected. First, there were a bunch of green screen shots for a car scenes with dialogue, and had I been there, I would have worked with them to eliminate the green cast on the car and people that apparently nobody thought would be a problem. There were other scenes where cutting was made more difficult because they didn't think they had time to do a master shot so they got everything but that, and didn't realize until after the fact that there were several props and things being looked at/referenced that would have been in the master but ended up not being seen at all. Not only were there missing props and things not shown, but more than once an actor would cross between the dialogue to a different spot in the room and they didn't get shots of the movement, making it hard to express the move without it looking awkward. There were other problems too, but those two were what made editing much more difficult, and a lot of time on my part could have been saved if they'd taken just an extra 10 or 15 minutes to address these issues for each scene.  To be completely honest, a lot of the problems you might face that the editor can help you with are problems that others really ought to catch anyway. But films have so many moving parts with each person looking after their own thing, sometimes you just need somebody with the sort of big picture perspective that editors tend to have. I guess the point is, each person on the film only sees it from their own perspective. What the editor looks for and what the editor knows they need isn't necessarily going to be the same as everybody else. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that it depends on the circumstances of your shoot. First, I should say it's fantastic that you have an editor who's willing to be involved in production and pre production, this is definitely a good thing and quite a rarity in my experience of low budget production! There are potential downsides though... As someone who has been both DOP and Editor on the same project (and also having edited other people's projects with which I had no involvement in the shoot), I can say that without question it makes your editing job harder if you've lived every moment of the shoot. The main problem for me is the fact that you're seeing the footage entirely differently to how the audience will. It's quite hard to describe, but it's to do with the fact that you have mental 'map' of what the locations are actually like, what's around every corner, where 2 rooms are in relation to one another etc.  It sounds kind of trivial but it's not and it makes the editing process harder - when you're watching the footage what you see the real life place instead of the film version of it, which of course is different to how an audience member would see things (think of how when you actually visit somewhere like New York or Paris it's not anything like the movies make it seem - the illusion is ruined). That said there are definitely plus points to having an editor on set, especially for a low budget production which others have pointed out nicely, so in my opinion it depends on whether or not you can have the editor nearby, without being involved too much in the actual shooting. In an ideal world you would to try to keep them away from the actual shooting locations as much as possible. Try not to let them visit the places where filming will be taking place, even when shooting isn't happening. Have a little room set up for them somewhere and make it so all they get to see is the footage. Then this is pretty much no different to what it would be if they were receiving the rushes after the shoot. Another option would be that if you have a production base, have them be there. Then they can be working on stuff in the daytime while you're off shooting, and you can then review their work when you return to base in the evening. ",
