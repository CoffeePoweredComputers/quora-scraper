            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. Every year there are about 50 or so spec scripts bought in Hollywood, and probably five times that many optioned. In any given year there are around 50,000 spec scripts submitted to productions companies and studios. Some of those scripts float for years before being thrown away or actually bought. The odds of you, an inexperienced writer with no professional contacts in the industry and no track record, getting a sale on your spec script are somewhere around 5000:1. *this is not my math, and I do not want to take any sort of credit for it, but I cannot recall the originator of it. I will say that having actually gone to films school and gotten a degree in screenwriting, then having gone on to have a pretty decent career in Film not actually writing screenplays, his math seems pretty valid.
