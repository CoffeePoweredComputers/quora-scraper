            "answer_text": "This is a hard question to answer, because social rules are almost never explicit.  They exist as a general, cultural understanding, and are therefore highly fluid and variable from group to group.  There are literally dozens of rules I could name from 100, 50 or even twenty years ago that are no longer accepted, and in some cases actually offensive in modern society.  In a sense, you could say that if a social rule is commonly broken, then it's no longer a social rule, because not enough people believe in it to make it one. I would argue that the only way that a rule can be often broken and still count as a social rule is when people are typically embarrassed by doing it, but do it anyway, or if they deliberately only do it in secret or with particular groups, knowing that broader society would condemn them for it.  For example, telling racist jokes is understood to be in poor taste.  Yet there are many, many people who will do so if they're comfortable that they're in a group of like-minded friends.  Harrassing women on the street turns out to be incredibly common, but it's so obviously wrong that you only have to show a video of it happening to sicken and appall most of the public.  Even just generally being rude and bullying.  We accept that as being wrong, but a lot of people will do so quite aggressively if they can do it anonymously, as the internet makes so abundantly clear. Social rules, by their very nature, have no enforcement except for social condemnation.  What people will do when no one's looking shows how necessary those rules are. ",
