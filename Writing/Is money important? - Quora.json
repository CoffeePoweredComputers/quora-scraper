            "answer_text": " It\u2019s easy to know how well you did in school, the baseball game, or even at work. But how do you grade success in life? There\u2019s more to life than money. In school we receive grades; in baseball we count runs; and at work we get performance reviews. But life isn\u2019t quite that simple. We may ask ourselves: \u201cDo I have more good days or bad days? Am I doing better today than yesterday? Do I give more than I take? Am I doing better or worse than others?\u201d At the end of a day, we may say: \u201cThree people smiled at me, someone thanked me for doing them a favor, and my kids told me they loved me.\u201d Not bad. But . . . it\u2019s really hard to put a figure on intangibles such as a smile, a thank you, and the love of our children. And because these intangibles are difficult to quantify (and frequently not in the public eye), we often discount their true worth. Instead, we turn to more recognizable ways to measure success \u2014 money and the things it can buy. And why not? Money is tangible. You can feel it. You can count it. You can flaunt it. You can use it to impress others, while impressing yourself. Money is flexible. Money spells success. (Or does it?) It\u2019s tempting to assume that if we have a better car, a bigger house, and take more vacations, we\u2019re leading \u201cthe good life.\u201d But, are we leading a meaningful life? The truth is, money can\u2019t buy everything. For example, money can\u2019t buy peace of mind, good friends, a close-knit family, work-life balance, a worry-free day, good karma, time to relax, good health, a golden anniversary, quality time with your kids, a new beginning, natural beauty, happy memories, to name just a few. Many people are actually poor because the only thing they have is money. If You Live for Money, It\u2019s Time to Get a Life Are you willing to sacrifice your dreams for more money? Some folks justify continuing in a miserable job situation by acknowledging that they\u2019re well compensated. The truth is, life is short. People who live a life of purpose wake up each morning excited to pursue their dreams and make a difference. \u2014 Money can\u2019t guarantee that. Are you willing to compromise your honor for more money? Everything has a price, but not everything should be for sale. Some folks make money by being ruthless or doing unscrupulous things. People with a clear conscience have core beliefs and values that influence their decisions, shape their day-to-day actions, and determine their short- and long-term priorities. The result is that they spend more time listening to their inner voice. \u2014 Chances are, they sleep well at night. Are you willing to forgo relationships for more money? Think about \u201cthe takers.\u201d You know them. They measure every action by how much they will personally benefit, while \u201cthe givers\u201d do things without expectation of personal gain. Givers receive as much satisfaction (and as many karma points) by creating win-win relationships and giving to others than if they had benefited personally. \u2014 Which are you? Are you willing to miss out on life for more money? Some people don\u2019t take time to smell the roses. It\u2019s hard to calculate the value of memories, such as a clean bill of health, first kiss, crossing the finish line, grandchildren, passing the driver\u2019s test, 10-year reunion, acceptance letter, visit from the tooth fairy, cheers from the crowd, retirement, \u201cMama . . . Dada,\u201d bedtime stories, potty training, a beer and a burger, and \u201cI love you, too.\u201d It\u2019s important to focus on the journey as well the destination. \u2014 There\u2019s no dress rehearsal in life. Are you willing to cash in your personal dignity for more money? Some people are consumed with seeking the approval of others. The most important person to satisfy, however, is you. It\u2019s your life. So do your best. Be your own person. And remember, you\u2019re not finished until you do yourself proud. As John Mason, author, said, \u201cYou were born an original. Don\u2019t die a copy.\u201d \u2014 It\u2019s time to be the real you. Money . . . What\u2019s It All Worth? I\u2019m not saying that money isn\u2019t important. Rather, this is a plea to acknowledge that there\u2019s more to life than money. We must assign appropriate value to the intangible areas of our lives, such as our honor, personal relationships, peace of mind, and quality family time, to name a few examples. If we take these things for granted, and lose them as a result, we are on the road to personal bankruptcy. It\u2019s important to keep money in perspective. Do you spend more money satisfying your desires than fulfilling your needs? Do you let money dictate your activities, affect your relationships, and consume your thoughts? Is money a constant cause of anxiety and a source of stress? If you answer yes to these questions, you may be becoming a slave to your money. When you look back on your life one day, will you gauge success by the power that you attained and the wealth that you accumulated? Or, will you measure the degree to which your life was rich in character and purpose? Will it matter that you led an honorable existence, made a difference in people\u2019s lives, and left the world a better place for your children? Albert Einstein said it well, \u201cNot everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\u201d The choice is yours. There\u2019s more to life than money. ",

            "answer_text": "Money is an economic token - a symbol of purchasing power. Unless you're an artist or given to appreciate the artistry behind its production, the token's likely of no great importance to you. If so, your answer is obvious. Most people appreciate money for what they think it might buy for them, and that's probably what you meant to ask. Ask yourself whether you can purchase what you value as important in life. If you can, your answer is obvious. If you cannot, ... same answer. Of course, the philosophical among us would think me remiss to omit that fundamental truism you've heard all your life: Money can't buy you happiness. The capitalists will guffaw at this nostrum as something people with no money say. Rich and poor alike can see that money or its absence won't eliminate all of your problems, but it might buy you a better class of problems and problem solvers. Maybe. Who's right?  To borrow a metaphor from Scrooge McDuck, there's two sides to every coin. So, your mileage may vary. It's certainly true that money can't buy you love; it can't buy you a longer life; possessing it doesn't make you smarter or any more worthy of what's good or noble about your species. But... While money can't buy you love, it can rent access to affectionate company in fragrant surroundings. But, can you trust your pretty companions or what their true feelings toward you might be? Though it can't buy you life, it might get you medical care, which goes a long way to preventing premature death and years of suffering before your end. Still, do you think being rich will take away your fear of suffering and death? No, not so much in my experience. Of course, it doesn't make you smarter, but it might gain you access to information and opportunities to exploit the advantage of a superior bargaining position. However, will you use that opportunity to better yourself and your surroundings or just exploit the advantage until someone better positioned exploits you? Is money important? Depends on whether you think you have enough to satisfy your needs in the given moment. Of course, you might better focus on finding other ways to see your needs met and make the question superfluous. Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Money is important for one simple reason: Society agrees that it's important and that it has value. As long as there has been specialization of skills, there has been a need for barter. If a person was better than others at making arrows, it made sense to give that person meat in exchange for arrows, and for that person to make arrows instead of hunting. It also would have made sense to accumulate arrow heads to trade with other tribes in times of need, etc. Thus it would have made a good currency, as long as there was no other specialization.  With more specialization, there was the need for open markets, and it was a matter of determining how much of one commodity was worth trading for another. Some would have been common enough that they were good for barter in general. Everybody could use a chicken but not everybody could use an extra spoon. So saving up spoons wouldn't have been a great idea, but when trading things that were less widely needed, it would have made sense to trade them for things that were widely needed and trade those for things that were more specific.  As time went on, precious metals met that need. Gold and silver were of limited supply, and thus could have a relatively fixed value. The laws of supply and demand could then dictate whether one person was willing to give more corn than the next farmer for the same amount of silver. Gold and silver were things anybody could use since they were universally accepted for trade. Thus they were a de facto currency.  Paper money is a more recent invention. Through most of the 20th century, the same \"money\" that we use today in the US, meaning bills of the same size with portraits of the same people, were issued by the Federal Reserve (among others), which agreed to \"pay to the bearer on demand,\" a sum of gold or silver.  In the later part of the 20th century, we were told that the paper WAS the money. Had people not been used to the idea of trading these pieces of paper for goods, it would have been hard to convince anybody to give somebody a house for a stack of papers with specific pictures and words on them. But unless society was willing to stand up and point out that the Emperor has no clothes, we continue to accept it. Since those days, we had another shift where we accepted numbers printed on a piece of paper. Employers would give \"pay stubs\" saying that there was a direct deposit, and banks would send statements reflecting an equivalent change in balance. People would show somebody a plastic card, the paper they got in the mail would show the numbers representing the purchase, numbers would change on checking account statements and credit card statements, and we all accepted that there was \"money\" somewhere, which itself was more paper. These days, those printed numbers often come down to ones we see on computer screens. I can put a bunch of numbers in this post and they mean nothing, but if your bank does it, it means you have \"money.\" If you buy something on line, you don't really need the piece of plastic, as long as you know the numbers that are on it. You trade those numbers for other things. With real property, you have tangible assets. With stock, you own portions of companies, and the paper represents a statement of ownership. But with \"money,\" we take it on faith that others will accept the notion that government printed paper exists somewhere, and numbers we see on our computer screens represent it. If we decide that it's nothing but numbers, and the paper is something that might help make a moderate fire, then the whole thing falls apart. But if we accept it, we have something of tangible value that is universally accepted, and the laws of supply and demand let us determine what things are worth relative to each other. Money gives us the means to make those exchanges, and that includes the ability to exchange effort for goods. ",

I believe I will stay that way forever I believe but money is a funny thing. Don\u2019t judge me for saying this but Money is the most important thing in life. Let\u2019s face it. We all work for money. People say that character is important, peace is important and so many other things. Let me list a few ironies God is supposed to be loving. While there is a long queue to worship him in religious places, there is also a paid queue which is considerable shorter and gives people quick access. If even God is swayed by money, what are mortals.A politician was convicted of a scam. He/She was found guilty in court and sentenced. He/She waited in jail for a few weeks, paid and got bail. He/She owns news channels, intimidates people with money, buys people with money and the society sings praise of the said person. Surprisingly, this applies to several politicians in the world.Who is the most successful man in the world? How many of you think of people who are not rich? I rest my case.Even an actor who tells you that money is not everything in an advertisement gets money for doing that commercialI once remember writing a short story where I call money as the \u201cone single truth\u201d and \u201csingularity\u201d. I\u2019ve not seen God but I have seen the power of money. Money is both a master and servant to man. Money is what drives man. Maybe it is the only omnipresent thing. I saw this quote by Krishna Kumar Joshi below and it was apt \u201cMoney is not everything in life, but make sure that you have enough before you think of such nonsense.\u201d Without money, nobody even takes you seriously. Money is a drug. You never have enough of it. Very few people do. Money is the thing that makes you break every barrier. How is progress measured in work? Appraisal. What is appraisal? Designation, power and in the end \u2026 More money This was an epic scene and the brutal truth  We have the example of several noble people who lived great lives but poor ones. They died penniless and stayed in the hearts of people but they did die poor. Exceptions like Gandhi, Mandela, Mother Teresa and so on may you think twice about money. They show you that other things are important but today, even to help others you need money. That is the brutal truth. The mere mortals need money and that is the truth. So, yes. Money is the thing that matters most in life ",

            "answer_text": "Money! The way I see it, money has three roles at both the personal and at overall society/civilisation level: Medium, Measure, Motivator. Let's look at each one of these and determine if money is a necessary construct. Medium: we need to use a common denominator to exchange things that we have a surplus of with the things that we want. We earn wages or produce goods ourselves and we need to exchange these into food, heat, energy, clothes, house etc. That's where money comes in. Without a common denominator, the economy will not function in an efficient manner, like it was during barter system days.Now the question is, how much does one need to buy stuff, or in other words, does having more money to exchange with the goods that one can buy translates directly into more satisfaction or happiness. There was a study I read some time ago by either Harvard or another similar institution that money does buy happiness, but only to a certain amount. I think the figure was around USD 75,000 per year for an average family in the US, where the amount of money was directly proportional to happiness in life, but it flatlined post that.I think this means that money is important as a medium of exchange till one achieves the basic standard of life and can afford the necessities, but beyond that it is not important. Of course, there are people who would want to live a much more lavish lifestyle than 75k can buy, but that is more to do with personal coding and is a complex issue in itself.Measure: the second function money has is a measure. It is often a measure of value in the current human society which primarily is economics driven. I know my last statement is open to discussion, that our society is economics driven, but I believe there is a fair amount of truth in that. Money being the common denominator serves this purpose very well. Whether it is the relative success of a company, a country, a society or a person, it can be measured via the economic contribution. Again people will say how is the economic contribution a good measure or the only measure. I agree that it is not the only measure of a cause or action in the society, however, money does serve as a measure at a vast majority of places and even the most obscure things like political ideologies or liberal views can be translated into economic or monetary measure. The abolition of racial tensions directly leads to better earnings and lifestyle for the minorities and money helps us measure that.Motivator: money can be a great motivator. It follows from its role as a medium or measure. I worked in my life initially to earn so that I could pay for a comfortable life. Then I worked so that I could earn more than my peers- simply because money was a measure of how well I was performing compared to them. Now I work towards an idea that will hopefully turn into a society changing endeavour and the commercial success is a great motivator. Again, I do not say that money can be the only motivator, but it is a great motivator as a measure of my capability to bring changes that I want to.Hence, if you ask me, I would say that money is a useful construct for the society. Is it a necessary construct? That is debatable. It is necessary for current society, for sure. Will we have a society one day where money is not a necessary construct? I think so. If we have gotten to a stage where scientific and technological innovations have brought such abundance of food, shelter and other necessities that there is no competition for them, then all we will work for is pure knowledge or pleasure or social standing. Then money may have lost its purpose. Ideas and value added by a person could be measured in a different way. Even further, we could get to a stage where we as a species would have transcended the material needs and only concern ourselves with the spiritual needs and peace within our own consciousness, and in that state money will be utterly useless.

            "answer_text": "Dear Friend, How much money does one require to simply live? And how much is the money people are chasing? Are they chasing it for just the basic needs of physical survival? For the insecure mind, work and money are cheap substitutes for the real essence of life. When there is absence of self-awareness, then getting respect from others becomes important. Money hides our inner hollowness. Money is a substitute for love and freedom. When life is loveless, then accumulating money becomes important.  And that is why people work. Not for bread. Simple bread is so simple to earn. To maintain the false self, money and designation and brand are desperately needed. So, people tolerate all kinds of nonsensical works, of which there are plenty. Keynes, the great economist, had said in the first half of the last century that soon the population of the world will need to work only very little, because of improved productivity of machines. Instead we find that we are being pushed to work more and more. A survey says that most jobs in economy today are not productive at all and they actually need not exist. Man goes on slogging and missing the relaxed joy of life. Not for his needs but for his pitiable greed. And to maintain his job and his greed and his foolish sense of security, he will tolerate all nonsense for six days a week. And then, he will party on the seventh day to forget his hell. Soon enough, comes another Monday. Your basic needs are quite small. You will get the money for that, don\u2019t worry. Existence is not that cruel. Existence is not so cruel that you will starve without money. Your fundamental needs are just food, clothing, shelter and you will get enough money for that. There is no great problem in that. You do not require money for your fundamental needs.  Do you know why people need money? People need money because they are hollow within, and they think that money can fill that hollow. Money cannot fill that hollow.  The amount of money that is needed to just live comfortably is not much. You will get that. Don\u2019t worry :) A lot of content for this answer is coming from my blog \u201cWords into Silence\u201d. You may refer to the blog for a deeper clarity and understanding of life. SB ",

            "answer_text": "There are several things that are important in life, and money is one way of gettimg some of those. As humans, in order to survive we need food, shelter, security, clothing... add some more XXI century items, education, access to internet, social contact, to develop all your potential. So, for basic survival, you either need money or the equivalent resources to get what money offers: land and strength to grow your own food, hunt or fish what you need from the land. If you want to go further and learn, interact and live a connected XXI century life, I think it becomes harder to make that happen without money. Now, that doesn't mean money is an end on itself, it is a way of getting things to enable your self fulfillment.  Picture this: you live in an empty building and you are living OK in the first floor.  Then you think that by getting to the second floor you may have a nicer view, and you try to climb there, but there are no stairs to do so.  Think of money like a ladder that will take you to the second floor and provide you with a better view.  Once in the second floor, you either feel great and rest or you try to climb to another floor to see if it is nicer.  Then you need a second ladder.  You may become obsessed about getting more ladders, and, like some people, stay in the first floor and accumulate ladders (which obviously makes no sense).  You may also become obsessed with climbing up, so that you never enjoy the floor you live in, and which may be perfect for you. In summary, money is important as long as it helps you survive and grow.  But besides that, what is important is how you manage to be happy. ",

But when you are lacking money you have to face taunts behind your back and on face too. Let me tell you a incident of my life. My father doesn\u2019t have their own house at the time of marriage of my parents but my Mother thinks and believe that soon they will make their own one house so they will not have to live in rented house. But things got worst and father and my paternal grandmother didn\u2019t like my mother at all because I (a first girl child) was born. And my Mother had live with my father 20 years with all physical and mental abuse. My mother always thinks about our future and cried day and night. Finally My father separated from my mother when I was 21 Years old. Now I am 25 years old having job. My mother is also in job and doing well with her life. She is taking care of us very well. And you know what we have bought a house also now and she is super happy now. Money Importance: Then: Nobody will ever come to my house. Now: Everyone wants to come and meet my MOM. Then: Nobody greets my MOM with respect Now: Every relative wants to listen my MOM\u2019s Opinion on the topic. Then: Taunts from relative about being selfish and careless nature towards my father. Now: Everyone praising for the step she taken at that time without any taunts. Then: Taunts about having no home and living in a rented house for years. Now: Want to celebrate every happiness in our house. Then: My mother\u2019s face is always full of sadness and hopelessness. Now: She is super excited and full of energy all the time and We always cheer her up whenever we see a little sadness on her face. Thanks for reading guys. :):) ",

            "answer_text": " Money is a means to an end. It is one of the most straight-forward gateways to get what you want, but is often not necessary. Money simply has an end most people do not think about. What would happen if you were to consistently generate more and more income? How much would it truly take for you to purchase everything you wanted? If you had the big house with 3 swimming pools, the private jet, the luxury cars, if you could travel wherever, whenever, and bought some incredibly nice things, what would be left to spend your money on? Truly consider this. No matter how much money you make, eventually you will run out of things to do with it. That is why a lot of extremely rich people become depressed or start becoming extremely charitable, because the money does not matter at that point anymore. Sure, you can always make more, but what will you do with all of that? That being said, up until that point, money can open a lot of doors; just know that it is not everything. Rich, poor, or average income, people can be happy, successful, fulfilled, feel confident, self-doubt or sadness, they can be the nicest people in the world or the worst. Money is not a defining factor for any of it, else they would not be spread so widely. That does not mean that money holds no value at all. If you are so stressed about your finances you drive yourself to depression or apathy it\u2019s not good either. Money can solve a lot of problems, but it does not make or break anything, just like most things don\u2019t. So\u2026 is it important? The answer to that is Yes and No. ",

And a young woman who had nothing from nothing sell things she did not have using only her own willpower, enthusiasm and imagination shared to others who was never afraid to fail and as such did not even notice when she did. The young woman became successful and money followed. The young man is still today searching for an idea that is truly his own. Of course, if you have both money and will power things can be easier! Of course, if you observe someone from the outside with money it may look like things are easier for them. But no, money is not important for your FIRST success. In fact, I would say money before your first success can be a big hindrance. Small steps, keep moving forward, and you can achieve your dreams. ",

            "answer_text": "Money is the backbone of any economy. It is the means of exchange, and in any advanced society will emerge naturally from barter exchange. A standard example to explain why money is important is to look at a situation of a complicated barter exchange. Imagine that you need product Z, but you have product A. You then go to someone and ask them if they can trade you product Z for product A. They say that unfortunately they do not need A, but they do need B, so if you bring them B - they will trade you Z. Unfortunately, the person who has B does not want A, but instead wants C. Person who has C wants D. And maybe only the person who has D will finally trade it for A. You then must take D to trade it for C, take C to trade it for B, then take B and trade it for Z. Such a complicated situation would be simplified if we had some product Y, that would be accepted by anyone, either because they need it or because they know that they can always trade it. Eventually, the value of product Y will be not in its commodity use, but more in its use as means of exchange. And there you have - money. Historically, both silver and gold emerged as money, and then depending on the country, either one or the other was used as the \u201cmain money\u201d. Why were these metals chosen? If we take a look at gold, it has several properties that make it usable as means for exchange. It is rare enoughIt is relatively easy to divide it chemicallyIt does not rust and spoil with timeThis is not a complete list, but it should give the idea. Today we are not trading in gold and most currencies are no longer backed by gold. They are called fiat currencies, or fiat money, which is money that has no intrinsic commodity value, but is instead enforced by government regulation. While a minority of economists think that this is a problem, the vast majority do not believe that a return to gold-based currency is a good idea.

            "answer_text": "One of my friends explained to me that true poverty is more about lack of good relationships than lack of money or income. This sounds profound and it might be, but he also meant it in a very practical sense. Work RelationshipsThe most obvious \"good\" relationship that a person needs to have to escape poverty is a job. Small business owners, meanwhile, need a network of suppliers and customers and other contacts. Employees need good relationships with their bosses, ways to get additional training, health care services, and some co-workers to cooperate with. FriendshipsA person also needs friends and family. When they lose their job or are going through hard times, they may need to save money and live off of the generosity of their closest relationships, at least for a little bit. When a person has a job, friends and family help them remember their responsibilities so they don't lose it. CharityFor people who have lost their jobs, broken their relationships with family (possibly by calling too often for help or destructive behavior), charity organizations like the Red Cross step in and lend a hand. GovernmentLastly, many countries provide local and national services to the poor. The \"Poor\" Rich ManAs a counter-example, he mentioned how quickly extremely wealthy athletes and other millionaires / billionaires often lose their money after they stop getting paid. The problem wasn't money. They probably had more than enough to last a lifetime or at least get another job. The point is that focusing on money first misses the important issues. That said, there are many people with normal relationships who still need to think about money. BlessingsMoney can be a blessing. Having a lack of money can easily spark ceaseless arguments in a marriage, arguments which have no easy answer. Money gives you freedom to enjoy life and your relationships more fully, without having to panic at every purchase.  In terms of economic theory, money makes it easier to trade with people without having to worry about much more complex problems with barter (How do move and store all this stuff that I've traded for, so that I can get the stuff I really want?). Most people expect and take money as payment, while strategies for living money free are difficult to work out in practice. There are many societal and technological advances that have moved us from having almost every member of a community operating their own farm to almost none of them doing so, and money was an important part of that, as it made the distribution of food much more efficient. This is distinguishing money as currency from money as wealth, which is interesting but probably not what the question was really asking. CursesMoney can also be a curse. It always slips through your fingers much faster than you expect, so having a lot of money might be deceptive. As with all property, money needs to be managed wisely. Managing larger amounts of money seems to be much harder than small amounts, as you need to work much harder to keep it safe and productive. Even if you do not believe that properly managing property is important in a spiritual sense, no one wants to be the billionaire who loses all of their money through their own foolishness. While many people will have sympathy for the poor beggar, no one will have sympathy for the poor man who wasted his money. It is much more difficult to lower your standard of living than to learn to live with a higher income. The rich poor man can always invest his extra money and take more and more control over it as they gain experience and discipline. The poor rich man, however, suddenly has to learn a ton of new disciplines with regard to saving money, which he never had to before because of his wealth.

The 10$ you spend on food item in a grocery store is going to the store clerk who puts the item in place, to the truck driver who transported it, to the farmer who planted it, to the water company who transported water to that farm for irrigation, etc\u2026 There was a research about money and happiness, to answer the question: \u201cDoes having more money make people happy?\u201d. In conclusion, they found that more money correlates with more happiness when a person is making less than 75K $ per annum. But when the income increases more than that, more money does not bring more happiness\u2026. (ref: Money can buy happiness, but only to a point) More recent research found that this might not be the case, except for the US ;) (Money Does Buy Happiness! (We Were Shocked, Too) Ultimately, happiness is an internal emotion created by your perception. Your internal dialog is what creates your emotions. I ask you to challenge that belief: Is money important in your daily life? How much is money important? Is it the most important thing in \u201cyour\u201d daily life? Are there more important things for you than money? I personally believe some money are essential, but not sufficient for my daily life. Other things are required. I believe money is a tool, utility that can be used wisely or in an unwise way. ",

Look at it this way: Would you be happier with $1M but dead in 1 year?Would you be happier with millions but with poor health?Would you happier with loads of money but all your family to die or stop seeing youOf course not. Moreover, spending money on pointless material things doesn\u2019t make most people happy beyond a certain level. Now sure, it is true, if you are poor living in a poor country, the extra income makes a huge difference. If you can only afford to eat rice, and suddenly you can afford to eat a more varied diet, that will probably improve your happiness , health and mood as a well-balanced diet is connected to mood. But in the developed world, beyond $50,000-$60,000 a year, money doesn\u2019t change your quality of life too much. If you earn more, you just go to different places. Somebody on 60K can still go on holiday, can still go to the bar. They just won't be able to regularly buy luxury goods. However, what money can buy, beyond materialism, is: Time Time for their businessTime with family2. Choice  The choice to carry on working or stopThe choice to work part-time or study full-time again as you don't need the income.3. Linked to point 2, the choice to not over consume and instead use income for wealth and financial freedom  People who don't use money in this way, even high-income people, often need to work in their 70s.4. The opportunity to try and fail  Some people, especially those with no wealth who have families and mortgages, can't take many risks.5. Travel and live overseas  Money and wealth gives you the option of passive income, and the ability to open your mind.So yes, money is important, although it shouldn't come before your health and wellbeing. Curiously, some things are good for both your health and your wealth, like giving up smoking, drugs and alcohol. Do you want to be financially free online? ",

            "answer_text": "Of course, money is important but only to certain extent. What do I mean by this? Take a homeless guy in the street for example. Common perception is to judge completely of having such critique such as he\u2019s healthy. He\u2019s got both arms and legs - he\u2019s able to work but he doesn\u2019t. Or maybe he\u2019s brought this upon himself. Or he will just use the money for alcohol, drugs. etc and of course there is an element of truth in this. There are other reasons too. But I refuse to believe this. Sure, he might have made some bad choices that may have resulted in this life. However every situation has a reason just like the consequence. Every person has a story - let\u2019s say this old man you are used to seeing in the streets. His wife had passed away as well as his kids in a car accident 30 years ago and has been suffering since. Once a vibrant, loving and hardworking family man who married his high school sweetheart who had promised her the rest of their lives to live and raise their beautiful two children up. Or that this woman had turned to alcohol and drugs because of her son who died in action. Once a loving, sweet lady whose husband passed away due to a stroke shortly after her son. Her only son too. I can go on. I\u2019ve met and talked to few. Veterans. Chefs. Alcoholic - one even admitted to me straight up. You name it. This is much more than just something money could fix. It\u2019s an emptiness - something a regular folk wouldn\u2019t be able to understand. We need to help those who are in need and not look at it as a burden of the society. Only human interaction could do this I feel but then again, we are complex. Life is complex. So many barriers to even go through to get their trust so they can open up to RIGHT people. By giving them money, it is not going to solve anything so really, what use is money? Money is nothing special. stop treating like it can actually help people. Like my parents say \u2018it comes and go\u2019 - your family. The people who you consider the most important, the memories you make. Your happiness and how you want to spend your life while we have it. These are some of the things we take for granted everyday. Everyday is a blessing in disguise but unfortunately, certain situations are inevitable. It is bound to happen therefore we must find ways to help such people in need that are living recklessly, dying unnecessarily. Mental health is only recently been talked about with such openness but we really need to get the message there and actually do something about it. We must find more ways to help. This is where I am focusing with my life. Us humans can do extraordinary things but only if we have a strong mental health. Correct mindset. And I swear to god, this is the only difference between us mere mortals to those who have been ahead in life than someone who hasn\u2019t. We need to understand that money cannot fix us. It cannot complete us. See, I view it as life itself being much bigger than money and having the sense of duty to live life well and serve others. Help others. To actually help people, we must do everything we can so they can get back on track of living a life. A strong mental health or\u2026it could be anything. After all, what are we all really without money? or even with money itself? nothing- just the difference of situations maybe which is the truth. Where in life, such uncertainty could happen to anyone. Where we know so much about ourselves, the universe but then again we really don\u2019t know anything. What are we really doing here? no one knows what the hell we are doing. No idea how a human being can obtain if that\u2019s the right word that get cruel diseases. Are we chosen? still haven\u2019t found such treatment for cancer. It is all a mystery. I could go on. In grand scheme of things, we are clueless if you actually think about it. So next time you see someone in the street, instead of being afraid and trying to avoid them. Strike up a conversation with them. You are bound to learn something, trust me. That\u2019s what this man did to me and he showed me more decency than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. If anything, he said he felt happy everyday but I knew he needed some help. What\u2019s more? He didn\u2019t ask a dime off me. We just shared a great moment - Thanks Phil. You\u2019re a top geezer like you said in your own words. So we ask ourselves, is money even really important? We made money. Created money. Before money, humans still existed. We can live without money. In this sense, money is nothing. It\u2019s important but not the important. *God forbid those things I\u2019ve used as an example to anyone above. ",

Consider this\u2026 if you were told you had days to live, or perhaps were on your deathbed, what would you wish you could have had, done,been, etc.? Is money on the top of your list? For most, the answer may be time - many wish they had more time, or had done the things they\u2019ve always wanted to do, \u2026 Money isn\u2019t the most important, but if you had more of it, you could likely do more of the things that ARE important: Spend more time with loved ones, friends, family, etc. How many people could work less if they had more money, thereby giving more of their time and attention to children or aging parents. Given more to charities and things that were close to the heart Provided more opportunities to children, dug water wells in Africa, helped homeless people in your hometown. Sure, we can do these things now without a lot of money, \u2026 but imagine what you could do with abundant resources. Luke 12:48 says this \u201cFrom everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.\u201d Personally, I walked away from a 6 figure income to have more time with my aging mother and young daughter and it was worth EVERY penny lost. (got 5 more years of my mothers life, being there for her daily) More money would have helped tremendously, but money was NOT the driving factor for the decision to walk away from my job and figure out how to make it on less. I will never regret making that decision :) Hope that makes sense. Blessings, ",

If it stops flowing to you, you can count on this very fact that you\u2019re going to be in deep trouble. You become so limited when it comes to paying your bills, stuck in situations like location where you live, not being able to pay your debt off, your student loans, limited on food you can buy, the style of clothes, the experiences to travel, the days where you can help a member of your family get a piece of cake in life; and most of all, putting food on table for you and your family. It is very important because it allows you a lot more freedom with resources, you can leverage to do things, it can help you achieve your dreams buy hiring the best team, best tools, best resources, open contacts and door ways for you to speed up the process of success. If your income is lower than your outgoing, you\u2019ll always be poor, working your ass off but if you learn to make your income higher than your outgoing and it grows without you with different assets, residual income, you\u2019re not going to worry about money. Poor is not something to talk positive about or glamourise. If you\u2019ve been poor you\u2019d know how stuipid it is when someone says to you, \u201cmoney is not important.\u201d You know how stuck it made you feel and become when you didn\u2019t have any. You\u2019ve seen how people judged you with where you live, with your poor teeth you have no money to fix, where you couldn\u2019t afford health insurance, the clothes you wear, how you are poor. People judge you. People do not respect you. People assume a lot of things about you because of how money plays an important role in the social world and social heirachy, and they can see and know you\u2019re not even on first step of that ladder. Money can be a powerful tool to leverage, to change your life, to gain a lot more respect from society and yes, it can also attract people you want, business deals, other deals and even people you\u2019re attracted to because you show you got the ability of knowing how this world really works. Money may not be everything but it\u2019s like breathing. Moment it stops flowing to you, is can count on hard times is coming. Don\u2019t mix money with \u201cvalues\u201d like belief.

If you have enough saved up and you've paid off all your bills for the month, spend as appropriate i.e on you, family, friends and equal contribution to society as well. I've seen money destroy families, so I'm living my life where my happiness and focus doesn't revolve around money. It's a waste of time and life to be worried about such a thing.

            "answer_text": " I cannot possibly explain the importance of money without showing you my thought process\u2026 Firstly, how you attain the money is important. To borrow a cliche - The journey is more important than the destination. How I Got the Money Firstly, I will think about how I managed to get this large sum of money - is it an accumulation throughout the years or is it a one-time surprise? Is it easy for me to earn my next million, or the chances are as slim as the next smartphone? The reasoning behind this increment in my finances will play a huge part in how important it is. Yes, the value of my efforts will affect the value of the money.Secondly, what can money do? Re-Investment Perhaps one good way to manage the sum of money, is to re-invest in what it had brought you that fortune? For instance, the business, investments, yes. Gambling, lottery, no. After such allocation, then I will take a fraction of the remaining sum to give back to my supporters. I will give a portion to my family and friends in 2 ways - one as a form of treat, the other as cold, hard cash. The question is, how much? This brings us to the third step.Context How old am I? Do I have my own family, kids? What are things between my family and friends different from now? Does anyone I know have any debts? Do I have to pay off any liabilities? After keying in this factor, then perhaps I will be settling the financial obligations first or stashed a larger amount to giving back to my family.Finally, after I have considered the above, the remaining will be what I can afford to spend on myself. Since you can already tell that I think too much sometimes, you probably would have anticipated the rest of the answers to be in lists as well. And you\u2019re right. Planning for my future self This depends again, at the age of which I got the sum of money. For instance, perhaps now I would want to take an MBA, but have put it aside because of financial woes. Perhaps when I\u2019m 50, I want to plant a herb garden, or go overseas for volunteer work. Things like these that require financial assistance requires some planning as well.Doing things for my past self Things that I wanted to do when I was young, but never got the chance to. I guess you can say now that I am chasing my childhood dreams, such as going for music lessons. And I want to change my wardrobe. I don\u2019t mean the clothes inside, but the actual cupboard, which was passed down to me from others. I never found the need to change it, and because of that I feel that my room is a little incomplete.Present self Materials I can buy to feel good. I don\u2019t usually buy a lot of things, but I want to get a new pair of sneakers. And perhaps a car, for my ease of transport. Maybe more ice cream. A gym membership? The list never ends though sometimes, materials are overrated. Plus, they come with other \u2018side-effects\u2019 that you have to deal with, such as buying a $5000 pair of shoes will make you more worried in dirtying it.All in all, I try to reduce decision making in my life, especially high involvement ones. More importantly, I don\u2019t think I have a lot of time to either i) shop for the things I want or ii) spend time using the things I bought. So is money important? Yes because it is a powerful tool that we can use to buy time and to make other people happy. Is it the most important? Like an equation that has many variables, for example, A + B + C + D = E + F + G + H I don\u2019t think any of the variables ABCD are more important than any other. By extension, it is not the most important. It depends on your dependence on it, and if you cannot rid yourself of this reliance, then perhaps you need to attain a minimum amount of wealth before other things get more important. (like the limiting factor in an equation, you know) Just be careful not to get too absorbed into it. :) ",

            "answer_text": "From Austin Middleton's answer to How does a monetary system work, in layman's terms? What is money's purpose in exchange? Money helps solve the mutual coincidence of wants problem.  Consider a world with three people: Alan, Brian, and Carl. Alan grows asparagus, Brian broccoli, Carl carrots. They each only produce one crop, but they would prefer to eat a variety of foods.  The thing is, they like things in different degrees. Alan likes Brian's broccoli, Brian likes Carl's carrots, and Carl likes Alan's asparagus. There's no pairwise trade to be made.  Alan wants to give Brian some asparagus in exchange for his broccoli, but Brian doesn't want asparagus: he wants carrots.Similarly, Brian wants to give Carl some broccoli in exchange for carrots, but Carl doesn't want broccoli, he wants asparagus.Same for Carl and Alan.Furthermore, even if they were all able to get together and do a three-way-swap, they'd have to all have the precise amounts of their own good relative to the others to enable that swap. Maybe Alan only has two bundles of asparagus when Carl would only accept three bundles to convince him to give his carrots to Brian. Add to that the fact that all three crops would have to ripen at the same time to ensure you get what you \"paid\" for, and you've made a clearly beneficial trade between the three much less likely to happen. Money solves this problem by enabling pairwise trades to happen more frequently, more easily, in the gradients that people want. Instead of Brian having to find Alan to acquire asparagus to trade for carrots with Carl, he simply offers Carl money in exchange for his carrots. Why would Carl accept this money? Because he believes that Alan will accept that self-same money in exchange for asparagus next week when it finally ripens.  So money enables exchanges of goods and services between multiple people that would be much more difficult, if not impossible, without it. If that's money, then what is a money system? Once you have a money, a good which best enables complicated transactions of goods and services between people, you produce prices. Asparagus for $2, broccoli for $4, etc. The essential characteristic of prices is their relative price: broccoli sells for twice as much as asparagus. Or, when you purchase one stalk of broccoli, you necessarily forsake the purchase of two bundles of asparagus. These relative prices can give you an idea about what people value; and if you know what other people value, then you are better equipped to tailor your own production decisions to ensure that others will exchange their money for your product. Why care about that? Because if you make something other people want, then you'll be able to convert your single product into that variety of things you desire. Just like how Alan's asparagus farm allows him to eat not simply asparagus, but broccoli and carrots as well.  Relative prices change because preferences over consumption goods changes. 10 years ago I had no idea what I was missing because I didn't eat avocados; now I love the little green taste-pods. When I purchase avocados I signal to the grocer that avocados are valuable; they then desire to stock more, so they make a larger order at the avocado farm; the farm receives more orders, so they enlarge the acreage they devote to growing avocados. If, heaven forbid, I develop an avocado allergy and stop buying them from my grocer, the reverse happens.

            "answer_text": "This is a very personal question. Some people regard money as a scoring system, always seeking to earn more and build more wealth. They measure their success by how much money the have control over. So money is a primary motivation for them. To them it\u2019s very important. Other people have different goals, like experience goals. For example, learning to fly, flying your own airplane on an adventure junket to Alaska, learning to sail, sailing your own boat across the Atlantic, operating a mission in a needy area of the world. For them, money is a means to an end, so it\u2019s not important in itself, but it\u2019s important to have enough to achieve your goals, but more than enough isn\u2019t important. I\u2019m more the latter. I\u2019m an accomplishment and experience junkie. In my life I\u2019ve treaded a somewhat peculiar path of making enough to fund my passions, but always making sure that making money didn\u2019t consume so much of my time and attention that I wasn\u2019t able to pursue those passions. So I guess, in answering your question, I would say \u201cNo\u201d, money isn\u2019t the most important thing, your passions are. Pursue your passions - they will feed your soul. ",

            "answer_text": "Importance of money in our life  Money is not everything in life but it is true that money can buy lots of things. It goes without saying that all services and products are quantified in terms of green bucks. After the barter trade went out of fashion, money has taken its place and made transactions simple for the people. In short, it has become part and parcel of our lives. How money plays an important role in our daily life? Medical facilities: People get quality medical care only when they are able to pay for the services in terms of credit card or cash. If they do not have money, they can only dream of going to the doctor and get medicinal treatment. It is required to meet the charges of the doctor and cost of medicinal manufacturing. Money can definitely buy happiness: People with money can buy homes and vehicles of their choice. They can rule the roost in the materialistic world. If they are able to fulfil the wishes, individuals would not feel jealous of others. They are happy and contended as money can fund their lavish style of living. Symbol of authority: Money generates power and authority which every woman loves. It works like an aphrodisiac that would cement the bond between the couples. Since money is in abundance, spouses do not fight with each other and live a wonderful life. They can afford to engage in the activity of their interest no matter how expensive it is. Barometer of success: No matter what people say, money is still the barometer of success. Individuals who have got a huge bank balance and live a flashy lifestyle. Skill courage, appearance, personality, power, and prestige are the parameters to judge a person and they can only be achieved with the help of money in life. Fit life: A fit and healthy life is not possible if you are a pauper. People who have to regularly worry about daily bread and butter cannot concentrate on developing a fitness regime for themselves. If you are flush with cash, it is possible to join the gym of choice and undergo training under the supervision of experienced instructors.People looking to develop their physique should have ample money to buy supplements as they are expensive. In addition, developing the personality also requires the magic bucks. Clothes that define the appearance of the person can only be purchased with money. Money defines relationships: It is sad but true fact that majority of relationships in the world is based on the flow of money not only in professional but also in personal space. As a person, you should stay clear of the buddies who are financial parasites. They can make you pauper by the time you realise what is happening. Avoid relationship with girls who are only after your money and treat you as their sugar daddy. A true friend will never allow you to waste money on unnecessary expenditure especially on his or her comfort. Learn to save hard earned wealth and invest intelligently in leading a happy and healthy life in the future. ",

Or did you mean to focus on \u201cHow linked to money is your own personal happiness?\u201d - that\u2019s a better question\u2026 At a personal level, having ample money gives security.

            "answer_text": "To me money is only a tool. It is like the hammer for the carpenter or the kitchenknife for the cook. If the carpenter use his hammer in the wrong way, he will not succeed. If the cook does not use his kitchenknife to cut the vegetables, he can not produce a enjoyable meal. But if bove craftmen uses there tools as craftmen should do, they can create buteful things that enjoy people who needs those things. The same with money. Use it in the wrong way and you will not enjoy it completely. And be a scroog and you will not enjoy it totally. On top of that, it is an art to find a balance between enjoying live right now and preparing the future. This is as far as my direct answer to your question goes. Here under I give you my system of handling money. But you do not need to read it, if you do not want to. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The answers have been written for other topics. You have to \u201ctranslate\u201d it to your question. Not everything is meant for your question. Do yourself a favor, read until the end. \u201cHow do I start?\u201d 1. Take care of your physical and psychological health in the first place!! This remark has nothing to do with your question, but is inspired by the fact that health is more important than money. 2. First things first. When your money arrives in your account, you FIRST save money (10%), SECOND reduce debt (10%) and THIRD spend money. Otherwise you will find out that there will be almost never money left to save. Then \u201cforget\u201d (as a matter of speaking) that you have saved. 3. What one have to learn about money is that it is just a tool that need to be used in the proper way. A key is a tool to open the lock that keeps the door shut. Throw it through the window and you will not be able to open the right door, take the right care for it and you will be able to. Money is like the crop of a farmer. 10% of the crop is the basis of the crop of the next year. The rest is to make a living off. The farmer lives for his crop, because his crop gives life to so many people, not for the crop itself, but for what it does to himself and many people. The same with money. A scrooge goes for the money for no other reason than the money. A hard working person goes for the money, because it means a living. 4. Another piece of advice I always give is to buy 1 ounce of PHYSICAL silver each month and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easily sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your own retirement capital, even if it is a relatively small sum of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 months and you should have 240 ounces of physical silver. One ounce of silver costs now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 months, because you started too late with that idea. 5. Choose also one note or coin, that you never spend when it comes into your hands by accident and in an honest way. \u201cMy coins\u201d are pieces of \u20ac1 and \u20ac2. Put them in a jar and \u201cforget\u201d them for a long period of time. 6. Debt and alcohol works in the same way. Use both with moderation and you have pleasure. Enjoy too much and you have problems. Get addicted and you are in real trouble.. 7. Cut up your credit card and use a debit card instead. As far as I can know it is not that simple in the USA because of the laws about improper charges and fraud. 8. Avoid advertising. What ever they told you, the only purpose of advertising is to seduce you to spend your money on their stuff that you nine out of ten do not need anyway. I have a television that can stop and delay the broadcast. I stop at the beginning of the advertising and 7 minutes later I wind fast forward. Window shopping is also a form of advertising 9. 80% of all problems are caused by 20% of reasons. So if you can find out those 20% reasons that make you spend 80% of all your money, it makes easier for you to reduce your expenses. 10. Avoid bars, restaurants and paid entertainment. 11. A penny saved is a penny earned. Many, if not most spending vs. saving decisions occur in the small moments of life, at the pennies level. 12. Create a mantra in the sense of: \u201cFinancial succesful people save 10% of there income, are debt poor and enjoy live with the rest of there income.\u201d Say this a thousend times to yourself every day and after many months your unconscious will believe this mantra and start help you to make come true that mantra. Do say \u201cSuccesful people do \u2026\u201d, not \u201cI have to do \u2026\u201d because the latter give to much resistance of your unconscious. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- If you think only in terms of saving money, this could happen to your money. In the 1970\u2019s there was a soap that was called \u201cthe six million dollar man\u201d. It was a astronaut that had a terrible accident, but with the help of advanced technology and loads of money, he was rebuild and changed in a superstrong man that worked for the government. What I want to say is that six million dollar was in those days an astronomic high number, a bit like six billion is today. Now it is \u201cjust\u201d a big number. Inflation can \u201ceat\u201d away your purchasing power. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 My way of paying of debt is the 1%-method. I advise you to use 10% of your income for debt repayment. However one want to feel a result almost directly after pay off a sum of money. This is the way one can do it. month 1: $1000 debt. Pay off 1% or $10. month 2 : $990 debt. Pay off 1% or $9.90. month 3: $980.10 debt. Pay off 1% or 9.80 month 4: $970.3 debt. Pay off 1% or 9.7 and your new debt amount is $960.6 Now you will \u201cfeel\u201d your effort of paying off debt two ways. You pay back every month a little less and you pay less interest every month. You can play with that 1%-roule. You can make it 5% every month or 0.5%. I gave you an example of what is possible. But make sure that every month the debt is smaller than the month before with at least the percentage you have chosen. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cHow to invest?\u201d There are two ways. Rental real estate and a combination from precious metals and stocks.Real Estate: Buy a small house or a garage with morgage. Rent it to someone (a garage ask less maintenance) Pay off the morgage with the rent and sell it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When playing the game Monopoly there is almost always a player who chooses to stay on his money in the beginning. At first it seems like a nice strategy. Every time when 'Start' is passed, this player sees his capital grow. This strategy goes well until others start buying houses and hotels. All of a sudden, rent must be paid everywhere. For the player who stayed on his money, the inevitable bankruptcy does not follow much later. In real life it is not entirely true that a person ultimately owns everything, and all others do nothing at all. But in real life too it is true that those who invest their money in assets that raise money themselves (shares for example) are ultimately far better off than those who stay on their money and do not invest. How do you win? How do you win with Monopoly? Buy as many properties as possible. And preferably the orange and red streets because they have the highest expected return. Well considered are the value shares of the Monopoly game! And nice to know: the very most expensive streets - Kalverstraat and Leidschestraat - do not turn out to be such attractive streets to buy. Compare them with the most beloved shares of the moment, the expected return is actually not good at all. The game Monopoly can not be compared completely to real life, of course. But in real life there is certainly a strategy to become rich: 1) Always live below your means, so that there is money to invest; 2) Invest the saved money in assets that raise money yourself. As with Monopoly, it is virtually impossible in real life to save yourself richly. In contrary, it is virtually impossible not to become rich when, for a few decades, both items are held above. A significant shorter period is often sufficient to become 'just' financially independent ... \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Read the books \u201cFail-Safe Investing, lifelong Financial Safety in 30 Minutes\u201d by Harry Browne and \"The Permanent Portfolio\u201d Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy\". Basic principle is 25% of your savings goes to stock 25% of your savings goes to Commodity (precious metals) 25% of your savings goes to bonds 25% of your savings goes to cash Every year you have to rebalance, so that your principle stays at 25% each. Let us say that your stock-portfolio is only 20% of your portfolio and cash is 30% you take cash and buy stocks, so you have again 25% - 25% For stocks I use always the same system: The rest of the answer I have written for other topics and is \u201ccopy-paste\u201d. So you have to \u201ctranslate\u201d it to your question. The most important lesson you will have to learn is that time will be your only friend in the stock market. Do not turn your back to your only friend by getting impatient. Stay away from pennystocks or, if you buy a pennystock, act as if you buy a lot from the lottery. Your money is lost in 99.9% of the cases. You will have to learn many lessons and that could hurt you a lot. Over the years I have developed a technique of investing that makes that pain small enough to stay in the stock market for the rest of your live. I will tell you that technique. For everything that can lose all its value, I invest no more than $500. I bought recently a stock for $150 including all costs. When the price go down, I will never sell. I do not take losses, until that stock goes to zero. If the price goes up, 10% or 15%, I will sell 90% of my stocks and keep 10% of the stocks as free stocks. Example : I bought 450 Lightwave Logic for \u20ac473 (I live in Belgium and I give you examples of what I actual did, so the price is in euro) after transaction costs. I did that in October 2012. I did not receive dividend. Until 2017 the price stayed under my buying price. In May 2017 I sold 340 stocks and received \u20ac435 on my bank account. So I have 115 stocks left for \u20ac38 or close to zero. For precious methals I have two methods. First of all I buy the stock CEF. That is the only stock I know that represent PHYSICAL gold and silver Secondly: Another advice I always give is to buy each month 1 ounce of PHYSICAL silver and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easily sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your own retirement capital, even if it is a relatively small sum of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 month and you should have 240 ounces of physical silver. One ounce of silver cost now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 month, because you start to late with that idea. Make it for my part 10 ounces of silver per month you have lived or 1 or more ounce gold. I give you the principle technique I use myself. For bonds I would prefer funding circles or an other crowd LENDING firm. I invest every month \u20ac100 in one loan of the category A and B. I never go for category C and higher because they are too risky. You should make it a priority not to lose money on those loans, so you should choose for the safe category as well. Go for many loans, so your risk will be less. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 About the price of silver I can say, that I made a study that anybody can make for oneself and I can asure you that in the long run the changes on profit are bigger than the changes on loss. I pretend to buy every year 12 onces of silver at the end of the year (to make it more visual understandable). I pretend to start in 1979, because silver hit a price of $50 to drop with 90% a few years later and to never hit the price of $50 again for the next 30 years or so. Will there be profit, yes or no? From 1979 until 1999 I use USD ($). Later on I use EUR (\u20ac) Up to you to use your currency or to pretend that \u20ac1 equals $1. This will not infuence the overall result of the study.   Even in this exceptionally bad situation one hits finally profits. One should not be too worried about the value of ones silver investment in the long run if one buy every month 1 or more ounce(s) of silver. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- This is an investment idea. It came up very recently. In Europe governments are convinced everything has to go electric in the future. No more gas to burn, no more cars on gasoline and so long. That means a lot of copper for electricity wire. However, the worldwide production capacity is way to low and it takes years to increase that capacity to fulfill future demands of copper. That means that the price of copper should soar. However, nobody can predict the future, so nobody can say for sure that the prediction is right and that the price of copper will rise huge. If you have hands on your body and a place to store copper, keep your eyes open for every opportunity to collect for free and in an honest way copper. Store it and wait. I have collected just half an hour before writing some old copper wire in an honest way. If you do not pay for it, and you can store without costs, you can not make loses on your investment. You can make some profit or huge profit. I do not give financial advice. You have to act on your own responsibility. ",

            "answer_text": "Money is not everything, but money is something very important. Beyond the basic needs, money helps us achieve our life's goals and supports \u2014 the things we care about most deeply \u2014 family, education, health care, charity, adventure and fun. It helps us get some of life's intangibles \u2014 freedom or independence, the opportunity to make the most of our skills and talents, the ability to choose our own course in life, financial security. With money, much good can be done and much unnecessary suffering can be avoided or eliminated. But, money has its own limitations too. It can give us the time to appreciate the simple things in life more fully, but not the spirit of innocence and wonder necessary to do so. Money can give us the time to develop our gifts and talents, but not the courage and discipline to do so. Money can give us the power to make a difference in the lives of others, but not the desire to do so. It can give us the time to develop and nurture our relationships, but not the love and caring necessary to do so. It can just as easily make us jaded, escapist, selfish, and lonely. How much do you need? What is it going to cost you to get it? It is keeping these two questions in mind that gives us a true sense of money's relationship to happiness. If we have less than what we need, or if what we have is costing us too much, we can never be happy. We need money to eat, sleep, dress, work, play, relate, heal, move about, and enjoy comforts. We should remember in choosing our style that it comes with a price tag. The importance of money in human life is similar to the importance of food for the body. Just like you can't live even for a few days without food, you can't survive for long without Money. Whoever thinks money can't buy happiness, please transfer to my account :) Anyone who says Money can't buy happiness just doesn't know where to shop. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s face it and be completely honest. In our material world, money is a huge factor. At all levels of society, it makes a difference. For the very poor, having some money is essential for survival. For the middle income earners, how much of it we can get a hold of and as importantly, how it is allocated/used, determines the quality of your current living and your eventual retirement. For the wealthy, it is a constant effort to keep it and not abuse it. The huge problem is when there is greed or when people subscribe to the common misconception that money makes you happy and/or it takes all your cares away. I heard somewhere someone saying \u201cMourning a loss within the comforts of a Benz, is far more appealing than having to shed tears inside a standard motor vehicle.\u201d This may be the case, but chasing money and possessions is a quick fix and a addictive habit. Yes, being comfortable financially is important and does make life easier. But not in isolation. You also need to look after your health, including your emotional health. You need relationships, people in your life, who care about you and who you care about. Attending a recent funeral, for a wealthy deceased man: The speaker had prepared a detailed eulogy with inserts from many of the attendees. Not once in the speech was there any mention of money or wealth. The only points of interest was the relationships and the personality and the emotional contributions that the deceased had shared with his family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances and society in general.

You have probably heard this right: \u2018Money is the root of all evil\u2019. But actually, money is one of the most important things in society (along with family, happiness, values etc). Money provides you with security and freedom. It keeps your family secure and financially stable. Money makes you able to help out your friends and family during their hard times. Imagine this your dad is dying and needs money for treatment. You are just standing there like a loser, not being financially stable enough to be able to afford his treatment. So give value to money, don\u2019t fall into this society\u2019s trap. Money is undoubtedly important for you and your family. I think this video of Dan Lok sums it all up.  ",

            "answer_text": "While all the previous answers are correct about money being a store of value and making trade easier, I think one very important point remains unspoken: Money is how society deals with the allocation of scarce resources. That's why breathing air is free, for example - there's lots of air. But diamonds are expensive, because there is a lot of demand for them and very little supply. How do we fairly allocate those diamonds? Make them available for the people who are willing to pay the most for them. By using money (and capitalism) society can try to find ways to provide more of what people desire and less of what people don't want, thus attempting to maximize everyone's satisfaction. Every time money is exchanged (willfully) both parties are better off. If I spend $5 on a cheeseburger, I'd rather have the cheeseburger than $5. And the company that provided the cheeseburger is selling them for $5 because it benefits them to do so. If all of a sudden demand for cheeseburgers skyrockets and the price rises to $8, society will try to fulfill the demand by producing more cheeseburgers until the price reaches a point where it no longer makes sense to produce more cheeseburgers (no company is making an extreme profit) and thus consumer surplus is also increased. Likewise if demand for cheeseburgers drops, society will put efforts into producing other more beneficial things instead. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Friends, I just came across a beautiful article by Acharya Prashant, I would like you also to have a look at the article.  Have you asked yourself, \u201cWhy is money important and to what extent is money important? What is money?\u201d The society has told you that money is important and is important to this and that extent, and you keep running after it. You spend your individual life in a pursuit of a social goal. Is that not stupid? You are spending your individual life pursuing a social goal, a goal given by the society. Whose life is it? \u201cMine.\u201d Whose goals are they? \u201cSociety\u2019s\u201d. Is that not a wastage of life? Your life is spent in pursuing a goal given by others. Whose life is being wasted? \u201cMy own life.\u201d Have you asked yourself, \u201cWhat is the meaning of work? What is the relation of work to life? Why must one work? What is the relation of work to money?\u201d Have you asked yourself, \u201cWhat is employment? What is meant by one man serving the needs of other? What is meant by one man accepting a salary from another?\u201d Have you asked these questions? You all are adults. Have you asked yourself, \u201cWhat is meant by love? What is sex? What is body? What is marriage? What is reproduction? What is family?\u201d Have you ever asked these questions? No. And you will blindly move into them because the entire society blindly moves into them. A particular age and you are fit for marriage, and you must have a family. Do you ask yourself, \u201cWhat is all this? This one body, what am I doing with it? This one life, what am I doing with it?\u201d But the society has clearly laid down the norms and you will follow those norms. When you are following the norms given by the society, obviously you will be afraid of the society, because the society has now become your master. Have you asked yourself, \u201cWhat is meant by settling down? What is meant by the so-called good life where you have a car, an apartment, two kids, a nice job and a particular reputation?\u201d What is meant by all these? Have you asked, \u201cWhat is religion?\u201d You go and celebrate festivals. Would you ask yourself, \u201cWhat is religion? Why am I following a certain religion? What is meant by following a religion? Is religion individual or social?\u201d Religion must be totally individual, but the religion that we follow is completely social. Even our God is a social god that the society has given us. Have you found out God? No. But you are blindly following certain scriptures that the society handed over to you, a social God. It\u2019s like I am sitting over here, all of you dream up a God, make certain pictures, create certain stories and then come to me and say, \u201cThis is God. Start believing in this and live your life according to this.\u201d When everything is social, when every breath is social, why wonder that why am I afraid of the society? You will continue to be afraid till the time you don\u2019t let intelligence function. Let intelligence function and then there will be no fear.  Thank you :) Hope this article helps you. ",

Lets just assume that money is the scale to demonstrate how possessing any subject is important to you by the figure you are willing to pay to possess it. Lets not repeat that old trick by objecting that not everything is purchased by money. People are sick and tired of hearing that bluff over and over again. Say everything has a price and in order to gain or possess we are required to pay the price. Then considering your desires or requirements we shall reach the conclusion to say yes, money is this or that important. For a man with no dream, a man who does not give a damn to himself to reward himself with a thing that may be purchased then money does not worth it. Dreaming to become rich further to your ambitions is planning for null, wanting nothing. Wasting efforts to get the excess money for nothing. Some rich people, mostly rich celebrities reach that point when they lose their appearance, see nothing in their empty head start donating. ",

Money also allows you to help other people less fortunate than you, should you chose to so spend your money. So money is very useful in modern society but importance nope not so much. What is important is the usual that is stated everyday, health, happiness, satisfaction, relationships, challenge, and opportunity. Money assists but with some of these and other really important things are totally beyond your control and others take action on your part to accomplish and accomplishing them is unrelated to how much money you have.

            "answer_text": "If you want an answer as simple as the question: Money is like sex; it's not important unless you don't have any. A more realistic answer is: Trade is a tool which is most notably used to facilitate cooperation among strangers, allowing people to acquire otherwise unavailable resources. Currency is a different tool used to facilitate trade among groups of people with different needs, particularly with different resource availability times. Example: Person A needs flower to bake bread, but has no access to grain. They do, however, have hens that lay eggs. Person B needs eggs to go with their cheese, but do not have access to hens. They do, however, have access to dairy cows that are used to produce cheese. Person C needs cheese to go with their bread, but has no access to dairy cows. They do, however, have access to grain. All three of these people have what another needs, but may not all be able to physically meet up at the same time and make to logical swap. Currency is a way for all three to acquire what they individually need, on their own time, without having to coordinate a meeting among all three of them. Its fundamental usefulness is to enhance personal agency and make trade more efficient. It has been of great importance since its inception and will continue to be for a long time to come. That's not to say that it will forever be the way we operate as a species, but realistically, it is currently the way we operate, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. In short, money is important. I wish it wasn't, but it definitely is. What's more important is happiness, don't forget that, and good luck trying to balance the two with the rest of life. ",

            "answer_text": "The Role of Money in Life  When it comes to our finances, each of us has our own individual approach. Some of us are savers, some are spenders, and others are somewhere in between. This continuum is a paradigm that our popular culture uses to frame differences in the way people approach money. I believe that the way we approach our finances goes beyond that particular behavioral characteristic. In reality, I think our approach to finances can be viewed in more of a multi-dimensional setting, where money has a different role in each our lives. For some, money means survival, plain and simple. For others, money is something that is a part of their lives but rarely on their mind, regardless of the role it actually plays. For yet others, money is an obsession, as accumulation signifies achievement. Some people view money as analogous to insurance, or a defensive resource to protect against future setbacks. Some people want money to provide a good home\u2026.or to contribute to the ability to have certain hobbies\u2026.or to provide something to bequeath to future generations\u2026.and so on. Sometimes the same person may view money differently in different situations. The bottom line is that we each have our own relationship with money, and our own conscious and subconscious needs for money, rooted in our value systems and cumulative life experiences. This is an area of personal finance that has interested me for a while. Why do people behave the way they do with respect to their money? What\u2019s driving this behavior? Of course, a starting point for anybody is to consider how you personally view things. Taking an introspective approach, I have spent time figuring out my own take on money, and the role it plays in my life. What I have determined is that for me, it fits into a framework that includes the following elements: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. These are linked together as a part of a system. Think about it: HWR \u2013 Health, Wealth, Relationships. They\u2019re all connected, and to the extent one is strengthened, the others will be strengthened as well. If one is weakened, the others will be weakened as well. For example, lets take 2 people: A and B. They are twins. A has good health, average wealth, and good relationships. B has good health, average wealth, and poor relationships. Over time, all other things being equal, I think that A will end up having a better overall quality of life. My reasoning is that A\u2019s good relationships will be good for his happiness and will lower his stress levels compared to B, which will give A a chance to be healthier. As A is healthier, he will have a better chance to be wealthier, as he will be able to in better position to earn money while having lower health care expenses. And while he is healthier, he in turn will be in a better position to cultivate, keep, and grow relationships, leading to better chances to be wealthy, etc. Circular, perhaps\u2026yet very symbiotic. So to me, money is a part of the Wealth aspect of HWR. Beyond basic survival, money gives you the opportunity to live a healthier life, with the time and means to have more positive relationships. One thing I want to make clear is that I am not saying that money buys friends. Well, it could, but those aren\u2019t true friends. What I am saying is that the more money you have, on balance, the less stressed you are about it, and the more time you have to do other things, such as cultivate true, genuine relationships that aren\u2019t based on money. Money is but a component in the system. Of course, there is no right or wrong framework, each of us has our own specific one, whether we have consciously thought about it or not. Yours might be entirely different than mine. It would be interesting to get everyone\u2019s perspectives on the role of money in our lives, in relation to other aspects. What do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "It is not important. It's the opposite, money is even detrimental to life in general. Money is the mean to accumulate wealth which cause economic inequality. Without money it's much harder to accumulate wealth and it's much easier to give something to the one who need it the most. In nature, no creature except human use money or a concept of it and they never ask something in return when giving something. A nut tree will not ask something in return from a bird who eat its nuts. But actually the tree will get something in return in a big cycle but not immediately. This is how the concept of \"pay it forward\" originated. I think money is born from the individualistic and greedy nature of human. Once implemented, it changes the way people think. With money in the system, everytime someone gives something to someone else, she/he could think that someone is owing him/her something which can be paid back with money. Then the whole trading system is born. People start quantifying the value of everything, and people become less and less giving. ",

One thing to note is that barter exchanges commonly are ad hoc, with no well-defined exchange ratios worked out beforehand. Also, what if I have nothing that you need? Maybe you don\u2019t need my sheep. How else will I get some hens? Money is an agreed-upon medium of exchange that facilitates transactions between individuals, between institutions, and between individuals and institutions. Having a reasonably well-known price for hens, with the price expressed in some monetary unit, makes it a lot easier for me to find someone who will sell me some hens! ",

            "answer_text": "The answer to this question, it ultimately relies on your interpretations of \u2018important\u2019 and \u2018life\u2019. Money is used for the exchange of goods and services. To some, money is unnecessary in life. For example, think of the general idea of a temple monk. They do not need any money to live their lives, therefore money is not too important in life. Clearly this is a drastic example but does come with inklings of truth. T/U: I think that money influences too many lives in too many varied ways. Bad people will do bad things with items intended for good. I think all of our lives are interconnected, so I believe money is important in life solely because of its direct effects it has to stunt or tempt people\u2019s actions. Personally, I am fortunate to be in a comfortable spot financially and do reside in a very urbanized first world country. My hobbies, functions, and habits revolve around institutions that collectively complete millions of transactions a day. Sorry for the broad reply, some questions have no definite answer due to the question dependent on too many varied factors. ",

            "answer_text": "I am just saying that money is everything for to have everything in life . A person who think about success and live a lavish life to live then he/she has to earn money for that . Why everyone does not have lavish life? ______________________ Because all does not have that much money for living . Some are only earning about to eat for day and night only .There are many who are dying everyday for not having money as to eat something and to be alive . We cannot get anything without money as for peace also we need money . Lets\u2019s think the country want peace then it has to increase its fund as to maintain peace from other country . If the country will not have the money and there will be no self-defence armor or military weapons as to save its country and people from other country. Think about a boy who has a love towards a girl who is a millionaire and the boy is a waiter at a particular restaurent then will she marry to that boy? If the boy is having some money and an reputed business man then the girl can think about that marriage proposal . Many talk about happiness that it can be achieved without money then think about beggar who does not have anything , and If he laughs then People will think that he is a fool laughing in the street without reason. Many talk about fulfillment that it can get without money , at present only oxygen is available as to breath free (but nowadays air is also polluted , so rich people use air purifiers and person without money dies due to some airborne pollution disease .) and have nothing to get . Google also gives meaning of fulfillment - the achievement of something desired, promised, or predicted. The fulfillment of anything needs money. Let\u2019s take an example of a teenager who wants a iphone as to match with his friends who all of them have iphones , and he ask his parents but parent have a tough budget and they told him that its not possible as they save money for his college fees . For above example its clear that everyone needs money who wants to get something except giving some advice free of cost. So , there is an importance of money for everything. Money is everything as it helps in many cases . For an example if you are thrown out of your house and you do not have job and money to live then what you will do then ? There is no one who helps the person who does not have any thing means money because money is the main source of any property, thing like car , any non-living thing or living thing also. WE ALL HAVE SOME SELF RESPECT . If we do not have money then we will be like beggar who does not have anything and he/she has to give his/her self respect as to live or survive in this cruel world . If you have money then you will have everything except love , I know that but , Let\u2019s take an example of a person who is a billionaire then there will be many women who can marry him without any love but for only for the money . We need to understand that money is more important than love for a moment of time . ",

No one could ever imagine a bone fracture in the leg could turn into a life threatening problem. Conditions got worse as the days passed. Her multiple organs stopped working. It was 4th day in ICU. There was neither any improvement nor any response from her mother except that she was still breathing on ventilator. Each day\u2019s ICU charge was costing more than all the family members month's income put together. Scared of the bills that was shooting day by day, they decided to talk to the doctor. Doctor clarified she status of the case and gave them 2 options- Option 1- To keep her in ICU untill she gets back to consciousness. Her life organs would be supported with various machines. Doctor gave an example of similar case where one of the patient was back to consciousness after 21 days. Doctor also admitted on the bad chances where she could never get alright. In this case the family should be ready to shell out Lakhs of money with 50% chances of her survival. Option 2\u2013 The hospital will help the easy passing of the person by removing the ventilators and machine support. She could survive atmost few hours after the support is removed. My friend was broken. All of the family members knew they could not go for the option 1. They were all forced to decide on practical terms and took a tough decision to go with the option 2. Hospital staff got all the formalities done from the family members to proceed with Option 2 and were all sent back to home that night and were informed that they would get a call from hospital if there is any news about her. Later, next day she passed away. True is that philosophy that states Money is not important and can't buy many things like love, life, peace etc. But it has the power to postpone death, could even save life in some cases. Respect money! \u201cLive and let live\" ",

For an hour, he tried to explain to people, how the race for wealth and never ending desires are ruining their life. People silently listened with respect. And then some of them left (draining everything through their right ear). I don't blame them, that's why they are common people, they can't understand and follow such tough preachings. Soon a few new devotees entered the scene. They looked rich and influential. Saint called them in front and made them sit near him. Others had to shift at back. Next, a healthy discussion about building a brand new temple started. The big, beautiful \u201cDhaam\u201d (temple) dedicated to the same saint who was giving a lesson of simplicity a few moments back. They discussed about the entire layout, arranging of funds, type of stone to be used, attractions, getting in more investment etc. Saint\u2019s face lit up while having all these discussions, the happiness on his face was amazing. God bless those investors, sorry followers. Soon, I left the place after pledging not to return.  Answering this question- No, money is not important, if it is of relevance to others ;) ",

Money cannot guarantee to make your child an IAS officer. But it can instill in you the belief that you can give best possible education to your child, without which, the path is rocky.  Imagine the above situations without money, this sole reason of not being able to afford will kill you from inside. When no one in life is by your side, money can give you the confidence and power to achieve things , it makes the things less complex. Money can't buy you happiness but it definitely can boost up your confidence. ",

He took his stuffs and turned to leave but turned back suddenly, \u201cPlease, give me a recharge coupon of Rs.10,\u201d he said with stumbled calmly voice. \u201clijiye,\u201d shopkeeper gave it. \u201cPaise baad me de denge,\u201d he replied. O my God! Shopkeeper snatched that card from his hand. \u201cPaise le kr aana fir lena, roj-roj ka ho gya hai,\u201d angrily shopkeeper told him. \u201cTake it,\u201d shopkeeper gave it. \u201c I'll pay you next time,\u201d he replied. \u201cBring money then take it, it's a habit,\u201d angrily shopkeeper told him. I was stunned by the scene. The old man belongs to a good family and there is no issues regarding money. When he left, I inquired shopkeeper behind his rude behaviour. \u201cHis son says not to give a single thing, simply refute when he comes. Everytime I can't help him. I don't want to get fired,\u201d shopkeeper revealed. It shocked me brutally. I told my mom about this incident. She said that he is a retired professor. He didn't save money for his future, gave all facilities to his son. Now, his son treats him like a burden. I skuled my sorrow. Hopelessly I left. Why? The person who sacrificed his happiness for his son is facing cruel world? Yes, money is important. Not only important, it can make your life. It can give respect in this rude society.

So i quit a Fortune 500 Petroleum Exploration behemoth\u2026yes i did. And i was 32 then. I joined after that in much lower paying jobs. It took me 10 years to come back to the level of pay i had quit in 2008. I lost friends. I lost my logic. People just left me including extended family members like cousins. Even now whenever my past is discussed either amongst friends, current colleagues or in interviews, the most perplexing question put before me is \u2026Why did you quit that job..it paid so well. I know in my heart that i quit because my heart had then screamed out \u2026.your self respect is more important than money. Yes\u2026i had quit listning to that scream. But the world doesn't run on emotions, however true they may be. The world runs on hard facts and money is a piece of fact that just\u2026.is. ",

            "answer_text": "Money isn\u2019t the most important thing in life(at least not to me). People are so bent on making money that they think it is the entire reason to get an education in the first place. So they hastily just pick a major they think they are interested in. Then they struggle to learn everything they are taught in the courses (many drop-out). If they make it, they still have to hunt for a place to work. Then they get caught in a career where they make money, but they don\u2019t have any fun. And fun is important, because they will spend the rest of their lives in this career: and if they aren\u2019t having any fun, it will be dreadful to them, and they might develop a variety of emotional, physical, and mental health problems.  We live in a society where everything is measured by money. Even our well-being is suppose to correlate to our bank account. Students are getting jobs in advertising, marketing, all areas that help fuel this massive consumerism, and why do they go to these areas? Do not major in something superficial or that leads to a corporate trap. Major in something rich in knowledge. Something you truly enjoy. Happiness, go for it. Money is soulless. Don\u2019t sell your soul so it can have its power over you. Find a thing that you always dreamed about and do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Not very - I was introduced to many valuable ideas through Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. One particularly useful lesson is that - assuming you at least make enough to get you by - you should work to learn, not to make money. People learn best when they have a curious mind and are genuinely interested in the things they do. Those who learn better and feel happier are more socially engaged, enjoy more career success, and - yes - tend to make more money. Likewise, many Americans seem to have the dilemma of spending beyond their means or not paying themself first (these ideas are also discussed in Rich Dad, Poor Dad). You shouldn\u2019t work for money, money should work for you. Money used to buy things that add no value to your life or the lives of people you love is money wasted. Trim the fat before you ask for more, and learn to manage your money before you demand \u201cyour fair share\u201d. ",

But it can definitely give you confidence that you can afford good quality treatment. And I remembered one meeting that I had with the late Bhanupriya Jayaraj at her residence last year and during the course of our conversations, she mentioned this: \u201cI know people say that money is not everything in life. But the quality of treatment that a person like me suffering from cancer gets, depends on money. I have personally known so many people who have deferred or did not do the treatment, because they had no or less money. I have also seen the patients and their families sleeping on the footpath near the hospital, because they had just enough money for the therapy and no money left over for a room in a lodge, for the duration of the therapy.\u201d Now it\u2019s upto you to decide whether money is important or not.

Money gives you food, shelter, clothing, position in society, a good life and luxuries. I feel that there is so much to see in the entire world, which only money can make it possible. Without money how can the nations be built, the new structures, new discoveries and inventions? Money makes the world go round. You can avail good amenities, you can get good medical treatment, meet good, classy people. You can go to places, eat, enjoy and be happy. Give good education to your kids, give and provide them with lot of good things and above all you can let your kids choose a career of their choice. You can have a secure old age also, you can hire people to take care of you. On the humanitarian grounds, you can give lot of donations and help the poor and the needy. At least you will not have a money problem to tackle with when you have money but when you don\u2019t have money you have lots of other problems too. That\u2019s why it is better to cry on a couch in an air conditioned room if you face any problem than cry on the road in the cold having nothing. It is better to have money than not having money. Money is THE basic thing to give you lots of things to make you happy. ",

Gone are the days when people used to say you don\u2019t need money for existence, you need Love. You do need love and support but to carry on with life you need something materialistic. Now let us not go towards the luxuries, but the basics. You need shelter, you need money. You want to kill hunger, you need money. You need education, you need money. Even if you are thirsty you buy water. Nothing in the world is free of cost today. I am not saying to have a million dollars but yes if you want to live you have to have money. If you have it, don\u2019t just keep it to yourself, try helping the needy and the poor when possible. The art is in having money and living life down to earth. After all money is not everything, it is just the fuel of Life, and not Life itself! ",

Society also judges you on the basis of your success which is always mapped with the weight of coins in your pocket.Even at some point of time, your family starts taunting you and makes comparison with saamne wale Sharmaji who has got big car and a beautiful bunglow. But somewhere we have forgot our real scent and meaning of life.All has got different goals.For some people till the time u are getting food and has a roof above u,it is better to focus on things that makes u happy from inside. And of course it is better to make relations with gud people than indulging your only life into making some notes and regret after that bcaz afterlife people will remember u for your deeds only. ",

It's same as that l, Money deserves the importance it requires but only to the point it does the work it's supposed to do, which is to keep you happy. If only making money itself is important for you or your happiness means, then you have to miss too many happiness which money can't buy in life. Money can bring happiness to your mind, staying in star hotel, going in Jaguar, Duplex Villa\u2026 But there are certain things which gives happiness to your soul, Birth to the child, Love of your Family etc. Which money can't buy. For me both the happiness are important, since only if you have money you can hold your esteem at high as well as make the people who travels with you happy. ",

            "answer_text": "It helps in trade. If money is not used the other means is barter: You give me X item and I swap it for Y. The trouble with barter is how do you define the variation in values between items X and Y? E.g. is a bag of apples more valuable than a bottle of milk, about the same, less valuable, by how much? If different then how do you accomplish a fair trade through barter? Say you have a watermelon but you want a glass of milk. Do you trade the entire watermelon? Do you cut off a piece and compromise the rest? Do you ask for many glasses instead?  What if you don't particularly want the milk (just now). But later you might. Do you trade now and store the milk somewhere? Or do you wait until you need the milk and only then trade the watermellon (which might have gone off by then)? What if you don't want the milk but you know someone else who does, and he's got some grapes which you want. Do you trade the watermellon for the milk and then trade the milk for the grapes? What if you didn't know the 3rd person wanted milk? So the 4 major reasons money is easier to use than barter: A means to measure value of different products.An easy way to divide up value among various products.A non-perishable store of value.A non-specific transfer of value.Money as we have it today isn't perfect on those elements. E.g. inflation causes its storage capability to be less constant. But its benefits still outweigh the problems. ",

Money is only a tool that us used to purchase goods. There are other ways to get those goods if you choose. You can make things, grow things barter for things, build things. You can actually do without a great many things or you can \u201cmake do\u201d with things in good but used condition. You don\u2019t have to spent all your time in pursuit of money. The people around you, friends, family and even pets, should be your top priority, but\u2026..I can\u2019t really define your priorities, only you can do that. Only YOU can decide what\u2019s most important to do with your time and whatever money you earn. Doing things that nourish your soul is what will make you happiest in the long run.

            "answer_text": "Sure. Most people can not manage all aspects of their life. On the other hand, most people can do a few things well enough to have an abundance. The result is trade, what I can do or have plenty of in exchange for what you got to trade. This makes for a barter system, clumsy, limited number of trades where there just happens to be somewhat equal values. So we have money, which supercharges trade, and so we get what we need, get rewarded for what we can provide. It is a fine thing. I think many blame money for the fact that some people are good at making it, and some are corrupted from a more cooperative nature socially. Envy is easier to turn to resentment with money it seems, so a negative character trait gets exaggerated. Money, like guns, are not the problem. Anything can be misused. ",

And since almost all of us are conformists in some form or the other - money becomes all the more important. It gives you the power to be and to do whatever you deem fit without being apologetic about it, though going crazy with wealth fueled power isn't ideal. You can end up saving the world, you can end up destroying it bit by bit. But without money you can't really accomplish anything that would be of any significance to others. Not necessarily owning it, but sourcing it and spending it can also change the world. I am not saying having money gets rid of all problems, or not having any means you are insignificant. I'm saying that getting people's attention is easy when you have a lot of it, or none. Taking it away from others will definitely get their attention. And you rather have it than not have it. ",

            "answer_text": "This story is not about me.. it's about my father and his parents and his siblings My father grew up in a small village of Bharatpur (India) along with his other 7 siblings as the philosophy during my grandparents time per \u201cjitne hath\u2026utna paisa\u201d (more hands,more money). My grandparents were not from any rich background.. they used to work in someone else's field to fullfill their own family's stomach. Back in days, method of payment were not in money form, Jamindar (Field lord) used to give the daily wedges in the form of Grains..which was further stored in vaults made of clay by my grandma\u2026my father along with his siblings used to stole a tiny-tiny amount of grain with the help of broom sticks in the exchange of candies from the cyclist which used to visit our separate part of tiny village,weekly..but as i mentioned there were 8 of them and vaults were made of clay\u2026every winters, grains were always in shortage. My grandmother told me that how many times she slept hungry\u2026but always provided everyone for at least one meal. My grandparents used to work during night in fields to provide a \u2018bit extra' which actually meant food atleast twice a day for them, during winters when the moon shines the brightest\u2026it was only time when the electricity was consistent and pumps will provide enough water to irritate the field in one go\u2026as we never owned any land of our own back than\u2026to irrigate mustard field for extra income was a good idea but it was not a consistent..but something is better than sleeping empty stomach..right?. Years went by and working in those chilly night with water till you knees ( Indian farmers are not very advance\u2026we use a system \u201ckood modna\u201d in which a person manually put sand to stop the flow of water in one particular direction) and drinking only Chach (buttermilk\u2026because milk was only for special occasions ) really took a toll on her. She developed a continuous pain in her knees. My father and my uncle were living far away from home those days so they were not aware of any of those conditions. My grandpa took my her to the nearest Doctor..he declared that it is just normal pain due to age (she was around 40) and gave her some medicines which was actually cheap and affordable as compare to other medicines and was much more effective than than those 'expensive medicine'. Years passed by..my father completed his Degree in maths- science and applied for Competitive exams for State Engineering service. Result came out but he passed the technical but failed in English. My grandparent were raising and trying to pay the fee for other 3 brothers too and also, 4 of his sisters were coming to the age of marrying so it was a great burden for them to collect enough for their marriage and for Dowry. My grandpa refused to gave him money and advised him to apply for Nursing Course which was a much cheaper option. My father followed the advice as he knew that as fast as he gets the job.. faster his family will recover from poverty and second (my own opinion) it was not in anyone else's power to pay the fee form Exam forms again and drop the whole year. After year or two..my grandma's condition grew serious, but that time my father had enough knowledge to know what was wrong. She had rheumatic arthritis which mainly developed due to lack of nutrition and food basically and those 'cheap but effective' medicines were actually heavy doses of steroids which she were taking for all those years. By that time it was far too late for her to recover from the side effect. My father had a govt job as a male nurse by that time. He tried his best\u2026 tprovidedher the best medicine and best treatment.. but it was late. She died a cruel death\u2026i don't even want to recall her condition during her last years for this question but I'm glad she died! She suffered for 18 years in her body. Followed years, all my uncle and aunty got married..got govt Jobs. My grandpa now owns a fair amount of land which he can't even irrigate by himself. Now I'm not going to answer thst if money is important? Cz even I'm not sure what thing took away my grandma's life..or another opportunity for my father to get a good job, what thing took away his childhood\u2026and if money is really that powerful and impo can it bring back all the things they all lost? Was it Time,which messed up things up for them..or was it the money..or was it simply the Indian philosophy of having 8 children when you already knew you are broke af? The thing is..it doesn't matter atleast not now for me. ",

Since losing the house in bankruptcy, we are now in public housing and despite my prayers to the Blessed Mother and the Holy Trinity and a few other saints, no job is coming to me despite being cognizant and mobile. Yet every month we seem to make rent and get most of our bills paid, but there are a lot of other things that need attention that aren\u2019t getting fixed.

Your Destiny as a human is to learn how to Love, to start doing things in a Love-focused way and to become Love Personified (or Love Incarnate if you prefer). There is a problem here though, since virtually all with power and many with scads of ill-gotten gains want to control everything and everyone so they can feel safe from those who want to destroy them because of what they did to get what they have. You can control people who live in Fear and as long as you promise them money (although never deliver it), most people will be controllable. The problem is with those who choose to live in Love-focused ways, Especially after they figure out that they are spiritual beings having human experiences, you cannot control them. This scares the bejeebers out of those who only know how to control those who will stay in Fear. Start your journey to becoming Love anyway. There is an explosion in the number of humans choosing to go that way and you will have lots of company - you will not \u2018see\u2019 them until you start leaving Fear behind, then you will be amazed at how many Love-focused people there are all around you. Most of your learning has to be on the Web since our Traditional Press is paid to keep you focused on Fear. There is no long-term Joy or Peace in things or even in power, but there sure is in Love!

Money not only provides for the food on your plate, the roof on your head but it is what keeps the world working. It is money that guarantees a scientist his value for intelligence, a doctor for his education, a worker for his toil. When a carpenter sells his furniture and buys food with that money, he traded his skill for the hardwork of a farmer, a trader, a laborer. Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. One more quote at the end for the people who preach that money is unimportant\u2026 Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper's bell of an approaching looter. -Ayn Rand Atlas Shrugged (1957 book) ",

I mean, what is a man with everything in the world if he has no one to share experiences with? That money might make him happy in the short term, but for long term happiness, he\u2019s going to want to share it with somebody. Or rather, many people. Money is an amazing thing if you find the right ways to use it. I'm not going to lie, in my ideal world I want to buy materialistic things, but I want to share that with my friends and my family. Not only can I make myself happy in the process, I can have an affect on the lives around me in a beneficial way. So, as a final answer to your question, money is not more important than everything. It is beautiful though, when used in the right way. ",

If you\u2019re seriously hungry, thirsty, or in need of shelter or other basics, then money is everything, in a system where you need money to get anything. If you\u2019re desperately poor, then yes, money is more important that most anything else, because your survival depends on acquiring it somehow. After you have enough of the basics for life, money becomes less and less important, to the point that very wealthy people have the luxury of declaring that money doesn\u2019t matter at all. The truth is that you need a minimum of about $75k per year to live in the US, much more in many hip, techy, coastal places. If you\u2019re below that threshold, you are probably doing everything you can to rise above it. If you\u2019re above it, you\u2019re probably doing everything you can to bring meaning, purpose, and real satisfaction to your life, because you don\u2019t lack for the basics. Money is power.

We measure everything, even people through monetary possessions, through the number of zeros on the bank accounts, through GDP, growth and profit. Without sufficient amount of money we simply can\u2019t survive or provide comfortable life for our families. On the other hand it is a false world as money - that started as a simple facilitator for trading necessary products in between people - has become the king. Today it is the \u201ctail that is wagging the dog\u201d. It is this artificial, lieful world built on the worship of money that is falling apart through the global crisis, especially because by only focusing on money, efficiency, productivity, profit, growth we have lost the most important thing: the value of human connections. Thus now natural evolution takes money away from us, forcing us to rediscover those lost human connections as without them there is no life.

            "answer_text": "Money is how the world tells you what you are worth based on how useful they find your particular set of skills. Make a wrong career choice, and you will struggle; choose a career in demand, and you have less financial problems than you would otherwise. The problem is we are asked to make an objective decision at a point in our life when we are idealistic; so many people choose with the purity of their heart and the nobility of their dreams. Later, the harsh reality of life, which can be more cruel in more ways than you can imagine, will cut like a sword, and the only thing that matters is whether you make / have money to survive and prosper, or you don\u2019t. Everything else is bulls*it. To reach a state of abundance while pursuing what you like is rare, and you have to be either extremely lucky, or fine tune your life over a long time to get it there. When you are still in school, you can do anything (infinite potential). As you approach graduation, you have to renounce most of those possibilities and pick one you have a high likelihood of being good at (if you really work it). Of course, you can also choose to keep yourself open to that connection to infinite choices by never picking anything to devote your full attention to, but the bills at the end of each month make for a very rude awakening; and any person who can\u2019t take care of him/herself will not be prized or valued much in a society where you have to prove your skill at taking care of yourself and of those who depend on you.

As societies developed simple tools and domesticated animals, there was some surplus and people may have bartered. Bartering exists even today, though I have no idea how many societies exist with no exchange of money. There may exist some isolated groups who may not use money. I think that money is a necessary construct in industrial and post-industrial societies today. I cannot imagine many developed societies who have no need for a monetary system. ",

Then the store door opens and in runs two kids. I'm shocked out of my reverie. I notice how scruffy they look, yet smiles are beaming from their tiny faces. One of them shoves a dollar bill onto the counter, simultaneously ordering 2 Snicker bars and some bottled water. It's hard not to get emotional at this point, I couldn't even get myself to take their money. I'm okay now. The store can wait. ",

To them there is no value of family, loved one, relationships, friends etc etc. They think that if they have money they can have anything even respect and love. Most of the people you will find in now a times fall into this category. B) If according to logical way, i think that money is important, but not because it can get you anything and everything but because you need it to live. You need food to eat, how you buy it? You are with out loved one, family, or friends, how you expect to live life with them? How would you provide them a safe future or good present? Now only respect won\u2019t get you that but money will. I think i have answered your question. Do upvote if you like.Comments are welcomed.",

Either you buy food or grow on your own, money is needed for both. Although it's not a written rule anywhere to wear clothes in public, to maintain a decorum everyone does so. Some people may go for brands and some buy local, it needs money in either case. Most importantly, the last need, it's very important to have a roof on your head. It can be in any form, ownership, rental or PG, but can it come without money?? After completing all your basic needs, what comes next is luxuries, which are definitely not for free. So, YES, money is important unless we switch to barter system again.  ",

For me, family comes first. They're the one who truly loves and cares for you. They're there to cheer for you on your success and lift you up when you're down. Note: Stop chasing money. Let money come to you. For that to happen, you need to first improve yourself. Learn more valuable (money making) skills, self-teach yourself more (if school is the only place you acquire knowledge from, you're far left behind than your peers) to stand out from the herd, learn a new language, etc. Do this and watch new opportunities spring to life.

And people more or less have access to similar educational resources. Infrastructure is robust and well maintained. If you live in a country where the quality of medical care will depend on your financial resources, not having money can literally be fatal. Taxes are likely to be lower than they should be to support society in the long term. You will not have access to educational resources, or it will be limited, and infrastructure will likely be decaying. It comes down to a question of values. How important is a single life and are all voices given equal value? ",

You will not be able to buy nutritious food, Good clothes, house, you will not be able to manage your medical expenses, No car, No bikes, you will not be able to go out and party with your friends and the list is too long. If money gives you pleasure and power, It also adds arrogance to one\u2019s personality. The utmost priority in life should be simplicity and humbleness. No matter how much you earn and grow, if you don\u2019t have friends and family with you ,You will ultimately end up being shallow.Do focus on what money can buy but don\u2019t ignore things which money can\u2019t.Money can not get you happiness, bliss, peace, hope, love, family, friends and knowledge.

Now, I will say that beyond a certain point, quality of life doesn\u2019t increase by much from the dollar alone and that simply being rich doesn\u2019t guarantee one\u2019s happiness in life. If you\u2019re earning 30K a year and then starting tomorrow you start earning 60K a year, yes your quality of life will improve. If you\u2019re earning 150K a year and then starting tomorrow you\u2019re earning 170K a year, your quality of life will not improve by much.

Is this the only way I can achieve my goal? Why do peoples break their families just for some piece of land? Dear readers, Money is as Important your life. If you want to live in this world, the most important thing you will need is money. Your family is not going to feed you for the whole life. You will need money in every turn of your life. Just thing if you are injured and you are admitted into a hospital who is going to recover you for free, they will all need is money. Yesterday I went into market and then a boy came to me and was begging for money. I asked him why did you beg for money he told me that if he will not beg then no one is going to feed him for free. I asked him that where are you mom and dad he told me that they have died. I just thought for a second that someone may have taught him this. I took him to my friends shop where he sells samosa. kachori and all, I just gave him to eat and during eating he told me that If he won\u2019t beg for a day then he will need to sleep without eating the whole night and he don\u2019t know that will he be getting food to eat tomorrow. Even if you don\u2019t have no one is even gonna marry you. So guys as you are addicted to your loved one, get the same addiction for money. I hope you liked it! ",

I could probably get more by taking on a part time job, but I\u2019d rather do my best at stretching my dollar so I don't have to because I enjoy having the luxury of time.

            "answer_text": "For me, I visualize money as a set of staircases to climb up for a something important to a person. It could be his dreams or needs. And usually the bigger the purpose then the way to climb is also harder. Say, if you want to take a PhD then it will be harder then a Diploma, right? You will need more resources for the research or tuition. However, money is not the only way. You can get a scholarship or sponsorships. So my point is that money is only tool. You just got to be wise to use it. That's why the highest place for a normal person to keep money is at the shirt pocket which is lower than his head. It means that he should think first before using it, either filling or clearing. Sorry for my bad English. ",

The more the limiting factor the more the outcome.The less the limiting factor the less the outcome.The limiting factor here is money, while C, the Outcomes can be numerous.

            "answer_text": "First, I reject the premise of the question that money is more valuable than anything \u2014 it\u2019s not. There are many, many things that are much more valuable that any amount of money: happiness, love, fulfillment, peace, etc, etc. Now let\u2019s move on to material goods and services: To say that money is more valuable than any other thing is rather silly. If that were true, then all commerce would come to a screeching halt as we would never give up any money to buy any other items or services. Now, let\u2019s look at what money IS and what it represents: money is a storage and transfer mechanism for value or wealth. It represents, in the most financially liquid form, ALL OTHER goods and services. Therefore, FAR from being the \u201croot of all evil\u201d, money is a great thing in that it lubricates and facilitates commerce, which leads to prosperity \u2014 increased economic welfare. We would do well to remember that the tired old saw, \u201cMoney is the root of all evil\u201d is actually a misquote from the Bible. The actual quote is, \u201cFor the LOVE of money is the root of all evil.\u201d There\u2019s a huge difference between these two statements. The first assigns agency to money, which has none, and lifts some portion of blame from the individual who may be guilty of materialism. The latter (correct) quote correctly teaches that a love of material things is the root of all evil, since money is merely the liquid form of all material things. ",

Neither you are living in a barter economy. You are living in an economy where money is the only passport to happiness and security. Say you will need money in case of medical emergencies. Most of the the hospitals dont care about your personality or your good deeds they will just ask you to pay money if you want treatment. Similarly you will need money for many important things like aforementioned. You are living in India not in countries like UK where the unemployed people there are paid social securities or given access to free healthcare. Here the life gets better and easier if you earn more money. As for getting better job,get experience, build credentials and qualifications, hard work and strong and stable motive may be the answer for the part of how to earn more money.Internet have so many resources so you should get an idea regarding how to enhance your earnings, although yes do not fall for the sham popups and fake facebook recruitment adds.

In other words he have everything that money can buy but he have no one to share feelings with . You feel satisfied when and only you can share your feelings with anyone. Whenever he makes any girlfriend , they got attracted only because of money ,there also no presence of Love is seen. Now talking about me I am from Middle class, I am pursuing Engineering , I have a girlfriend(Not because of money) , a Younger sister and an elder brother to share feelings with, my mother is housewife and I can talk to her whenever I want. My father is in Job and return home daily at 7pm. Yes we face some money problem sometimes , but my father manage to resolve it . The best part is I am very satisfied from my life . It's like I have everything with me . Beside of having less money I atleast feel complete. So from my point of view , make money so that you can bear yours and your family expenses easily. There is no need to make money Everything . Make good Relation , that's what your soul wants. ",

Earlier when the money was notional the person who had big stock of cattle or pile of grains was a rich. He would exchange them to fulfill his wants. In modern economy the currency has replaced the exchange value of Utility, we can not get away from the wants, when we have wants, those need to be fulfilled, to full fill them we need to give back some thing in exchange. That exchangeable matter is called Money. Hence until we have wants, money is going to be eternal in one or other forms ",

Tom Shaw / Getty Images Money has a bad reputation with people who don't have it. It has been blamed for everything from wars to infidelity, from destroying friendships to wrecking families. In the minds of the masses, the more ways they can demonize money, the more validated they feel for not seeking their own fortunes. Instead of seeing the positive ways that money can enhance the most important things in life like our health, family relationships, and friendships, most people would rather scorn money and tell you how it can destroy the things we hold closest to our hearts. Don't listen to negative people who don't know any better. The truth is money is not the most important thing in life, but it will make the most important things in life so much better. ",

Yes, money is important in order to give you food, shelter and security, education, etc.No - because when you die, you won't take your money with you or if you are very ill sometimes medicine and money can't cure.Wealth gives us comfort and enjoyment but also takes from us. My 2 cents: be careful how you spend money, try to share with people and give others not to spend them only for yourself. ",

Let me explain it to you how,Imagine a situation where you are an average earning person just as anyone else and you live happily with your family where you have your parents or your girlfriend/wife or both, your kids(if any) !! You are a religious person and you go to temple,church or mosque regularly. Now imagine a life where you are the same and the people around you mentioned above are also the same, the only thing which has changed is your earnings. Imagine you can go on a trip with your girlfriend/wife to the beach of BAHAMAS, buy your parents a brand new farm house in your village where your parents were married and struggled for life, take your kids(if any) out on a ride on a BMW X5 and admit them into the best educational institute of your city !! You are the same religious person but this time, you can build a new temple,church or mosque for your community people in a required area whereby your family name would be respected for generations for doing such deeds. In the end all the money you have wont give you any peace of mind but if you have adequate wealth, you will always enjoy your life with an extra luxury seat without having to worry !! ",

And even a rich family gets more honour as compared to middle or poor class family. But it is not only the need to be happy. And even its not necessary that every rich family is a happy family. Though money can buy all the goods but can not buy anyone's love, care, sympathy, respect. And without all this no person in the world can survive happily. Without money everyone can survive but without happiness no one can be alive\u2026they can be physically alive but mentally that person will be dead. Money is important but not most important! ",

(Nope,not even a penny to heaven.) Money is something that needs balance. Once you tip off the balance, it starts to play with your mind. Since we have all conditioned ourselves to become more,to have more,to enjoy more,more,more,more \u2026.more than what is actually required, the equilibrium is actually lost. Suppose I have loads of money,I won't be satisfied with spending it normally,I'd always be searching for something to buy,it may not be what I surely need, but I just want it because I liked it. The greed never dies man! It's inherently in human genetics as I like to call it so. Haha. So if I have less,I might be depressed or malnourished or whatnot. So yeah,everything needs a balance, both money and your mind. ",

            "answer_text": "15 years ago, I wanted to be a priest. I didn't want to join the rat race, so I chose to work in a non-profit company until the time I could join the seminary. One day my dad later asked me, \u201cSon, how's it going? Still don't want to join the rat race?\u201d \u201cGreat, dad!\u201d I said. \u201cIt's going great! I see all my friends struggling in the rat race. I'm glad I'm not in it.\u201d \u201cSon,\u201d he said, \u201cso long as you use money, you're in the rat race. Don't kid yourself that you're not.\u201d And he was right! I may not have thought I was in the rat race, but I was. Later, when I decided not to pursue religious life anymore, I realised that at the age of 27, I knew almost nothing about money and how it works. I realised that I was stuck working in a non-profit and my pay was never going to be very high. I had to learn how money works and how to make it work harder for me. Three years later, I fell seriously ill and could not work for a year. Having money in the bank tied me over and paid for my wedding. When I went back to work, it was in a job where I taught people about money and how to make it work for them. I'm still doing it. Money is an enabler, a lubricant and fuel for life. It's not the most important thing, but it affects everything else that's important to me. ",

Those who thinks there are more important things than that are clearly living in a delusion and you can bet that they don\u2019t have too much access to this market (poverty). It is like asking that the air is really that important for us? ",

It applies completely in today's world. Ofcourse there are few exceptions who by their work and commitment in particular areas are famous and well respected but how many are they if we compare them with 1.21 billion population of India. Even though you don't want to be famous . You just want to live an ordinary life. Then also money is very important as a famous saying \u201c poor people have no friends\u201d Thirdly what will happen to your life or your family's life tomorrow is not under your control. But definitely no one would want to suffer jus beacuse of lack of money for best treatment. Fourthly another wise saying, money can't make you happy but it is better to cry in a BMW than to cry in a cycle. ",

Entire economies can run this way: both the Soviet Union and China were doing OK and growing quite fast before a new generation of leaders decided to change this.  (This gets denied by the dominant New Right ideology, but you can find the hard facts at The World Economy: Historical Statistics by Angus Maddison. He was not at all pro-Communist or pro-Chinese, but his project was to give accurate estimates of growth wherever these could be found.) A few centuries back, most people were peasants growing their own food and making most of what they needed for themselves.  And what other goods they consumed were mostly produced locally by people they knew.  Some people could live without money. ",
