            "answer_text": "Sure. I\u2019m 19 so you\u2019re in good company. I have been writing for about six years now so I have at least a few things I could contribute with. Here are a few things I\u2019ve picked up from a lot of trial and error since I started. Know that what you make the first 50 times will be stuff you would be embarrassed to ever see the light of day. Keep going despite this! If you stop while you suck you will suck forever.Show don\u2019t tell. Instead of writing that someone said something angrily, describe their body movement as they say it. Don\u2019t dictate the story to the reader, show them.Realistic dialouge does not usually use complete sentences, train yourself to write things organically. (I still slip up on that one sometimes.)You don\u2019t need to sound Elizebethan to have something sound profound, a modern day Shakespeare would not sound like he came from the 1600s.Learn story structure! This is so important! After I took the time to learn how proper story structure works my writing evolved further in two weeks than my previous two years of fumbling around in the dark. I recommend the \u201cstory embryo\u201d, google it. There are more things to learn like the three act structure and the heroes journey and such as well.Don\u2019t follow these story structure models as gospel! I know I am contradicting myself a little here but the last thing we all need is another heroes journey knockoff! Learn the rules so that you can bend them later.Don\u2019t write what you think people want to read, you will never amount to more than middle of the road this way. Write something real and that\u2019s true to you, you need to be your creations first and biggest fan, and that is hard to achieve when you are just parroting what you think others want to hear. You are a lot more like other people than you might think so don\u2019t think you will alienate the audience if you are honest in your depictions of your characters.Don\u2019t call yourself an \u201caspiring\u201d writer, call yourself a writer until you can stop feeling like you can\u2019t fill those shoes.Oh and don\u2019t create a Mary Sue, power fantasies have a place and all but there are enough of those on the market, ALL people have flaws, even the \u201cperfect ones\u201d and they have likely worked hard to be good people. Don\u2019t chalk that up to just purity of heart.Lastly, you will fail, a LOT. You will have worked on something for months and it will die in your hands, I guarantee it. Learn from every failure and don\u2019t be afraid to try again with something new while acknowledging your previous failures.I am where I am right now thanks to continuing to do this and not quitting in the face of failure, I have started and failed a large amount of projects and only now am I in a position where it might actually look like my work will see the light of day. Best of luck to you and your writing! ",

            "answer_text": "Wording of the question when I answered: What advice would you give to an aspiring teenage writer? Keep writing. Write every day. Writing is not a talent you receive fully formed at birth. It is a skill to be learned though practice, like playing the piano.Write to be good at it, not to be successful. At any given time, in a world of seven billion people, there are probably less than a thousand \u201csuccessful\u201d writers, where success means both widespread recognition and serious financial gain. But there are lots of ways a good writer can make an adequate living as a writer.*Write until you can make the words go together artfully to express thought the way notes go together beautifully to express music.And read everything! * I remember a conversation I had with a friend who had been my documentary cameraman and then went to Hollywood and made his living as a screenwriter. (I thought one of his scripts would receive an Academy Award nomination, but that didn\u2019t happen.) During that same time I had written a couple of books and lots of scripts for documentaries and information videos. And we were standing around one evening sort of good-naturedly complaining that success had eluded us, when I said, \u201cBut, Jack, we\u2019ve been able to make a living all these years without having to do any actual work.\u201d Always remember the words of Eric Hoffer, who supported himself working on the docks as a stevedore while he was writing highly acclaimed books on philosophy. Some journalist ask him, \u201cIsn\u2019t writing your books hard work?\u201d To which Hoffer replied, \u201cIt beats lifting something.\u201d ",
