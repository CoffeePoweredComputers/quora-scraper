            "answer_text": "My students joke that they write their essay in the fifteen minutes before class. Some of them are pretty good. But, if you would like to write a comprehensive essay, you might want to take more time. Also, to reduce the number of mistakes, allow some time to edit and re-write. In order to give yourself some gravity, perhaps before writing the essay, sketch a frame work or outline. So, minimum, give yourself a week. ",
