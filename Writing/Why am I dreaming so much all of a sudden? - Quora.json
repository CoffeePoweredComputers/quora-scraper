            "answer_text": "It is true that things in your life situation can evoke dreams that communicate your unconscious reactions to the situation. You\u2019ve given us no details about your dreams, but I\u2019ll try to give you some guidelines and let you figure out the rest. The more real the dream seems, the more likely it\u2019s important. Repeated dreams are also important. Keep a dream log by your bed and enter the dream as soon as you awake. Even a 2 minute delay can let important dream details escape. Be sure to record the date, the feeling tone of the dream, and any real-life events that may relate to the dream. Don\u2019t bother with dream books or sites that list dream symbols and their alleged meanings. (e.g., \u201cdreaming of an aardvark means you will find money.\u201d) About one dream book in twenty has useful general information. You are the best interpreter of your dreams; a dream specialist can only assist you in the process. Truly prophetic dreams are extremely rare. I\u2019ve heard of a few. If your dream contents are very disturbing, consult a medical doctor who can refer you to a competent therapist for analysis. Don\u2019t wait\u2014some dreams indicate the presence of serious physical conditions. If you often dream that you are in a confined space and trying to get out or to crawl through it, you may have sleep apnea. Again, check with your doctor, especially if you find you\u2019re short of breath when you wake. Sometimes dreams flow profusely when a person starts therapy, as if the unconscious mind wants to help the therapist make fast progress. Don\u2019t omit dream or real world details when working with a therapist. They\u2019ve heard it all before. A good therapist will use whatever model they believe fits the client best, whether it\u2019s Jungian or classical Freudian or another. Some schools of Psychology no longer include therapy requirements for students in their curriculum, but say it\u2019s \u201chighly recommended.\u201d Draw your own conclusions. Be careful of \u201cChristian counseling.\u201d It\u2019s a little like hiring a priest to fix your car\u2019s transmission. If you decide you\u2019d be most comfortable with Christian counseling, before you start, at least ask the therapist for the name of their school and a copy of its curriculum. Some Christian-focus school curricula are as thorough as secular institutions. Some are not. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe I\u2019m I\u2019ve been in a similar situation to yours. I had a period of about 15 years, in the eighties through nineties, in which I dreamed up a storm almost every night, with long, complicated, and semi-coherent stories unreeling so effectively in my sleep that I could remember a string of five or six in detail upon waking in the morning. Then that tapered off, and 2 decades of sporadic dream recall passed; and now the pace is picking up again. I don\u2019t know why the dream-memory shifts and changes, but it could be a change in concerns and mental activity at a particular period in your life (have you had a significant birthday recently \u2014 30, 40, 60? Had a change of residence and friends, change of school, deaths close to you? Started what we call the mid-life crisis?). It could be that your subconscious has things to say to you, but you don\u2019t make any time for listening to it (sometimes meditation helps to clear the channel, or getting more sleep, or doing demanding physical exercise). And it could be just that for many people, there are dream floods and also dry patches as a manifestation of the ebb and flow of changes in your thoughts and perceptions as you mature. If I were in your position on this, I\u2019d keep a dream journal for a few months, and read your notes back to see whether there are themes that keep showing up. If so, meditating on those particular dreams might shed some light on the underlying messages. ",
