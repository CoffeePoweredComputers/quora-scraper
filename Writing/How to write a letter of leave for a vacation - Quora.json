            "answer_text": "The most important thing when addressing correspondence to your employer: never assume too much familiarity; do not assume you are appreciated and respected as a fixed condition! [Do not assume an employer knows exactly who are you as an employee.] Employee/employer relations evolve: your work environment might seem casual or informal, but being overly \"chummy\" w/correspondence is not appropriate. It seems a request for an extended leave should only be initiated for good cause: if you are not owed vacation time\u2014per an existing agreement\u2014it might be wise not to ask at all, but if you choose to persist\u2026 It can be a memo form or formal letter, depending on your employer. A memo form simply has a date\u2014centered at least 3 blank spaces down from the top of the page\u2014and then \"Attention\" line [starting at the left margin, 2\u20133 blank line spaces down from the date line]. A formal letter has the company name and address\u20143 blank line spaces down from top of the page\u2014at the top of the page left margin: drop down 2\u20133 blank line spaces to center the date and then use an attention or salutation line that begins 2\u20133 blank line spaces below the date; \"Attention: \u2026\" or \"Dear Employer Name\u2026\" starts at the left margin. And then drop down 2\u20133 blank line spaces to begin the body text at the far left margin, with or without paragraph tab indention. Example\u2026 \"Dear or Greetings Mr./Ms. Employer Full Name\", My name is [\u2026] and I am an employee of the [name your] department [exact work position] who has a very consistent work attendance history to prove I have not yet experienced any leave of absence for vacation or other reason during the time of my [however many months, years, days] of employment. [If you have been congratulated, elevated in position for good work or otherwise overtly appreciated by your employer or supervisor at a previous time, mention it correctly in the second paragraph; each paragraph should have a least one blank line space down from the previous one and all paragraphs should start at the left corner of the page margin, with/without tab indentation of the first sentence to each paragraph.] \"If you will please recall: I was voted as the best departmental accountant just three months ago. I felt most honored and honorable to learn my most diligent work towards your concern was noticed and appreciated.\" \"However, my request for your attention at this time is not necessarily related by reason: this communication is a request for an extended leave, starting\u2026 [starting date] and then returning with renewed vigor [return date].\" [Declare your work ethic responsibility during a 3rd paragraph, then wrap it up: don't blab, don't grovel, don't try to suck up; don't offer explanations about what you plan to do with the time off, unless it's for relevant for education that will enhance your employment ability\u2014do not express notions of being abused if not getting time off\u2014and don't try to belittle or issue reprimand to your employer if he/she chooses refusal.] \"I am aware that the company schedule or agenda to which I am not yet privy might cause my leave of absence at the time I am requesting to be inconvenient; I would not request this leave if I knew of any issues that could arise during my suggested time of leave. \"I respectfully await your decision to the matter.\" [Drop down 2\u20133 blank line spaces for closing salutation line at left margin.] Sincerely, [Drop down 2\u20133 blank line spaces: type your full legal name, then your job title; leave enough space between \"Sincerely\" and the typed name line to sign your full legal name. Your handwritten signature should not include your job title after it. After the typed name/title line: you might also type your direct to you telephone number and email.] Signature Your full name, your job title [and if it seems necessary for the employment situation], your work phone number direct\u2014not your personal cell or home phone number\u2014and your specific work (only) email address. Memos do not have a \"Dear or Greetings\" line under the \"Attention\" line; a memo does not get a \"Sincerely\" line. But to conclude a Memo does still require at least your full name and job title typed 2\u20133 blank line spaces below the last line of the last paragraph, starting at the left margin. Memo or a formal letter should have at least 3\u20134 blank line spaces left at the bottom of each page. ",
