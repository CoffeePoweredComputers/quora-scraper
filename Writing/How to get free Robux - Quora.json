Make a game w/ game passes.Alright, so you do know that the most popular games with expensive game passes on ROBLOX are made by creators who gain tons of robux each week, right? When you buy a game pass from a game, it sends the robux you spent to the game developer. If you are the developer of a popular game, with game passes, you are very likely to go to your homepage to find out you have a certain amount of Roblox Dollars(Robux. however much you made the gamepass) 2. Make clothing that people can buy You can make T-shirts, Shirts, Pants, and hats(maybe not hats but yeah). once you do, people can buy it and you gain robux from that. 3. Join a giveaway There are groups out there that distribute free robux to accounts. they do this by putting robux into group funds, then they go to \u201cDistribute\u201d and give people robux. Those are the ways to get free robux.The people who said no need to play the game more. ",

I know from experience, once i had an account with like 10k robux but there was this sponsered game and it looked really interesting so i tried it. It asked for my username and password, so i gave them my roblox username and the same password i used for my roblox account just so i could remember it. I thought mabey it was a game where you made an account to play and save your stuff, but then it said \u201cyou have won 1000000000000000 free robux and a Domino Crown!\u201d I got really confused and left the game then i went to bed. the next morning i saw that my account was HACKED. So that is why there is no way to get free robux besides selling game passes etc. ",

Players buying Robux are the only thing keeping the website and client up and running so that other players enjoy the games. Believe it or not, maintaining a website costs money, and Roblox charges a small price for Robux so that it\u2019s reasonable, yet enough to keep the site up. So this brings me to ask this question: Would you want Roblox free to play with the option of paying for Robux, Make Roblox a large one time purchase so that everyone can access everything (this would be impractical because the price of the game would get up into the tens of thousands), or would you have everything free, but you wouldn\u2019t get to play any games or access the site at all?

Never give your password away. No one needs it but you. Most of the items I have on my account is from the Robux I earn by doing those surveys. What is happening here is that you are trading information for a currency. Just be very careful before doing anything and be sure to have the stuff to protect against malware.

And in YouTube videos, you can see their robux changing, which they only used a feature called \u201cInspect Element\u201d. That feature can change the look of a website, but it can\u2019t really change the website. For example, you can use it to look like you got 1 million robux, but you won\u2019t be actually granted. It will only go if you refresh the page, and you have to start again. However, some websites do grant you some robux, just saying, so not all free robux websites are bad.
