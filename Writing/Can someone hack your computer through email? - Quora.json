            "answer_text": "If you open the attachment or open the given link(s) then you can be hacked easily hence answer is Yes.But can someone get hacked by just opening email? Answer is Practically No. Let\u2019s analyze all scenarios:- Scenario 1:- Hacker may use email tracking techniques, such as including 1 pixel image (read invisible) in the text, that image is located on hacker\u2019s server. When you open the email, that image is loaded from the hacker\u2019s server and your IP address is recorded. That\u2019s the most hacker can do. Now hacker is left with your IP address. Difficulties in hacking someone by just knowing his IP address are:- Almost every home PC has dynamic IP addresses, hence targeting someone by IP address doesn\u2019t work on most occasions.Even if IP address is static or hacker gets enough time to attack on dynamic IP address. The computer would need to be visible from the Internet (most home PCs aren't, they are behind NAT) .Provided both the above points are in favor of hacker (static IP and no NAT). Then there must have to be a service listening the incoming traffic with either a stupid password, or a vulnerability for which you have an exploit.In nutshell hacking a home PC by using only IP address is highly unlikely to occur. Scenario 2:- There is something else to the story. If you are using a Mail Client (not webmail) then something like this can happen. Many mail programs analyze attachments and generate a thumbnail image. If there is a vulnerability in the library used to generate the thumbnail, you can be attacked through that. This is only theoretical concept, i don\u2019t know if this ever happened or not.Years ago Microsoft Outlook had a vulnerability which allowed emails to run JavaScript code and infect your computer. However, this vulnerability was fixed. Emails cannot use JavaScript. It needs to have great knowledge, sophisticated and specifically targeted attacks to carry out above given hacks. You can conclude that, as long as you are using up-to-date software including your Mail Client, Browser, Browser Plugins, and Operating System. You should be able to open email messages and view them without fear. Thank You\u2026!!! ",

            "answer_text": "If a hacker gains access to your email they can cause all kinds of damage to you and others, such as: Get access to your online accountsToday many people use their email address for quick access to Google, YouTube, social media sites like Facebook, online shopping and so on. What\u2019s worse, people often use the same password for many of these, making it even easier for a hacker to access them. But even if they don\u2019t necessarily know the password for these sites, as they already hacked your email and know the password for it, they can simply hit \u201cforgot password\u201d and get it that way. Gain access to your personal informationOnce they have access to your social media sites hackers can also use it to glean your personal information from it. They can, for instance, if you haven\u2019t enabled privacy protections on Facebook find out who your friends are and see your pictures. Steal your financial informationOkay, let\u2019s say you\u2019re not overly concerned about someone seeing your Facebook pictures. What should concern you however is them getting access to your financial information. A lot of us have at some point sent our credit card information over email. In the same manner, a hacker might also use your email to get your online banking information. Once they have those, they might as well have your credit card in their pocket. They can send phishing emailsEven if they don\u2019t have your email password, but only know the address, spammers can still cause damage by using phishing tactics. They might do this in one of two ways. The first is to send you a fake email posing as a legitimate website that looks like it came from a popular service. For instance, you might get an email with a link to a fake PayPal site. Depending on the skills and the effort the scammer put into this, the fake website might look 99% identical to the actual PayPal site. From here, you\u2019ll be prompted to leave credentials and with this in hand, the hackers can gain access to your real PayPal account. They can blackmail youSo maybe stealing your money isn\u2019t enough for the hacker. They might also want to ruin your reputation. Now, you might be thinking \u201cthis won\u2019t happen to me\u201d and you might be right. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re a public person, perhaps a politician, and the hacker has something you don\u2019t want publicly known. Well, you\u2019re going to have to pay them to keep their mouth shut. ",

            "answer_text": "Lucas will confirm the truth of this story: The easiest way to crack a system using an important password is often \u2018People Hacking\u2019 - just ASK someone who has it for the Password. Just one example of many: years ago, I was consulting to a sizeable company. I had visited the Boss Managing Director several times to set things up/give advice etc. I was presenting to all their senior management -including him - in their Boardroom which was glass walled. Said I would show them how easy it could be as long as they promised that no-one would be punished in any way if I did. They agreed. Asking them to wait quietly, I stood up, walked over to stand near the MD and tapped on the glass wall to get the attention of the Bossman\u2019s Secretary sitting at her desk outside his office a few offices away. She looked up, as did half that floor. I waved, smiled and gestured, pointed at my watch etc. then left the room and went to her. Smiling & confident, I explained that the Boss wanted a couple of reports from his PC and had asked that she help me get them (I knew that there was better than 90% chance that she, like most Exec PAs would have had a similar call or request from her Boss before when he was away/at home and would have noted down any necessary details in a handy place - usually in her desk). Sure enough, she slid out a drawer on her desk revealing a sheet with the necessary details scrawled down. You can anticipate the rest as well as the reaction when I went back into the boardroom with the Goodies. Everything was on his PeeCee including confidential memos from his own computer \u2018security\u2019 people etc. People are always the weakest link in any \u2018Security\u2019. In this case it was The Secretary AND The Bossman himself\u2026 But it could have been anybody else. ",

This can be via a link or attachment, or by an image (even an image you don\u2019t see, but which contacts a malicious server to retrieve). There are companies which offer \u201csecurity awareness training\u201d to help explain to companies (and individuals) how to keep their data safe, and to avoid this kind of malicious stuff. One such company (and I have no financial interest in them\u2026 I just appreciate what they do) is a company called \u201cknowbe4\u201d. You can Google them. They offer a free security newsletter, which is worth subscribing to. The more you understand the risks, the less likely you are to fall into one of these traps. ",

Mostly organizations are hacked through their employees emails attacker send all of their emails documents and bind backdoors inside them. There is also a method called email spoofing which an attacker use to forward email from an email that already that specific organize use. So no one can image that they receive a backdoor from their own company email. ",
