            "answer_text": "What's the best writing prompt for a creative writer? The one that gets you writing. For every writer, the \u2018prompt\u2019 will be different. For one writer, it may be an anthology call. The theme might be something like women who\u2019ve lost their children, and a large number of authors will immediately start writing their story because the theme speaks to them personally. Another, larger number of writers will try it out just so that they can submit a story and hopefully get published. That\u2019s okay too. They\u2019re writing. For another writer, the \u2018prompt\u2019 will be their writing habit. At 9am, every day, rain or shine, sick or well, they\u2019ll be at their computer, writing. Every rare once in a while they might miss a day because it\u2019s a holiday or they\u2019re on a trip and the time zone change has messed with their groove. But they\u2019ll probably still write sometime that day, even if it\u2019s just to write out an answer on Quora. Yet another writer may be \u2018prompted\u2019 by a strong feeling, or by a view from a cliff, or by a news article that makes them think of a \u2018what if\u2019 scenario, or by an event in their lives, or because they have less than a buck in the bank and they need to write anything and get it published or the lights will go out in thirty days. What will get you to write? Only you can answer that. ",

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the best writing prompt for a creative writer? The one that drives your fingers to the keyboard or your hand to hold a pen, that makes your hands itch to pour words onto the screen or the page. The prompt that launches a rolling rush of words, ideas, dialogue, paragraphs\u2026page after page until you can pause for a real or a mental breath. It might be the melody line in a song. A burst of color from sunlight on a passing bird\u2019s wing. Your own reflection on the side of a car. The arc of a golfball. A photograph from 1927 of Djuna Barnes and Olaf Stapledon at a cafe table in Paris\u2026or one of yourself eating an ice cream cone at age five. Or it might be a stanza of Wordsworth. Or Collins. Anything might be a prompt. Despite the advances of neuroscience, we don\u2019t know exactly how or what or when our creativity sparks into action. I\u2014and maybe you\u2014have pulled off the road to capture a piece of deathless prose (or a less grandiose fragment of a few nearly illegible words). Perhaps better if you ask writers\u2014and all are creative by definition\u2014what doesn\u2019t result in a cathartic moment when we fabricate something from absolutely nothing but our membership in the human race.
