            "answer_text": "Thats the point where people judge life success and sense of seeing and analysing the things. Thats the essence and taste of champion that everyone want to go behind and follow blindly. No one wanted to know those who score slight less marks or those who are still able to get a govt medical college have done same efforts, or will be Studying same medical course and syllabus. No one wanted to know ever how others did efforts though they never come in limelight.( Those who do able to make it while Studying in big brands) Even every coaching institute want to talk or share about toppers but all forget that their so called business and profit is not by only these two, but those in lakhs who blindly join their institution, without even thinking of their own and their own talent. and these have no value once they failed to get a seat. These are the oneswho promote otherswho are champions, in turn get nothing. BUT YES THESE TOPPERS BRING BUSINESS. Thats why in papers and other ads only toppers photo is mentioned. Why Shoyab came to say about five different institute, why not all present across India? That also no one wants to know. They are brilliant no doubt, but Isn't it others are encashing it to pure those who follow and take admissions blindly? To me every those medical aspirants are equal champions like them. Everyone involved in Rat race, and admission is flushed in these markets though everyone know only 5 -10% will be selected from these business markets. No one wants to know what is their own potential, or there are more than 70% selections are to those who are not seen or know these markets, but are sharing the seats with Shoyab or Akanksha. In Education also like Big bazar, or More or any other outlet, sale will be more on its own when you will see more ads, irrespective whether they are selling outdated or duplicate goods. The same is with education institute. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the main reason behind this controversy is because of team Allen, they declared about Soyeb Aftab few days ago and thereafter certain popular pages on social media sparked about him and the director of Allen took him to the LOK SABHA SPEAKER for the introduction, that got the media coverage more, so people came to know about Soyeb and if we talk about Akansha so we can blame the Team Akash, why should Akash be blamed? Akash didn't even organise any felicitation or press conference to declare her result and people didn't come to know about her, and all the social media pages sparked about Soyeb Aftab, that's why she didn't get much attention.
