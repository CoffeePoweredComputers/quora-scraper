            "answer_text": "No. Black magic is a tool of evil, it's source being allied with the Gates of Hades, the demons that direct and affect its energy being citizens of same, and under the employ of Satan [search for magic on The Life of a Demoniac; search also for voices demons]. Those who work that energy in the kingdom of Man are invariably in league with same, and do so to his ends. Those with a sound mind that can hold a focus, and those who can imagine in their minds how or what people, places and things would see, hear, smell, taste or feel to a given target were the conjurers\u2019 intentions fulfilled are capable for practice, in that the more accurately you convey your intentions, the more likely your magic will be granted. But, not anyone capable, can. Channeling, carrying and refining the energy for a given purpose is always a group effort. Behind every conductor that is a black magic practitioner is a train of cars manned by demons, which carry it in various stages of refinement and in various loads along a track layed by the Devil. If there's not enough or the right kind of energy, then actual demons may manually manifest the intentions of the practitioner.  Accordingly, the results of black magic can come from two completely different sources (either energy or demonic manpower), even though they always serve the same ends.  As previously mentioned, it takes more than an ordinary mental picture to work black magic with your mind; but, anything less than what makes sense to each demon along the way\u2014or at least the first one closest to the practioner\u2014will fail to manifest. A practitioner will always find the differences created by the disparate cultures and backgrounds between humans and demons a hindrance until a familiarity is established. Accordingly, relationships are key, and are of the kind formed by a lifetime of familiarity and association between demons and the practitioner. Demons are invariably well-acquainted with the person you see waving their arms and casting spells and what-not, having observed and participated in the lives of the spellcaster from birth, and that with the intention of following them until they are no longer adequate conduits of that energy into the realms of man (even until death).  Having said just those things, you can easily infer that relationships are key, and those don't always succeed. You can also infer explanations for much of what a voodoo witch or priest is and does, and can supplement your observations with supposition about various aspects of their otherwise mysterious lives. Why would you do this, you ask? Because, although only some persons are capable, and only some actually can, all who are capable and do can be saved.  Here is a mere fraction of things you can rightly assume that might compel you to save a practitioner from a life that is not truly of their own choosing, and things that often compel a practitioner to abandon such a life: A practitioner is but one link in a chain of many, none of which you can see, but each of which they just contend with as often as you do with the people in your life. Imagine dividing your time and consideration between two completely different worlds, with one of them set against the other, and then living to any successful degree.As the fleshly end of a train of cargo intended for those also in the flesh, a practitioner has had, has and will have their entire lives planned out for them by the demons that use them to serve a kingdom that enslaves members of ours. There are no life choices available to be considered or made that aren't filtered or influenced by a third-party. Because of the importance and necessity of the practitioner\u2019s role (whose body and mind are physically necessary to transform spiritual into physical, as it were), even the most minute details of their lives are managed and controlled, including how they feel, what they feel and if they are allowed to feel a given emotion in whatever situation for whatever reason.Demons train practitioners for their role in ways we would not understand or with which we would not approve, all for reasons that come from their end\u2014not ours. A practitioner\u2019s perspective of the world is far different than most, which may give them an air of refinement and superiority on one hand, but which leads to alienation and ostracization on the other.Hence, the mysterious, \u201cpriestly\u201d lives by which they are caricatured.  [The arrow points to the three prongs of the Devil's triton, which marks his property; while it is readily visible to demons, it is only visible to man in digital images processed by special technique] Knowing this, such persons deserve great sympathy, I think, which is a good thing to feel for them for any effort to help them break free from service to an evil agenda. That's done, of course, by members of the only known establishment to ever withstand prevailing by the Gates of Hades, specifically, Christ's church, which has grown from 12 people since it started to 12 billion* in the present [see BIBLE | Is your church a real church? Are you a world-aware Christian? [Proverbs 14:25]]. *Christians never die, they just sleep for a time. The process requires a deep bond rooted in love, the impetus coming from a thorough understanding of the nature of someone\u2019s suffering. Once you personally witness that there are no viable choices within (and no easy escape from) a person\u2019s life that was shaped to serve the minions of a kingdom committed to the destruction of men, an understanding is easy to achieved, and sympathy easy to feel. A church is comprised of members whose goal is to infuse the love of God in their lives, and direct that to the benefit of others. Consequently, Christians and voodoo people are a perfect match (and churches who aren't pleading for the souls of such persons, and who are not finding and developing avenues of escape for them, but are instead berating the entire body of people to the exclusion of addressing each person on an individual basis, are anathema to its Founder. The church is refuge, and inviting to all who are weary and would seek rest; and, not a place of condemnation and judgment).

            "answer_text": "Depends what you call black magic. If you mean can we curse someone or cast a spell on them invoking the demons to do our dirty work then yes. But only to the extent that the victim believes in black magic. The Witch Doctors in deepest dark Africa still point bones at people. Those who believe in these dark arts believe they are cursed and effectively carry out the curse on themselves. On the other hand, if you mean can we invoke the powers of the demons to do something physically impossible, breaking the natural laws of the universe then no. There is a branch of stage magic called Bizarre which as Max Maven put it \"references a larger magical world beyond the boundaries of the performance.\" This uses horror and supernatural imagery in addition to standard magic effects. The magician may tell you its black magic but it is not. It\u2019s standard magic with a weird and untrue explanation for the sake of theatrical authenticity. It is quite amazing what can be done with a little unseen manipulation but don\u2019t let that fool you. It\u2019s not the demons, just a very clever magician who prefers you to believe in the spirit world. The danger here is that people like John Edwards want you to believe they can talk to the dead and that is where this whole thing gets downright abusive. They are giving people false hope but are not being truthful. They are using simple tricks to con people out of their well earned money for a little bit of ill founded relief. That\u2019s where the magic is black and dangerous. Psychics, astrologers and faith healers are the same. They will make grandiose proclamations about your future based on how they \u201csee\u201d it or the position of the stars at the time of your birth. But they have no need to provide proof and will often blame you for your lack of faith when these things don\u2019t happen. That\u2019s the real black magic - using gullibility, fear and superstition to take your money. ",
