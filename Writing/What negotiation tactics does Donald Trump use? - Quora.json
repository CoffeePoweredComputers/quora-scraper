            "answer_text": "Q. What negotiation tactics do Donald Trump use?  Summary answer: (1) Short answer: Use extremist, intimidating type negotiators.Start from extreme negotiating position baseline, thenprogressively moderate position.Present an illusion that you\u2019ve conceded substantial ground to the opposition. (2) It\u2019s a very simple strategy, commonly used by negotiators all over the world. You and I use it too, subconsciously, from time to time. The difference is that Trump has SOP\u2019ed the process. (3a) Appoint a Negotiator known to hold extreme views/positions on the matter/issue. This may be Trump himself (his reputation is well-established in this respect), orillustratively, the \u2018most vocal critic of China\u2019 for the purpose of US-China Trade negotiations. (Donald Trump appoints China critic Robert Lighthizer as chief trade negotiator)The appointment itself is an implicit proxy statement of the going-in position for the negotiation, way before the first negotiation word is bantered. Also serves as a forward intimidation device to mess up the opposition\u2019s mental backoffice. (3b) When the negotiation begins, start with the most extreme, threatening, hardball, outlandish position. (Example: What issue would irk China most? Answer: 1-China Policy) Hold unwaveringly firm to this stake in the ground, even if it\u2019s incredulous, ludicrous, laughable, even if mocked. This is the baseline. (4) Then, negotiate from this polar position,inching towards the center of the spectrum,giving the illusion that alot of ground has been conceded to the opposition.(5) Complement the above with extreme, vague, outlandish tweets and public pronouncements, to mess up,wind upthe opposition.(6) Related: Sam Qwato's answer to What do you think about Trump's choices for his cabinet?

            "answer_text": "The biggest one is to \u2018anchor\u2019 very high, i.e., make outlandish demands or statements to put people into what is now called the Trump Derangement Syndrome so he can misdirect them and keep them busy attacking him rather than concentrating on the real issues in front of the American public. He also uses the media to keep him alive on most shows that denounce him. It stems from the principle: Talk about someone positively or negatively but talk about them all the time. Since the democrats hate him so much and keep attacking him, it keeps them from making policies that would be acceptable by the American public. Another strategy is to repeat what Clinton, Obama, Pelosi, Schumer said about the same policies he\u2019s promoting to that they attack him on it while forgetting that they had the same opinion in the past. See their opinions on the wall in the past and their position now about the wall. Another example is when Trump recently offered fast food for the winning team. He personally paid for the various hamburgers, fries, etc. and got criticized about it, while Obama had flown in hot-dogs and charged it through your tax dollars to pay for it. Obama was never criticized about that. You will notice, too, that whenever Trump is called a racist, white supremacist, bigot and whatever else, you will see a video clip of him proving the contrary even though mainstream media mostly censors that kind of response so they can keep the usual talking points alive. Until the Democrats realize what Trump is doing to keep them at bay, they will lose a lot of battles before any war is won. He has the ability to set people up so that they lose. As long as they keep playing Trump\u2019s games, they will not win, especially when they give the impression that their hate for Trump is bigger than what is best for the American people such as security at the border, jobs, insurance for all, etc.. It\u2019s actually quite fascinating to see the manipulation games in action, almost live every day. A lot of the tactics are not visible. ",
