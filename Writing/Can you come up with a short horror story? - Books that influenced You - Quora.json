            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s give it a shot, and for your information, dear readers, this would be my first attempt in this genre. ****************************** The Broken Tooth ****************************** This lockdown has locked us all up in our rooms, especially for college teenagers like me who are living all alone far away from their homes. Finally, after the end of the lockdown, I decided to go out and get some fresh air. I took the lift and went to the parking near my car, from back came a voice : Watchmen: \u201cWhere are you going Sir?\u201d Me: \u201cJust to get some fresh air, Why?\u201d Watchmen: \u201cSir, she is my daughter \u2018Preeti\u2019, it\u2019s been months since she has gone out, Do you mind taking her out with you for some time?\u201d Watchmen: \u201cActually, my wife is not here, and I cannot leave because of my duty, can you please take her out with you, please sir.\u201d His words were very hopeful and above all, I looked at her, a 4-year-old girl with a cute pony tale holding her doll looked at me with the cutest smile and a broken middle tooth. I couldn\u2019t resist her smile and agreed to take her out with me. She was utterly quiet and did not speak a word but kept on smiling shyly at my poor jokes while I was driving. \u201cYou know what, you can have my extra teeth if you want, anyways it\u2019s of no use for me,\u201d I said making another lame joke just to break the silence. For the first time she looked right at me into my eyes and with no smile at all, it was weird. There was something weird about the look that she gave me. The car had become completely silent, no more lame jokes from me and not a single word from her. It was so silent that I could hear the air inside the car. A few moments later she pointed out to a dental clinic, she looked at me as if she desperately wanted to stop me at the dental clinic but I kept driving ahead, and all of sudden her eyes started turning reddish. Her look, her eyes, the silence, all of this had started making me dizzy. So I drove as fast as I could to return back to my hostel. With the heavy breathing and sweat falling all over my face, I finally managed to reach my hostel. At the entrance, I saw the watchmen. Even though he was close to me I shouted out loud, \u201cWatchmen\u201d. He came running at me. Me: \u201cTake away your daughter with you\u201d Watchmen: \u201cWho Sir? I have no daughter, I am not even married\u201d Me: \u201cThen who is she?\u201d I said with anger in my voice. Watchmen: \u201cA doll\u201d I looked at the seat, there was no one but just the doll. I became dreaded, having no idea of what was happening. Have I been watching too many horror movies lately, I asked myself and parked my car and with shaking legs and fearsome body I somehow managed to came to the lift. The lift\u2019s gate opens, there she is, looks at me and smiles with her broken tooth and says \u201cGive me your extra teeth\u201d.

            "answer_text": "This is a short humoro-horror story: \u201cShona, come on!\u201d Ikel cried out from across the chasm. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t!\u201d Leaves rustled nearby. \u201cIkel, I can\u2019t! I\u2019m too scared!\u201d \u201cOkay, calm down! I\u2019m coming there!\u201d \u201cNo! The rope won\u2019t take it!\u201d \u201cShona, either way, you have to take the risk. I know you can do it!\u201d \u201cGrrr!\u201d the monster growled behind me. Without realizing what I was doing, I held onto the rope tight and swung myself across the chasm. As I did so, I felt the monster\u2019s paws score my back. Shrieking, I fell on Ikel. \u201cOkay, now RUN!\u201d We ran as fast as our legs would allow. The monster stamped close behind us. It was near dawn now. We\u2019ve been running in this jungle the whole night, just because of Ikel\u2019s stupid idea of an adventure. Due to bad weather, we had halted our boat on this island. I was brought back into reality by Ikel\u2019s cry. He had stumbled. \u201cOh, you, be careful,\u201d I said as I helped him back on his feet. \u201cI\u2019m too tired.\u201d \u201cCome on, we\u2019re close to the shore.\u201d My tired eyes searched the surroundings. \u201cIkel, that cave!\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cDown there, come!\u201d I dragged us down the slope and our limp bodies rolled themselves into the cave. Our breathing was ragged now. \u201cAre we safe here?\u201d \u201cHope so.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d \u201cMe too.\u201d \u201cShona, see!\u201d he muttered, excited. I searched in the filtered morning light and found ourselves surrounded by Willow trees. \u201cGreat! Knife?\u201d \u201cHere!\u201d he said, handing me his Swiss knife. I creeped out of the cave and carefully scratched a switch of Willow tree. It\u2019s more than enough in this situation. I turned towards the cave but was shocked to see Ikel\u2019s pale face. My body shivered at the thought. Though I knew it was behind me, I fell onto the ground when I faced it. In daylight, I saw it clearly for the first time. Eight feet tall, covered with wild mossy hair and his ugly teeth dripping with saliva, it was ready to pounce on me. I was paralyzed with fear. \u201cShona, the knife!\u201d Ikel cried out. The monster looked up at him. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to let this devil harm my brother! In the next instant, he leaped towards Ikel and I sliced the knife into his belly. Grunting, the monster fell hard on the ground. His blood was sprinkled all over me. Trembling, Ikel walked up to me. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d We hastily dragged ourselves to our boat. When finally on the boat, we checked for any major damages. Thankfully, apart from our soiled clothes and a lost knife, we were alright. \u201cHurry, start the engine!\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t follow us into the boat!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just want to be out of here!\u201d The engine roared to life and we sailed far away from the wretched island. I stood at the deck, watching the sun rise and the islands fade into nothingness.

He's in charge of the \"new\" construction \u2013 converting the kitchen in to the master bedroom for instance, while I'm on wallpaper removal duty. The previous owner papered EVERY wall and CEILING! Removing it is brutal, but oddly satisfying. The best feeling is getting a long peel, similar to your skin when you're peeling from a sunburn. I don't know about you but I kinda make a game of peeling, on the hunt for the longest piece before it rips.Under a corner section of paper in every room is a person\u2019s name and a date. Curiosity got the best of me one night when I Googled one of the names and discovered the person was actually a missing person, the missing date matching the date under the wallpaper! The next day, I made a list of all the names and dates. Sure enough each name was for a missing person with dates to match. We notified the police who naturally sent out the crime scene team. I overhead one tech say \"yup, it's human.\" Human? What's human? \"Ma'am, where is the material you removed from the walls already? This isn't wallpaper you were removing.\" ",
