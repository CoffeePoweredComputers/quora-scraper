            "answer_text": "1. Get out of the house. Go to the reading room, if you have it, or to a library, a cafe, everywhere but home. I cannot work at home, since I get distracted (my windows are never cleaner than when I'm supposed to work from home), and it seems like you have the same problem.  2. Make yourself a goal One of my former student assistants had set target for every day; either to write 750 words or for 6 hours every day. So one day he would write his 750 words and go home at 11, and some days he didn't get anything down, and spent 6 hours fiddling with the footnotes. He wrote his thesis in record time, so I've adopted the strategy. 3. Write or die! I have used this, it's a program you write into, and if you stop, it make noices, or even worse, start eating your words. So you cannot leave the screen to surf or wash the windows. 4. Pomodoro technique. A nicer technique than number 3. Write for 25 minutes - don't get distracted!, 5 minutes break, 25 minutes writing, 5 minutes break etc.... I use a normal kitchen timer.  5. Remember yourself, remember to eat healthily, drink water, stretch and go for walks every once in a while.   My office with (not exactly) pomodoro rearing to go! Good luck! ",
