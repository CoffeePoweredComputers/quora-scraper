            "answer_text": "The answer lie with why would the European specifically Northern European and their descendants still drinking milk despite being an adult? Didn\u2019t they feel like they\u2019re violating an animal when they are trying to get their milk? The answer for the question above is it is out of necessity supported by abundance of supply that turned into habits and finally into a culture that have even imprinted in their DNA. As for the East Asian, they didn\u2019t have the necessity to drink milk and the supply of milk are scarce since most cow, bull, ox and etc are bred and used as a farming tool. Due to this, East Asian didn\u2019t even eat beef, at least in the past. Do note that cow milk nowadays are supplied by cow which is specifically bred to harvest their milk. A normal cow didn\u2019t even supplied that much milk enough for both its child and for human. The dairy cows which supplied most of today milk supply are bred due to the demand for milk initially by the Northern European. Since East Asian doesn\u2019t have the necessity to drink milk. It didn\u2019t turned into a habits and eventually culture. As such, it didn\u2019t imprinted in their DNA as in the genetic mutation for lactose tolerance. Do note that all human are born with the ability of lactose tolerance but will lose it once they become an adult. In the case of the Northern European and their descendants, their gene that they had when they\u2019re still a baby, didn\u2019t really \u201cturn off\u201d or in scientific term, the gene have mutated. In addition, drinking milk and eating beef have always been associated by the East Asian with the barbarian diet. ",

            "answer_text": "Because many of us do. Newsflash, East Asians aren\u2019t a monolith. Although it\u2019s true we are genetically more predisposed to lactose intolerance, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll spontaneously erupt into a ball of flames if we drink a small glass every now and then or tuck into a scoop of ice cream. Growing up, everyone I knew drank milk, and the part of the city I grew up in was slightly over 50% Asian. Not only did it come with our school lunches, my parents often made sure that I was drinking some at home to make sure I was getting enough calcium and for the hope that it would help me grow (it didn\u2019t, I still ended up a shorty). Although I am fully capable of drinking a glass or two of milk, eating a little ice cream, and cheese, I still am a bit more sensitive to dairy products than the average American. If I were to have a whole milkshake (they\u2019re too sweet for me anyway), a really large serving of ice cream, or anything more than a small cup of whole milk plain yogurt, my stomach will start shouting at me.
