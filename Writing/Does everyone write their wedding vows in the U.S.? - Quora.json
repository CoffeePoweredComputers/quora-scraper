Myself and other Wonderful Wedding Officiants, can and usually do help with the full wedding ceremony and the wedding vows. Some couples leave the ceremony and vows as written, some alter where they want and others have newer ideas and those ideas are always welcome. Some people freeze when attempting to write out their heartfelt emotions. Others can\u2019t stop writing and everything in between. When appropriate your Officiant is there to help. There are many beautiful and not so pretty wedding vows available on the internet. We may not want to plagiarize, so we\u2019ll use those pre-written vows to inspire our own. Borrow from other\u2019s, writings, poetry, movies, books, TV and such. Talk to family and friends and listen to their comments. Choose what you want. The possibilities are endless. I, as, I\u2019m fairly certain, other officiants are, wanting to avoid, what you, the couple, does not want and include what you do. After all, it\u2019s your wedding, ought be done your way . . . So, you see, not everyone In the US writes their own vows and some do. You may write me, for a free eCopy, of an excerpt (while supplies last), of the soon to be released, \u201cWedding Ceremonies With Beautiful Vows for Inspiration and Adoption.\u201d Have a wonderful wedding and a joyous marriage. Take good care . . . ",
