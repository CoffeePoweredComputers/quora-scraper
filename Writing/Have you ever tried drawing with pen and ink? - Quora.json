            "answer_text": "I do it all the time actually . I had started doing portraits with shading but to move to a higher level , I started urban sketching with direct pen, fine liners , brush pen and water colours . I use pencil sometimes when the reference is more complicated or has mor lines and details are very closely spaced . Hope this helps!!! ",
