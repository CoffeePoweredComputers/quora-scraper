Taking aside the fact that there are many sorts of myths: cultural, social, philosophic, religious and so forth\u2026we\u2019ll just look at the religious aspect. As a hard polytheist, I believe in all of them. However, only a select set (Germanic/Norse) actually inspire me to give worship to the Numinous Beings described therein. The stories are Mythic Truth, which informs my spirituality. It is a Truth for me, and I demand that no one else take up my Truth, freedom of conscience is part and parcel of my personal ethic. Observable phenomena, repeatable scientific experiment, analysis of data, those power my Physical Truth, and that of the world in which I live. So I am quite comfortable with my fellow Meat Puppets who do not hold to any Mythic Truth or hold to a different Mythic Truth, because Physical Truth is where we can hold community. ",
