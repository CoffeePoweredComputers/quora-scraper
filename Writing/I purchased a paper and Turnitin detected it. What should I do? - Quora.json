            "answer_text": "To Madi Hartfield, Your only choice now is to write your own original paper, which should have been your first (and only!) choice when you got the assignment. Next time, start earlier, especially if the topic is outside your field, such as literature but you are a psychology student who doesn\u2019t read books. Learning how to analyze and write your own material is a life skill you will need for the rest of your life, and if you are in school, you are in a unique situation where motivated and educated subject-matter experts (i.e., teachers) are being paid to help you learn how to do this. However, turning in somebody else\u2019s work is plagiarism, and it does not teach you anything other than how to game the system. Warning: Being labeled a plagiarist in one scenario, and thus potentially untrustworthy in other areas as well, can affect the rest of your academic, personal, and professional careers. People may say they trust you, but they will always be verifying what you say. It\u2019s what U.S. President Ronald Reagan famously said about his adversaries: \u201cTrust, but verify.\u201d[1] Here are some tips to get you started on that essay. You can do it! Discard the idea of turning in anyone else\u2019s work as your own. Dishonesty has long-term consequences. Just as in agriculture, you reap what you sow, more than you sow, and later than you sow.Choose a topic or a point of view that inflames your passion, so it will be easier to write about. It also helps if you know a little something about the subject so you do not have to research every little detail.You could ask for more time to write it; however, this will usually mean at least a grade lower for each day you turn it in late. I once had a paper due when I was studying for my master\u2019s, but I had not paid attention to the syllabus, which is another way to say I was not respecting either the course or the professor. The result was I pulled an all-nighter to read the book and write my paper. It was a good paper (but not as great as if I had spent more time on it), turned it in on time, and earned a decent grade. I WAS EXHAUSTED during class, but it was worth it. (I don\u2019t think I ever told the professor I had written it at the last minute.)Chalk this one up to a learning experience, and do your own work from the very beginning next time. Earn people\u2019s trust!You can do this!\u2014Sarah Madden, Written and \u00a9 Copyrighted \u2661 3 October 2020 (updated 16 October 2020)  QUESTION: I purchased a paper and Turnitin detected it.

People have patterns in the way they write and the way the speak Turnitin can recognize those written patterns. As a college instructor for 5\u20131/2 years of teaching the same class I was able to recognize passages students had plagiarised from other sources and not cited them. Imagine what a computer can do since it is infinitely faster than a human. ",
