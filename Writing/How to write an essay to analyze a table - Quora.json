            "answer_text": "Perhaps \u201cAnalysis\u201d or \u201cAnalyze\u201d is not the actual word to describe your assignment. \u201cDescribe\u201d (verb) or \u201cDescription\u201d (noun) is more likely what you are seeking. Of the Four Modes of Discourse (Exposition, Descritption, Narration, Argument referred to as EDNA (a woman\u2019s name) Description is the writing mode that requires the use of Adjectives. What you might do first is do an internet search for adjectives like Adjectives + List: However, you are probably going to need more than just a vocabulary list. What you will need is some guidance about \u201cHow to write a descriptive essay\u201d. So one free website that I found which has some instruction both in adjectives and in writing Descriptive Essays is the following. Guide to Grammar and Writing Adjectives My personal thoughts are that I would describe the wood that the table is from. Knowing this can help get you started. For example: \u201cThe __________wood came from tree on a Malaysian hillside. It was taken by truck to a mill in _________________ and after examination by the mill expert in quality timber, it was decided that the ___________ wood should be cut into 5 centimeter thick planks that were 3 meters long. After cutting, the planks were stored in special shed where the wood as allowed to dry for a period of a year.\u201d (I made all of this up of course, but it is just a suggestion about what might be done. What I did not do was use any of the suggested Adjectives from a website. That is something that a person must learn to do.) What can help is for you to ask a basic question about any object you describe. Ask: \u201cWhat is the essential characteristic (thing, fact, aspect) of this object?\u201d Regarding the legs of the table, a writer might think about the workman who cut the wood, or the kind of saw or saw blade used, and how is the wood treated? Is the wood cut and immediately sold? Is it dried or treated with a chemical? What kind of a tradesman built the table? Was the table built and sent to a \u201cshowroom\u201d where tables are sold? How much was the original timber sold for by the people who cut the tree. How much did the lumber mill sell the planks for? What did the tradesman charge for building the table from the raw lumber? \u2026and on and on\u2026and on.  To be honest with you, I do not like Descriptive Writing and I do not care a lot about Adjectives when the subject is studying English or writing. The reason is that the most important part of English is the Verbs, and the verb Nominalizations (noun forms of verbs) and more than that, the Mental Verbs (called Stative Verbs) Most people trying to practice \u201cwriting,\u201d cannot even communicate their feelings or ideas with any effectiveness. How can they effectively describe an object such as a \u201ctable\u201d. List of Adjective Words \u201cYour Dictionary\u201d is another good free place to find a list of Adjectives. You can find many such websites.  Another thing that might help with writing your descriptive essay would be to find all of the Synonyms for \u201cwood\u201d and \u201cboard\u201d and \u201cplank\u201d and \u201cbeam\u201d. Also, you may want to do another Internet search using these words: \u201cdescriptive writing exercises\u201d.  What may be helpful for you to know is that the Four Modes of Discourse are not an exclusive system. Sometimes, something written will show all Four Modes of Discourse. They can blend together and this can be confusing, when one thinks about writing description and then discovers argumentation, narration, and exposition have become part of what has been written. Mark Twain was one of the great writers of Description. You can find his essay \u201cLife On The Mississippi\u201d on the Internet for free. He was masterful in his description. (Personally, I \u201crespect\u201d Description, but I do not \u201clike\u201d it. It emphasizes the use of Adjectives, and this complicates the learning process and the writing process for those who are studying the English Language for school and academic purposes.  I suppose a  person  might  prefer a  mild  \u201cdescription\u201d  of a  mundane object (which a table is) over  \u201cexposition\u201d or \u201cargumentation\u201d as an early writing project.) ",
