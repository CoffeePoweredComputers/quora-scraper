            "answer_text": "Quite easelly depending on your frame of mind... In this case, painting is 8 letters, thus creating an 8-lined verse. Short and sweet, yet you could repeat the exercise again for verse 2 and verse 3. A more satisfying poem for an A4 sized paper, yet for PC and Internet tablet screens it would be easier as just 16 lines not 24. More chance of appearing without the need to scroll down further. More chance to use a larger font size as well. So you could begin with letter P for Preparation and A for artistic flair and I for Intricate detail and N for Nature and T for Traditional and I for Integrity and N for Nobility and G for Grandeur. Whatever ideas follow on to lead to a finish with finesse and a final flourish. Using basic vowel sounds for rhymes will help with even more ideas and also help children be more interested than struggling with fancy words. If going with that suggestion then you'd simplify the acrostic words for the letters even more. ",
