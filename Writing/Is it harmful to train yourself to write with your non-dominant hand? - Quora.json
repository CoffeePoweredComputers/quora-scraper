            "answer_text": "Yes and no. If you just want to write with your non dominant hand it might not be harmful but if you want to be ambidextrous it might hamper your brain functions as has been revealed by modern research. Until the mid 20th century, there was a hype that ambidexterity increases some neural functions depending upon whether you are left-brained or right brained. However this was only one side of a coin the other was revealed in modern research that being ambidextrous can harm your neural activity.Recent evidence has shown that being ambidextrous from birth can cause children to suffer from reading disability and stuttering,they are at a higher risk of suffering from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and consequently their academics have suffered. In some instances it was found that ambidextrous people performed worse than right-handed or left-handed people especially in Maths and Logical Reasoning. The resaon for such a disruption in neural functions is attributed to competitiveness of both the spheres of the brain.You can increase your proficiency by using your non dominant hand as most pianists do but it must only be to increase co-operation between both spheres of the brain as competition between the two spheres is quite harmful.

The non-dominant hand is actually linked to the non-dominant hemisphere in your brain \u2013 the one that isn\u2019t exercised as often. There are studies that show that when you use your dominant hand, one hemisphere of the brain is active. When you use the non-dominant hand, both hemispheres are activated, which may result in thinking differently and becoming more creative.
