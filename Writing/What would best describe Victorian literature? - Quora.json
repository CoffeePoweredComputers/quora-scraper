            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, the history of modern literature only started just after Queen Victoria died, and all works from her era are strictly proscribed under the Gutenberg Act of 1903, which was passed to ensure that Peter Pan would be the only notable work from this period. Only a few remnants are known to us - the term \u2018what the dickens\u2019 has something to do with being thrown into workhouses to ask for some more pease. Besides it being a time of pride and prejudice rather than great expectations for novelists, playwrights were gaoled for being wilde, and poets such as Tennyson were lariate (that is to say, lassoed and hogtied). Tears, idle tears were shed! Baser works such as The Balloon-Hoax do survive, but only thanks to the piracy laws of the United States, which allowed american writers to both lampoon and harpoon real gentlemen. Another example of this can be found in the writings of the French seditionist Verne, who just made things up for fun (they were obsessed with balloons!) Seriously though, much of what we now consider literature was just very popular in an era when light and literacy were becoming more and more available, in the UK, Europe, and US. These works remain available through Gutenberg and the like, and give us a contemporaneous window into those times. Although literacy would be no means have been universal, rich and poor alike would have read to each other in a time before radio, TV, internet, and such. The Jungle Book has a librivox reading. Download it, grab a turnip to nibble on, close your eyes and listen. For a more complete experience, have a bucket of horse manure nearby. ",

            "answer_text": "I can only compare with my reading experiences of earlier and later literature. One thing springs to mind immediately. I remember writing at the end of my 1984 college freshman essay about Oscar Wilde: \u201cIf writers would have kept on writing like the old bugger, way into the 20th century, nobody would have bothered making something out of this tech fad called cinema, and \u201cWinning an Oscar\u201d would have meant something entirely different, today.\u201d For the life of me: I can\u2019t remember whether I nicked that or not. Our commune of Wildish Drama Queens at RITS Brussels Film and Television School was an autonomous anarchy-syndicalist collective, with shared common intellectual property. It is no surprise at all that the Victorians were obligatory reading at Cinema schools for most of the 20th Century. They made feature films, before the technology was even available. If you want to see a really really really good movie: read Charles Dickens. He will turn you into your own inner Steven Spielberg, after a couple of chapters. I consider the Polish national Joseph Conrad, and the Americans Poe, Twain and Melville as the very best amongst the Victorians. My countryman Maurice Maeterlinck (Nobel Prize lit. 1911) and the Dutchman Multatuli to me are as Victorian as they come. Culturally, the Victorian Era started with the British Reform Act 1832 .That is five years before Queen Victoria\u2019s coronation. Most English lit buffs agree on that. It is also an important date for my country Belgium, and my City of Antwerp. The city fell to the Belgians in 1832. Leopold King of the Belgians was Victoria\u2019s Uncle and later became her designated Royal mentor. 1832 was also the year of the London Treaty, the earliest beginnings of the EU. To my British friends: Brexit all you like, mes chers amis, but \u201cLa Reine Vic\u201d didn\u2019t vote \u201cleave\u201d last spring, as far as I can recall. :-) ",
