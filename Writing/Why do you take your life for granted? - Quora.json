Poof, gone just like that, I doubt if anyone would even care to ask about my whereabouts after that. 50 years is a very short time and people should not take their life for granted. Everyone should live life to the fullest, I know it\u2019s easier said than doing but to be honest I believe they should enjoy each and every moment of their life. Don\u2019t take life for granted, you never know when it will come to a sudden stop. ",
