            "answer_text": "The Screenwriters Association appears to be an India-based organization and thus I suspect few Americans would have any way of evaluating how useful a membership in it would be. It looks like it has been in existence since 1926, which at least gives it longevity. You would be eligible for regular membership with the sale/production of a significant piece of work (film, television, music), or as an Associate or Fellow, which have accordingly lower barriers to entry. You\u2019ll have to do the research on this since it\u2019s going to be easier for you to determine what current writers in the industry in India who qualify for membership are, indeed, members. It might be worth it to you to invest in a membership at the Fellow level, presuming you qualify, to have access to the resources of the organization, for example, lectures, workshops, or film screenings. (Not saying these will necessarily be part of your membership, but they typically are for American writers\u2019 organizations.) On the surface, it looks legit, but then again, anyone can throw up a website and make whatever assertions they feel like making. Do your due diligence and best of luck to you. ",
