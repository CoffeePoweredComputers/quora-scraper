If you're able to see a good thing even in a bad situation which will drown you in complete sadness , that's a really good attitude. For example, you and your girlfriend are going in  a bike for a theatre to see an awseome movie in a pleasant cool evening, the tyre got punctured , you can either feel grumpy, sad and get angry because you missed the film orYou can enjoy a pleasant romantic walk in the cool evening with your girlfriend , it's all what you choose to be.
