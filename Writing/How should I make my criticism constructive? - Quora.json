            "answer_text": "I was once told that criticism is never constructive! It's just a fancy name for pointing fingers and fault finding. ie \u201cWhy do YOU (always) ? \u201c deliberately shifts the focus off of the accuser. Sometimes it means that the accuser then rightly or wrongly, And sometimes it may even mean that accuser dosnt accept any responsibility or accountability for what happens. Ie\u201d it's them alone to blame, and I DO blame THEM\u201d. Thus he beholds the speck in the OTHERs eye, not realizing he has a bolt in his own eye. To want to HELP someone to see something, or see it differently, or understand the error of their ways is only constructive so long as it is builds or contributes to the other person's development or future advancement. Never is it done to manipulate or control someone else that WE have judged. Therefore, largely it the MOTIVE that is important. The first group wants to break down, accuse and destroy or even annihilate or obliterate. Often one finds this in that \u201ccat eats mouse\u201d, awful game of politics where it's all about the survival of the fittest and how it affects the campaigner, and even it means huring the opponents it is considered legitimate in that they feel that the end justifies the means. So what I was told was that if you really think about it, \u201cconstructive criticism\u201d is actually a contradiction in terms. (One word contradicts the other) . It's either criticism (negative) \u2026or it's constructive admonition which would be helpful advice that aims to build up and not to destroy. The other aspect is that we CORRECT someone because we care about them, and so sometimes we DO need to say something that may not be popular so that they can be helped out of a rut, saved from future damage, protected from hurtful people or situations, or stopped from making a fool of themselves. In this case, NOT to say something would be deeply unloving and uncaring. In the Bible there is a scripture that says I am my brothers keeper\u2026or something to that effect. So especially if it's another believer, he DOES become our responsibility especially since, if I see my brother sinning\u2026by my keeping quiet, it may mean my brother falls into error or even goes away from God. So since have a responsibility to God, as His mouthpiece.. I speak out when something is unfair or unjust., evil destructive or in Godly. (as the saying goes \u201dAll it takes for evil to prosper, is for good men to say nothing \u201c) In this instance ALL is based on my commitment to Christ, and since I love Him, living my life to serve HIM, I love my brother (even if he's slipped up) realizing full well that it could well have been me who was affected. The motivation here then is to redeem my brother so that He can be fully restored. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the powerful skills for a manager is to give a feedback to his team or employees. Feedback is when one person communicates their observations to another. The manager should give feedback to: \u2714 Let the employees know if they are doing a task correctly, to standard. \u2714 Let the employee know what they need to do to improve performance. \u2714 Build the employee's confidence. \u2714 Increase the employee's motivation. How to give an \" Effective Feedback\". \u25b6 Be specific. + Clearly describe your observations; don't judge. + When providing constructive criticism, clearly describe the \"desired state.\" + When providing positive feedback tell the associate specifically what he/ she did well, so that the associate knows what to repeat in the future. \u25b6 Be considerate. + Make sure the employees can get something out of what you are telling them, that will help them improve poor performance or repeat good performance. +Pick a good time to share your feedback. Speak so that other associates/ employees don't overhear your conversation. Remain calm, using conversational language, tone & geatures. \u25b6 Be timely. + Talk to the employee immediately, when you observe it. \u25b6 State why. + Describe the impact; why it is important. \u25b6 Ask questions/check. + Ask, if you need additional information. Make sure the employee understand what you are saying. These are few tips that will help all the managers/ Supervisors give an effective feedback and improve and build a positive relationship with their employees. ",
