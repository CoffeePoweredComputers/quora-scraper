            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to determine the best, firstly due to translating. And secondly, you must choose some semblance of balance between the best they\u2019ve ever written and how well they write consistently. For the former I would go with Vladamir Nabokov, his writing in Lolita is simply incredible. Obviously the subject matter is highly controversial at best. Here is the opening passage, one of the most famous in all literature. \"Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms, she was always Lolita.\" Here are some other that illustrate my point, each word or even syllable seems perfectly placed and chosen. \"There, on the soft sand, a few feet away from our elders, we would sprawl all morning, in a petrified paroxysm of desire, and take advantage of every blessed quirk in space and time to touch each other: her hand, half-hidden in the sand, would creep toward me, its slender brown fingers sleepwalking nearer and nearer; then, her opalescent knee would start on a long cautious journey; sometimes a chance rampart built by younger children granted us sufficient concealment to graze each other's salty lips; these incomplete contacts drove our healthy and inexperienced young bodies to such a state of exasperation that not even the cold blue water, under which we still clawed at each other, could bring relief.\" - \"Through the darkness and the tender trees, we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of sensitive memory, appear to me now like playing cards-presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner of her parted lips and the hot lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves; that vibrant sky seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct as if it emitted a faint radiance of its own. Her legs, her lovely live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it sought, a dreamy and eerie expression, half pleasure, half-pain, came over those childish features.\" He was accused of writing purple prose in other works, however most do agree his prose in Lolita is the finest ever written in English. Back to my original point, for the latter (consistency) I would personally nominate Leo Tolstoy, there seems to always be this focused clarity and perfect flow. Whether a long novel like Anna Karenina or a short story like The Kreutzer Sonata, his writing retains the same legendary style. He tends to describe things in the perfect length, many authors downfall (including Nabokov some would argue) is their penchant for being overly or superfluously descriptive. Rather than list passages I would strongly recommend reading his some of his novellas as they are very short and great reads. The Kreutzer Sonata, The Death Of Ivan Ilych, Hadji Murad, The Cossacks are all personal recommendations. Though in fairness there are many more. A rare author able to excel in both quantity and quality. Honorable mentions - Joseph Conrad, F. Scott Fitzgerald, W. Somerset Maugham, James Joyce, Franz Kafka. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s subjectice, but among fiction writers my vote goes to Hilary Mantel. She writes with a confidence I\u2019ve not seen in any other author. Her historical characters come to life through the authenticity of their voices. It doesn\u2019t feel like writing. It feels like you\u2019re meeting these historical personages for the first time. Unprecedentedly, she won the Booker prize for Wolf Hall (2009) and again for its sequel, Bring Up the Bodies (2012). Here are a few quotes from Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies: His children are falling from the sky. He watches from horseback, acres of England stretching behind him; they drop, gilt-winged, each with a blood-filled gaze. Grace Cromwell hovers in thin air. She is silent when she takes her prey, silent as she glides to his fist. But the sounds she makes then, the rustle of feathers and the creak, the sigh, the riffle of pinion, the small cluck-cluck from her throat, these are sounds of recognition, intimate, daughterly, almost disapproving. Her breast is gore-streaked and flesh clings to her claws. It is wise to conceal the past even if there is nothing to conceal. A man's power is in the half-light, in the half-seen movements of his hand and the unguessed-at expression of his face. It is the absence of facts that frightens people: the gap you open, into which they pour their fears, fantasies, desires. There's a feeling of power in reserve, a power that drives right through the bone, like the shiver you sense in the shaft of an axe when you take it into your hand. You can strike, or you can not strike, and if you choose to hold back the blow, you can still feel inside you the resonance of the omitted thing. ",
