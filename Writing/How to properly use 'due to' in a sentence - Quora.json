            "answer_text": "In its strictest sense, a \u201cdue\u201d (noun) is a debt or an outcome that is to be fulfilled by someone or something; the debt or outcome is also \u201cdue\u201d to the subject (adjective). In most cases, as noted by others, it is a functional synonym for \u201cbecause of\u201d, as you are attributing the effect to a cause - \u201cThe success of this project was due [accredited] to the collaborative effort of the team\u201d. But \u201cbecause of\u201d doesn\u2019t work in sentences such as \u201cA sum of \u00a3100 is due [owed] to the society treasurer\u201d, or \u201cHis train was due [supposed] to arrive at 10:40\u201d. So, when trying to use it in a sentence, see if it can be replaced with \u201cthanks to\u201d, \u201cowed to\u201d, or \u201csupposed to\u201d, and you\u2019ll have a good idea of whether it works.

            "answer_text": "\u2018Due to\u2019 is a causal connective, much like \u2018because\u2019. You could substitute it in place of \u2018because of\u2019. The tone of due to is a little bit more authoritative, as if you are going to be talking about facts or factors affecting an outcome, rather than just explaining things in a more basic spoken way. Eg Due to his failure to comply, he was sacked. He was sacked, due to his failure to comply. The tone is slightly different is \u2018He was sacked because of his failure to comply. The second still sounds like \u2018official information\u2019 but is a more verbal form. ",
