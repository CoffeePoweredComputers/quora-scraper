            "answer_text": "That's a big part of it, but no. Journalism is finding things out and then telling people what you found out. The finding things out part involves interviews but also other kinds of research \u2014 libraries, websites, public records, spending time in the area and among the people you're writing about, and possibly photography/videography. The telling people part involves transcribing your interviews, but also fact-checking, organizing, doing the actual writing, editing, rewriting, and finally publishing/presenting your findings to your audience/readership. If you're so inclined, the whole process is mind-expanding and fulfilling. ",

These explains the people interviewed by the journalist and not the technical content of its writings. But it is indeed that a journalist must have the interesting introduction for who is he featuring. ",
