            "answer_text": "Without context, it is wrong. With the right context, it makes sense. The wrong version is because in standard usage, a reply is a particular type of response. It\u2019s a bit redundant. It could make bit of sense in that you could respond by deleting the email or shredding the letter. That\u2019s not the usual intent however. Within an email context, it makes complete sense. A recipient can reply to an email using two methods: \u201creply\u201d and \u201creply all\u201d. \u201creply\u201d sends the response back only to the sender of the email. \u201creply all\u201d sends the response back to the sender and everyone who was sent the original message. New users of email often respond to emails using \u201creply all.\u201d In many situations, this just clutters up the inbox of everyone else on the email thread. For example, if there is going to be a banquet for 100 people, I might send out and email to the 100 people asking whether they want chicken or fish. An inexperienced email user will hit \u201creply all\u201d and respond with \u201cchicken\u201d or \u201cfish\u201d. The result is that 100 people will now know that the responder wants chicken or fish. If this is done by all 100 recipients, every recipient now has 99 useless emails that they need to deal with. \u201cPlease respond by reply\u201d is a polite way of saying \u201cPlease do not use reply all and spam everybody with your response.\u201d See also Email storm - Wikipedia and the bedlam incident at Microsoft: Me Too!

The first two dictionary searches turned up these words as the prime definition of one another. They\u2019re two-syllable words from the third grade or something. To try to sound formalistic by using both sounds odd to this Floridian-Californian English literature major. \u201cRespond by reply\u201d isn\u2019t idiomatic that I\u2019ve ever heard. Perhaps the OP isn\u2019t referring to U.S. English. If it\u2019s idiomatic somewhere else in the English-speaking world, that\u2019s why people keep doing it. Idioms got their name because they don\u2019t make literal sense but are in common use anyway and are accepted for their common, if illogical, understood meaning. ",

Often, \u201crespond by reply\u201d is added to an email that contains questions or the need for decision to be taken by the recipient. If you receive an email with this wording, it indicates that you should only reply to the email once you are capable of answering to the questions asked. It could mean \u201cDo not send me more of your nonsense, thoughts or excuses until you are able to give me a clear answer on my queries\u201d. It is used in the same way when written \u201cplease attach by reply\u201d meaning \u201cDo not waste my time on yet another email saying that you are \u2018working on it\u2019. Answer only once the agreement is signed by yourself and attached to the email for me to see\u201d. ",
