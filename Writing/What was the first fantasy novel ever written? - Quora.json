            "answer_text": "It sort of depends on what you consider fantasy. Jonathan Swift\u2019s Gulliver\u2019s Travels (1726) has some fantastic elements, but it is usually considered a prose satire in the form of the genre of the traveller\u2019s tale. William Beckford wrote a Gothic novel with elements of oriental fantasy called Vathek (1782). It was an amalgam of the Gothic school with the Arabian Nights. Matthew G. Lewis wrote the Gothic novel The Monk (1796) and combined terror with some genuine supernatural and demons and devils. In the period, it might have been considered \u201cUrban Fantasy 1790s style.\u201d Charles Maturin\u2019s Gothic novel Melmoth the Wanderer (1820) combines a demonic pact for long life with a damned character in search of souls of others. It\u2019s not far in temper from Lewis\u2019 work, but it\u2019s more convoluted and less perverse. George Meredith, a poet and a novelist of the realist school, wrote a pair of oriental fantasy novels in the form of rather baudy Arabian Nights\u2019 entertainments. The books are The Shaving of Shagpat (1856) and Farina (1857). George MacDonald wrote a pair of dream-fantasies called Phantastes (1858) and Lilith (1895). I have somewhat mixed feelings about calling these books because they seem \u201cfantasy\u201d novels in the same sense at times as Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice books. However, MacDonald\u2019s two novels are primarily allegories at bottom, and intended for adults. Oscar Wilde wrote some literary fairy tales that are basically forerunners of the fantasy story. The first notable book is The Happy Prince (1888) William Morris wrote a group of novels that resemble in many respects our modern conception of the fantasy quest novel. His contributions to this genre are: The Glittering Plain (1891)The Wood Beyond the World (1894)The Well at the World\u2019s End (1896)The Water of the Wondrous Isles (1897)The Sundering Flood (1897)Lord Dunsany wrote a number of books of fantasy in the first part of his career, books that have been highly influential. The first was The Gods of Pegana (1905). Dunsany seems influenced by the earlier work of Wilde. Modern fantasy comes out of all of these writers to varying degrees, depending on the personal literary pedigree of a given modern fantasist. It seems pretty clear that Tolkien comes out of Dunsany and Morris to some degree, and gives evidence of having read some of MacDonald\u2019s children\u2019s books such as The Goblin and the Curdie. He was also influenced by direct readings in Norse and Anglo-Saxon, as well as the Finnish Kalevala. E. R. Eddison, who wrote The Worm Ouroboros (1922), was fairly clearly more influenced by Norse saga and Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Writers like Clark Ashton Smith were more influenced by William Beckford, but there is a touch of people like Dunsany, too. Lovecraft was much influenced by Dunsany, but also writers like Arthur Machen\u2019s The Great God Pan (1895) and various stories of weird terror like Algernon Blackwood. Writers like Blackwood and Machen sometimes cross the boundaries into fantasy, but their emphasis was more on terror. The fantasy writer Robert E. Howard was influenced by a different path. His work derives from a mixture of influences: his reading in ancient history, Bullfinch\u2019s Mythology, Jack London, and Rudyard Kipling. The origins of fantasy are complex to trace. It is not in a straight line. There was not a single progenitor. There are several lines of development.

            "answer_text": "It's difficult to trace the origins of fantasy fiction because the setting of modern fantasy novels is usually a mirror image of medieval Europe. And medieval Europeans actually believed in magic. So any fiction written in medieval Europe is going to have quite a bit in common with modern fantasy novels. Some ancient literature such as Nordic myths feature many elements that we find in modern fantasy fiction, but it is important to point out that such literature does not fall neatly under the category of \"fantasy novel\". George MacDonald's Phantastes (1858) is considered to be the first modern fantasy novel written for adults. Some other early fantasy novels include The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900) and Peter Pan (1911). The first massively popular fantasy novel was Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (1954). It remains the most influential fantasy work even today. It is a singularly unique achievement, and is the best-selling novel of all time in any genre. (This list of bestselling novels on Wikipedia is inaccurate because The Lord of the Rings is incorrectly categorised as a series, when in fact it is a single novel that was published all at once. The publisher only divided it into three parts for economic reasons. Furthermore, the claimed 200 million sales for Dickens\u2019s A Tale of Two Cities is highly unlikely and has been dismissed as \u201cpure fiction\u201d.)  ",
