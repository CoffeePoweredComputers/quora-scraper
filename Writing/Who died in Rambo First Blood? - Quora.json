            "answer_text": "No one. Watch the movie carefully. Several were injured but there were no deaths. In the book First Blood, the body count was off the hook, and the Rambo described in the book would have been better cast by Johnny Depp. The author of First Blood in later reprintings talks in depth about why he HATED the movie. The purpose for the book was to show what happens when the violence of war actually is imported into a small civilized town. As opposed to the popular view of \u201cit\u2019s like a war zone\u201d that is touted by people who haven\u2019t experienced the reality of war. ",
