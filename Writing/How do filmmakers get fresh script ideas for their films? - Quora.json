Okay, let me explain\u2026 Did this ever happen to you, you are in the middle of the shower and out of nowhere you are imaging your own made up story?, It may be a derivative of a movie you saw recently but it is still there, in your head. We imagine stuff every day and night ( while dreaming). All filmmakers do is turn that \u201cinside your head story\u201d into a real script, pitch it to producers and get the movie made. It takes a lot of time, patience, and commitment to form a full story. So, dream on\u2026. Turn your own \u201cinside your head story\u201d into a reality and who knows maybe it'll turn out to be a blockbuster. Have a great day. :-) ",
