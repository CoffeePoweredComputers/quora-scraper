            "answer_text": "I am not even sure my school has a specific \u201chomework\u201d policy, but I have not given formal homework in any of my classes for years. As a rule of thumb, I try to keep assignments short enough that they can be completed in a class or two, depending on the topic. If they are not completed in the allotted time, then they become homework, or students have to stay after school to complete it. While many students will not do homework if I assign it anyway - for whatever reason, not all feel this way. In my academic courses, all my university-bound students know and understand that they must work hard and do some homework to succeed. I raise the bar, and while I don\u2019t give a lot of homework, I give some, and the expectation is there because I cannot always give class time to do the work. My less academic courses, rarely, if ever get homework. I personally disagree with the idea homework, in general. It has it\u2019s place, but it should not be used excessively. Students are in school for 6 hours every day, and have to get up early on top, why should I \u201cpunish\u201d them with more school work at home? It is absurd! ",
