            "answer_text": "Shop around and look into your other options first. If you can, run the correspondence by your friends and/or someone who has experience with publishing or law if you can find them and get a second opinion. I just looked up the webnovel site and I don\u2019t think its much of an upgrade from the Wattpad platform, so in my opinion: don\u2019t do it. At the very least ask questions about ownership of your work, what kind of compensation you would recieve, and consider your rights to withdraw and publish in other formats and on other platforms in the future. If the correspondence continues to be shady, trust your gut. Cut it off. If you really believe in your work, self-publishing is a good option especially for your first time publishing, an added benefit being the only person you have to hold accountable is yourself. - Hope this helps ",
