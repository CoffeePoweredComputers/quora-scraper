            "answer_text": "Can Schizophrenia and Dissociative Personality Disorder be comorbid? Schizophrenia: Symptoms of schizophrenia usually start between ages 16 and 30. In rare cases, children have schizophrenia too. The symptoms of schizophrenia fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive. Positive symptoms: \u201cPositive\u201d symptoms are psychotic behaviors not generally seen in healthy people. People with positive symptoms may \u201close touch\u201d with some aspects of reality. Symptoms include: HallucinationsDelusionsThought disorders (unusual or dysfunctional ways of thinking)Movement disorders (agitated body movements)Negative symptoms: \u201cNegative\u201d symptoms are associated with disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. Symptoms include: \u201cFlat affect\u201d (reduced expression of emotions via facial expression or voice tone)Reduced feelings of pleasure in everyday lifeDifficulty beginning and sustaining activitiesReduced speakingCognitive symptoms: For some patients, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are subtle, but for others, they are more severe and patients may notice changes in their memory or other aspects of thinking. Symptoms include: Poor \u201cexecutive functioning\u201d (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)Trouble focusing or paying attentionProblems with \u201cworking memory\u201d (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)NIMH \" Schizophrenia Dissociative Identity Disorder(DID): DID (previously known as multiple personality disorder) is thought to be a complex psychological condition that is likely caused by many factors, including severe trauma during early childhood (usually extreme, repetitive physical, sexual, or emotional abuse). DID is a severe form of dissociation, a mental process which produces a lack of connection in a person's thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of identity. Dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the presence of two or more distinct or split identities or personality states that continually have power over the person's behavior. With dissociative identity disorder, there's also an inability to recall key personal information that is too far-reaching to be explained as mere forgetfulness. With dissociative identity disorder, there are also highly distinct memory variations, which fluctuate with the person's split personality. Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder) There is a significant amount of research demonstrating high levels of co-occurrence between these diagnostic groups. However patients with dissociative identity disorder report more positive symptoms of schizophrenia than do schizophrenics, and schizophrenics report more negative symptoms. Researchers are concerned that focusing on the positive symptoms may result in false-positive diagnoses of schizophrenia and false-negative diagnoses of dissociative identity disorder.

            "answer_text": "Yes , unfortunately , I have been diagnosed with traumatic dissociative disorder and paranoid schizophrenia\u2026I knew from the time I was young I am very different. I have insulated myself and am so lost and lonely that at times I've tried to take my own life. The rage when waking up from O.D. on pills , covered in vomit , urine and \u201cstuff \u201c I don't need to be to specific about never really goes away. I've broken bones from jumping from a bridge , been found acouple of times and rushed to E.R. I've been in mental facilities on and off from childhood. I've asked God countless times to bring me home. You see , both disorders leave me unable to feel or have normal emotions. But I'm well aware of what I'm missing , I obsess in wanting to feel and give \u201c love \u201c . I can't emotionally feel my children ! Oddly enough it heartbreaking ! I can't cry, literally . I want my prize , my soulmate. I've never had anyone in my life , including my children , that have been able to stay . I was a fantastic mother , single , yes. My homes were immaculate , clothes always clean and kept nearly in drawers , beds made , food aplenty . My kids wanted for nothing. That was easy because they were 15 years apart. I went thru phases of trying to be \u201c normal \u201c . The only thing they never had was an emotional bond with the primary parent. I told them often I loved them , gave hugs many times daily. My down fall was that you can't fake instinctive responses. I misqued everytime one was needed. I often wonder if I should have let the father's raise them , but I din't want them to think I din't love them so I just wanted them . I still drive myself nuts with that question. Now I believe I should have , they paid dearly for my ignorance. Well , I guess I've rambled in enough. I hope this answers your question. Have a wonderful life and plz be as kind as you can be to the mentally disabled .\ud83d\udc9d ",

            "answer_text": "Psychiatric comorbidities are common among patients with schizophrenia. Substance abuse comorbidity predominates. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are also very common throughout the course of illness, with an estimated prevalence of 15% for panic disorder, 29% for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 23% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. It is estimated that comorbid depression occurs in 50% of patients, and perhaps (conservatively) 47% of patients also have a lifetime diagnosis of comorbid substance abuse. It has been recognised that pathological personality occurs in the context of SZ both before and after the onset of psychosis. ",

It looks like a clinician has also answered this question, and has seen a patient with both, themself. I don\u2019t personally know much about how DID & Schizophrenia work together, but I have had a couple of psychotic episodes in the past. These episodes were brief, and I was aware I was having them, so i don\u2019t think that counts as the kind of psychosis that schizophrenics have. Thanks for the A2A. ",
