            "answer_text": "\u201cUsually\u201d is an adverb. It denotes how often something is done. In a range of options, it might be considered the opposite of \u201cseldom.\u201d Adverbs have no tense because they are not verbs. \u201cUsually\u201d does not mean the same as \u201cused to.\u201d When someone says he/she usually goes for a walk in the morning, that means the person walks OFTEN, not seldom. In contrast, \u201cused to\u201d is a colloquial way to express a simple past tense instead of using \u201cwas\u201d or \u201cdid.\u201d When someone says he/she used to walk in the morning, that means the person either no longer chooses the morning for the time of exercise, or he/she no longer walks, but might use that time for something else now. Just because the two words begin with the same first two letters, they are no longer closely related nor have similar meanings. The adverb \u201cusually\u201d is related to the adjective \u201cusual.\u201d \u201cUsed\u201d and \u201cused to\u201d might have come from the verb \u201cuse\u201d at one time. Look at its Latin root \u201cutor, uti, usus= use.\u201d You will see it comes from a Latin deponent verb, not an ordinary one in the language. The concept of \u201cusing something\u201d is complex. The words \u201cused to\u201d have become a substitute for an auxiliary verb in the same category with \u201cought to, should, may, might, must.\u201d These concepts do not translate well from other languages into the English language, which does not convey subjunctive modal concepts easily. Therefore, instead of saying \u201cHe used to walk.\u201d switch to \u201cHe walked.\u201d or \u201cHe was walking.\u201d Add in an adverb or adverbial prepositional phrase to explain when or how often. \u201cHe usually walked in the morning, but now he stops at the athletic club before he goes to work.\u201d That means, \u201cHe was walking often in the past, but he no longer walks.\u201d (Note: If you change the position of the adverb \u201cusually,\u201d it changes the meaning! \u201cHe walked usually in the morning. . . \u201c The focus is on the prepositional phrase \u201cin the morning\u201d instead of the verb! It signals that he walked earlier in the day, but now he walks in the evening. So, the placement of the adverb is important.) If he is still walking in the morning: \u201cHe usually walks in the morning even on days when it rains or is cold outside.\u201d That means, \u201cHe often walks, and he is still doing it.\u201d Again, the placement of the adverb between the subject and predicate shows the action of walking is more important than conditions which might preclude the action! The English language is complicated, and American English is different from British English in many ways. I appreciate the opportunity to share from my point of view as a native and lifelong English language speaker living in the USA. My education and witness of the language in colloquial and formal style here may vary from those in other countries. With respect to others in our global community, American English is my first language. I have invested in multiple college degrees learning about it, devoted 41 years to teaching it to students and adults, and spend much time contemplating how to explain it to others on Quora. I respectfully agree when differences are regional, but I speak up when I read a response which is just not accurate. ",
