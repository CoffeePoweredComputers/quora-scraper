            "answer_text": "English naming is really like communism, in which the alphabets are actually meaningless and you dont have much options and everybody\u2019s name is pretty mediocre and same. Chinese naming on the other hand is like capitalism. Depend on parents education level and knowledge in Chinese literature and the time they spend, the name could be extremely simple or extremely sophisticated. few names i consider as sophisticated, for example: \u6797\u5915 Lin, Xi The plain meaning of the first name \u5915/Xi means evening/sunset. But if you combine the first name and last name you get the single chinese character: \u68a6(First name at bottom and last name at top), which means \u201cdream\u201d. Xi Lin is a Chinese lyricist famous for his dreamlike lyricis. \u90ed\u5a49\u5a77 Guo,Wan Ting or Guo,Wanting People pick english names for themselves, but in case you insist to use Chinese pronunciation translated English name, you end up with pronunciation translated spelling. \u5a49\u5a77 are two beautiful feminist Chinese characters, but surprisingly the pronunciation translated spelling in english is already a fascinating term. Since she is a singer and song writer, i consider her English namr is as fascinating as her song. \u5f20\u4e00\u5c71 Zhang, YiShan or Zhang,Yishan the first name: \u4e00(means \u201cone\u201d)\u5c71(means \u201cMountain\u201d)\u2026these two characters are super easy and commonly used in daily life, they are so simple that they should are among te first 10 characters Chinese kids learn in kindergarten. But that simplicity is what set it different from the rest, and if you think carefully it actually could from traditional chinese philosophy of naturalism and taoism. yeah, one mountain, i can already picture a wise old monk preaching about nature and relationship between the universe and human. i personally think if you want a meaningful chinese name, picking characters with good meaning is important, but the meaning or story behind the name is equally important. Parents name their kids because of something, and i believe every chinese kid has asked their parents the question, \u201cwhy im called XXXX?\u201d Before i paint the picture too rosy, i want to assure you that a majority of chinese population have mediocre names. Lol My first name means shining, because an augur said i lack \u201cfire\u201d (One of five elements) energy and my first name have to be fire-related to fill up the breach. A quite common traditional naming practice in China. You can go after complex characters for sure. I have a friend whose name is \u9648\u5929\u61ff, the third character is complex that i guess most people cant write it. I have a African American teacher in high school in NYC. He told us that when he was in China his name is \u767d, so Mr.White. Its kinda fun if racism is not considered. So beside the characters themselves there are so many other factors could be considered or tricks could be played. If you are a english speaker without chinese background, i would recommend you to think about the story or meaning behind the name before you go pick characters. And then, follow the rule of simplicity. I have seen so many people get \u201ccool \u201d chinese characters tattoo. One famous chinese joke about Justine Bieber is that he got a tatoo of \u201c\u4ece\u5fc3\u201d, which means follow your heart. But if you combine vertically you get \u6002, which means coward or frightened. ",
