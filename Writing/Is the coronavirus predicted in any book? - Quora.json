            "answer_text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic has gripped the world with a deadly disease spreading like wildfire, affecting thousands of people. In India, the number of positive cases has crossed the 100 mark and the death toll has touched three people. In a scenario where panic is as contagious as the virus, rumours take no time to become viral. Some stories of uncanny predictions are also doing the rounds. Here's a list: A book from 1981 The Eyes of Darkness, a novel written by Dean Koontz and published in 1981, allegedly predicted the outbreak of a coronavirus. There is a passage in the book that alludes to the creation of a deadly virus known as Wuhan-400, which is named after the place where it originated. Netizens are going gaga over the strange similarity and many are saying that the author was one person who foresaw the occurrence of COVID-19. A prediction in The Simpsons More often than not, The Simpsons is credited with predicting that Donald Trump would become the President of United States. \"The Simpsons predicted it\u201d is a common phrase on the internet. A 1993 episode of the animated sitcom titled Marge in Chains dealt with the outbreak of a mysterious virus that originated in the Far East. The episode focuses on an illness called 'Osaka flu' that spreads through Springfield after residents order juicers from Japan. Nostradamus predicted this? Nostradamus, the 16th-century French astrologer, physician and reputed seer is famous for his predictions. From the end of the world to natural calamities, his predictions are dynamic and mind-boggling. And according to one Twitter user, Nostradamus also predicted the coronavirus. The authenticity of the user's claim is debatable.  'The war of Armageddon' Jeane Dixon was an American psychic who reportedly predicted the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Dixon also predicted that the world would end in 2020 when a 'war of Armageddon' would wipe out the planet. According to netizens, the Armageddon that she was referring to was the coronavirus. End of Days Pictures of a page from a book titled End of Days, written by late Sylvia Brown, has gone viral on social media. Certain lines in the book make it seem like the author had predicted that a coronavirus-like epidemic would attack the world in 2020. Here's an excerpt: \"In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\" All of these predictions may just be shots in the dark. For now, people need to keep themselves safe by following the guidelines shared by governments, medical experts and the World Health Organization.

But any Native American can tell you otherwise. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 [I\u2019m not an expert. I\u2019m synthesizing information so that I can make the best decisions for my business in the next 12\u201336 months. Take what I say with a grain of salt. If you have better information please add it with a comment and link to the source.] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Two years ago I posted on Facebook that viruses were the largest threat to Native Americans. A little bit of xenophobia would have been good for them. My friends were none too kind with their responses:  Pathogens have decimated populations probably since the dawn of time. And they will continue to do so. Lindy Effect The Lindy Effect says that something will be relevant in the future for about as long as it was relevant in the past. The bible has been relevant for 2,000 years. Shakespeare has been relevant for 500 years. Twitter has been relevant for 15 years. You get the idea. Epidemics have been relevant since\u2026 forever. How this compares to Coronavirus What\u2019s notable in this example (Source: Acuna-Soto, et al 2002) from Mexico is that 21 out of 22 million native people in Mexico died from pathogens, around 95% of the population. Compare this to the Diamond Princess where 0.2% of people died. The Native Americans had no immunity to the new viruses, Smallpox \u201cimported\u201d from Europe and Cocoliztli possibly native. But the people on the Diamond Princess seem to have had some immunity \u2014 only 19% were infected despite the close quarters. Perhaps there is some natural immunity among humans to COVID-19. This gives me hope in our current situation that we won\u2019t end up like the unlucky natives 500 years ago. However, decimated populations are Lindy. If it\u2019s been relevant since the dawn of time, it could happen again. In fact it will. Let\u2019s look at what happened back then to see what we can do now to protect ourselves. Why were Native Americans so susceptible? The new world wasn\u2019t colonized by guns; it was colonized by chickens. That probably sounds strange. We were taught that the brutal colonizers killed a lot of people. And they did. But guns didn\u2019t cause the majority of deaths. You see, in the New World people had very few domesticated animals \u2014 only dogs and llamas. You\u2019ve heard of avian flu and you\u2019ve heard of swine flu but you probably never heard of llama flu or dog flu. Because those animals generally don\u2019t pass on viruses to humans. They\u2019re just not similar enough. Europeans living in close proximity to domesticated animals like pigs and chickens built up immunity over time. Then they brought these viruses to the new world which wiped out the native people. The native people didn\u2019t have domesticated chickens to help them build up immunity. This helps explain how we make vaccines. The most common way is with chicken eggs. We inject a virus into a fertilized chicken egg, the virus multiplies and then we extract the virus. We then purify the antigen, a molecule from the virus that our antibodies need to be exposed to. We then inject that antigen into humans who can now get the exposure to the antigen without being exposed to the virus.  Source. A Tangent on Wheels. The reason Native Americans never invented the wheel, supposedly, was because they didn\u2019t have domesticated animals. They didn\u2019t have beasts of burden like oxen or horses. Thus, there was not much use in having a wheel because there was no animal to pull a wheeled cart. But wheelbarrows don\u2019t require beasts of burden. Thus, it\u2019s still a mystery why they never invented wheels. At the very least you can see the utility of the wheel was substantially less for people who didn\u2019t have horses or oxen. Back to the original story\u2026 How can we see it coming next time? This is the hard and the simple question to answer. Simply, anything that happens rarely but repeatedly will happen again and surprise us: Economic crashesWorld warsParadigm shifts in science (Heliocentrism, Newton\u2019s laws of motion, Relativity, etc.)Change of super powers, no super power has lasted more than 1,000 yearsMeteorites hitting the earthNew ReligionsAlien invasions (ok, just kidding about this one)The hard answer is I don\u2019t know how to predict these things. Do you know? Let me know in the comments. I\u2019m very curious. ",

            "answer_text": "No one predicted the Covid19 virus which is a mutation of SARS. It broke out in China and was apparently eaten in a Wuhan restaurant, (perhaps pig that had eaten a bat infected with SARS-2), at the end of December 2019. 36 people from the store were infected and each of them infected 2 or more other people. Others contacted it but had no outward symptoms. China instigated a program to contain the disease which is working now. Many people from Wuhan flew to Italy and Covid19 broke out in the Lombard region of Italy a major manufacturing region which attracts immigrants who live in poor conditions and were devastated. Europe quickly became an epicenter for Covid19 in a domino reaction. The disease was spread by people flying from place to place, cruise ships, etc. Although the Italians were prepared for such an event, they were overwhelmed by Covid19 and determined the only way to cope with it was to contain it so it could not spread. But initial efforts failed and they did a complete lockdown of Italy which is working. 18,000 people have contracted the disease over 1000 have died, mostly elderly people. South Korea seemed to be the best prepared country for such a scourge they were able to contain the disease with the help of the population and were able to instigated a rapid system of testing which reached the figure of 3,000 people per day. The U.S. has instigated procedures to contain Covid19 which include lockdowns in California, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, and Texas. ",

            "answer_text": "Surprisingly YES! This outbreak was predicted 500 years ago by a French Astrologer called Nostradamus. He is know for his book called Les Proph\u00e9ties. The book is know for it's quatrains on future events.  In total, this book has 942 poetic quatrains which predicts all future events till the year 3700 AD. Nostradamus even predicted his own death date and it turned out to be true. This book was first published back in 1555 and has been translated into several languages globally. In one of his quatrains from the second century it's written French Quatrain Le pare enclin grande calamit\u00e9, Par l'Hesperie & Insubre fera: Le feu en nef peste & captiuit\u00e9, Mercure en l'Arc Saturne fenera. English Translation The sloping park great calamity To be done through Hesperia and Insubria: The fire in the ship, plague and captivity, + Mercury in Sagittarius Saturn will fade. Let me break down the translation below, Sloping park - Means the park in Wuhan where people can walk into the water. Hesperia- It's a place in the United States Insurbia- This is in Italy The fire in the ship- This means the trade, commerce and wealth. Plague- Corona Virus Captivity- Lockdown Mercury in Sagittarius, Saturn fading- This means the beginning of Jan 23 and 24. This is when majority of the operations started to get suspended in Wuhan. If all the above clues are combined together, we'll get the message that's conveyed on his quatrain. Nostradamus is also famous for many of his previous predictions like the twin tower incident and world war 2. Mostly his predictions are based on past historical events and as we all know History repeats itself. P.S - This is just my personal view and some may agree or disagree based on their point of views.

            "answer_text": "Such an outbreak was predicted as likely in a research paper, Bat Coronaviruses in China, published in March 2019, written by scientists working in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak in China. Details: Bat Coronaviruses in China, Published online 2019 Mar 2. Authors: Yi Fan, Kai Zhao, Zheng-Li Shi, and Peng Zhou, from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430071, China. Introduction: \u201cFifteen years after the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak, another severe acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) devastated livestock production by causing fatal diseases in pigs. Both outbreaks began in China and were caused by coronaviruses of bat origin [1,2]. This increased the urgency to study bat coronaviruses in China to understand their potential of causing another virus outbreak. In this review, we collected information from past epidemiology studies on bat coronaviruses in China, including the virus species identified, their host species, and their geographical distributions. We also discuss the future prospects of bat coronaviruses cross-species transmission and spread in China.\u201d The prediction comes in this section in the paper. 2.3. Why China? Two bat CoVs caused outbreaks in China; it is thus urgent to study the reasons to avoid future outbreaks. China is the third largest territory and is also the most populous nation in the world. A vast homeland plus diverse climates bring about great biodiversity including that of bats and bat-borneviruses\u2014most of the ICTV coronavirus species (22/38) were named by Chinese scientists studying local bats or other mammals. The majority of the CoVs can be found in China (Table 1). Moreover, most of the bat hosts of these CoVs live near humans, potentially transmitting viruses to humans andlivestock. Chinese food culture maintains that live slaughtered animals are more nutritious, and this belief may enhance viral transmission. It is generally believed that bat-borne CoVs will re-emerge to cause the next disease outbreak. In this regard, China is a likely hotspot. The challenge is to predict when and where, so that we can try our best to prevent such outbreaks. ",

Scholars have been arguing that our policies are exploitative. We are causing grave damage to nature. Novel Coronavirus is a revolt of nature against human beings. We have been cruel towards our nature. This is not sustainable. We may, believe it or not, nature has its own conscious and it works to restore balance. Traditional Jain lifestyle will solve all your problems regarding this disease. I follow the Jain lifestyle and this lifestyle has come to me from many generations (times immemorial). I give my examples to illustrate my life-style: - I get up early and drink 4 glass of warm water in the morning one hour after sunrise I am vegetarian I avoid taking food after sunset I adopt Preksha Dhyaan (Meditation), Yog, Samayiki in my day to day life Jain saints have been following this lifestyle for thousands of years. Jain saints have been drinking boiled water and they keep masks (muhbatti) when they open their mouth (this is the practice that they have been following for thousands of years). Jain philosophy is now limited to a few persons and its followers are reducing every day. Despite scientific practices, these practices are becoming extinct. It is becoming difficult to revive these practices. Due to Covid-19, people all over the world have become attracted to Jain Philosophy again. Jain families find it difficult to train the young generation in Jain lifestyle due to contractions by the modern education system. The schools teach students that eggs should be eaten and mean has good protein intake, while the parents ask the children not to take eggs and meat or meat-based products. Schools tell something and parents tell the opposite, ultimately the children follow their friends' circle and follow the crowd mentality. Fortunately, we still have many Jain Saints, who are practicing Jain philosophy in their lives. They are a source of hope for the next generations. Traditional Indian practices are extremely helpful in this time. Eat Tulsi, meetha Neem, Methi, and take spices including Haldi, Mirch, and other herbs, which will help you. Return back to old practices (which have been followed by Indians for thousands of years). ",

            "answer_text": "The specific covid-19 virus was not predicted. But all professional epidemiologists predict a leap of a virus from animals to humans - with uneven time space among them. This is prepared against - even if not as well as we would like.The reason for the deficiency in preparation is preparation costs money, and many people are not willing to pay for protection against a danger which is not already there. I will not bring in party politics, but there is a difference between gouvernments supporting the lasting guard against new epidemics and those which close down the gard against new epidemics as soon as there is no new epidemics going on. These leaps of viruses from animals to humans are mostly due to mutations in the virus, many viruses being specific for which species they infect.In seldom cases the leap can be due to new contact with animals we usually do not have contact with. All these leaps of viruses from animals to humans have some things in common. The most important is ALL the antigens on the virus being new to humans, meaning No humans have ANY innate resistance at all against the virus. Let us compare this with the seasonal flu. With the seasonal flu, the main antigens mutate. This makes us vulnerable to the mutated virus even if we had the flu in the former years, and is why we have new flu shots every year. But still the \u201cnew\u201d flu viruses are not totally new after all, as they still carry on them several of their old antigens. These antigens they continue to have, do we have some resistance against. This is why the Spanish Flu, the Avian flu and the Swine flu was different from the ordinary flus. All these flus came new from animals, and no human had any resistance against any of the antigens on them. The covid-19 virus is the same (even if it is not a flu), it came \u201cnew\u201d from some animal, possibly bats on the \u201cwetmarked\u201d in Wuhan. No human have any prior immunity against any of the antigens on the virus. That makes us vulnerable to it. Being viruses, they spread like viruses. Viruses can differ in how contagious they are, the most contagious virus we know being the measles virus.But most viruses spread in such a way that every infected person, infects more than one other person. This is what we call \u201cviral spread\u201d. What makes a virus more or less infectious are:How much the infected person excrete the virusHow long time does an infected person excrete virusesHow long does an infected person survive? If a virus kills the infected person too quickly, it has not enough time to infect others.How high virus load (how many viruses) it takes to make a person infectedHow long does the virus survive outside the body, and on which surfaces does it surviveWhat are the infection routes: Contact infection, airborne infection, infection by water, infection by food, infection by vectors like mosquitoes Epidemiologists study these questions, and study how to deal with them.

News2020/03/sylvia-browne I have maintained in several of my posts that a worldwide pandemic would be nature\u2019s response to climate change. And that it could come at any time. This pandemic actually began in 2019. Which in the Tarot would be represented by 20 (Judgment), 1( God), 9 (the Hermit) and also 19 (the Sun). This combination augers a judgment (possibly by God) forcing everyone into a hermit state for up to 1 year. However, if you look at the Tarot for the year 2020, you can then again break one of the two 20s into 20 and the other numbers would represent 2 and 0. Then you would have 20 (Judgment), 0 (the Fool) and 2 (the High Priestess). Or this could mean a year of Judgment-Judgment. The interpretation of Judgment would be universal as a time of Judgment. the Fool would be those not paying attention to where they are going. However, the High Priestess may represent a highly clairvoyant woman (Sylvia Brown) or even a warning given by a highly placed female spiritual entity such as the Virgin Mary. There are likely other interpretations for the Tarot and 2020. However, the presence of Judgment does not appear positive in either year. Also the presence of 20 will exist in every year of this century. Yet 2020 is the only year it will appear twice. ",

In fact, the reason some countries have been so well prepared for this one is because they were NOT so well prepared for things like SARS and MERS. But, from the perspective of Bible prophecy (my special interest), an increase in such epidemics is specifically followed by a caution that it does not signal the end of the world, but it does signal the \u201cbeginning of sorrows\u201d. So there is something far more sinister lying out there beyond what is happening\u2026 imo, not only with the corona virus, but also with climate change. Both of these could be key links in a chain of events that would result in something far worse than what we are facing at the moment.

As life evolves, and new species appear, there will always be some other species that evolve to use this new resource. And the new species will always evolve to combat these threads - or go extinct it it cannot. Humans already play host to a long list of specific pests, bacteria and vira that can live nowhere else (fleas, tuberculosis bacteria, colds and AIDS vira etc.). Some of these may initially prove so successful that they decimate the population before we have developed a defense against the invader (the black death, typhus, Spanish flu etc.). So really: given the sheer number and mobility of humans, pandemics like the Corona pandemic are inevitable, and we should expect to see them regularly - as we in fact do! ",
