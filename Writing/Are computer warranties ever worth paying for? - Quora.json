            "answer_text": "It depends on whether it's from the manufacturer or if it's from a third party company. From the manufacturer, yes. I'd always purchase the extended warranty and with accidental damage protection. If the computer's any good, it's not going to be cheap, if something happens to it, like a blown capacitor, failed drive, non working keyboard etc you have the option of paying 50 to a hundred dollars for the extended warranty or paying twice that (at least, if it's a systemboard or display you're looking at around 600 bucks plus labor) if it's out of warranty for just the parts, without labor. Accidental Damage Protection is also a really good idea, you may be extremely careful with your unit, but things happen that may not be your fault but are still considered Customer Induced Damage (CID for short) Say you live in a really cold area and forget your notebook in your car overnight, the Liquid Crystal Display can freeze and then crack when it warms up a little bit. Or say you close the lid on a couple of stapled pieces of paper, a cable, or a pen, it can easily break the display and without ADP you're going to be paying for the repair because it's customer induced damage. It may sound stupid or that people are careless and clumsy, but you have no idea just how many ADP cases similar to these examples that I see in a month. I wouldn't recommend buying a third party warranty from anyone to be fair. Asurion is alright, but it's not generally worth it unless you're buying a non-manufacturer refurbished unit, plus their business is more centered around Smartphones, they do okay with computers but it's not the vast majority of what they fix. I would definitely never, ever, ever recommend even my worst enemy or ex-wife buying a third party warranty through AllState's SquareTrade garbage. I've had to clean up their miserable excuse for repairs about a hundred times too many where the customer wound up having to pay us for a repair to get the computer working again after SquareTrade\u2019s contractor techs completely pooched the first repair on really basic stuff from installing the Keyboard but not connecting it to the systemboard, to installing the wrong model display panels with no WWAN or WLAN antennas making Cellular and WiFi data not work, to messing up both M.2 sockets on a systemboard so bad the entire component had to be replaced, to installing a systemboard without risers so when it got turned on the first time, the board grounded out and fried itself, to branding a computer so completely incorrectly that it simply didn't recognize that there was audio, WLAN, or a webcam. Don't touch them with someone else's 100 foot pole. ",

            "answer_text": "Normally, in the past, I had never recommended extended warranties for any computers until just the last few years. Due to the fact that so many laptops have fewer serviceable parts now and many small, lightweight machines are so expensive to repair, I am now finally recommending purchasing extended warranties for any laptop over a value of $1000 and for all Apple computers. Example: I had a Dell XPS 15\u2033 last week that needed a new keyboard. In the past, I could purchase a new replacement keyboard for most laptops for $20 to $30 and the keyboard could easily be replaced in less than 10 minutes either by removing a few screws or pushing on a couple of tabs. Replacing the keyboard on this newer Dell XPS required completely disassembling the laptop, removing the battery, removing the motherboard, removing about 35 tiny screws holding the keyboard in place and then installing the new keyboard and reassembling the entire laptop. Now it takes 3 1/2 hours to perform the same job. This not just Dell, but most all new laptops are far more expensive to repair and some are pretty much not repairable at all, especially some Apple computers. REPLACE A KEYBOARD IN 2014 (5 min)  REPLACE A KEYBOARD IN 2020 (3.5hrs)  ",

            "answer_text": "Commercial stuff with a support clause yes. Home stuff no. If you bought it new then the warranty covers it well past the break in period and that\u2019s when it will normally die on you. The reason they sell extended warranties is the odds are great you won\u2019t use it and in the fine print don\u2019t be surprised to find user caused damage is not covered. The Dell 9010 in front of me is 8 years old. Yes I did upgrades but still it should be still running Linux 10 years from now. And I don\u2019t expect to have to repair it other than maybe replacing the SSD. Since I bought a good one it may still be fine then. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the price, terms and the longevity of the seller. If the warranty is a deal but the seller bankrupt early, you paid but can never claim it. If reasonable but with unfair fine prints, you still pay a lot when claiming. Personally, I think the first year warranty included with purchase is ok. Paying anything \u201cextended\u201d makes repair complicated, when needed. The seller subcontracts the repair anyway. I can find him. ",

            "answer_text": "for me it depends on the warranty and the intended use of the PC. I recently bought a new Lenovo. It came with 90 days replacement and 2 years parts and labor on what is considered normal wear and tear, but in case of an accident or abuse, they offer 2 / 3 / 5 years for an extra fee. I felt the standard warranty was enough. ",
