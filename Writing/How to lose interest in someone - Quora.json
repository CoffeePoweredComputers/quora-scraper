            "answer_text": "You love who you love, and are attracted to who you feel attracted to. If you feel it is inappropriate to have feelings for the person you are interested in, take a step back and look at yourself. Is there something this person provides, whether it is real or imagined, that satisfies a need, a craving, or longing in your life? If so, reflect upon that so you are fully conscious of what that is. This will provide some guidance on how to handle the situation and move forward. If it is time to end another relationship in your life, end it. If moving forward with your feelings would cause a great deal of emotional pain for someone, rather than act on your interest, it may be time to have a very deep conversation with the person in your life in which the relationship is lacking. You deserve to be happy, and should not stay in a relationship where you feel unsatisfied and unfulfilled. Being at a crossroad like this can be very difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to tell the person how you feel. If you think you have no chance of building a relationship, ask them to help you let them go. They will likely agree that you have no chance, which will completely deflate your feelings. You will feel good that you tried instead of pining in obscurity and prolonging an unrequited love. Also, there\u2019s a slight chance that you\u2019ll begin a relationship. At least, later when you are more mature and successful, that person might realize they blew it with you. If they respond with criticism and sarcasm, then just say, \u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d Work hard to be a better person and some day they will regret losing their chance. ",
