            "answer_text": "Of course, it is possible to earn money from online. In fact, many time you searched google how to make money online and make sure you get countless pages of advertising ways to make money online prestige from A to Z ... and the promises are very attractive as: \"Just check your mail and have money\" \"Watching videos and answering questions is also paid\"  BUT MAKING MONEY ONLINE IS THAT REAL EASY? Through many times participating in the field of making money online, I have learned little experience and quite good experience to share. Below, I will help you out the forms of making money online and should not be done. Some ways to make money online should not participate:1.PTC (Paid to click) This form is well known from the past to now, there are some people who earn money, about more than a hundred dollars a month, but number of people who can not earn money after a few months of being busy making a scam site is still great a few times more. I do not encourage this way of making money online because it takes time, I have to go looking for someone to become a referral and take commissions from my subordinates. Not adding much knowledge. More likely to be tricked by scam sites. 2. Read promotional emails This way of making money is also quite popular abroad, every day you will receive a series of promotional emails and your task is to read each email and receive points. Similar to PTC, I do not recommend that you make money in this way, the scam is much but the truth is less, it takes time to check the mail and the money earned is stork.  3. Share documents (PTU) This is a good way to make money online, you share your personal documents, if others see your documents, they will pay to download and you receive money. Although the form is good, you can get into trouble with copyright. Especially if you upload other people's documents to make money, you may be in trouble with the law. Personally, I do not encourage this form because it involves copyright infringement. 4. Securities, gambling, betting (Forex + betting) This online way of making money can help you make money fast, but not sustainably, at high risk and is more likely to take legal responsibility if not careful. Therefore I do not encourage you to make money online this way. Some other forms such as introduce friends to the system and write a lot of articles, upload photos to make money, make money by introducing website visitors .... All frauds are a lot, very few reputable sites and the ability to earn income sustainably from the above is very low. So how to find a way to make money online prestigious and effective? Some reliable ways to make money online should participateResearching ways to make money online for a long time, take forms that after a process of learning, I encourage you to consider and participate. Because these forms not only help you increase your knowledge but also bring a sustainable source of income, long-term and unlimited. How much income is depends entirely on your ability. But one thing is for sure, the ability to make money online is possible, not fraud, as people often think. 1. Build your favorite themed website and place ads Imagine, if you own a website with thousands of hits every day, do companies want to place ads on your site? Of course, yes. The more visits, the higher the price of your ad, earning a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month from placing ads on your site is possible. This is one of the most popular ways to make money online. You can find out the price for placing ads on famous sites in Ebay, Amazon,\u2026 to understand more about this form. 2. Create a product and attract traffic Think about it, if you have a great product and a website with 2000 visitors a day, just 5% of your visitors buy it, you can earn the profit from 100 customers, fully automated and regardless of day and night.  3. Join the Google Adsense PPC (Pay per click) program Google will pay you hundreds to thousands of dollars for their ad clicks from your site every month. Your only task is to search for topics and attract traffic to your site. The more ads you place on your site as close to your site's topic, the higher your chances of making money. The core problem of this online way of making money is that you have to choose the right niche and attract lots of visitors. 4. Join affiliate marketing This is a way to make money online called affiliate marketing or collaborators. With this form, you do not need to create products, just choose good products from other companies and promote it, you will receive commissions on every product sold from your link. Commissions for this online way of making money are relatively high (30-70%), even with a 100% commission. This is one of the ways to make money online that many internet marketers prefer because of its ability to bring sustainable income. Currently, there are many reputable websites deployed, including DevNET which is a 5-15% commission trade page. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. It depends on how you sell your product, but at the same type, there is a tendency for things to be over-hyped about earning things online. People do earn a lot of money working online, but it is not the same for everyone. There is an ocean of ideas out there, with a lot of them earning their creators a lot of money. But there are just as many, or even more creators who struggle to make a living. The blogger, the web developer, the YouTuber, the gamer. All these people work online, and make quite a lot of money. But here\u2019s the thing, for every PewDiePie there are hundreds of YouTubers who do not make a fraction of the views that he gets, or the money he makes. But if you take PewDiePie\u2019s example, he was someone who entered YouTube by streaming videos of him playing games online. Once he started to become a little popular, he immediately diversified his content, turning from a niche product to something that was more accessible to everyone. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not plugging Pewds here. I\u2019m not a fan of his stuff. But it is eye-catching. And controversial. And different. Which is my point. The reason why some are successful, and most are not is because they have something that is radical, and diverts attention from the rest. And because they pretty much slogged day and night to reach a point where they could consider themselves to financially secure. To be honest, there are several ways to earn money online, the most common being advertising on your websites or YouTube channels. Alternately, a lot of people sell their merchandise online, in addition to selling the products of other brands/organisations through affiliate links. Or work with brands to create sponsored content. Or request your online following to donate to your projects through platforms like BuyMeACoffee and Patreon. The list is endless. So in a nutshell, the answer to the question \u201cIs it really possible to make money online?\u201d is quite simply, \u201cYes.\u201d It is risky business, but if you take a calculated risk rather than an impulsive one you may just stick the landing.
