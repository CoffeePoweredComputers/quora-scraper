            "answer_text": "Short answer - Yes. I am a power-user of InDesign, and have been since its inception. I was a hardcore Quark Xpress user before that - although I became very disenchanted with it in its later years. I welcomed the new software from Adobe. There are simply no other solutions out there that offer the same level of nuance and power that InDesign does. Its typographic controls alone are worth the price of admission. I could rave about its other features ad-nauseum. If you are a professional and billing a decent rate, then the software pays for itself with a small portion of 1 job. Like it or not - SaaS (Software as a Service) is the new revenue model, and your own services and pricing can be modified to adapt to this. That said - Adobe has become the 800lb gorilla, and it\u2019s certainly under fire from many upstarts who are attempting to disrupt the space. I\u2019d certainly welcome the competition. It keeps every one sharper, and tends to provide the end user with an ever more refined set of options. If you are looking for simple brochure layout software and do not have overly complex needs, there is likely a solution out there for you that is more affordable. But if you are doing long form document publishing; would like to see the power of scripting help you automate repetitive tasks; want to see massive time-savings by having powerful globally applicable styles for type, objects and tables; and need tight integration with raster and vector based image software (Photoshop/Illustrator); want a cohesive printing experience using an Acrobat/PDF workflow - then InDesign is really your only choice. for $53 USD/month per seat (and you technically get 2 seats for this) for the ENTIRE Creative Cloud Suite of applications - I do not consider this prohibitively expensive for a true design professional.

            "answer_text": "It depends on who you ask. This is my take on the program: If you had asked this question before Adobe moved to their subscription model, I would wholeheartedly say yes, it absolutely is worth the cost. Back at the height of desktop publishing, when Quark was the 800 lb. gorilla, XPress was an expensive, cumbersome application that was, for all intents and purposes, stagnant. Updates were few and far between. InDesign was a refreshing addition to the designer's toolset. Today, it's a completely different story. Because of Adobe's subscription model, you will spend more money to \"rent\" an application that you would otherwise buy outright and upgrade every other iteration. The software is no longer snappy and quick, and has become bloated with features. To make matters worse, if you live outside of the United States, you're likely paying a premium for the software thanks to currency exchange rates. My employer's costs to subscribe for Adobe's software has increased 30 percent in the past five years. Adobe has also been criticized for their pricing in countries with a stronger currency as they still pay higher rates despite the so-called benefits and savings Adobe had touted with the digital distribution model. Is Adobe InDesign worth the cost? Yes, unfortunately, if you want to be able to work with other designer's files. It's the de facto standard of the design industry, so you don't really have a choice in the matter until a strong competitor comes along. ",
