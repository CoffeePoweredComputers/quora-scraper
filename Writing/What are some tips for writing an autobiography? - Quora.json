            "answer_text": "I don't know if I know the BEST way, but I can tell you what worked for me! It took me four years to finish and publish, but I eventually did it. Here are a few pieces of advice that I heeded that really worked: 1). Write now and edit later. For the first draft you need not worry if your writing is any good. Just get your initial ideas down. You will most likely need to write a draft, take some time off and then rewrite it later. A friend of mine in publishing told me all good books start with at least five drafts. 2). Some writers will recommend doing a timeline/outline before writing. Plot out the chronology of your story. Some don't work with outlines. I recommend trying it. 3). Find a writing spot you can call home! It might be a favorite couch, a cafe or a bar. For me it was a dog friendly Kava bar in the neighborhood. I started writing there seven days a week. I got to know the staff very well. I wrote at the same barstool every day. I started to enjoy the ritual of going there, I couldn't write anywhere else. Because I developed a ritual there, I could write in 4\u20136 hour spurts without a break. When I felt a little burnt out, I would take a break to play with the dogs and talk to the regulars. 4). There will be days when you write non stop and feel like you could keep going. Take advantage of those days\u2026 they don't come all the time. For months I wrote 12 hours a day. When that urge comes, don't be afraid to turn down social invitations to get it done. If you wake up at 3am with the urge to write, do it. 5). There will be other days when you aren't feeling it. You just have to push through. With any creative project there is usually a \"honeymoon phase\". Take advantage of that. Sometimes it takes a while to \"feel it\". Be willing to write bad stuff that you will never keep. What matters is that you are getting \"in the flow\". 6). Don't start new projects while writing your autobiography. Finish one project before you start another. Now is not the time to start a band, join a community garden or a bowling club. 7). On days where you would rather eat glass then write one more page of your autobiography it's ok to take a day off. 8). I spent time listening to YouTube lectures from authors and publishers about the makings of a great memoir/biography. One thing they taught me was to start thinking of the reader. What do you want them to feel or think from reading your story? What message to you want to convey? 9). Have a fun celebratory event you may want to partake in once your book is done. For me it's \"Taco Monopoly\". It involves inviting a bunch of friends over to the Kava bar. I will make tacos and we will play Monoploy. Think about that reward while you are writing all day. 10). If you have a writer's meetup in your area, go to it! There are many writer's meetups on Meetup dot com. The one in my area has us writing for 20 minute spurts four times throughout the session. There is nothing more powerful then surrounding yourself with other writer's who have the same goals. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "No one can write a perfect book, much less a memoir (I make a distinction between a memoir and an autobiography). We\u2019re much too close to the material to ever hope to achieve perfection when we\u2019re writing about our lives. I\u2019ve written one memoir and edited dozens. To me, these are the most important things to remember as you write about your life: Unless you\u2019re well-known, an expert in your field, or a celebrity, people don\u2019t care about your life. What they do care about is the aspects of your life that they can relate to, events or behaviors or qualities they can identify with. I always suggest making one aspect of your life the dominant focus of your book. In Memoir of a Misfit, I made sure that what I call \u201cmisfittedness\u201d permeated every anecdote I told, even though at times the connection was subtle. You don\u2019t want to hit your readers over the head to get your point across. Think of the focus as a single gold thread that runs through the tapestry of your life\u2014gold because it\u2019s valuable while also being shiny and drawing the eye to it. Keep that in mind.Be vulnerable. Let readers know that you stumbled and fell more than a few times on your journey to where you are now. Speaking of where you are now, make sure you\u2019ve waited long enough to process the focus of the book you want to write. One writer I knew wanted to write about the custody battle for her kids that she was embroiled in at the time. No one, but no one, can possibly do justice to a story like that until they\u2019ve been able to step back and look at it from a fresh perspective. I told her to wait 10 years\u2014an exaggeration, but not much of one. She got the point.Be honest. Was your abuser really the monster you\u2019re depicting him to be? Sometimes the scariest people in the world are like Ted Bundy, the charming, handsome guy who answered calls to a suicide hotline and murdered at least 30 young women. Ann Rule\u2019s chilling true-crime bestseller, The Stranger Beside Me, tells his story like no one else could\u2014a former Seattle police officer, she worked the hotline calls with him and never detected anything unsettling about him. Whatever your focus is\u2014cancer recovery, grief, betrayal, and so forth\u2014keep it real and specific and detailed. Use your words! Don\u2019t just tell us you were in pain. Help us feel something of the agony that kept you begging God to just kill you already. Or whatever your truth is.Be respectful of the people you write about. I named a few people in my memoir, but I sent them the manuscript before I sent it to my publisher. I got their permission in writing, by way of return emails. Others I would never name, to protect their privacy. I wrote things like \u201ca friend I\u2019ll call Scott\u201d and camouflaged other details that would tip off our mutual acquaintances as to whom I was writing about. Sometimes that\u2019s easier said than done, but if you believe what you want to write will hurt someone you care about, you need to think long and hard about how you\u2019re going to express that. You may need to leave it out entirely.And speaking of leaving things out, do it. You may be itching to tell a fabulous story or a funny anecdote\u2014but it has no place in the story you\u2019re writing. I had to encourage one writer to leave out a lovely, heartwarming scene that felt like a piece of a different puzzle. She agreed it didn\u2019t belong and left it out, but it made both of us sad. I told her to hold onto it tightly and use it elsewhere in her writing. I hope she did.Write down your memories the moment they occur to you. Don\u2019t wait, and don\u2019t even think about if or how it\u2019s going to fit into your book. I\u2019m a big believer in just letting it all come out the way it comes out, fixing it and fitting it together later. Our memories are too precious and fleeting to let them disappear. Even if you think you\u2019d never use that memory, write it out anyway. You never know. Trust me.Okay, so clearly I could write a book about this, and maybe I will. But this should be enough to get you started. I wish you all the best as you write! ",
