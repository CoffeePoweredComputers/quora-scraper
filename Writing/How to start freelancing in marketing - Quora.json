            "answer_text": "The most practical way is the side hustle approach, working after hours on getting your first client and building from there. Changes in technology mean that it's easier than ever to find work as freelancer or independent contractor. There are dozens of freelance websites that match skilled professionals and creative people with businesses that need them, and the kinds of work that can be done this way is growing all the time. It's estimated that up to one third of all workers are freelancing in some way. Many of those make their living that way, and most of the rest are building up from a side hustle. All it takes to get started is one customer or client who values your skills. Once you are working for yourself -- even if it's only for a couple hours a week -- you will be motivated to develop your skills, and you start getting clarity about what you have to offer. That might help you re-engage with your day job with a fresh perspective, to show your boss you are ready for more, or it might motivate you see your day job as a place to learn all you can while you prepare for you new goal of building your own freelance business. I love this answer to this question from my colleague Jessie Kwak in How to Start a Freelance Business In One Step? Why Reckless Is Best: \u201cYour first step is to get one client. Change that one thing, and you change everything.\u201d Essentially, she\u2019s talking about the side hustle approach. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, great question. I highly reccomend you pick your niche. It could be copywriting, online marketing (such as PPC, SEO, etc.), social media marketing, Speaking of my experience (SEO for 3 years now as a side job) it\u2019s not that difficult as it seems to be on a start. When comes to gathering information about your topic, I reccomend you to stick to 1 - 2 sources of information about topic you choose. If you won\u2019t, it\u2019s possible you will get lost in an incredible amount of new information. You may ask, how to get your first clients. If you are confident about system you\u2019ve created by reading guides and websites, I reccomend you this. Find first client and say this: \u201cIf it won\u2019t work, you don\u2019t need to pay me anything.\u201d Marketing is all about money. If you help your client make more money, he will be more than happy to pay you back. If not, change your system and next time you\u2019ll do good! Good luck!! :) Btw, I found really great class on SkillShare and I am pretty sure it\u2019ll help you. Give it a shot!

            "answer_text": "Sales and marketing are linked but the skills for one are different to the other. It's easier to pitch your proposition and be noticed for it, if it's clear, so decide which discipline suits you best. Then, make sure if it's sales, you can demonstrate a good process and prove your experience and target achievements. If it's marketing, be clear about your skills (digital, content, brand and/or product marketing etc). Use LinkedIn, get it sparkling and bright. Request recommendations and make sure any old jobs are written with your new work in mind (you wanna get hired, right?!). Then it's all about networking, networking and more networking. Be clear about the kind of work you want and ask people to recommend you. Happy hunting! ",

Freelancers provide marketing consultancy on an independent basis and work for clients who they search on their own. This job can be easily done at home or by working at the client\u2019s office for as long as the consultant is needed for the project. Freelance marketing consultants outsource their services to clients who need temporary services. A freelance marketing consultant\u2019s job can be as demanding as that of a regular fully employed marketing consultant. These individuals can work for multiple clients at the same time and may need to promote themselves in order to bag jobs. To be a successful freelance marketing consultant, one needs to have a balance of educational qualifications, skills, the right knowledge of the field and fulfilling of many duties and responsibilities.
