            "answer_text": "For a more academic-styled essay, 100 sentences per paragraph would be moderately sized. As such, the 250-word paper would be roughly 2.5 moderate length paragraphs, or potentially further broken down into five shorter paragraphs. Judging by those estimations I\u2019d say a range of 2\u20136 paragraphs wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable. By any means, it should be roughly one page at the typical double-spaced font-size 12 Times New Roman, and 1/2 of a single-spaced page with the same specifications. For reference, this answer is 83 words. ",
