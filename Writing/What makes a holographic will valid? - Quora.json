            "answer_text": "A holographic will has NOTHING to do with a hologram. i.e.,the 3-D security image on money. i.e., the fancy-dandy laser generated image of Leia at the beginning of the original Star Wars. \u201cHelp me, oh, Obi Wan Kenobe. How do I write a will.?\u201d That thought remove you should. An holographic will is very simply entirely hand-written. All of it is handwritten and signed by the testator; no typing allowed. Then the testator (the person making the will) signs it. And dates it. Done. Except in some states you don\u2019t need a witness. Or you may need more than one. Sounds pretty simple so far.? But suppose a beneficiary or non-beneficiary who is angry about what they did or didn\u2019t get contests the will. Now your estate not only runs up lawyer fees; somebody also has to pay for handwriting analysis and verification (a good reason to have it witnessed and notarized even if they\u2019re not required.) Analysed by an expert who is not your brother-in-law. By the time that mess gets settled; everybody is angry about how much of the estate has disappeared. That\u2019s nothing against lawyers and the handwriting analyst. It is squarely on the head of the amateur who tried to do an end around the legal system and get by on the cheap for cost of just paper and a pen. And don\u2019t forget that what you write down might be legal gibberish subject to more legal arguments and more legal fees. If real estate property is involved there is another level of complexity and cost. If your goal is to avoid probate and lawyers fees; get a living trust. Probate and estate lawyers make their money on the back end when your estate goes through probate. First they get paid for writing the will; then paid again for probate. With a living trust your lawyer is paid up front and for less than what it would cost for the same estate to go through probate. There are ins and outs with trusts; just like everything else. Rich people use them all the time to pass on their wealth relatively unscathed by legal fees; and it seems to be working rather well for them. If it\u2019s good enough for them, it\u2019s good enough for me. Time for me to shut up. I am not a lawyer. Everything I know about trusts is because I have one. When I die, who gets what is stated in the trust. The deed to my house already has my heirs\u2019 names attached to it; but I remain in full control. Upon my death, all a lawyer has to do is file a quit claim deed removing my name from the existing deed; finalizing the transfer. A couple hundred dollars. No probate. No probate fees. My trust cost $2000 to set up ten years ago. Costs may vary depending on inflation, complexity and location. My heirs pay nothing to go through probate; because probate isn\u2019t involved. See a lawyer. Please. Maybe your situation is such that you truly cannot afford any kind of lawyer and that is your reason for looking into a holographic will. In that case your estate is probably small enough that a holographic will to suffice. But if you can\u2019t fit all your bequests on a single sheet of wide-spaced notebook paper; you need a lawyer. Remember: 100% handwritten. sign it and date it in front of a witness and a notary public (free at any bank, although you may need to have an open account there) Keep it in a safe place. ",

            "answer_text": "A holographic will is a real roll of the dice, even if the few jurisdictions willing even to consider such a thing. One of the purposes of the safeguards surrounding wills is to provide a court with evidence that the will actually is the true expression of the decedent\u2019s wishes. How would that work considering the ease with whichh a person\u2019s head and shoulders can be forged? While the original forgery might show traces of the forgery, what happens when an \u201coriginal\u201d is created? That becomes the original thereafter. What safeguards might be created? Would having a few people swear that they witnessed the creation of the holographic will be sufficient? How would they know that details were not later altered and a new and different \u201coriginal\u201d created? How would the witnesses be able to say under oath that they are sure that the holographic will in court i, in all points, identical to the one they think they witnessed? The possibilities are fascinating from a technical viewpoint, but who wants to be the person whose will becomes the precedent? Cute idea, but absent clear evidence of the testator\u2019s intent and the content of the holographic will, there are so many equally easy ways to do the job without the substantial risk involved in verifying the accuracy of the holograph once the primary participant is removed from the scene.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The law is all over the map (in the US, and I\u2019m sure elsewhere). Just some legalese for those unfamiliar: a \u201cholographic will\u201d is a will \u2014 i.e., a document directing what to do with your stuff when you die \u2014 that is hand written. Some jurisdictions just flat-out won\u2019t even consider the validity of a holographic will, including my state of Massachusetts. Some jurisdictions require that the will be entirely written in the handwriting of the decedent. Some jurisdictions require that only the \u201cmaterial\u201d parts of the will be written in the handwriting of the decedent. Some jurisdictions won\u2019t consider its validity, unless it\u2019s made under certain unusual circumstances that generally involve a great risk of death. (E.g., soldiers in active military conflict, a not-necessarily-military sailor at sea.) In those jurisdictions that at least consider the possibility of a valid holographic will, there\u2019s often an enhanced requirement of showing that this document was really intended to be a will, as opposed to something less formal like notes on what to do, or instructions for someone else to have a will prepared. For example, if I write out \u201cWhat to do with my stuff when I die:\u201d at the top of the page, underline it, and then make bullet points about who gets what, that\u2019s probably a little too ambiguous. Is that a will, or just me getting thoughts down on paper? On the other hand, if I wrote: \u201cThis is my last will and testament. Sorry for the holographic will everyone, but my printer is out of ink and I feel like I\u2019m going to die tonight. I really really hope the probate court upholds the validity of this here holographic will\u201d then I\u2019m probably in business. ",

            "answer_text": "The law in the greater portion of the world has not kept up with the times for several reasons. First off, since the film industry is capable of motion capture and of super imposing your face onto a wire grid and reimposing that on a motion capture you can immediately see who it is possible to have an actor play the body role, and then use a single frame of a picture to articulate the face, or to use a short video of the speech patterns and use a computer synthesis of that to creat a faux version of a \u201cLast Will and Testament\u201d (were it legally acceptable). That takes care of the video aspect of such a \u2018recording\u2019. Onto the voice aspect: since we can create a VOX version of your voice using only a few select complex words, an only slightly longer recording would provide enough inflective \u2018colour\u2019 for a computer-tech to recreate a broad dialogue base acording to the \u2018script\u2019 needed. Current computer algorithms can detect an abrupt shift in stress markers in a voicerecording . . again, well within current realms of technology. The reason we currently use a written format, drafted and presented by a legal third party, using multiple witnesses, and recorded formally in a Court Registry is why the video version will be a bit more of a hard sell. Multiple copies, issued simultaneously, sealed by thumbprint of the Testator might be one way to guarantee validity - each held separate & apart, both played simultaneously to verify. Any deviation in either would invalidate the will. You begin to see the problems inherent in this method. The rationale of the thumbprint is the equivalent of the Babylonian contract in clay, then wrapped in an outer clay shell. Impossible to forge the inside if you can\u2019t get access to the evidence. The Elizabethans wrote three copies of contracts, one original for each, and one half of the third randomly cut in a zig-zag half to each. Hard to fake the random cuts! This is where we get witnesses to sign off on the veracity of the contract. Holographic will eventually come into play with eventual tamper security measures. Its just a matter of time. ",

            "answer_text": "In general, for a document to be recognized as a Will in the US, it has to be \u201cattested,\u201d that is, it must bear the signatures of a specific number of persons, typically, two, depending on state law, who, at the request and in the presence of the testator, witnessed the testator sign the Will. See, for example, Requisites of wills-Foreign wills. The notion that a Will has been \u201cattested\u201d provides the legal evidence that the document in question was truly signed by the testator intending it to be his/her Will. Query: What other legal evidence might suffice? Is proper attestation the ONLY such evidence? According to the law of some states, such as California, however, alternative legal evidence is sufficient, namely, that the document is not only signed by but also written entirely in the handwriting of the testator, producing what is known as a \u201cholographic\u201d Will. Codes Display Text (Some states also require that the Will be dated. And some states require only that the material provisions of the Will be in the testator\u2019s handwriting, meaning that a testator can take a pre-printed Will form, fill it in in his/her handwriting, and make a valid holographic Will.) The rationale for recognizing a holographic Will is to provide a person in imminent danger of death, such as a soldier at war, the ability to make a Will in the absence of witnesses \u2014- an unattested holographic Will being \u201cbetter\u201d than no Will at all. Note, however, that the issue is not really how a Will is written, whether printed and filled-in, type-written, hand-written, or whatever. No state, to my knowledge, has any requirement as to the means used to write a Will (although some states do recognize an oral Will, called a \u201cnuncupative\u201d Will \u2014- see, for example, Nuncupative wills.). The issue is whether the Will has been attested. California, for example, recognizes a holographic Will that has not been attested, while most states don\u2019t. In those states, Wills require attestation, regardless of how they are written. So, to answer your question, the laws of all states to my knowledge recognize a properly attested holographic Will. The laws of some states also recognize an unattested holographic Will. Richard Wills, retired probate attorney originally licensed in CA & WA ",

Certain jurisdictions recognise such wills as being valid despite the lack of other formalities, but there is little consistency. Such wills are recognised under Scottish law, but not English law. Twenty six US states recognise them, and twenty four do not. Check with a qualified lawyer in your jurisdiction before trying to use a holographic will. Or better yet - just get your lawyer to draft you a proper will. ",

Unfortunately, though it might sound a weasling answer, the best reply is \u201cit depends\u201d as some jurisdictions do not accept holographic (handwritten) wills as being valid. So as usual, check for your area, get a lawyer if you can, preferably STEP qualified (Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners) etc, etc. Blah blah. So, assuming you live somewhere where this is valid, then you need to make sure you set things out carefully. Make sure your instructions are clear and unambiguous. Consider \u2018what ifs? \u2018 eg what if a beneficiary dies before you, or they all die (disaster clause) or a charity you're remembering no longer exists. And so on. Lastly, make sure it's witnessed and that it's witnessed correctly. Again, rules differ in different areas, so check. It's never a good idea though to have anyone with an interest in the Will as a witness. You might also consider leaving a letter setting out your thinking, and why you did things the way you did. Oh and if it's handwritten, please make sure people can actually read your writing. Basic I know, but really\u2026. If in doubt, get professional advice. Just because you can do something yourself, doesn't mean you should. ",
