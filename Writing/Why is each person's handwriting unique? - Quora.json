            "answer_text": "A person's handwriting is as unique as their personality, and there's good reason to look for traces of their personality in their handwriting as it is controlled by their unconscious mind. The study of Handwriting is called GRAPHOLOGY,  also referred as pseudoscience at times , graphology is believed to reveal a person's character, disposition, and attitudes from their handwriting.   Their are certain basic steps one look for studying someone, and believe me, with practice one gets so good at it that just a look at their hand scripts will reveal you more than a month's conversation...  I'm explaining some basic steps  here,  so go through  only if you're really interested : 1Look at the pressure of the strokes    . Heavy pressure indicates commitment and taking things seriously, but if the pressure is excessively heavy, that writer gets very uptight at times and can react quickly to what they might see as criticism, even though none may have been intended. These writers react first and ask questions afterwards.Light pressure shows sensitivity to atmosphere and empathy to people, but can also, if the pressure is uneven, show lack of vitality.2Look at the size of the letters.     Handwriting is made up of three zones - or cases - middle, upper and lower. A basic average measure - or benchmark - by which size can be judged is 3mm per zone. This gives a benchmark for a non-remarkable full height of 9mm. More than this is large; less than this is small.Large size handwriting can mean extravert and outgoing, or it can mean that the writer puts on an act of confidence, although this behaviour might not be exhibited to strangers.Small size can, logically, mean the opposite. Small size handwriting can also indicate a thinker and an academic, depending upon other features in the script.If the writing is small and delicate, the writer is unlikely to be a good communicator with anyone other than those on their own particular wavelength. These people do not generally find it easy to break new ground socially. 3  Look at the slant of the strokes.   Right slant indicates a response to communication, but not how it takes place. For example, the writer may wish to be friendly, manipulative, responsive, intrusive, to sell, to control, to be loving, supportive, just to name some possibilities.If the handwriting is generally upright, this indicates independence.A left slant tendency shows emotion and reserve. This writer needs to be true to self first and foremost and can be resentful if others try to push for more commitment from them. 4Look at the connection of the letters.   Connected letters mean that the person is logical and judges things according to experience. Disconnected letters mean the person is imaginative and judges things according to intuition ",

            "answer_text": "Our fingerprints are unique, why not the writing that comes from our hands? But seriously, there are so many issues that go into making handwriting, including personality, neuroanatomy, physical coordination, intention to make it beautiful, or intention to write fast. Consider a bunch of art students sitting in a room, all drawing the same vase of flowers.  Yet, each one turns out very different.  Writing is the same.  Each of those drawings is recognizably the same vase of flowers, but how hard the pencil pushes on the paper, how delicately the leaves are formed, how accurately the spaces between the parts are recorded, how subtly the shadows and light are presented, all go into making the drawings look different. Same with handwriting. And like art and handwriting, someone who is very good at them, can see someone else's work, and copy it--forge it, if you will.  But most people don't have that level of control over drawing what they see.  And handwriting is a form of drawing. ",
