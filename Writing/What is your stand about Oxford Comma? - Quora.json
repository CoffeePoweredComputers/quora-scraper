The former illustrates the Oxford comma (the one after \u201copportunities\u201d). It is obligatory in technical writing. As for other contexts, I am all for it, except, perhaps, in very rare instances, for the sake of this or that special effect. The reason is simple: Good writing is writing that the reader can read fluently, and the reader can read much more fluently with than without the Oxford comma. To my mind, in that respect, there is no comparison between the two examples above. The former is much better. Incidentally, now, at 74, I remember clearly the very moment I first learned the Oxford comma, though I did not learn the expression until a few years ago. I was a young child, studying writing in elementary school. I came across the problem of that final comma in the course of an exercise in class, and didn\u2019t know what to do. I asked the teacher. He told me to look it up in a little book of rules, I did so, and there it was: \u201cA, B, and C.\u201d I have never deviated in my loyalty, and I see no reason to do so now. ",

            "answer_text": "The Oxford comma, so-called because the Oxford University Press style guidelines require it, is the comma before the conjunction at the end of a list. If your preferred style is to omit the second comma in \"red, white, and blue\" you are aligned with the anti-Oxford comma faction. Personally, i enjoy long sentences, riddled with commas, packed with meaning and with a sense of pause and start like we do in speech. So, the comma has always been a friend to those who want to write as expressively as they speak. Cheers, Cheers, and Cheers! :D ",
