            "answer_text": "Before Jan of 2010, Amazon offered 35% royalties only. They've said that the 70% royalty option will help writers make a living in a digital world (where book prices are being driven down); in fact, to qualify for 70% royalties, a writer/publisher needs to price their book under $9.99.  The consumer and author are both supposed to win with this model because it keeps costs low while keeping author income where it was.  For example, an author who publishes on Kindle DTP and prices her book at $19.99 will only be eligible to earn 35% royalties, or $7. That same author could publish that same book at $9.99, be eligible to earn 70% royalties, and make $6.93 -- and the consumer would be more likely/able to buy that book, thanks to the lower cost.  On the flip side, a person who's written a work that the market would value at, say, $30 can still charge $30 for that book, the result being that Amazon is not 'devaluing' literature (fiction or non). If you ask $30 for your book, you can only earn 35% royalties - which is light years ahead of traditional publishing royalties - but you'll still make more than you would by undervaluing your book just to earn 70% royalties.  The dry, legal details are in the link you've included, but you can find easy-to-digest info here: http://www.publetariat.com/publish/right-schedule-amazon-changes-arithmetic-publishing-launching-70-percent-royalty-option-kindhttp://techcrunch.com/2010/01/20/amazon-royalty-kindle-dtp/",

The reason they have two is they are trying to provide incentives for books to be priced at $2.99 - $9.99 so they give an incentive. ",
