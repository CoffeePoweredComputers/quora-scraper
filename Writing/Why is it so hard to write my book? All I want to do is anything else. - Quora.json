            "answer_text": "There are many reasons to want to avoid getting that book written. Let me touch on some of them, and include a word of advice for each: You are writing about a personal subject that brings you pain.This is often because a person is trying to write about something while it is still raw within them: i.e. A diagnosis of cancer, a suicide, a divorce, the death of a child. Please, please wait for a coming to terms before you start to write. In the meantime, keep a journal, and do record your feelings of anger, despair, etc. You think you will never forget. You won\u2019t, but in time the sharp edged will dull.You are writing what someone else thinks you should write rather than what you want to say.Work to discover the book of your heart, then start again.You\u2019re only vaguely aware of where your story is going.Write out a focus sentence and tape it to your computer. (i.e. This book is about my husband leaving me and how I learned how capable I really am.) If something doesn\u2019t fit it, leave it for another book.Then decide what chapters you want and write a paragraph or so on what will be in each one.You want to write but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.Take a writing class through extended ed or online or community college. Read books on the craft of writing. Writing truly is a craft, and knowing what you\u2019re doing makes a huge difference.You keep going back to reread what you\u2019ve written and to edit it.Don\u2019t. Write that first draft, knowing it will need a lot of editing, but get it down first. Editing comes later.You are doing too much research.Hold off on research until you make your outline. Then you will know what you really need to know. Otherwise you will waste endless time finding info that does nothing but clutter.Write!Don\u2019t allow yourself to spend your writing time dusting your computer, or doing your nails, or watching funny cat videos. That\u2019s not writing. It\u2019s what we call procrastination!",

            "answer_text": "Here's the thing. You want to write your book, then write it. You want to play basketball? Get your ball and go to the court. You want to play guitar? Pick up your axe and practice. Writing, like anything else, is work. It may be work you love, but it's still work. I know baseball players who hate going to batting practice, but it's part of the job. And going takes discipline. That said, it's important to recognize how your process work. Someone mentioned outlining. That's great if that works for you. If I had to outline my novels, I'd never write a lick. I like to have my characters figure out their lives. It's messy, it means I waste a lot of pages, but so is life. Some days I don't open the novel file at all as I think about my characters too see what they'd do next. This time not adding sentences to the manuscript is still time writing. Note I spent years figuring out a process that works for me. Aristotle says we train ourselves to be excellent. The training starts by making a decision to write. There's plenty of other things calling for our attention (the grass needs to be cut, Netflix, grocery shopping, social media, a nap\u2026) but just because those temptations are there, doesn't mean you have to choose them. Remember, it's your choice. ",
