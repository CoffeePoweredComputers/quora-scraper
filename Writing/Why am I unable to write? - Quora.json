            "answer_text": "I believe this is called \"illiteracy\". But seriously, I'm sure you can write. After all, you wrote this question. Your issue may be that you don't think you write well or perhaps you just don't feel inspired to write. I certainly have suffered from both issues at some point.  For the first, remember that few people write well without having written a lot. So the only way to improve is to do it.  For the second, inspiration is not always easy to come by. I recommend that you simply write anything in these moments. Absolutely anything at all, just so long as you're writing. At least then you'll be practicing and improving so when inspiration returns, you're ready. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you are pretending that you don't have time. perhaps, you are wasting it between movies, TV and with friends.. arrange your possible time to write. EX. you should choose time like 9pm to 10pm, you should always write in that time. always attend that time in writing if you are writing or not that's not matter but you have to do that pick pen front of paper. Discuss more with friends, you will get more idea on what to write, how to write. always pick some short stories from conversion of peoples and make it more attractive and connected. never think you are wrote is bad, what you choose to do is always better for you.
