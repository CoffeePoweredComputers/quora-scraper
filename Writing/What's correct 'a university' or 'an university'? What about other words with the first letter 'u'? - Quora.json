            "answer_text": "\u201cA university\u201d is correct. The spelling of a word doesn\u2019t always correspond closely to the word\u2019s phonetics. We sometimes say that the letters aeiou (and sometimes y) are vowels. This is not quite true: these letters often (but now always) represent vowels. Vowels and consonants are \u201csounds,\u201d not letters, and sometimes there is a mismatch between the The thing is, the a/an distinction applies to the phonetics of the word, and has nothing to do with its spelling. The word university does not actually begin with a vowel: it begins with the consonant /j/ (that\u2019s how the \u201cy\u201d sound is written in phonetic notation). We say \u201can honorable man\u201d because honorable actually begins with a vowel. The h is just a letter in how the word is spelled, but is not part of the word\u2019s phonetics at all. Acronyms are another example of how the word\u2019s phonetics differ from how it is spelled. We talk about \u201can MRI\u201d because MRI begins with the vowel /\u025b/. (I put \u201csounds\u201d in quotation marks in the second paragraph because the proper term here would be phoneme. If you do not know what a phoneme is and would like to, I encourage you to read more!) ",

Unicorn is pronounced yewnicorn so it's a unicorn. The same goes for unique, useful. Upset is pronounced with a short u so it's an upset. The same goes for udder, ultra, umbrella. ",
