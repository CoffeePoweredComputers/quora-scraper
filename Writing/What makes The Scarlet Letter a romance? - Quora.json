            "answer_text": "I suppose it depends what exactly you mean. It could be considered a gothic \u201cromance\u201d in the sense that it involves an illicit/criminal (because adultery was a crime) love affair between two central characters. On the other hand, it is \u201cromantic\u201d in the sense that it includes elements that aren\u2019t entirely realistic, with strange supernatural(ish) incidents (like the scarlet letter A appearing in the sky at night); it\u2019s a fantastic story in the sense that it involves fantastical elements. I was disappointed, though: I\u2019d understood it to be \u201cromantic\u201d in the sense that it would have dirty bits\u2026 more fool me, should\u2019ve known that the Puritans wouldn\u2019t have it in \u2018em. :) ",
