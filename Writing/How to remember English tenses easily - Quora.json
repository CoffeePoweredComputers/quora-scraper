            "answer_text": "PRACTICE The more you practice, the more you learn. I let you know how I remember. First of all, I came to know about classification of sentences according to tense 10 years back when I was in class 6. A good English teacher plays an important role to make you learn. After that how much you practice is equally important. My English teacher was good. He used to teach us well. After dinner, my father used to make me learn all the tense while lying in bed every night. I used to get slept after sometime while learning so I was confused in concept of perfect continuous tense at that time. I did not absorb much at that time. Later in class 7 & 8, more things were added in the course but learning tenses remained constant. Teachers used to make us practice a lot & I learnt very well. After that in class 9, I was lucky enough to meet a great English teacher. He made us to learn it one more time & we did a lot of practice at that time too. He made us learnt too many other things in grammar & made us practice too. I was taught by him upto class 12 & I rarely make a mistake in grammar. So you see, practice is the key to remember after learning. All the best ",
