If not, I would check the public library near you first to see if there\u2019s anything that might work. However, if you have no problem dropping some cash on a textbook, I would suggest \u201cAmerica\u2019s History.\u201d Here\u2019s a link to it on Amazon (Amazon.com: America\u2019s History, For the AP* Course eBook: James A. Henretta, Eric Hinderaker, Rebecca Edwards, Robert O. Self: Kindle Store). You can even just rent the book. ",
