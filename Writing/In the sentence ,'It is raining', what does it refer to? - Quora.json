            "answer_text": "\u201cIt\u201d is a pronoun. Therefore, it must have and does have an antecedent. The antecedent is, necessarily, the noun form of the verb, in this sentence. Therefore, \u201cit\u201d (in this case) stands for rain. Hence, \u201cThe rain is raining.\u201d Think about it. What else can rain, other than rain? Let\u2019s look at a different example so that you understand the logic. \u201cIt\u2019s raining fish.\u201d So, what\u2019s raining fish? UNLESS you have an antecedent OTHER than \u201crain\u201d, the sentence is that, \u201cThe rain is raining fish.\u201d That does sound odd. But the fact that a sentence sounds odd does NOT mean it is grammatically wrong. A pronoun ALWAYS has an antecedent, and it is NEVER random. Let\u2019s look at a couple of ways that I have used \u201cit\u201d in my explanation, here. \u201cBut the fact that a sentence sounds odd does NOT mean it is grammatically wrong.\u201d What is the antecedent of \u201cit\u201d here? Clearly, it is \u201ca sentence\u201d. Hence, \u201cBut the fact that a sentence sounds odd does NOT mean a sentence is grammatically wrong.\u201d \u201cA pronoun ALWAYS has an antecedent, and it is NEVER random.\u201d Here, \u201cit\u201d stands for \u201cantecedent\u201d. Hence, \u201cA pronoun ALWAYS has an antecedent, and an antecedent is NEVER random.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cit\u201d, either in English \u201cIt\u2019s raining\u201d or in Spanish llueve. English speakers can say \u201cIt is raining\u201d instead of \u201cRain is falling\u201d. (BTW, in Japanese it\u2019s ame ga furimasu, \u201crain falls/is falling\u201d.) One of the main purposes of language is to communicate information about the world, but the accidents of grammar don\u2019t tell you anything about the world. English needs a subject for a sentence, and nobody would say \u201cI am raining\u201d or \u201cFred is raining\u201d etc., so the form English uses is some unspecified generic \u201cit\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s cold\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s humid out here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d All of those can be expressed without seeming to claim some unspecified \u201cit\u201d exists: \u201cThe ambient temperature is far below the optimal temperature for humans.\u201d \u201cThe dew point exceeds 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201d \u201cRain is failing.\u201d You should read up on a fellow named Meinong. He\u2019s known for a more specific version of what you\u2019re asking about\u2014the notion that since there are true propositions that refer to nonexistent things (e.g. \u201cThe square circle is not in Des Moines, Iowa\u201d), in some sense there is a square circle, but it just doesn\u2019t exist. Um, OK\u2026 (I suspect that Bertrand Russell had much the same reaction; he wrote a paper, \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, setting out his theory of descriptions. See also one of the early chapters of Principia Mathematica\u2014ah, there we go, chapter 14.) ",
