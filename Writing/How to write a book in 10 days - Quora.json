            "answer_text": "I suspect that you might be able to write a book in 10 days\u2014especially if it was less than 100 pages and you could harvest sections and paragraphs from previously-written projects\u2014but it might not turn out as well as other projects you have written. The exception is if you separated the writing and editing aspects, and were able to edit your book after you had written it. No book should be published until its been self and professionally edited. Self-editing is good for basic grammar and flow, but editing by an impartial editor is necessary from an independent perspective. An editor will be likely to not missing topics, like omitted segues between one topic and another, or grammar problems like repeated words or missing words. As an author, you \u201cknew\u201d what you meant to write, and when you encounter a spot where text has been omitted, your brain will automatically fill it in because it \u201cknows\u201d what you \u201cthought\u201d to write. Many times, authors will inadvertently omit \u201cnot\u201d before verbs. This can totally changing the meaning of \u201cdo not run on the stairs\u201d to \u201crun on the stairs.\u201d The only exception to the above is when I was writing a \u201cTwitter book\u201d about choosing book titles. I was sharing advice about 140 book titles and limiting my replies to 140 characters or less. Because I had decades of experience writing about the topic, I was able to write the first draft on one Saturday afternoon, and review each rentry and check the word counter on the next Saturday afternoon. Nevertheless, an outside editor still found numerous errors requiring several hours of clarification and rewriting! ",
