            "answer_text": "Writing on Medium is a great idea - no matter who you are. I often hear people recite that it's a good place to start \"for beginners\", but there's a lot more value to it even once you're well on your way. If you look around, you'll also notice a lot of big names that still write there. There are a few good reasons for it and I'll give you a few highlights below.  But first here's a little nugget about my experience writing on it. Before Medium came out I had never blogged before. Once I started (summer of 2013) I was amazed at the immediate traction I got writing on it. My first few posts got thousands of reads and it wasn't long before I was writing content that got 30,000+ reads. A few of those posts were later picked up and republished on sites like LifeHacker and The Huffington Post. I've recently been blogging on my own sites and have gotten far less reach than when I publish on Medium. Pros for Beginners: 1. You can sit down and start writing IMMEDIATELY. You don't have to mess around getting your own blog set up (which is never as easy as it sounds). 2. You can get a few posts out there and see if writing is something you're really going to stick with (before putting together your own blog). 3. You get a much larger reach than a personal blog because discoverability is so much better.  Pros for Experienced Bloggers: 1. It's a great place to share your personal stories, experiences, lessons, and opinions. I usually choose to post content like this on medium and save the more tactical, product-related stuff for HookFeed's blog.  2. Your Twitter followers are now automatically notified via email when you post something or when others in your 'network' recommend your article. This is fantastic when you've got a loyal following.  3. You're likely posting in a few places already (guest posting, your own blog, etc. - this is one more way to grow your audience and get in front of new people. 4. Although there are SEO benefits of blogging on your own site that you lose when you blog on Medium, the reach you get outweighs that (for a long time) for most people. It's worth the SEO hit to take advantage of building a larger audience up front - then shifting content over to your own site.  ---Like everything there's always more to the story but these few bullets sum up the major pros.

            "answer_text": "People laugh at me and my ideas all the time. In 2012, I clearly remember my entire advanced reporting class laughing at me as I pitched a story about \u201csugar babies.\u201d The big local newspaper editor at Orlando Sentinel laughed at me too. Orlando Weekly didn\u2019t though, and my cover story was a massive hit\u200a\u2014\u200aso much so\u200a\u2014\u200aI got Facebook tags, like the one below, from former classmates: \u201dBig ups to Lauren Holliday for having the foresight to appreciate the appeal/newsworthiness of this story a year and a half before local news media covered it. We all thought she was a bit nutty for pursuing the story and that it belonged in the Weekly, not the Sentinel, but this will likely be one of their most popular stories this month. On behalf all of us in Speere\u2019s Fall 2011 Advanced Reporting class, we stand corrected.\u201d In 2014, I clearly remember my editor at the time rejecting one of my favorite pieces I\u2019d ever written because \u201cit wasn\u2019t consumer-facing.\u201d Embarrassed because I\u2019d been rejected by this hot-shot, former CNN editor, I\u2019d forget about the post for a couple months and press pause on publishing it. Then one night, I was up late, bored, and I was just aching to publish the post in discussion on Medium. I did. Within a day, this became the most popular post I\u2019ve ever published. Look at the numbers from just the first week:  This screenshot does not even mention the number of personalized emails from really big deals, who\u2019d read and loved my post. Investors, potential partners, prospects, inspired readers, interview requests, etc. The list is pretty long. My Medium following, which hovered around 400, skyrocketed. A question I get quite often is: Why do you publish on Medium as opposed to somewhere else\u200a\u2014\u200alike your own blog perhaps? The above is just one reason why I choose to publish on Medium. In total, there are seven reasons Medium has stolen my loyalty and why I predict it\u2019ll win the war on publishing. Here they are. 1. Medium has a massive and engaged built-in audience. See above. Anyone can be somebody on Medium\u2026 Anyone who publishes phenomenal content of course.  2. Medium believes in native advertising. How annoying is it to read on Forbes?  The Forbes experience makes me cray cray. So cray cray that I always take the risk of missing a really great article as opposed to uninstalling my ad blocker or opening a different browser, like Safari, to read the post. For the sake of this post, I uninstalled my ad blocker, as I waited for Forbes to load and read my quote of the day.  Look at this\u2026  \u2026 this is Forbes \u201cAd-Light\u201d version. This page not only kills my eyes, distracts the hell out of me and completely ruins my reading experience, but it also costs me (and you) a nice chunk of money in the form of Internet data fees. \u201cBeyond loading times, web page sizes matter because most of the latest smartphone plans have data limits. Some carriers, like AT&T and Verizon, charge fees if you surpass your data allotment. So the websites with bloated ads not only take longer to load, but they can pad data consumption and phone bills.\u201d (Source) Ifyou\u2019re wondering which publications are costing you the most money in data, check out this super neat interactive chart from the New York Times.  So let\u2019s recap. Traditional Ads Drool\u2026 They cost you money in data usage, which gets pricey. My Verizon bill last month was $163\u200a\u2014\u200aa price so high because of my solo data plan. #InsaneThey\u2019re annoying, spammy and ruin the reading experience.Ads significantly increase the time it takes for articles to load; therefore, wasting your time, your battery life and your money spent on data.\u2026 and Native Advertising Rules. Like it or not, content production isn\u2019t free. We\u2019re going to have to pay to consume content, and personally, I\u2019d prefer to have brands pay through native advertising that has strict editorial guidelines. Sponsored content is a subset of native advertising, which The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)defines as \u201dpaid ads that are so cohesive with the page content, assimilated into the design, and consistent with the platform behavior that the viewer simply feels that they belong.\u201d Basically, paid posts look like any other piece of content online; the difference is that brands pay publishers to post it on their site to reach their audience. (Source) Native advertising is another post in itself so if you\u2019re interested in learning more about it, read this post. If you want to read about how Medium is going to utilize native ads, go here.  3. Medium puts writers first. One of the most important pieces of a marketplace is not demand; it\u2019s supply. At the earliest stages, how effective are you at getting suppliers on board, and how loyal are they to your service? A lot of times that actually leads to demand. If your supply is loyal, the demand will come. (Source) Medium will win because it\u2019s the ONLY place that actually protects writers from trolls. A recent story on Buzzfeed is a prime example of the above quote. In short, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and others are all competing for influential Vine stars to create content for their platforms because remember, Facebook is only a platform\u200a\u2014\u200athe content comes from individuals. Facebook is already paying media companies and celebrities to post video via its Live product. The company is offering around $250,000 for 20 posts per month over a three-month period, according to one source with knowledge of the arrangement. (BuzzFeed is among the group of Facebook Live paid media partners.) (Source) We\u2019re seeing a great awakening for content creators, including writers, and Medium is the ONLY place protecting writers from nasty trolls\u200a\u2014\u200athis is a HUGE benefit for me. Last year, I nearly quit writing after I wrote a touchy post. The commenters were brutal, and I just felt like giving up. I write because I enjoy teaching and bringing awareness to issues near and dear to my heart. I enjoy debating. I\u2019d love to debate with commenters, who have differing opinions because they know information I don\u2019t. [#GrowthMindset] Unfortunately, I haven\u2019t been able to do that because it\u2019d mean I\u2019d actually have to read all the comments\u200a\u2014\u200aeven the nasty and downright mean ones from trolls, who I can\u2019t even dignify with a response. I\u2019m not the only writer who feels this way after reading a nasty and pointless comment. Publishers that don\u2019t take writers feelings into consideration are going to lose because, remember, supply drives demand. Here\u2019s a screenshot of what Medium does to suppress trolls.  https://medium.com/the-story/notes-quote-responses-and-troll-control-99a45dfcdaa0#.76rjd0hac  4. Medium is actually transparent. If you haven\u2019t read this remarkable piece in Gizmodo, I highly suggest it. It was a somewhat shocking piece (depending on what you do for a living) about how Facebook uses human curators to boost \u201cgood\u201d content and demote \u201cbad\u201d content. These curators are all faceless contractors. One reason Facebook might want to keep the trending news operation faceless is that it wants to foster the illusion of a bias-free news ranking process\u200a\u2014\u200aa network that sorts and selects news stories like an entirely apolitical machine. After all, the company\u2019s entire media division, which is run by Facebook\u2019s managing editor Benjamin Wagner, depends on people\u2019s trust in the platform as a conduit for information. If an editorial team is deliberating over trending topics\u200a\u2014\u200ajust like a newspaper staff would talk about front-page news\u200a\u2014\u200aFacebook risks losing its image as a non-partisan player in the media industry, a neutral pipeline for distributing content, rather than a selective and inherently flawed curator. (Source) Facebook\u2019s ranking algorithm should NOT be a secret and neither should these contractors. /sidebar We\u2019re praising coders for their algorithms like there\u2019s no tomorrow, but it\u2019s actually humans\u200a\u2014\u200ajournalists in fact\u200a\u2014\u200awho are the algorithm. This is another blog post but just something to chew on. /sidebar I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t like companies trying to BS me. Medium doesn\u2019t do that. I can easily read about Medium\u2019s News + Curation Team here\u200a\u2014\u200aeven see a freakin\u2019 face behind Medium\u200a\u2014\u200ahow refreshing.  https://medium.com/the-story/meet-medium-s-news-curation-team-3feb0ee3ff65#.naerffuf0 Then I can read Medium\u2019s Curation: Guidelines and Principles. Transparency is fair, which brings me to my next point.  5. Medium is fair. There\u2019s justice on Medium. It\u2019s like the American dream for bloggers\u200a\u2014\u200aany blogger, any lil\u2019 ole\u2019 blogger like me\u200a\u2014\u200acan make it on Medium with just one post.   6. There\u2019s actual people\u200a\u2014\u200alike team members\u200a\u2014\u200abehind Medium, who are accessible. I love that Medium shows who posted jobs.  Medium isn\u2019t some black hole on the Internet. Its team members actually use the platform and add value to it. #AccessibilityRules #BlackHolesDrool  7. Medium is beautiful. I love writing on Medium. I love highlighting on Medium. And I think there\u2019s a lot of potential for me to love responding on Medium. It\u2019s simple, intuitive and focused on your words. I love that I can highlight. When I\u2019m not reading on Medium, I use a Chrome extension, called Highly, but it\u2019s not as enjoyable to use as Medium\u2019s highlighting feature. This brings me to my conclusion\u2026 Imagine how beneficial it would be to us\u200a\u2014\u200areaders and writers\u200a\u2014\u200aactual platform users if Medium was the publishing platform of choice. I think my wish will come sooner rather than later, and there\u2019s your seven reasons why. ",
