            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what I think is a defining moment of terror. It sneaks up on you but unlike a jump scare, it\u2019s usually a series of events or moments that when put together, it creates a fear that slowly builds along with realization of the moments coming together and the fear builds in concert with the mental calculation of the situation.  So, scary is a moment. Walking in on a scene and that moment, cranks up your nerves and you immediately get the fear response. And it could anything from blood splattered walls to a lone doll in the middle of a long hallway. And it can be a piece of the puzzle that leads to terror.   Creepy, can also be a moment but can also just be a feeling. Just seeing a person standing still on a streetwithout moving, a pitch black room or an abandoned house can create the moment that we call creepy.  Because you never know if this moment might turn into this..  Anyway, this is just what I think. I have clearly watched way to many scary movies to have this deep of an opinion about moments. ",
