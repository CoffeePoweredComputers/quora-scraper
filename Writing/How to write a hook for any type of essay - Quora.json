            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to start by explaining to you that the hook is absolutely unnecessary. Seriously. Almost every essay that you write is what I call \u201cpre-sold.\u201d If you\u2019re writing an essay for a class you\u2019re taking, your audience is your instructor. Your instructor is reading your essay because he or she is your instructor. Reading your essay is part of the job, right? If you\u2019re writing your essay because you want it to be published in some academic journal, your audience is some scholar who is reading your essay because he or she is researching or is planning to cite your work. He or she don\u2019t need to get \u201chooked\u201d because entertainment isn\u2019t part of it. Imagine if you wrote an essay\u2014the greatest essay ever written. It would cure all of the world\u2019s ills. It would teach the world to sing in perfect harmony (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s trademarked somewhere, right?) and make sure that no one would want for anything. Unfortunately, you couldn\u2019t figure out how to create a good hook for it. Now we\u2019ll never have world peace! Alas. You may as well never have bothered to put pen to paper\u2014or maybe fingers to keyboard? The hook is part of the introduction. Most introductions in the academic world go unread. We really jump in to read from the meat of the paper, taking what we need. Let\u2019s say that you really did need a hook, though. Perhaps you\u2019re writing for the New Yorker or you\u2019re really writing some kind of editorial, or persuasive speech. There are a few recognized methods for writing a hook. Recount some anecdote. As an example, if I were going to write about drug addiction or spousal abuse, I might tell the fable of The Scorpion and the Frog.Write some really vivid description. If I were going to write about some historical event like 9/11 (overdone) or the death of John Lennon, I might look up the weather for that day and lead up to the fact that no one realized what a dark and earth shaking event would happen on that day.Define an important term that some people don\u2019t often understand. If I were writing about stage fright, I might explain the real meaning for the word \u201canxious,\u201d which some interpret as \u201cexcited\u201d but really means \u201cafraid\u201d and \u201cworried.\u201dRelate some exciting trivia. For example, if I were going to talk about US politics, I might point out that Jimmy Carter was the last president we had who didn\u2019t get us involved in a war or that Richard Nixon may have been a great foreign policy president, but he was an inveterate racist.Use a hypothetical situation which leads to some interesting idea or paradox. For example, if I\u2019m going to write about voting, I might say, \u201cIn the last presidential election, the public was given a choice between Hillary Clinton or her one-time most vocal supporter.\u201dCreate a powerful metaphor or analogy which some might find questionable. If writing about gun ownership, I might describe background checks as a being like getting a license for a car\u2026 except that you don\u2019t have a constitutional right to own a car.Choose a really solid quote. The trick is not to use something too clich\u00e9. Instead of quoting something which has been used so many times that it has lost all meaning to some like \u201cMartin Luther King once said, \u2018I have a dream,\u2019\u201d consider a quote like, \u201cTupac Shakur once said, \u2018Wars come and go, but my soldiers stay eternal.\u2019\u201d Yes. I said it. I\u2019d rather that you quoted Tupac than the Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King Junior.There are other things you can do. You can be humorous, heartfelt, etc. but those aren\u2019t things you can teach. You can\u2019t really teach people to be emotional or to connect to others except through practice. If you aren\u2019t naturally good at those approaches, maybe you should focus on what you can do. Plus, humor (and emotion in general) is risky. The key to a great hook is that it should be something at least mildly surprising and which somehow makes sense in the overall context of your essay. It has to have the right tone. It takes practice. The good news is that you generally have time. Talk to people about the topic. Bounce thoughts off of them. See how you try to get them interested in the topic. ",

            "answer_text": "Repeat yourself. One of these is a short story by David Consiglio-the second is one that I wrote for dog heirs. Radically different topics, but you will be able to appreciate the constant reminder of thought train though repetitions. first, Daves: I do a lot of walking. Tonight, my walk is in the rain. People scurry past as I walk under the elevated tracks. The last train of the night clatters past. Car horns blare in the distance. The smell of cheap beer and deep fried food wafts into the street from a nearby dive bar. I don\u2019t hurry - I\u2019m just a guy walking in the rain. Nothing to see here. My employer demands detail and precision in every job, but particularly one this high profile. That\u2019s why he chose me. I\u2019m an assassin, and when I come for you, you die. It\u2019s not like what you think, being an assassin. People think it\u2019s all killing, but I hardly do any killing. Mostly I walk. You see, anyone can kill - that\u2019s easy. But in my line of work, it has to be done perfectly. That means no witnesses, no evidence, no loose strings. So I move to a new town. I walk the streets at night in the places the target likes to go. I learn where the he eats, what bars he goes to, what kind of music he likes, who he\u2019s married to and who he\u2019s screwing on the side. I do a lot of walking. Marco is the mayor of this town. Normally I don\u2019t hit politicians because the heat puts me out of commission for too long. But my employer wanted me specifically for this job. He didn\u2019t say why; he never says why. He never says much of anything. Mostly it\u2019s just a name, maybe a photo, and a sheet of paper with a phone number and that curious phrase Everyone Dies\u2122 I don\u2019t ask - I just do my job. But I got a feeling why someone might want Marco killed. He\u2019s pushing hard against organized crime. It\u2019s not because he wants to clean up the city, mind you. No, he\u2019s pushing hard because he wants to be in charge of the crime in this town. He wants the money funneling through city hall, not the local mob bosses. Maybe one of those bosses pulled the trigger on this hit. Maybe he hired my employer to make Marco disappear. Maybe not. It doesn\u2019t matter. I peer into the window of the Mexican joint where Marco is still stuffing his face. Marco can stuff stupid amounts of refried beans into his oversized face hole. Little does he know that he\u2019s eating his last meal. So why tonight? Tonight is perfect. For starters, there\u2019s the rain: rain makes everything better for me. It muffles any sound this dumb mook might make. I\u2019ll garrote him so quickly he won\u2019t have time to talk. But sometimes guys flail, and Marco\u2019s got a hundred pounds on me easy. If he kicks over a trash can or falls into something noisy, people will just think it\u2019s the rain, if they hear it at all. The rain\u2019s good for more than muffling the noise, though. It washes away footprints, blood, everything. And people don\u2019t poke around into other peoples\u2019 business in the rain. People stay home and watch TV when it rains like they\u2019re supposed to. Marco is still stuffing his face, so I start walking up the street again. When you hold still people notice you, but when you\u2019re walking you\u2019re invisible. Up the street, around the corner, down the street, across the street, back to the cantina. Marco is on his way out now. Of course he doesn\u2019t pay, and the last thing I see before I put my head down is the owner\u2019s disgusted face. He\u2019s paying protection money to Marco and the local mob boss; it\u2019s bleeding him dry and this jerk doesn\u2019t even pay for his nachos. A guy like that deserves to die if you ask me. But no one asks me. They just give me a job, and I do the job. Marco walks out of the restaurant and down the street. He\u2019s with his two enormous body guards as usual. These two are unusually large, even as bodyguards go, but they\u2019re no good at their job. I\u2019ve been watching them work for weeks, and they let the boss out of their sight all the time. I walk past, turn the corner, and rush to take my position. My speed alarms no one - it\u2019s raining. The bodyguards don\u2019t worry me because they\u2019re walking Marco to an apartment where one of his girlfriends lives. He likes to visit Angela on Thursdays\u2026never did figure out why he liked her on Thursday. Doesn\u2019t matter now. She\u2019ll never see him. Right on cue the bodyguards stop at the front entrance to the alley while Marco walks right in, past the dumpster and the back entrance to the liquor store to the stairs that will take him to Angela\u2019s. I\u2019m under those stairs, soaked to the bone and a little out of breath, but calm. It\u2019s dark back here, and Marco\u2019s eyes still haven\u2019t adjusted. So when I say \u201cHey\u201d in a soft voice, Marco doesn\u2019t notice my faint French accent or my ebon skin. He can\u2019t see or hear much of anything. That\u2019s ok - I just want him to pause, which he dutifully does. This is my favorite part. I move swiftly around behind him, wrap the wire around his neck, and crush his windpipe. All those years in medical school did one thing for me - I know how to destroy a man\u2019s larynx in a second. Marco falls to his knees in panic, lets out a soft gurgle, and then falls face first onto the wet pavement of the alley. I keep the pressure up on the garrote for a few minutes, just to make sure. Marco has been very accommodating in the way he fell and I only have to drag his gelatinous bulk a few feet to the alcove beneath the steps where I\u2019d been waiting for him. I pull out my phone and take a photo. The flash goes off, but on such a perfect night a faint shimmer of lightning covers my action. By Horus I love a night like this. I walk casually out the back entrance of the alley and into the night. I hope I never return to this town. I probably never will. I text the number my employer gave me with the job. I attach the photo. He always sends the same reply: A+ Never figured that out, either. Probably never will. It doesn\u2019t matter - the deposit notification appears on my phone a few minutes later. By then I\u2019m more than half a mile from Marco\u2019s rapidly cooling body. He won\u2019t be found for another two hours and by then I\u2019ll have walked all the way to the train station and on to the next assignment. I do a lot of walking. And mine: We buried Webber Saturday. Kim was very eloquent with her Face Book eulogy; I am afraid I am not feeling so refined. I realize that this is not going to reach anyone whom this would apply to, but I still need to vent, to rage, to scream. My hands are fine. About two years ago I was refinishing a table out at dad\u2019s plant: 80k feet, empty building, no lights except where I was in the very back. Then, out of the dark, I distinctly heard the ticking of nails on concrete. Couldn\u2019t see a thing, until about thirty seconds later a graying, 10-ish black lab came wandering out of the darkness, wagging his tail.No, collar, unneutered, no microchip; Cherylyn from the grocery store about a mile away said that she had seen a tan pickup truck drop him off and drive away. He tried to run after them, but he couldn\u2019t keep up.He just turned around and sat down, waiting for them to return. They never did. He was sick, you see; they apparently didn\u2019t want to bother to have him checked out. They would have realized that it was a simply urinary tract infection; easily cleared up. He kept waiting. My hands are fine. Manager at the grocery-\u201cCherylyn\u201d-refused to call anyone because she \u201c\u2026didn\u2019t want o get involved.\u201d After several calls to her general manager, her district supervisor, and Food Lion Corporate I damn well made SURE that she got involved.\u201cCherylyn\u201d even made the comment that \u201c..at least if he got hit by a car it\u2019d be quick.\u201d Ever see a dog hit by a car, you dribbling shithead? I have a little more than casual acquaintance with this. It is not usually \u201cquick\u201d by any reasonable definition of the word. It usually involves a lot of blood, a lot of agony, a lot of whimpering and crying, dimming eyes pleading for help. Not to mention the damage it does to someone\u2019s bumper-and maybe the people inside. Thankfully he was smart enough to stay out of the thoroughfare. But the damage was done: a senior dog near the end of his days had just been tossed like a piece of trash because his piece-of-shit owner\u2019s decided that they were going to drop him off and let him be someone else\u2019s problem. He apparently though he could make it home on his own; he started walking. And walking. And walking. Finally he came in through the open door at the plant-I suspect he was desperately trying to find someone who would be nice to him and help him find his family; obviously it was a mistake that they left him. My hands are fine. Next stop: Ed\u2019s front seat. He digs Jimmy Buffet. We ran around for weeks trying to find his owners (we were still under the misguided impression that he had just snuck off during \u201c\u2019bath time\u201d.Anyway, Webber lived with us along with the rest of the canine cast-offs that we\u2019ve collected for two long fun-filled years: lots of pats and snuggles, no shortage of food, lots of buddies to play with on a regular basis, treats left and right. He got to travel with us, and generally had about as good a time as a dog could.But time caught up with us-he took sick and three weeks later (and several large unhelpful veterinary invoices) later he was gone. He was with Kim when he passed; I am so glad that he at least had company and didn\u2019t die alone.But I am still reeling with the concept that some people can be so flippant with the life an animal that has nothing but you. We are their entire world; they spend 90% of their very very short hours on this rock trusting, loving and waiting on people to come home. To praise them, to spend time with them, to treat them like they are-at least for a short time-the center of someone else\u2019s world.And yet so many clods out their ignore that trust, ignore that devotion, ignore that adoration and just toss them aside when it\u2019s no longer convenient. To turn trust love and devotion into a disposable commodity that has no real value.And the rest of us upright apes act all surprised and wonder why/how our youth can walk into a school or a movie theater and start putting bullets into people they don\u2019t even know; without even the first concern about the families that they are destroying, the lives they are wrecking, the aftermath of the massacres. If you can\u2019t understand loyalty or trust on a small scale then I guess it\u2019s bound to escape you on the big one. So, once again, we buried a trusting friend that some other asshole dumped without a second thought. My hands are fine. And I am under a rapidly building blind rage. Because they shouldn\u2019t be. They should be bleeding after digging a 4 foot deep hole into the hard packed ground. They should be blistered after moving over a cubic yard of dirt and rocks. They should be bruised and torn from the bare wood shovel handle; no gloves. They should be battered after moving heavy earth from over a yard down for yet another friend's grave. But, my hands are just fine. You see, they have toughened up quite a bit over the years. The human body gets used to ANY task that it has to do repeatedly. ",
