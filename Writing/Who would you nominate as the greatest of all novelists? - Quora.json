            "answer_text": "I know this more or less avoids the question, but honestly, I wouldn\u2019t nominate any single writer. The history of the novel is too diverse to make fair comparisons. In the 18th Century, for example, the novel was considered a sub-literate form. Nonfiction was all the rage. Hence the reason you get guys like Defoe, Swift and Fielding writing tons of nonfiction pamphlets and occasionally a novel. If you wrote fiction back then, you probably wrote plays. The novel was in its infancy. The 19th Century, by contrast, saw the rise of the novel as the premiere form of entertainment. You get Dickens, Trollope, Hugo, Tolstoy, etc. This era probably produced the greatest novelists, simply because the novel grew to encompass such a huge range of elements. Think of Les Miserables, Hugo\u2019s masterpiece: you get a detective story, history lessons, military lectures, a diatribe on the construction of Parisian sewers\u2026you could stuff so much in a novel back then. The 20th Century cleaned out a lot of those elements, thanks mostly to competition with other forms of entertainment, as well as the rise of other technologies. You don\u2019t need to describe houses and landscapes and clothing, etc. in great detail when you live in an era that has mass photography. These days, you can never leave home but know exactly what London looks like, or Paris, or wherever. You could compare novelists from different eras, though, based upon how well their work has sunk into the cultural conscience. For example, everyone is familiar with Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, even if they\u2019ve never read the novel or seen any of the movies. The story, its themes and characters, have become part of the culture. Personally, I think this is how novelists last. By that standard, Mary Shelley, Arthur Conan Doyle and Bram Stoker are greater novelists than, say, Virginia Wolfe or William Faulkner. Clearly, this discounts anything related to style, sentence structure, etc. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a fair way to compare writers, although I would argue that it\u2019s how every writer is eventually judged. Either your work becomes part of the culture, or you are forgotten. ",

            "answer_text": "Fyodor Dostoevsky (Greatest of all time) My favorite author. His writings are a treat to readers. No other author can portray human emotions as exquisitely as Dostoevsky.
