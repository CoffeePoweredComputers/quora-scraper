            "answer_text": "Reading will indeed improve your grammar. But you should also concentrate on the mechanics of the sentence, which is the only mechanism available to you to convey your ideas. Writers convey their ideas to readers with the sentence. And there are only two types of English sentences and only two types. #1  Those sentences that ascribe an attribute to a subject. For example, I am fat. My dog is ugly. #2  Those sentences that describe an action: Subject, Predicate, (optional) Object. Then there are only 8 ways to add more information into a basic sentence. See Chapter 12 of The Little Brown Handbook, which is available on-line for free. Practice writing a single sentence: Think of an idea and then write it down using one sentence. Remember that you only have two types of sentences to choice from. Add information to that sentence using the 8 ways that English writers can add information into a sentence. Rewrite the sentence several times to emphasize different aspects or to make your idea clearer. Read other people\u2019s sentences and see how they accomplished conveying their idea. Remember only 2 types of sentences and only 8 ways to add information. Generally one paragraph is used to convey one idea. Read other people\u2019s paragraphs and see how they conveyed their idea using several sentences. Practice writing a single paragraph to convey one idea where often you will need only one sentence to do the job. In summary, you should practice writing the sentence and then practice the paragraph to convey an idea as clearly as you can. And then good grammar will naturally follow because good grammar produces the clearest writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the answer is yes. Reading books not only provides you with knowledge and relaxes your mind but it also helps you to improve your English grammar. While going through any book you will be introduced to many words and you will be given an idea of many sentences presented in different ways. And, to speak English, the most important thing you need to take care of is grammar. I will say tense is the first thing you need to understand to frame any sentence in a correct way. Because a tense is the only important grammar that tells us the time of happening of an event. Many of us have a good word stock but because of improper grammar, we fail to compose a sentence. So, yes, read books. You can really frame sentences in different ways and you can have the idea of where and how to use specific parts of speech. Besides reading books, a good grammar tutorial will add to your improvement. ",

            "answer_text": "My solution was this: Write like a mad bastard. If needed, I\u2019d write something based on the song lyric running through my head. Or, when I was really blocked, I\u2019d pause the story and write something about heresy. Then once I was done, I\u2019d avoid reading any of it for a week. Then I\u2019d go back and re-write it, correcting spelling errors, cleaning up errors in logic, adding stuff I should have thought of the first time, and generally improving. I would now recommend getting help. When we edit our own works, we are prone to see what we intended to write, not necessarily what we actually wrote. We often miss our own errors that we\u2019d see clearly if someone else made them. But the biggest thing is: give it time. In a week or a month, you\u2019ll be able to clearly see your errors. ",
