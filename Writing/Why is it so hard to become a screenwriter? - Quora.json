            "answer_text": "Other answers have focussed on the tremendous amount of hard work the job takes so I\u2019m going to address one other very important element: subject matter. There are literally tens of thousands of scripts written by wannabe writers every year and at the heart of each script is a subject they each think is unique or special or, at minimum, marketable. That means between all the amateurs and the professionals, there is a huge amount of overlap in subject matter. If a producer receives two submissions on singing Mafia hit men, one from a writer he or she has never heard of, and another from a produced writer, who do you think the producer is going to go with? It\u2019s a relatively small, exclusive group, (produced writers) and even gaining access for them can be very difficult because so many scripts seem to be about the same things, slightly varied. Producers are awash in a sea of sameness. And yet, the best path for a new screenwriter is to find a unique story, the one that proverbially glows in the dark, that jumps out of the slush pile and says \u201cyou haven\u2019t seen THIS before.\u201d Keep in mind, all those produced writers, who spend their waking as well as unconscious lives fixated on finding something unique, are probably going to beat you to that producer\u2019s door. And here\u2019s the kicker. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve stumbled over some special tale, something that hasn\u2019t been seen before. Most producers are still going to be much more comfortable going with a known writer with a script that is only a slight variation on something we have seen before. If you did manage to get to a producer with something special, I can almost guarantee you are going to get rewritten by that producer\u2019s favorite writer in that genre. One last point. You may be sitting there in the darkened theater saying you could write a script that well. Maybe you can, but if you hope to break in you have to write a script that is much, much better than a draft by a produced writer. In other words, an unknown has a higher bar to pass than the known writers. That\u2019s what makes it so difficult to become a screenwriter. ",

            "answer_text": "Because screenwriting is like designing your own car from scratch and make sure that those who ride it reaches the destination you programed. So in other words, you must assemble all the pieces of the car into a pleasant design, make sure it all works and that the ride will be comfortable\u2026 So there are many layers to writing, many which requires psychology (which car design peoples will like to ride), sociology (as you need to please, not only one but as many peoples as possible), science, maths and so forth, just to make sure every part that needs to fire in your car engine, works\u2026 It\u2019s why screenwriting is less an art than a form of alchemy, as it requires lots of knowledge from life itself. Mainly because its all about storytelling and since you can write only what you know about, you need a pretty darn good life experience to make a script work, as otherwise, what you\u2019ll have to say will most likely have been told by many others before you\u2026 So you have to break free from the box (your life \u201cfishbowl\u201d) and learn or experience things that very few other writers came about\u2026 I was never good in literature playing with words to present them in a pretty way was never a thing for me. I preferred content rather than structure. So if you prefer the aesthetic of words, I advise you to write a book instead\u2026 As writing a script will require way too much work, unless, of course, you are lucky\u2026 But I can tell you, that luck as little to do in this field\u2026 ",
