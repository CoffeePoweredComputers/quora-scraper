            "answer_text": "Some of the differences between the terms 'understanding', 'intelligence', 'comprehension', and 'knowledge' are not subtle. Intelligence stands out from the others because it is an ability. We often measure intelligence by knowledge that has been gained. Actually the level of intelligence measures the ease with which a person can learn and solve problems. A person from another place or time with high intelligence may comprehend a completely different body of knowledge than a person from here and now. Knowledge usually refers to the actual facts, theories and processes that a person learns. Understanding and comprehension are the most similar terms, with comprehension having the connotation of a greater amount of \u2018understanding\u2019 or insight than simple understanding. ",

            "answer_text": "Keep in mind that definitions are general things. People develop their own exact definitions due to their learning experiences. Here are my definitions: Understanding: to know how and why something works, and what it will do in given circumstances. Intelligence: the combination of understanding and the IQ to apply that learning to solve problems. Comprehension is a synonym for understanding. Knowledge is simply access to information. A database has lots of knowledge, but no clue how to do anything new with it. It only uses programming it remembers to do what it is told to do. No thinking. For example, an encyclopedia has lots of knowledge and no intelligence or understanding. ",

When applied to an object it means how much organized data it represents. Understanding means base ability to apply a given set of instructions, skills, or processes. Comprehension is all of that and applies some ability to cross-reference. Knowledge is the amount of storage of those same instructions, skills, or processes. ",

I would need to write you an essay to illustrate the point but I have no time, unfortunately. A person may have a high degree of intelligence, for example, but have no understanding of his friend\u2019s problems. A student\u2019s comprehension of what he reads may be excellent, yet he may still acquire little knowledge as he is too lazy to learn. ",
