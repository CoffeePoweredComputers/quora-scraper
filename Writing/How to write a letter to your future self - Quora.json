I know you are better than me, you have learned a lot from life and earned a lot that I had thought of. But I really hope you still have the same values and ethics, you still haven't lost yourself to the race of fame, money and success. You still live your life to the fullest. I love you a lot for your learning spirit, your confidence, your ethics and your way of thinking. Hope that's all the same in you. Am I still living in you? With love, Me\u2026 ",
