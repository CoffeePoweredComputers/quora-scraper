            "answer_text": "Generally speaking - Amazon will not accept a handset in exchange if it has physical damage. The idea being that exchanged handsets are ultimately cannibalized OR sold as refurbished. Hence, the handset accepted in exchange must be in saleable or harvestable condition. Having said this - you can take your chances with the Delivery Executive's perception and interpretation of Amazon's exchange policy. Minor damage is often overlooked as it is part of the wear and tear (ageing) of the device. So, I would recommend you book your favourite handset in the Great Indian Festival Sale, in exchange. The Delivery Executive who brings your new handset will collect the old one, so he will either exchange on-the-spot or decline the exchange. You will just lose the Rs 100 exchange fee if the Delivery Executive rejects. On the other hand - You got yourself a new handset with a great discount and exchange offer if he accepts!! So go right ahead and roll the dice \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can exchange a phone with broken screen also. When you fill in the details of the old phone to be exchanged, you will get options to declare the condition of your old phone and mention the defects. the final exchange of the old phone will be determined basis the details you mention about the old phone here. it is advisable to be honest in mentioning the details, as the delivery executive who will come to collect the old phone will inspect the old phone, and if the condition of the phone is different from what is mentioned by the customer, then the value of the old phone might change (from the value mentioned on the site) ",
