            "answer_text": "Your best bet would be not using any specific common words to start your conclusion. Just make it natural and flowing. Avoid using distinct stock phrases to tell the user what you are about to do. Some commonly overused phrases are: In conclusion...In summary...After all...To sum up..And lots and lots of others. These definitely can be words to start your conclusion, BUT these are not good words to do it. I believe you got the point. Avoid using clumsy concluding phrases, but better use smooth transition words. Some general tips would be: Synthesize the main points of your essay, but make sure you don't just summarize it.Emphasize your thesis statement, but avoid merely restating it.Close the arguments raised in your essay, but think about drawing out some new ideas, outside the scope of your essay.Start your conclusion with a transition sentence without using cliche phrases mentioned above. If you do it right you wouldn't have to state it - it will be clear that you are wrapping up your essay.The following strategies may help you move beyond merely summarizing the key points of your essay. If your essay deals with a contemporary problem, warn readers of the possible consequences of not attending to the problem. You can even try recommending a specific course of action. Another good idea would be using an apt quotation or expert opinion to lend authority to the conclusion you have reached. If you provide startling statistic, fact, or visual image to drive home the ultimate point of your paper it will definitely strengthen your conclusion. Thus make sure that discipline encourages personal reflection, illustrate your concluding point with a relevant narrative drawn from your own life experiences. Return to an anecdote, example, or quotation that you introduced in your introduction, but add further insight that derives from the body of your essay. Hope that helps! Below are couple effective strategies to use when writing your essay conclusion: The \"Addressing limitations\" strategy When you use the \"addressing limitations\" strategy to write your conclusion, you are discussing the possible weaknesses of your argument and, thus, the fallibility of your overall conclusion. This strategy is often useful in concluding papers on scientific studies and experiments. For example, consider a paper about an apparent correlation between religious belief and support for terrorism. An \"addressing limitations\" conclusion for this paper might suggest that the apparent correlation relies on the paper's definition of \"terrorism\" and, since the definition is not objective, the apparent correlation might have been wrongly identified. To use this strategy, ask yourself, \"In what aspects is my argument lacking? What are the circumstances in which my conclusions might be wrong?\" Polishing your conclusion and your paper After you've completed your conclusion, look over what you have written and consider making some small changes to promote clarity and originality: Unless your discipline requires them, remove obvious transitions like \"in conclusion,\" \"in summary,\" and \"in result\" from your conclusion; they get in the way of the actual substance of your conclusion.Consider taking a strong phrase from your conclusion and using it as the title or subtitle of your paper.Also, be sure to proofread your conclusion carefully for errors and typos. You should double-check your entire paper for accuracy and correct spelling as well. ",

            "answer_text": "A conclusion must be a unique paragraph that reviews what you\u2019ve taught and shared with the reader thus far. You need to leave a mark on the reader\u2019s memory, you must make it memorable for the right reasons. However, you should not, like others have stated, simply take your thesis and your paragraph starters and just throw them in there and call it a day. It all depends on the type of essay you\u2019re writing. I\u2019d prefer by getting friendly and familiar with the audience of the essay, especially if it\u2019s a persuasive piece. Get loose, but not too loose. Don\u2019t forget what makes an essay, well, an essay! Never ever use words or phrases that basically say you\u2019re wrapping the piece. It makes you look unprofessional, especially in informative pieces such as advertisements, reports, or letters. \u201cThis concludes\u2026\u201d \u201cThe end to\u2026\u201d is unacceptable! What are you doing? This isn\u2019t the ending of a documentary from the 50s!! This is a professional medium in which you are telling us something. Just remember what you can\u2019t use in an essay, and remember how you aren\u2019t supposed to talk directly to the audience and to directly address yourself. Make it fresh, small reminders here and there. If you were to watch a cartoon, you notice how sometimes the episode starts out differently, they learn their lesson, and then go back to what they were doing at the start of that very same episode only with the lesson in mind to guide that action? Do that. Just\u2026not too intense. You got a great conclusion, and you get a good grade! Good luck! ",
