            "answer_text": "If search engine optimization is a science, than keyword targeting is kinda like handling chemicals in a lab. It must be done carefully. Over-optimizing your content with keywords \u2013 or \"stuffing\" as it's commonly referred to \u2013 will negatively impact your search rankings, while not targeting the right keywords at the appropriate volume will hurt your visibility as well. It's all about balance. But what exactly does that mean? Funny you should ask... How many times should I use a specific keyword? While this is more of an inexact science, the general rule of thumb is to include specific keywords no more than five times in a standard blog post. Anything else can be considered spammy to the reader and negatively impact the user experience. Google even warns against \u201crepeating the same words or phrases so often that it sounds unnatural.\u201d What this means for you Avoid including keywords more than five times simply for the sake of including them to increase SEO value. This can actually detract from your efforts, as Google penalizes for \u201ckeyword stuffing.\u201d What is keyword stuffing? Google defines keyword stuffing as \u201cthe practice of loading a web page with keywords or numbers in an attempt to manipulate a site\u2019s ranking in Google search results. Often these keywords appear in a list or group, or out of context (not as natural prose). Filling pages with keywords or numbers results in a negative user experience, and can harm your site\u2019s ranking.\u201d In order to avoid this, create helpful content that speaks to the needs of your audience. Include keywords in an appropriate manner and within context of the article. The general rule of thumb among marketers is to keep mentions of a specific keyword to around five in any blog post. ",

            "answer_text": "Keywords remain incredibly great for SEO but too much of it is not always better. Ideally, you would need to focus on one or two long-tail keywords for your article. Here's how your approach should be: Focus on just one keyword and write about it as naturally as possible. It should blend well with the rest of your article and deliver the message to your intended readers.After a month or two, review the post if it's ranking. Then check out what related keywords the page is being found through.Take your time in layering in additional keywords for optimisation.But overall, don't get too hung up on the quantity of keywords you are going to use. Think quality - focus on finding the right keyword first. ",
