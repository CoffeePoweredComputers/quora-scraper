            "answer_text": "I read in a book about Punjabi that, Arabic script can be considered the national script of Pakistan. Its not specific to Punjabis. Pakistan is an Islamic State and Arabic script is highly preferred because it's the script of Quran also. The script was introduced in South Asia by Persians and Persianised Empires(who in turn were introduced to the script by the Arab Conquest of Persia). So, Urdu the National Language of Pakistan, Punjabi, Sindhi,Pashto and Balochi languages all are written in Perso Arabic.(with modifications for sounds). Arabic Script use by Country,   Islam was actually spread by Punjabi Sufi Saints also using Perso Arabic script. I can't find the source but i read at one point Punjabi was 3rd most important language of Islam after Arabic and Persian. Fariduddin Ganjshakar of Pak Pattan is generally recognised as the first major poet of the Punjabi language.(12th Century) Popular Poet of Punjabi : Baba Farid  Era of Sufi Saints Roughly from the 11th century to 19th century, many great Sufi saints and poets preached in the Punjabi language. Bulle Shah is considered one of the greatest Sufi poets. Punjabi Sufi poetry developed under Shah Hussain (1538\u20131599), Sultan Bahu (1628\u20131691), Shah Sharaf (1640\u20131724), Ali Haider (1690\u20131785), Saleh Muhammad Safoori (son of Hazrat Mai Safoora Qadiriyya, whom Ali Haider had given great tribute) and Bulleh Shah (1680\u20131757).  I as an Indian Punjabi have also learned Perso-Arabic to connect to wider Punjabi History.(in turn lots of Muslim World). When Bengal was ruled by an Islamic State, Bengal Sultanate, it also had Persian as official language along with Bengali and Arabic for religious use. Its written Shahi Bangalah in Perso Arabic Script.  Bengal did get 'Persianised' to an extent The Bengal Sultanate was an absolute monarchy. The Ilyas Shahi dynasty promoted a Persianate society. It copied the pre-Muslim Persian tradition of monarchy and statecraft. The courts of the capital cities sanctified the sultan, used Persianized royal paraphernalia, adopted an elaborate court ceremony modeled on the Sasanian imperial paradigm, employed a hierarchical bureaucracy, and promoted Islam as the state religion. The rise of Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah saw more native elements inducted in the courts. The Hussain Shahi dynasty employed many Hindus in the government and promoted a form of religious pluralism. Also Bengali script is not Devanagari, it's Eastern Nagari. There were disputes later on between West and East Pakistan(Urdu as official language as one of the disputes). East Pakistan later became Bangladesh and preserved the Bengali Script. As to why, reason is Bengali as a language has always been stronger than Punjabi, although they are of similar age, plus Punjabis were ruled by foreign powers for way longer.

            "answer_text": "As a Bengali, I am a bit irritated for a dash of ignorance in this question that I must clarify. We Bengalis of Bangladesh fought for our right to not only speak our language, but also partially to keep our language\u2019s script from becoming the Arabic script. Devanagari is the script of several Indian languages that are not Bengali. We Bengalis have pride in our own writing system for our own language. The reason for Pakistani Punjabis to write in Nastaliq is because they\u2019ve decided to go with a more Islamic identity in more recent times, and adopted a writing system to show it. Whether one cherishes their religion of all things over their ethnicity or nationality is not my problem, however much I disagree with it. However, just know that the Bengalis of Bangladesh (and of India as well, I hope) have their pride in things other than their religion, like their native culture and literature, and because of this, I think we decided to fight for our tongues and scripts. I welcome anyone to disagree and correct me here, thank you for your time. ",
