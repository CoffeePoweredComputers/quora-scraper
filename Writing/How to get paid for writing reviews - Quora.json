            "answer_text": "As of this very moment, nobody cares about your opinion on the movie / book / play / whatever it is you want to review. In order to start seeing revenue for that writing, you need to make people value your opinions. That generally means you need to write quite a few of them (at zero profit), publish them to your blog or website (or youtube if you\u2019re doing it via video) for people to consume. If your content is something they find worthwhile, word will spread and you\u2019ll get more and more hits. THEN you can start getting advertizers to your site and start earning revenue. ",
