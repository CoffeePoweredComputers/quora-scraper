By reading how they market their shoes, you'll get a good idea of what matters to shoe buyers and what points of comparison can be made.Don't focus on the length of the review. A succinct and accurate review is what readers look for.Instead, focus on the organisation of your review.Clearly mention the shoe you are reviewing.Provide the specs, that is size, colour, material used etc.Write about how the shoes feel once worn.Write about the price range.Write about the maintainability and ruggedness of the shoes.Include your opinions about the best usage for the shoes, and compare the shoes with others in its class.Finally, ensure that you provide a good summary for the review. A good summary can take a review to the next level.Cheers! ",
