            "answer_text": "Because I\u2019ve taken dozens of writing classes and seminars and know how to write a spectacular, sharp novel that contains no grammatical errors, has no cliches, has a fresh plot, compelling characters, hooks where they are supposed to be, interesting twists, perfect pacing, and killer dialogue. I know the market, what is expected in each genre, and how to write the correct number of pages according to the guidelines. My chapters are the correct length for the type of story I\u2019ve written, my scenes are stellar, and there are no POV problems. Because I have accumulated all this knowledge and it just begs to be organized into a how-to book. Remember your competition is every known and successful author in the world who are also contacting publishing houses and pitching their books and hoping to fill the limited slots the houses have each season.

            "answer_text": "Authors write books about writing because people buy them. That\u2019s the only reason. If you really want to write, then WRITE - I don\u2019t believe reading books about writing will make you into a good writer! It can be a waste of time and frustrating as well. I\u2019ve read books about writing and about writer\u2019s block - the only way to be a writer and to get rid of writers block is to knuckle down, stretch you fingers and just get WRITING!! Reading about riding a horse will not make you into a horse-rider or jockey! Reading about flying an airplane won\u2019t make you a pilot. = you HAVE to DO it, practice, do it better, write more, write better, keep on at your or pace and in your own style. If you want to be a writer, just write. ",
