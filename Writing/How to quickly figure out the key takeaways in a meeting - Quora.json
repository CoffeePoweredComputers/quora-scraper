            "answer_text": "There are various techniques I've developed over the years for this, most of them subconsciously. Firstly, don't write a transcript of the meeting. That will take up all your time and attention and you won't process what's being said. If it's important that every details is kept for review, record it, or (as I've often seen happen) have someone in your team as a 'scribe' whose job is to just make notes or take minutes. If the details on the slide deck, don't write it down, ask for the slides after the meeting. If you can get details by a polite email after the meeting, make a note of that fact \"get figures off Dave\" and go back to listening and thinking. Secondly, speak. There are two useful things you can say, even if you are there very much in listening mode. 1) Summarise what someone else has said in your own words, and ask if your summary is correct. This will do wonders to help fix important messages and facts in your head - takeaways as you call them (new term to me!). It can also help the whole meeting retain focus and not ramble, which will help everyone including you. I think it's fine to do this openly: \"So, Lucy, is it a fair summary of the position to say that concerns over declining margins basically outweigh the good news with increasing revenue?\" - \"Well, I don't know about outweigh, but yes, I think we need to focus more on the margins right now than continued sales growth\" Writing down Lucy's reply is way more useful than scribbling down all the numbers from her slides on revenue in every region and margins on every product line, complete with interruptions. 2) Ask a question that probes deeper. Just speaking will fix things in your head as well as writing them down, and again, this can help get to the heart of the matter. \"Hang on, Lucy, I can see lots of good stuff on the revenue/margin issue, but what's the strategic line on this? Like, is there value placed on market share here?\" - \"OK, yes there is a bigger strategic question, but right now the message I'm getting is watch the profit in the next two quarters. I guess maybe there's some tension between Dan and Alice on the whole financials v brand and market stuff, but, I don't know if we can address that here\" It's up to you what the takehome message is - that profit is the focus, or that there's some strategic tension - but at least you aren't wading through figures and some regional sales head rambling on about how it's been a great quarter and his team are all troopers. Thirdly, write down concepts and join them up. Not everyone is a fan of mind-map style note taking but to me, what matters is the how the major elements interact. If someone talks about margins, just write 'margins' on the page. Then someone says that aggressive sales targets is leading to discounting, with the result that margins are shrinking. Write 'sales targets' and an arrow to 'margins'. Next to the arrow write 'pricing pressures?!?' That's all you need. If someone talks about competitors in that market affecting price, you can write 'competition' and another arrow going to 'pricing pressures'. You're starting to see themes. What words have the most arrows in and out of them? Is competition the issue or sales targets? You have some deeper questions to ask already. Remember, if you were meant to have all the detail and not ask questions, you'd be reading a 20 page report, not sitting in a meeting. Less writing, more talking, is probably the way forward for you. Finally, experience counts. You'll learn to sense when people are rambling and when they are saying something key. Use the rambling time to glance at your notes (or fill them out a bit) and maybe come up with a question you need to ask. When someone is saying something that may be key, stop writing, and listen hard. ",

            "answer_text": "To make it quick, the key takeaways of a working meeting should always lead to actions & decisions. This is one interesting point to keep in mind during a meeting: what decisions are taken in the meeting, or to be taken later? what actions have to be carried out? Trying this simple exercise may change your professional life\u2026 You can refine with risks and mitigation plan: what risks are expected and what plan to mitigate them? You can go deeper with some diagrams or sketchs like a mind map, a process, a workflow, etc. to describe an issue or a situation; And more deeper with the description of the requirements from your client or business owner, etc. with a mission statement, rule statements, etc. All that said, you have a lot of means to take notes during a meeting. It depends on your way of thinking: I like to write verbatims but some of my colleagues are just writing down key ideas. Some people like to record the meeting. etc. I even saw yesterday a women drawing a mindmap during a roundtable about ESG. A few KPI for you: writing the minutes of a meeting take roughly the same duration if you want to be exhautive. A One hour meeting means rougly one hour work to write the minutes and send it.
