            "answer_text": "Note: This is about a one-page memo, based on the experience of having completed an MPA program. Begin with your conclusion. A memo is not a mystery novel. If someone reads the first paragraph of your memo, they should should have the gist of the entire page. Recommendations should be action-oriented and specific. The rest of the page is for supporting arguments, which should be concise and to the point. Only include relevant information, and don't make your reader guess what your point is, or why you're mentioning a fact or figure. I like using bold paragraph headings for my supporting arguments. It helps to assume that a reader will spend either 3 seconds, 30 seconds, or 3 minutes with a memo and structure it accordingly. The 3-second reader will look for the recommendation, and maybe glance at paragraph headings. The 30 second reader skims the first paragraph and reads the headings of the rest of the memo. The 3 minute reader might look at the whole thing. It is safest to assume that no one will look at it more than once. ",

            "answer_text": "This article is a great resource that provides a few memo examples. However, as a short summary, the most typical format of interoffice memos is below: Heading: (usually \"MEMORANDUM\" or \"MEMO\" in all caps, centered, although this format is not required and can vary based on organizational style guides.) To: (Who or which department gets it) From: (Who or which department sent it) Date: (When it was sent) Subject: (Briefly, what it's about)  (A line generally separates the header from the content, as shown above.) In the introductory paragraph, tell your reader what the memo is about and how it pertains to them. Keep in mind that a memo isn\u2019t the place to write long messages; keep it short and sweet. In the body of the memo, give your reader details they might need pertaining to the topic of the memo. If these details are extensive, consider using the body to point them to another larger document (that might be attached or available online). Also, consider providing additional information concerning who they should contact if they have further questions. Close the memo with your name and role in the company or organization. ",
