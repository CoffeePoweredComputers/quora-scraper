            "answer_text": "\u201cCatch phrases\u201d are the same as cliches, so don't use them. There is no such thing as a \u201cgood\u201d catch phrase in quality writing. However\u2026 You may actually be asking about writing a good \u201chook\u201d for your essay, meaning you want to \u201ccatch\u201d the reader\u2019s attention. If so, there are a number of literary devices you can use for that first line. Take these examples I made up that could be used for an essay on the minimum wage: Ask a question that sets up the background and thesis statement in your first paragraph. (\u201cWill raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour really make a dent in ending the cycle of poverty?\u201d)Use a \u201cvisual\u201d sentence that describes a situation, much like the opening to a fiction story. \u201cEvery morning, 6 days a week, Jane Doe rises at 5 a.m. To prepare her family\u2019s day before taking the 6:15 crosstown bus to her minimum-wage job at the Acme Hotel.\u201d)Set up the unexpected, a sentence that leads the reader to believe something is the norm (or not the norm), with a thesis that will show the opposite. \u201cFew neighbors knew that John Doe, who worked a job at minimum wage for 30 years, was actually a millionaire.\u201dStart with a relevant quote: \u201cMy father worked at minimum wage for 30 years,\u201d said Mary Doe, \u201cbut he squirreled away everything he could to help me get to college, even skipping meals just to save that dollar or two, long before I was born.\u201dHere is a link to college admission essays that were successful.
