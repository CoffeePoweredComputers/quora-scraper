            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t. It is not developmentally appropriate to expect young children to remember social distancing rules especially in groups of 12\u201325 in a 25\u2032 by 25\u2032 room for 4 (if schools opt to do half days) to 8 hours a day with one adult in charge. What you can do is carefully monitor health. You can create frequent hand washing sessions. You can increase cleaning of areas they are in. If you think about it, \u201csocial distancing\u201d for all elementary students will be very difficult, too. Most classrooms are not big enough to keep even 12\u201313 students 6 feet apart. And then having a masked teacher try to make herself/himself heard and understood by a dozen or so students stuck in weird spots throughout a class will also be difficult. And if the teacher has to go near one student to demonstrate, up close, how to do a lesson. (And teachers do this every day, all the time), there is no way to expect the teacher to do a full de-contamination before moving on the next child. The best she will be able to do is slap some hand sanitizer on and move to the next student. ",

            "answer_text": "If you have been asked by your school to implement social distancing in kindergarten classes, they should be providing training for such a task. Sounds like smaller classes. New rules. Varying schedules. You need to address your concerns with your school principal, before a return to class. That is a lot to learn, and a lot to teach. Kindergarten students are able to do that, are you ready? ",
