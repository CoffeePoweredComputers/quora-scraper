            "answer_text": "There will always be two sides to this argument. Many published writers are opposed to the idea of fanfiction and are openly hostile towards it. A few examples that spring to my mind are:  George R. R. MartinUrsula K. LeGuinOrson Scott CardJ. D. SalingerAnne RiceThey have such an opinion because what they have created is precious to them and the idea of someone else tinkering with the product of their thoughts and imagination irks them. Then there are some who are not so strict about the idea of stories by fans. I can only think of two at the moment:  J. K. Rowling - She feels flattered by it, as long as it's non-commercial and remains PG rated.Stephenie Meyer - She's conflicted about it, but doesn't mind it all that much.By professional, I'm going to assume you mean someone who is serious about writing. Again, there is much conflict regarding this because there are some who are and some who aren't. Fanfiction is still perceived as something teenage girls write when they become obsessed with something. While that is not true, very few writers in this \"genre\" are well-rounded and gifted. Fanfiction is mostly bad because there is very little quality control and anyone can publish just about anything online. Another reason why fanfiction authors are not held in high esteem despite being very good writers is because there is very little original content in their work. Most published authors argue that if people can come up with good plots and are skilled, they can foray into fiction rather than piggyback on the popularity and hardwork of others. This is my opinion on the matter: As others before me have pointed out, anybody who writes is a writer. However, if you want to be called a 'professional' or 'actual' writer, writing original fiction is the best way to achieve that. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course! I write fanfiction all the time, as well as poetry and fiction. I consider myself to be an author, as well as anyone who writes a fanfiction. You're writing a story...you've made the plot, come up with the concept, and worked out the sequence of events. And if you made an OC, then you've done character development.In some ways, fanfiction authors must work a bit harder. We have to make  sure we portray canon characters correctly and don't go OOC. Sometimes we rewatch shows to see how they do a certain thing or go back to get the exact words he or she said. It can be quite tiring to do this. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course they're actual writers. Writers are people who write. Now, \"professional\" takes on a whole different meaning, because to say you are a professional implies that you are paid to do what you are doing. And while many fan fiction authors are indeed professional writers, many are not. So you have to separate the two in that regard, but the line is getting more blurred all the time as fan fiction goes on to be published and professional writers own up to writing fan fiction in their spare time. I actually considered myself more of a professional writer when I was writing the majority of my fan fiction (I was working as a journalist) than I do now when the largest percentage of my income comes from editing and other work.

            "answer_text": "It depends on the writer's skill level, as much as on what fandom they're writing in. I have seen published several different fan works. In fact, only recently, Chuck Wendig, a writer of renown in the Science Fiction/Fantasy world, sold and saw published his Star Wars fan fiction, now official Star Wars canon, published under the official Star Wars banner. It happens, if the writer is good enough, their story is good enough, and the original franchise they're writing in is comfortable and confident enough in its niche to allow outside work inside. ",
