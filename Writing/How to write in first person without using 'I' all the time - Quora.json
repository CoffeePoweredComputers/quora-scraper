Both also can be used sparingly. Just as in dialog attribution: \u201cIs that the plane?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d I told him. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThis is absurd!\u201d \u201cThere is no need,\u201d I said, \u201cto get angry.\u201d As in all dialog, action, motivations, placement, verbal ticks, and more than anything else the place in the conversation helps the reader keep track and allows you to use the attributions sparsely. The same goes for pronouns. First Person, like the typical Single-Viewpoint Third Person, is an immersive point of view. Everything is seen through and understood to be filtered through that experience. It isn\u2019t a mistake to occasionally put in a \u201cI looked\u201d or \u201cI saw\u201d but you should reserve them for when the character is making a specific effort; when they are in effect noticing they are noticing: Trees, trees everywhere. Tangled, verdant detail close-up, all leaves and twigs and suspicious shadows. Rank after rank as they crested the low hills, blending into a seamless horizon. There. A cloud of birds had suddenly burst from the canopy. I looked in that direction, saw a tall alder that stood just slightly above its brothers. If the sniper was here, that was his most likely nest. I jiggled the above to put a specific \u201cI looked\u201d in it. There were actually smoother ways of doing it, such as \u201cI focused my attention on a tall alder\u2026\u201d Even actions can be described without the pronoun. But I personally feel that this is somewhere where the immediacy and the efficiency of pronouns wins. After all, who wants to read a fight scene in which, \u201cblows were exchanged.\u201d I\u2019d rather read one in which the protagonist tells me, \u201cI hit him twice in the face and he fell back.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Just make sure your viewpoint character spends at least as much time observing what other characters are saying and doing as they do talking about themself. \u201cGood evening, Viewpoint Character,\u201d said the butler. \u201cMay I take your coat?\u201d \u201cNo thank you. It\u2019s a bit chilly in here.\u201d The butler looked offended. \u201cSorry. Circulatory issues.\u201d \u201cQuite understandable,\u201d said the butler. \u201cMy master\u2019s guests often have circulatory issues\u2014particularly after a few visits.\u201d He bit his lip. It looked like it had been bitten quite a few times before. And let the fact that it is the viewpoint character experiencing the scene be understood rather than stated. Avoid phrases like \u201cI noticed\u201d \u201cI thought\u201d or \u201cI heard.\u201d The rocking chair was rocking on its own, despite the absence of any breeze; a loose floorboard under the left rocker creaked rhythmically\u2014in a different rhythm than the rocking of the chair itself. Hmm. It was possible this room was incompetently haunted. And finally, don\u2019t go overboard. Sometimes it\u2019s important to know that an observation comes from, and is therefore colored by, your character\u2019s personal viewpoint. It wasn\u2019t the out-of-sync creaking that I objected to so much as the choice of a Regency era rocking chair for such an obviously Victorian-inspired haunting. Took me quite out of the moment. I\u2019ve always thought eclectic decor best for a haunted house for just this reason. I hope you found this useful, or at least amusing. ",
