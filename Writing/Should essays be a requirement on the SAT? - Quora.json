            "answer_text": "No, essays WERE a requirement on the SAT from 2005 \u2013 2016, when the total score was out of 2400. The mandatory SAT essay section was removed in March 2016 for very legitimate reasons. First of all, the task mimics something no decent university would ever want their students to be doing - writing a full length essay rushed, without adequate research, nor adequate time to revise/rewrite. Once in college, most essays are expected to be generated through a process of careful reflection, research/organization, writing a draft, rewriting, etc. Pretty much the SAT essay task mimics the work of a college student with a major procrastination problem! On college level exams, students will likely encounter free response questions, but in my personal undergraduate experience at a U.S. university currently ranked in the T20, I do not ever recall being ask to write a complete essay with a formal introduction and conclusion under timed circumstances similar to the SAT essay section. To top it off, the SAT essay section grading has been extremely problematic, and there are inadequate policies in place to have the score reviewed for inaccuracies: SAT Essay Test Rewards Length and Ignores Errors Here\u2019s a link to a 2013 article that sums up some major reasons the mandatory SAT essay section was removed, and in my personal opinion why the SAT essay section should remain optional: We Are Teaching High School Students to Write Terribly ",

            "answer_text": "I kinda wish they were \u2014 for several reasons. First, they can\u2019t be electronically scored, to my knowledge. While there is a formula for writing a good essay, I think content needs a human reader. Second, the organizational requirements show the student\u2019s ability to think, apply reason and organize these into a coherent document in a short time. College students should know how to do that. In fact, Rutgers had instituted a requirement that every undergraduate take and pass (C minimum) an expository writing class. Some took it seriously and yet quite a few still seemed surprised that other college instructors expected them to apply those skills in assignments for other classes (like why did you take it, huh?). A functioning adult in a \u201creal\u201d job should know how to express him/herself to colleagues, superiors and subordinates. Again, you\u2019re using these skills. They are commonly-accepted methods of conveying information that can be understood. It\u2019s not random. ",
