            "answer_text": "That happened to me once. I had a company come for an estimate to remove a tree and other debris after a hurricane. I thanked them for the estimate and said I would be in touch. The next day I returned home from work and there they were working away. I went over and asked what they were doing and I hadn't given them notice I was going to hire them. He shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know and the office just sent him and his crew to work on this job. He was polite and honestly had no idea of how the office received jobs from customers. He said they were actually finished and were cleaning up and would be out of my yard quickly. I called the office and spoke to the owner, who was the one who gave me the estimate, and asked why he started before I gave him notice I would hire them. He said that since he knew he gave the best price I would get (he didn't even come close to the best I got) he just went ahead and did it because he was too busy to wait for my call back and I could mail him a check for his services and hung up. The next day I came home and saw the same crew at my neighbor's. I went over and knocked and when Reggie came to the door I told him of my experience. He said he just got home and had just told them to stop work and leave because he didn't hire them and only got an estimate. We both went to his back yard and asked the foreman if he knew his boss was sending him to jobs they were not hired for. He honestly didn't know that was what was going on. He was red with embarrassment and damn near in tears as he apologized profusely. Going back through Reggie's house I went home and back into my back yard. Their truck was parked behind my fence and I was about to start measuring my fence line to replace my fence when I heard him on the phone talking with his boss, (he could not see me because I was behind a hedgerow) asking him just how many people he was attempting to force to hire him by just showing up and starting a job without permission. He then said he couldn't work for a crook and said that he quit and since he brought that crew with him when he started there they would leave with him too. His whole crew (four guys) stood by his truck when he said it and all agreed with him. He said \u201csorry guys but we can't be a part of this kind of outfit. I'll go to the bank and pay you for today with what ever I have available.\u201d They still had quite a bit to pack up and load the Bobcat so I went back and explained to Reggie what I heard. He came up with a great idea and we trotted out back to talk to the foreman. We didn't let on that I heard his conversation but simply said that we understood they may have some free time on their hands and would be available for some side work. He looked a bit confused but nodded in agreement. We said great, you guys want to build our fence? They built mine and Reggie's and after word spread they built several others and had clean up jobs all over the neighborhood, enough to last them for over the next two months. As for his boss, I got on the computer and made a lovely certificate thanking him for volunteering his time and money to clean the debris from my yard. Never heard a peep from the owner, but I see John (the foreman) from time to time and he'll buy me a cold one. Seems word spread beyond the neighborhood and customers from his old job and new ones too, needed so much work he had to hire another crew and was going to have to hire an office manager after he found an office. I think it worked out well for everyone. ",

            "answer_text": "I'd start by calling them and asking who authorized the work. In many places the local government has regulations about how you must maintain your property, and if you don't, they will send someone to perform this maintenance and bill you. For example, I used to own a rental property far from my home. When there was no tenant, I had to arrange to get the lawn mowed and that sort of thing. On two occasions the city decided that I had let the lawn grow too high, sent someone to mow it for me, and billed me -- with \"administrative fees\" and fines added on top of the lawn mowing. My point being: if your property was not up to the standards required by regulations, the local government may have authorized a contractor to bring it up to code and bill you. I'd check on that possibility first. If that was the case, then in the future be more careful to meet the legal requirements. Or if you think they're unreasonable, find another place to live.Failing that, if this work really was unauthorized, there are basically two possibilities: a mistake or a scam. Perhaps the landscaper was hired to work on a house with a similar address and made a mistake. Or, have you had other dealings with this landscaper? Maybe there was a misunderstanding, like you thought you were contracting for a one-time job and they thought you were contracting for ongoing maintenance. Etc.Or it may just be a scam. They do some job, send you a bill, and hope you'll pay it. If you don't, they threaten lawsuits and hope to intimidate you.So I'd call them up and, as I say, first question, Who authorized this work? If they say that the government did, investigate if that's true. If they say that you or your spouse or some other authorized representative did and you know that isn't true, tell them that there has been a mistake, you never authorized this. If it was an honest mistake, like they went to the wrong address, they should back down and apologize. If they insist that you should pay, demand to see the contract. As presumably there is none, tell them you are not going to pay. If they press it and start threatening lawsuits or some other threat, you probably should get a lawyer and bring a countersuit. If the amount is small you may resolve it in small claims court without a lawyer. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a classic 1L Contracts question. I am a lawyer, but not your lawyer. Seek the advice of an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction. Treating this as a law exam question for the exercise\u2026 I. Owner\u2019s rights to damages for restoration and for trespass: First, most assume the landscaping was an improvement to the property. If it wasn\u2019t, then the owner is entitled to damages to restore him or her to the status quo ante (as it was before the landscaping). For example, if the landscaper installed a beautiful stone wall and trees in a play area in back of the home where the owner\u2019s children play football, the owner would have right to damages for the cost to return it to its prior state, at the expense of the errant landscaper. Separate trespass damages could be sought, but are typically nominal to reflect the fact that trespass alone doesn\u2019t impair the property. II. Owner\u2019s liability for benefits conferred Whether a property owner whose property was erroneously landscaped without consent owes money to the Landscaper turns on whether the owner knew the work was being done and said nothing to prevent the error. The innocent recipient of a benefit that is not returnable cannot be accused of unjustly retaining it. That means the owner doesn\u2019t have to pay if they didn\u2019t know the work was happening in time to stop it, and then the mistake comes out after the fact. The law will not enforce moral obligations. On the other hand, if the owner knew the work was being done and remained silent, then letting them retain the benefit without paying for it would be unjust, and if all the facts come out in court, the owner will have to pay fair value for the benefit conferred. Courts see it like this: If a person confers a benefit on another expecting to be paid for it and it would be unjust to allow the recipient to retain that benefit without paying for it, then courts apply the equitable doctrine of quantum meruit to require the recipient pay the value of the benefit conferred. That value may not be the amount a landscaper charged on their bill, but is the fair value of the benefit conferred. The lesson is - if you see someone conferring a possible benefit on you that they expect to be paid for, you better say something if you don\u2019t want to be on the hook. ",

At the end of the day, even if you rent, the landlord can not enter the property without informing you with prior notice.and notifications depending on local laws can be anything from 7 days to a month or more. So ask this1) Did i ask for the work to be done?2) Was i informed that his work was required by written notification?3) Did i authorize the work even though i did not ask for it to be done?4) Did the Landscaper give you any option or explanation about the work?5) Is your signature on any document that could be considered a contract for this work accepting financial liability for it? so if the answers to these questions is no, thank the landscaper for his work and bid him good day - Make sure to take some pictures of the work he has done. The Landscaper will then have to go to the person that contracted the work to get paid. If they don\u2019t pay, he will be required to take them to court for compensation. not you, he does not have your signature on his work order/contract. At some point you may end up in court with a demand to pay, so it may pay to get some proper legal advice, but for right now, Don\u2019t admit to anything, and don\u2019t payIf your landlord chose to do this, then it is on them, not you. It may also pay to approach the tenants association or its equivalent where you are, they are there to aid tenants, (not owners or landlords) through difficult circumstance. they may be able to advise you as well, and they will know better what questions to ask you.

            "answer_text": "Unless there's more to this story (as it often tends to be with Q questions), the legal opinions are overly complex. And of course, a lot also depends on how much we are talking about. Was it just mowing and trim, or a large landscaping job? Otherwise it should go something like this. You contact the landscaper and have a conversation similar to this: Homeonwer: \u201cHello Mr. Landscaper, who contracted you to do work on my property?\u201d Landscaper: \u201cYou did Mr Homeowner\u201d Mr Homeowner: \u201cI've never met you before\u201d Mr Landscaper: \u201cMaybe it was your wife or someone representing you\u201d Mr Homeowner: \u201cNobody makes these decisions on my behalf\u201d Mr Landscaper: \u201cWell, someone has to pay for the work done\u201d Mr Homeowner: \u201cShow me who that person is, because its not anyone I know. You must have the wrong address. Do you have an agreement signed by me?\u201d Mr Landscaper: \u201cNo I don't, I don't need one\u201d Mr Homeowner: \u201cWell, yes you do need a written or verbal agreement. And since we've never met before, you don't have either. Have a nice day\u201d or \u201cYou owe me $n for damages to my property\u201d Mr Landscaper: \u201cGood bye\u201d or \u201cWhat do you mean I owe you for damages?\u201d Mr Homowner: \u201cYou trespassed and did things to my property without my consent, l'll call the police to file a complaint\u201d Mr Landscaper: \u201cGoodbye\u201d In the end the landscaper does not have a position on this if you did not request the work to be done - verbally or written. It's that simple without any lawyers. Now - If there's something missing, then that changes everything. Is there more to this scenario\u2026? ",

            "answer_text": "Not a landscaper, but I\u2019ve been an irrigation contractor for many many years. I\u2019ve often done work on other people\u2019s property without permission. If I\u2019ve seen a problem, I first try to contact the land or property owner. Water, especially gushing water the wrong way can cause a lot of expensive problems. If I can\u2019t get a hold of them, then I have fixed the problem on my own. I will always leave a note and a business card letting them know what I saw, what happened, and what I fixed. I also take pictures. Lots of pictures. I\u2019ve never charged for materials, or labor with my repairs. If it\u2019s going to be expensive in parts, I\u2019ll just shut off the water but still leave a note telling them what happened, what I saw, and what I did. Over 90% of the times I\u2019ve been reimbursed for the materials. Most times I gain a new client from it. A lot of times I find that it was a do-it-yourself homeowner that didn\u2019t have repair knowledge, or a commercial lot that wasn\u2019t getting serviced properly resulting in material or equipment failure. I would never charge anyone or try to force anyone to pay for services that weren\u2019t previously agreed upon. That is unethical. If you don\u2019t have a contract, work order, agreement, or purchase order in place, you wouldn\u2019t be getting any money from me, nor would I expect any. ",

            "answer_text": "A landscaper did work on my property without my consent, and is now billing me. What do I do? Today in Law 101, we will be discussing verbal contracts. A verbal contract can have the same force of law as a written one, and you can sue over breach of contract with a verbal agreement just as you can with a written agreement. The problem with verbal agreements is one of details. The court has to be able to extract the key details of the contract, which may be difficult when the two parties do not agree on what those key details were. They may not even agree that a verbal agreement existed at all. The person wanting the agreement enforced now finds himself in the unenviable position of not only proving that a verbal agreement existed, but that it contained exactly the key details he is claiming. This is why landscapers work on written orders. They provide written estimates, which do not become finalized until signed and returned. Then work can begin. It\u2019s more time consuming to do it this way, but it leads to happier customers, and no misunderstandings about what work was requested and what work was performed. The court will also look at whether or not you knew the work was ongoing. It\u2019s a lot easier to claim that you didn\u2019t want the work to be done if you didn\u2019t know the work was ongoing. If you knew the work was ongoing and you did nothing to stop it (for example, if one of the employees spoke to you or someone in your house), you again will have a difficult time convincing the court that you did not authorize the work to be completed.

            "answer_text": "The other answers offer a lot of valuable information but I feel there is a large section of this scenario that\u2019s being ignored. Let\u2019s assume you refuse to pay, the landscaper is licensed, and the situation escalates to court. One major point that would be hit on is whether or not you could\u2019ve intervened. I learned about a case I\u2019m my business law class where a contractor arrived at this persons house and proceeded to pour them a new driveway. There was no permission given, no pre-payment, nothing. The homeowner had noticed them pouring the driveway and just went, \u201cmeh, I didn\u2019t order that, I\u2019m not paying for that\u201d and went about their day. Like you could probably expect, the case escalated and went to court. The judge sided in favor of the contractor stating that the homeowner would pay for the driveway at cost. The reasoning? The homeowner saw them pouring and made no attempt to stop them or clarify their purpose for being there. The homeowner \u201cbenefited\u201d from the driveway regardless of whether or not they originally wanted it. This along with their refusal to intervene cost them thousands. If this is the case for you, save yourself the court and attorney\u2019s fees and pay the contractor. If not and they did the work while you were away or outside of a verbal or written contract, stand your ground the fault is with them. Hope this helps, -G ",

            "answer_text": "Something similar happened to a former neighbor. We\u2019d recently had a terrible hail storm that caused billions of property damage to our city and one of our neighbors needed a new roof. He found a company and signed a contract with them. Another neighbor miraculously did not have damage warranting a new roof although they were in the same addition, same address in fact except different streets. Husband of the non damaged home leaves for the day leaving his wife with severe anxiety issues home alone. Shortly after he left, she calls him and says she hears a lot of noise on the roof and is scared. He rushes home to find the majority of his roof shingles on the ground and asked what they thought they were doing. Well none of them spoke English so they had to wait for the foreman to show up. He shows the neighbor the contract at which point the neighbor says, \u201cThis is ABC Street, your contract is for XYZ Street.\u201d They\u2019ve now damaged this man\u2019s property without his consent so when the owner of the roofing company calls up and asks him to pay several thousand dollars for the new roof, the neighbor of course says no. The owner then says, \u201cWill you at least pay for the materials?\u201d My neighbor said, \u201cNo and you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t sue you.\u201d That was the last he heard of it. ",

I disregarded this because it was literally an emergency situation and looked way better than 3 week high grass. He even said the next time would be better as he\u2019d have more time. About one week later, I requested that he cut my grass and then schedule a consultation meeting with me to discuss my ongoing vision with my yard. He cut my yard as I requested and it looked the same as the first cut. It wasn\u2019t the neatest cut but it got the job done. I never heard back from him regarding a consult meeting. Another two weeks later I got a bill for a cut that supposedly happened that same day. I went home (as I was at work when I got the email) and saw that the work had been done. I reached out and explained that I never requested this additional cut as he never set up a consultation meeting. He said \u201cOh! I thought you requested ongoing.\u201d I had to screenshot our text conversation and send it to him. He apologized and cancelled the invoice. Needless to say, his attention to detail wasn\u2019t his strong suit. ",

            "answer_text": "A landscaper did work on my property without my consent, and is now billing me. What do I do? US Answer: If your property is a single-family home, then simply request a copy of the signed work order/contract showing what was to be done and how much it would cost. A licensed contractor would have that. If he\u2019s not licensed, he shouldn\u2019t have been doing any work on anyone\u2019s property. If your property is in a \u201ccommon interest community\u201d (meaning you have an HOA), then you need to check your HOA communications to see if the Board authorized the work and the individual homeowners would be paying for it. That\u2019s entirely possible, although unusual - usually the HOA would just pay for the work out of the fees you pay each month. One other option - were you notified by your city/county that your landscaping violated some ordinance? You\u2019d have been given an opportunity (probably several) to correct the problem, then the city/county would have had it done at your expense. Check your mail for any such notices. ",

            "answer_text": "You generally can\u2019t be billed for work you never agreed to nor can silence act as consent in most cases. Call them and ask for copies of the work orders you signed. Of course they either won\u2019t have any or it will be for a different address. At this point, you tell them that you\u2019re not paying and if they insist, suggest that all further correspondence over this bill you don\u2019t owe be with your attorney. If it was the wrong address and they admit that, they might try to shame you into paying anyway since you benefited. No, sorry \u2026 you guys did a great job and I\u2019ll be happy to tell everyone that, but I never ordered it and I\u2019m not paying. Where it gets sticky is if they claim it was a verbal order over the phone. You orally approved the price they gave you and so they (with no paperwork) showed up and did the job. You may need to go to court if they want to stick with this, since a verbal contract can be binding. A good attorney ought to be able to poke some holes in their story and cast enough doubt that the court rules in your favor. ",

            "answer_text": "Something similar happened to me about 10 years ago in Vermont. I came home from work and there is a gigantic pile of firewood sitting in my driveway and two scruffy looking guys standing next to their truck. They said, \u201cHere is the firewood you ordered.\u201d I replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t order any firewood. I order mine from Rick up the street.\u201d \u201cOh, you didn\u2019t? Is this XXX address? You\u2019re Andrew Toler? It will be $350.\u201d \u201cI get it. I know what you guys are doing. I didn\u2019t order firewood but you are trying to make money. I understand. And I WOULD bite and buy this firewood from you, except for one problem. This is 18 inch firewood. It will not even fit in my stove. I can take 14\u201d firewood, maximum. I cannot even burn this stuff. It won\u2019t fit and I\u2019m not cutting it down to size. You are going to have to load it back up and take it away. Sorry guys.\u201d They spent the better part of the next hour tossing wood back into their panel truck. I brought them out glasses of water and chatted a little more before they left. Never saw those guys again. I felt bad. Some people really do have it tough in the country. ",

            "answer_text": "If you don\u2019t pay the bill, then the contractor has the right to place a lien on your property, which will make it almost impossible for you to sell it until you pay the contractor. The contractor can also go to court and get a judgement against you to have your wages or bank accounts garnished, as well. However, if it was the city/county that is sending you a bill for being out of compliance; not only can they do the same thing as a contractor, but they can also have your property condemned and sold to the highest bidder. The best thing to do is to figure out who sent the bill either the contractor themselves or a government entity. Then work out a way to pay for it, so you don\u2019t lose your home. Also, if you have a mortgage on your home and your property has a lien put against it, in some jurisdictions your mortgage company can bring foreclosure proceedings against you. If you aren\u2019t able to figure out on your own who sent the bill or you aren\u2019t able to see a copy of the contract, then you\u2019ll have to get an attorney involved that specializes in this area of law to help you.

There was a small stream at the bottom of his garden which some landowners on the other side assumed was the property line but this was not correct the boundary was in fact some 20 feet beyond. He was in the RAF and his house rented, on returning he found that the land right up to the stram had been landscaped. He was advised the if he did nothing by ancient law after time the property would be accepted as being part of the other property. Property disputes can be very complicated and expensive. So he sued the landscape company for damage to his property and to restore it to its original state. In order to defend themselves the Landscape company had to prove and pay for the boundary survey, they then appealed the cost of restoration. In court his representative reluctantly agreed, providing the boundary was certified and their cost were paid. All Happy and as he said he now had a firm declaration to his,and others, boundary and a beautiful extension to his garden at no cost. ",

I told him I didn\u2019t want it. Two minutes later his boss shows up and demands I pay for their services. I said show me your contract. He said he was studying law and was in the right. I said, good for you, see you in court. I have lots of paid time off, so go for it. Never heard from him. Don\u2019t let people intimidate you.

Legally, you don't need to do anything. You're off the hook. Though common courtesy suggests that you at least thank him. That said, if the work he did was satisfactory, and you really, really like it, then I would be inclined to pay him something toward it. Presumably, it was an error on his part - wrong address or whatever. He likely didn't set out to rip you off. If you like it, there's nothing wrong with paying something to offset his cost, since you did benefit from his mistake. We're all riding in the same bus. Let's make it as pleasant as possible. ",

An American Express card that I\u2019d canceled years earlier was suddenly re-activated, and I received a past-due collection notice for an airplane ticket - to somewhere I\u2019ve never been, under a name that wasn\u2019t mine. Plus late charges. Plus a few years of annual AMEX fees. On top of that, there was no friendly call asking if I\u2019d \u201creactivated\u201d the card, it went directly to a rather rabid collection agent. After telling them several times that they had made a mistake, and that they cannot bill a card that I\u2019ve canceled. I simply demanded that they show me my signature on a purchase transaction. I never heard from them again. This was some years ago. Today, particularly with a local business who is playing dirty unethical games, I would definitely take a few minutes to leave a legit review on what they\u2019re doing so that others know who they\u2019re doing business with.

They come in for a service and as part of our service procedure we basically do the annual test on the car without emissions and brake rollers. We check every testable item on that vehicle. If we find a fault and fit a part without the verbal consent at least from the customer they are well within their rights to refuse payment. It was not agreed and therefore we cannot enforce the payment be given. We can get occasional the customer that says if it needs anything else just do it within a price range or to only fix the serious defects but it all has to be recorded somewhere with a date and time. I'm assuming the same procedures would apply in any trade ",

I presume you live at your property and that you would be aware is work is being performed on it. Did you know that the landscaper was doing work? Did you attempt to stop him? Are you benefiting or enjoying the work he has done? Could you have reasonably expected, given the kind of work being done, that the contractor would expect payment for the work? I am not a lawyer, but I think the doctrine of quantum meruit would apply. In other words, if the above questions are affirmative, a court would hold that the contractor is entitled to reasonable payment, being what others would charge for similar work, for the services he provided.",
