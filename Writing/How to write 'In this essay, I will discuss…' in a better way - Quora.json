Whether you state your thesis or not, you should have a thesis statement, which would tell the reader your opinion of the topic. Look up essay writing or thesis statements on the internet. UNC has a writing clinic with a lot of well-written information on various aspects of writing. A thesis statement is a statement about the topic you want to write about. Many writers suggest a 3-part introduction consisting of some preliminary sentencesa thesis statementan description of the topics you are going to discuss.If you use this format, you will never say \u201cIn this essay, I discuss. . . .\u201d For example\u2014 Pearl Harbor was a was a great victory for the Japanese and a total disaster for the United States. (Preliminary) However, it was a tactical victory but a strategic failure and a disaster for the Japanese. (Thesis) Three aspects of the attack doomed the Japanese: (1) The attack angered the American population as nothing else could. (2) The aircraft carriers were not in Pearl Harbor when the attack took place. (3) Fuel and repair facilities were untouched. (Topics in the organization) ",

            "answer_text": "While writing any type of essay, you will have to address the contents discussed in the essay. This is usually done in the introduction of the essay, where the author explains the topics that are covered in the essay and their significance. Apart from this, you may also find the need to address the contents of your essay in the body section and the conclusion of the essay. Although the need to address the essay contents in the body section is somewhat unusual, however in the conclusion, the author brings together all the points discussed in the essay and initiates the sentence as \u201cThis essay has discussed\u2026\u201d In either of the cases, it is important that you get the right essay writing help, either form your colleagues or on the internet to understand the various different ways in which you can frame the \u201cIn this essay we will discuss...\u201d sentence. It mainly comes down to your proficiency as a writer, using which you can come up with different ways to frame the sentence such as, \u201cOne of the main topic of this essay is\u2026\u201d or \u201cThe following paragraphs of this essay will discuss\u2026\u201d etc. There are a lot of different possibilities and sentence structures which you can play with. As an additional tip, you can try reading the introduction section of different essay and get a better idea of how different authors frame this sentence as per the nature of their particular essays.

Honestly, I think \u201cIn this essay, I shall discuss\u201d is fine, as long as you keep the personal pronouns to a minimum otherwise. This is true especially if you\u2019re detailing HOW you\u2019re planning to answer the question (using a particular theory or methodology) as well as WHAT you\u2019re answering it with. Maybe look at what the prevailing wisdom about your topic is - do academics say X, but you think the right answer is X AND something, BUT something or DESPITE something? Make that clear. Maybe mention which author you most agree with, and summarise why. And what does it mean, if your answer is right? How should we change the way we study the topic, or evaluate an idea? This can also finish a strong introduction. ",

Protip:\u2014 In any kind of extended writing (such as essays), avoid using words like I and you (and probably also we, but not he, she, it, they, etc). Get straight into the game. Avoid telling the reader you will do something. Tell the reader this thing will show XYZ is this, that or the other. ",
