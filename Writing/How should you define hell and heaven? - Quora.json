            "answer_text": "The Watchtower, November 1, 2008 How Does Learning the Truth About Hell Affect You? THOSE who teach that hell is a place of torment promote a gross misrepresentation of Jehovah God and his qualities. Granted, the Bible does say that God will destroy the wicked. (2 Thessalonians 1:6-9) But righteous anger is not God\u2019s dominant quality. God is not malicious or vindictive. He even asks: \u201cHave I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die?\u201d (Ezekiel 18:23, King James Version) If God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked, how could he for all eternity delight in watching these ones being tormented? God\u2019s preeminent quality is love. (1 John 4:8) Indeed, \u201cthe LORD is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made.\u201d (Psalm 145:9, The Holy Bible\u200b\u2014New International Version) In return, God wants us to develop heartfelt love for him.\u200b\u2014Matthew 22:35-38. Fear of Hell or Love of God\u200b\u2014Which Motivates You? The teaching that souls suffer in hell promotes a morbid fear of God. By contrast, a person who learns the truth about God and comes to love him will develop a healthy fear of him. \u201cThe fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; prudent are all who live by it,\u201d explains Psalm 111:10. (The New American Bible) This fear of God is, not abject terror, but awe of and profound reverence for the Creator. It engenders in us a healthy fear of displeasing him. Consider how learning the truth about hell affected Kathleen, a 32-year-old former drug user. Her life had been filled with parties, violence, self-hate, and immorality. She admitted: \u201cI would look at my one-year-old daughter and think, \u2018Look at what I\u2019m doing to her. I will burn in hell for this.\u2019\u201d Kathleen tried to stop using drugs, but nothing worked. \u201cI wanted to be good,\u201d she said, \u201cbut everything in my life and in the world was so pathetic. There seemed no reason to be good.\u201d Kathleen then met Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. \u201cI learned that there is no burning hell. The Scriptural evidence made perfect sense,\u201d said Kathleen. \u201cKnowing that I would not have to burn in hell was a tremendous relief.\u201d But she also learned of God\u2019s promise that humans could live forever on an earth cleansed of wickedness. (Psalm 37:10, 11, 29; Luke 23:43) \u201cI now had a real hope\u200b\u2014to live forever in Paradise!\u201d she exclaimed. Would Kathleen be able to stop abusing drugs without the threat of a fiery hell hanging over her? She related: \u201cWhen I had a strong craving for drugs, I would pray, begging Jehovah God for help. I thought of his view of such defiling habits, and I did not want to disappoint him. He answered my prayers.\u201d (2 Corinthians 7:1) This fear of displeasing God enabled Kathleen to break free from her addictions. Yes, cultivating love for God and a healthy fear of him\u200b\u2014not fear of torment in hell\u2014\u200bcan motivate us to do God\u2019s will in order to enjoy lasting happiness. The psalmist wrote: \u201cBlessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in his ways.\u201d\u200b\u2014Psalm 128:1, American Standard Version. WHO WILL BE RELEASED FROM HELL? Some Bible translations create confusion by rendering two different Greek words\u200b\u2014Ge\u02b9en\u00b7na and Hai\u02b9des\u2014\u200bas just the one word, \u201chell.\u201d In the Bible, the term Ge\u02b9en\u00b7na refers to total destruction, without hope of a resurrection. By contrast, those in Hai\u02b9des, or Hades, do have the hope of being resurrected. Thus, after Jesus died and was raised up, the apostle Peter assured his audience that Jesus \u201cwas not left in hell.\u201d (Acts 2:27, 31, 32; Psalm 16:10; King James Version) The word translated \u201chell\u201d in this verse is the Greek word Hai\u02b9des. Jesus did not go to some fiery place. Hades, or \u201chell,\u201d was the grave. But Jesus is not the only one whom God releases from Hades. In connection with the resurrection, the Bible says: \u201cDeath and hell delivered up the dead which were in them.\u201d (Revelation 20:13, 14, KJ) Emptying \u201chell\u201d will mean restoring to life all those whom God judges worthy of a resurrection. (John 5:28, 29; Acts 24:15) What a marvelous hope for the future\u200b\u2014seeing our dead loved ones brought back from the grave! Jehovah, the God of infinite love, will do this. The Watchtower, July 15, 2002 What Really Is Hell? WHATEVER image the word \u201chell\u201d brings to your mind, hell is generally thought of as a place of punishment for sin. Concerning sin and its effect, the Bible says: \u201cThrough one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.\u201d (Romans 5:12) The Scriptures also state: \u201cThe wages sin pays is death.\u201d (Romans 6:23) Since the punishment for sin is death, the fundamental question in determining the true nature of hell is: What happens to us when we die? Does life of some kind, in some form, continue after death? What is hell, and what kind of people go there? Is there any hope for those in hell? The Bible gives truthful and satisfying answers to these questions. Life After Death? Does something inside us, like a soul or a spirit, survive the death of the body? Consider how the first man, Adam, came to have life. The Bible states: \u201cJehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life.\u201d (Genesis 2:7) Though breathing sustained his life, putting \u201cthe breath of life\u201d into his nostrils involved much more than simply blowing air into his lungs. It meant that God put into Adam\u2019s lifeless body the spark of life\u200b\u2014\u201cthe force of life,\u201d which is active in all earthly creatures. (Genesis 6:17; 7:22) The Bible refers to this animating force as \u201cspirit.\u201d (James 2:26) That spirit can be compared to the electric current that activates a machine or an appliance and enables it to perform its function. Just as the current never takes on the features of the equipment it activates, the life-force does not take on any of the characteristics of the creatures it animates. It has no personality and no thinking ability. What happens to the spirit when a person dies? Psalm 146:4 says: \u201cHis spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.\u201d When a person dies, his impersonal spirit does not go on existing in another realm as a spirit creature. It \u201creturns to the true God who gave it.\u201d (Ecclesiastes 12:7) This means that any hope of future life for that person now rests entirely with God. The ancient Greek philosophers Socrates and Plato held that a soul inside a person survives death and never dies. What does the Bible teach about the soul? Adam \u201ccame to be a living soul,\u201d says Genesis 2:7. He did not receive a soul; he was a soul\u200b\u2014a whole person. The Scriptures speak of a soul\u2019s doing work, craving food, being kidnapped, experiencing sleeplessness, and so forth. (Leviticus 23:30; Deuteronomy 12:20; 24:7; Psalm 119:28) Yes, man himself is a soul. When a person dies, that soul dies.\u200b\u2014Ezekiel 18:4. What, then, is the condition of the dead? When pronouncing sentence upon Adam, Jehovah stated: \u201cDust you are and to dust you will return.\u201d (Genesis 3:19) Where was Adam before God formed him from the dust of the ground and gave him life? Why, he simply did not exist! When he died, Adam returned to that state of complete absence of life. The condition of the dead is made clear at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, where we read: \u201cThe dead know nothing . . . In the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.\u201d (New International Version) Scripturally, death is a state of nonexistence. The dead have no awareness, no feelings, no thoughts. Unending Torment or Common Grave? Since the dead have no conscious existence, hell cannot be a fiery place of torment where the wicked suffer after death. What, then, is hell? Examining what happened to Jesus after he died helps to answer that question. The Bible writer Luke recounts: \u201cNeither was [Jesus] forsaken in Hades [hell, King James Version] nor did his flesh see corruption.\u201da (Acts 2:31) Where was the hell to which even Jesus went? The apostle Paul wrote: \u201cI handed on to you . . . that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, yes, that he has been raised up the third day according to the Scriptures.\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:3, 4) So Jesus was in hell, the grave, but he was not abandoned there, for he was raised up, or resurrected. Consider also the case of the righteous man Job, who suffered much. Wishing to escape his plight, he pleaded: \u201cWho will grant me this, that thou mayest protect me in hell [Sheol], and hide me till thy wrath pass?\u201db (Job 14:13, Douay Version) How unreasonable to think that Job desired to go to a fiery-hot place for protection! To Job, \u201chell\u201d was simply the grave, where his suffering would end. The Bible hell, then, is the common grave of mankind where good people as well as bad ones go. Hellfire\u200b\u2014All-Consuming? Could it be that the fire of hell is symbolic of all-consuming, or thorough, destruction? Separating fire from Hades, or hell, the Scriptures say: \u201cDeath and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire.\u201d \u201cThe lake\u201d mentioned here is symbolic, since death and hell (Hades) that are thrown into it cannot literally be burned. \u201cThis [lake of fire] means the second death\u201d\u200b\u2014death from which there is no hope of coming back to life.\u200b\u2014Revelation 20:14. The lake of fire has a meaning similar to that of \u201cthe fiery Gehenna [hell fire, King James Version]\u201d that Jesus spoke of. (Matthew 5:22; Mark 9:47, 48) Gehenna occurs 12 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and it refers to the valley of Hinnom, outside the walls of Jerusalem. When Jesus was on earth, this valley was used as a garbage dump, \u201cwhere the dead bodies of criminals, and the carcasses of animals, and every other kind of filth was cast.\u201d (Smith\u2019s Dictionary of the Bible) The fires were kept burning by adding sulfur to burn up the refuse. Jesus used that valley as a proper symbol of everlasting destruction. As does Gehenna, the lake of fire symbolizes eternal destruction. Death and Hades are \u201churled into\u201d it in that they will be done away with when mankind is freed from sin and the condemnation of death. Willful, unrepentant sinners will also have their \u201cportion\u201d in that lake. (Revelation 21:8) They too will be annihilated forever. On the other hand, those in God\u2019s memory who are in hell\u200b\u2014the common grave of mankind\u2014\u200bhave a marvelous future. Hell Emptied! Revelation 20:13 states: \u201cThe sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead in them.\u201d Yes, the Bible hell will be emptied. As Jesus promised, \u201cthe hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear [Jesus\u2019] voice and come out.\u201d (John 5:28, 29) Although no longer presently existing in any form, millions of dead ones who are in Jehovah God\u2019s memory will be resurrected, or brought back to life, in a restored earthly paradise.\u200b\u2014Luke 23:43; Acts 24:15. In the new world of God\u2019s making, resurrected humans who comply with his righteous laws will never need to die again. (Isaiah 25:8) Jehovah \u201cwill wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.\u201d In fact, \u201cthe former things [will] have passed away.\u201d (Revelation 21:4) What a blessing is in store for those in hell\u200b\u2014\u201cthe memorial tombs\u201d! This blessing indeed is reason enough for us to take in more knowledge of Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ.\u200b\u2014John 17:3. [Footnotes] In the King James Version, the Greek word Hades is rendered \u201chell\u201d in each of its ten occurrences in the Christian Greek Scriptures. The rendering at Luke 16:19-31 mentions torment, but the entire account is symbolic in meaning. See chapter 88 of The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, published by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. The Hebrew word Sheol occurs 65 times in the Hebrew Scriptures and is rendered \u201chell,\u201d \u201cgrave,\u201d and \u201cpit\u201d in the King James Version. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: What do you think is in heaven and in hell? Nothing, nothing at all. How can there be; they\u2019re both imaginary places. The concepts of a heaven and a hell both derive from ancient, pre-scientific knowledge beliefs, not facts, and in essence they\u2019re nothing more than a classic marketing ploy which has been used since time immemorial to \u2018sell\u2019 something. Basically early religions used people\u2019s then innate fear of their believed-in gods as a means of getting them to obey the laws of the time. They did this by promising the people two things. Firstly, that their god(s) would look after them during life, and secondly, that after they died here on Earth, part of them would continue living for ever in a wonderful place called heaven, where they could even meet up with their already dead loved ones. The catch? They had to follow and support the religion which made them these promises of course! Later, a threat was added to these promises, to cope with those who failed or refused to comply with the laid down rules and dogma of the religion. That threat was that if they continued to do so, after they died here on Earth, part of them would continue living for ever in a horrendous place called hell, where they would be in eternal torment. You have to remember that the people of several thousand years ago were, in comparison to us today, naive, ignorant, highly superstitious, and completely unaware of the laws of science which dictate life, death and the very existence of everything. They had no idea that such places as a heaven and a hell were entirely conjectural - imaginary - and could not possibly exist in reality, and they would have believed in them implicitly, having been told so by perceived authority, their religious leaders. Even today, organised religions use these same reward and threat tactics to \u2018sell\u2019 their particular belief system to people, mainly by indoctrinating the concepts, along with many fairytale sounding stories, into children who are too young to be able to discriminate between fact and fiction. Most of these children grow up in already religious societies, thus reinforcing the belief in places like a heaven and a hell, and in turn passing them on to their children\u2026 But the bottom line is that neither a heaven or a hell exist in reality - could exist in reality without violating many of the laws of science - and therefore can\u2019t contain anything; other than the empty promises of organised religions of course. Thanks for the A2A. ",
