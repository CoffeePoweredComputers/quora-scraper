An example would be: \u201cThe Inns of Court - and there are four of them - are the professional associations for barristers in England. Every barrister in England must belong to one of the Inns and they have been around since the late 1300s. If you are ever in London with a little bit of time to spare, head over to Chancery Lane or walk up from Victoria Embankment. Enter the Inns of Court and you\u2019ll find yourself in what feels like a city within a city, a pefect little world, tucked just out of sight.\u201d (From \u201cEssentially England News\u201d). The precis: In England, every barrister must belong to one of London\u2019s four Inns of Court, which can be reached along Chancery Lane or by walking to them along the Victoria Embankment. Established in the late 1300s, it\u2019s been described as a perfect little world, just out of sight and feels like a city within a city. ",

One is to read the subject document, while taking a few notes, and then to describe what\u2019s in the document accurately and completely, getting down all the essentials \u2014 as if you were describing your vacation to a friend. The other way is to succinctly restate the content of two or three-sentence blocks, sort of like taking notes in a college lecture. Then you revisit your restatement to remove less important material and make it shorter and shorter. The first method has the disadvantage that in a document of any length at all it requires a brilliant mind \u2014 unless you are already an expert in the subject matter of the document it can be difficult to hold all its important information in your mind at once. The second method has the disadvantage that it is very time consuming, like digging a hole with a toothpick. ",

Think about all the steps involved and write them down in order, then actually physically do what you wrote. Did you come up with the result you intended? Did you forget something?
