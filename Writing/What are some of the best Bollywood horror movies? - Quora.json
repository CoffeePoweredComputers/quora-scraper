            "answer_text": "Bollywood is famous for commercial cinema, over the top drama and masala entertainers. However, the Hindi film industry has given us many gems over the years in a variety of genres. While horror doesn\u2019t make for the best genre of Bollywood, it does have a few movies that can keep you awake for nights and invoke your belief in spirits and curses. These movies go beyond the typically funny costumes, sounds of creaking doors, blatant jump scares, or creepy looking characters. Some movies have avoided these tropes and instead given us some intensely thrilling and scary stuff. When it comes to scaring the audience with creepy plots, nail-biting sequences and spooky background score. Here are some such Bollywood horror films that are actually good which can fill the hunger of every horror movie lover. Tumbbad (2018)This movie is obvious to make it to the top of the list. It\u2019s more of a mythological thriller with beautiful chained story and scary scenes. The story and curiosity of outcome binds you infront of screen. Beautifully played and justified incident. No absurd scenes, no stupid sudden popping of ghost. Plot- When a family builds a shrine for Hastar, a monster who is never to be worshiped, and attempts to get their hands on his cursed wealth, they face catastrophic consequences.IMDB rating- 8.3/10. 2. Haunted -3D. This movie is my personal favorite in horror genre as it had given many sleepless nights. Its a real horror movie with jump scares, spooky background sound effect, a crime history, revenge and a strong storyline. I have no idea why IMDB rated it so low. PLOT- The narrative revolves around Rehan, a realtor who arrives in Shimla to sell a mansion believed to be haunted. After meeting a mysterious rag picker, Rehan experiences attacks during the night while staying at the mansion. In an attempt to prove there are spirits inside, Rehan ends up stumbling upon a letter that reveals about a violent incident. Soon, he finds himself sent back in time in order to undo the one act of violence that led to the mansion becoming haunted for years.IMDB rating- 6.2/10. 3. 1920 (2008). Again typical horror movie. Scary faces, spooky background sound, crime history of the house, beautiful places and melodious playback music. PLOT- Arjun falls in love with Lisa and abandons his family and faith for her. They move to a manor in Palampur but when Lisa gets possessed by a demonic spirit, Arjun must save her.IMDB rating- 6.4/10. 4. Raaz. (2002). Raaz is the most celebrated horror film in India for obvious reasons. This movie gave us a new dimension to horror genre. Timeworthy and strong storyline. Typical horror movie. PLOT- A young couple's marriage is on the rocks and in a bid to save their relationship, they decide to spend a romantic break in picturesque Ooty, where they first fell in love. But events take a sinister turn.IMDB rating- 6.5/10. 5. Pari (2018) Its a supernatural horror film which based on dark mythological theme. I liked the concept of spirit falling in love with human, their chemistry and the protectiveness. Performance and cast are wonderful. PLOT- A kind-hearted man tries to help Rukhsana, a chained woman in a hut who is probably a victim of abuse. However, he soon realises that things are not as they appear to be.IMDB rating-6.6/10. 6. 13 B (2009). The film spooks you with its (serial) killer of an idea. It based on very different concept. NO creepy faces, no excessive makeup and still one of the most horrifying movie. Both the storyline and execution are tremendous. Plot- Manohar, along with his family, moves into a new apartment on the 13th floor. However, their peace is disturbed by a spirit that uses the television set as a medium to communicate with them.IMDB rating- 7.2/10. 7. The House next door. (2017). Amazing movie and a Hindi horror flick which matches up to Hollywood standards of films like Conjuring & Oculus. Lot of thrills and scary scenes with a gripping storyline. The film is also shot beautifully in the Himalayan valley and there are some breathtaking shots. PLOT-Neurosurgeon Krishnakanth and his wife Lakshmi welcome their new neighbours, whose elder daughter Jenny has a crush on him. When Jenny gets possessed, Krishnakanth intervenes to help the family.IMDB rating- 6.8/10. Happy reading! Until next time\u2026adios\u2764\ufe0f \u2014-Pallavi\u270d\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "14 Bollywood Horror Movies That You Just Can\u2019t Watch Alone Raat (1992) Raat is considered to be one of the finest films RGV has made. It's a supernatural thriller that doesn't go over the top with the nuances of a horror film. The plot is set into motion when a kitten is killed and the leading lady is possessed with its spirit. After you watch this cult classic, you will never look at cats the same way. 1920 (2008) A royal deserted mansion. Check. A mysterious caretaker. Check. A newly wed couple. Check. This movie abounds in every cliche expected of a horror film but what sets it apart from the others is the sheer artistic finesse with which the frames have been done. Chills guaranteed. Raaz (2002) Inspired by the Michelle Pfeiffer starrer 'What Lies Beneath', Raaz was just the the beginning of a slew of horror films that Bipasha Basu was to sign later. Pfeiffer did a commendable job in the original. But our Bips matched her in every way. Ragini MMS (2011) Ragini MMS is inspired by the American supernatural horror 'Paranormal Activity' and is partly based on a real story. Unlike its sequel, this one did not have Sunny Leone, but still managed to draw the crowds to the theatres thanks to its edge-of-the-seat thrills. This sleeper hit can give you a few sleepless hours when you hit the bed at night. 13 B (2009) 13 B comes packed to the rafters with spine-tingling chills and scares. It doesn't completely depend on a spooky background score or weird camera angles to deliver the chills. With a strong script and an ensemble cast that does its job to perfection, 13 B is definitely one movie you shouldn't miss. Mahal (1949) Considered as the first horror movie of Bollywood, Mahal deals with the subject of reincarnation. This one probably scared the shit out of your daddy as well your dada . Even with minimalistic effects this film has continued to haunt audiences for decades. Bees Saal Baad (1962) A mysterious woman walking around at midnight through a field crooning Kahin deep jale kahin dil spooked the nation so much that the film turned out to be the highest grosser in 1962. Loosely based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Hound Of Baskerville', Bees Saal Baad remains every bit haunting even after pachaas saal baad of its release. Horror Story (2013) A group of youngsters decide to spend the night at a haunted hotel. Things get convoluted and it's a scare fest thereon. There are some genuinely frightening scenes that will make you jump off your seat. Those looking for chills won't be disappointed at all. Shaapit (2010) The third installment in the Raaz trilogy, Shaapit is good enough to raise the hair on the back of your neck. Like every Vikram Bhatt film, the USP of this film lies in its treatment, keeping it stylishly eerie. By the end of it all, you might want to believe in curses and evil spirits. Ek Thi Daayan (2013)  The thought of daayans existing in society is spooky in itself. Ek Thi Daayan is a brave attempt at trying something new. It is a cross between an out-and-out horror film and a creepy, paranormal thriller. The supernatural drama may seem unrealistic but the stylised treatment and the taut storyline makes up for it, not to mention Konkona Sen's eerie portrayal of a daayan. Spooky indeed! Bhoot (2003)  The scare element in Bhoot is kept brewing through most parts of the film and is frequently intercepted with scream-out-loud moments. Bhoot was one of the last gripping films churned out by Ram Gopal Varma before he switched to making films like Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag. Darna Mana Hai (2003)  Only Ramu can make apples look scary. This flick by RGV features in this list not because it is scary but because of its innovative script. Ramu packs in 6 of the most creative short stories in one movie, each with outrageous twists. No wonder they call him a maverick! Kohraa (1964) This horror movie was an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier\u2019s 1938 novel Rebecca and was later adapted on screen by Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Academy Award-winning film with the same name. Many believe that the the Indian adaptation was way better than Hitchcock's. Watch this movie for its famous climax scene. Phoonk (2008) Another creepy film churned out by Ram Gopal Varma's Factory, Phoonk deals with the practice of black magic. RGV had so much faith in his film that he promised to offer Rs 5 lakhs to anyone who would watch the film alone in the theatre and not run out scared.
