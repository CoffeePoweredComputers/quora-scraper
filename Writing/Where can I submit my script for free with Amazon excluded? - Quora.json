            "answer_text": "You can put your script up on Script Revolution. You can share it to a number of places for small dollars. My opinion is to use something more like \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d but not in a careless fashion. Pick your best script. Host it and get it read there. Just once. To see how you do and sort of take stock in where you are going to go with the script. The other options are to spend the time prepping the script and saving the cash to put it up for festivals. There are many reputable places that hold up contests and submissions that are reasonable that you can find something that fits your style/genre/etc. I say that from the perspective of someone who has written around a hundred scripts (pilots, shorts and features) and who has tried the approach of \u201cwhat can I do for \u2018free\u2019\u201d and has found more success carefully plotting how to spend as few a dollars as possible in order to get noticed. My last blcklst submission was my most successful round of doing this strictly as a screenwriter as opposed to producing/directing my own stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "Your question is a bit unclear, but let me give it a shot. You can submit your script to anyone for whom you have an email address. They may or may not accept that submission, depending on their submission policy or guidelines. There are several ways to give your script the best chance of being read. First, make sure your script is the best it can be, by writing and rewriting it until it is the best it can be. Know your craft, the elements and techniques and requirements of screenwriting. Never submit your script without first querying the producer or agent you're submitting to. Make sure your query is professional. Never submit a first draft or a first script. Good luck. ",
