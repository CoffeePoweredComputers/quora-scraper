            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A  I think I can fit in to give an answer as I'm doing engineering too.  In engineering the best ways to give answer is by figures. Hence checker can know you know about the topic and you've proper understanding in that theory.  If the answer doesn't include any figures then you'd write answer topicwise, starting new statement with new line.  because it leaves impression on checkers mind. For drawing sheets you need to be neat and clean, don't draw constructive lines so dark. Better use two different grades of pencil.",

            "answer_text": "Buddy, since I am a little younger than you so I exactly can't tell you about how to write an answer at b.tech level (because i haven't till now); But what I can share with you is how to generally write a good answer. Read the question and understand what it is exactly asking you. You told that no matter how good you write you are not getting the expected result. So, one reason for that can be the fact that the question is slightly different from what you are understanding it to be. Once you have read the question, gather all the knowledge about it. Arrange the known fact in an order so that the most important and to the point facts come first. Then, accordingly write your answer starting from the most important thing and moving to the least. This is important just because the teachers often read the beginning of the answers and judge the remaining of it on it's baises.Always include keywords in your answers. Always! All the best! Cheers!

So if you think you won't be able to memorize a certain topic, try breaking into crucial points and make a flowchart. You would be able to remember lot of things without confusion. All the bestThanks for a2a ",
