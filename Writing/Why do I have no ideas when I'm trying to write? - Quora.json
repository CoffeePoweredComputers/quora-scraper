            "answer_text": "This is a common problem called \u201clack of constraints\u201d There are billions of possible word combinations you could make, more, really, than there are grains of sand on the beach. In order to write something, you need freedom\u2026but not too much freedom. It\u2019s much easier to write a story about Angela Merkel on the beach with Fidel Castro discovering a shared appreciation for seashells and how it relates to economic realities among the poor than it is to \u201cwrite a geopolitical essay\u201d One of the great things about Quora is that it presents you with questions, and you can put together an answer, instead of just staring at a blank Blog page and hoping some idea comes to you, something you can write about. If your essay assignments aren\u2019t detailed enough, add additional challenges to them. Insist on working the word Dystopia into every essay this week. Write essays which avoid using the word \u201ca\u201d (an is fine, just no \u201ca\u201d). Decide that your essay will have five paragraphs, and each paragraph will start with the corresponding letter A through E Your goal here is to create a framework to work inside of, instead of a blank canvas which gives you no idea where to go. The second issue is a desire for \u201cfirst draft success\u201d. Writing well is a combination of creativity and control. But the two rarely come at the same time. It is much much much simpler to evoke one, and then the other, serially rather than in parallel. You can immediately see a problem with this approach; if you sit down and say I\u2019m going to exercise control now, you\u2019ll have nothing to work with. Instead, sit down and just create. It doesn\u2019t have to be good, there just has to be putting a bunch of stuff down on the page. Go where it leads you, jot down tangents that lead other directions, let whatever happens happen. Then go back and EDIT the thing so it makes some sense. Now that you have something created, understand that it\u2019s crap right now, but that you can make something good out of if. Go back and forth between creativity and editing, add some of those tangents in, prune off ideas that went nowhere, do some research and fill in the blank spots you glossed over. The third thing is fear. You\u2019re afraid what you create won\u2019t be any good. Screw that. It\u2019s not important that somethign be good. Write something bad. Write nonsense. Lie, cheat, steal. Just get some stuff out there. Do not censor, do not edit, relax, have fun. Editing is for later, editing is where you go back to the stuff you created and dig the good parts out, shine them up, and build something beautiful. But the funny thing about editing is, nobody gets editors block. Creating is hard, because you have to learn not to edit. Editing is easy, the creating part is already done. ",

            "answer_text": "Finding the best outlet for your creativity is one of the larger challenges as a writer. Many writers feel they lack creativity when they sit down to write, Steven Pressfield claims that it\u2019s \u201cthe resistance\u201d - in other words, fear and doubt, that place limits on you and that you just need to sit down and write. Often, the difficulty we experience is the fear that it wont be good enough and we doubt our thoughts. It\u2019s rare that you\u2019ll experience a \u201cflash\u201d of inspiration, an epiphany that you can just scribble out and it\u2019ll be perfect. Musician Neil Young would say that he\u2019d play music all day and night, and in an instant would get a note or lyric while driving. But that was a byproduct of doing the work regularly. There are a few strategies that may help translate from being \u201ccreative\u201d to being able to write. Just write. Put thoughts on paper. You can try to outline a couple thoughts or topics - Do it \u201cold school\u201d with pen to paper. There\u2019s a physical element that triggers something in our cerebrum, the part of the brain that processes reading and writing.Write using a productivity hack like the Pomodoro Technique: The Pomodoro Technique is a method of time management that helps organize your work flow more efficiently. Basically, you set a timer, say for 20 minutes. You work intensely for twenty minutes and when the duration ends, you take a 5 minute break from EVERYTHING related to what you\u2019re working on.Read. Get a book and read for 1 hour. Not a kindle, or other app, but a physical, bound book. Afterward, try to write in the tone and style of the author. (Just don\u2019t submit it as your own work).Don\u2019t edit. Free-flow your writing. Put ideas down on paper, and edit later. If it\u2019s a report for class, write on one topic and set it aside. Write on a second topic for the same class. Set it aside. Now re-read the first and second topics. Are there similarities you can use? Rewrite the content in a way that the two topics make sense. Next write the transitions between the topics, an intro and a conclusion to your new draft.Deadlines and expectations (like grades in class) are double-edged swords for creativity. On the one side, it\u2019s great to have the outside (extrinsic) motivation to propel you to write. On the other side is the fear and doubt that limits us. It\u2019s most important to put aside our doubts, write, and only through the editing phase that we see the work as it is becoming. ",
