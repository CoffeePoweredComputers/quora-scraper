            "answer_text": "**There might be some spoilers ahead** Yes, I have read part of \u201cBringing the Nation\u2019s Husband Home.\u201d It\u2019s already a completed book but I didn\u2019t finish it. I think I got until 300+ chapters before dropping it, if I remember it right. What do I think about it? The English translation was great. Very minimal grammatical errors, almost negligible. The world setting was in modern day China that involves the entertainment industry which is typical for this kind of novel, nothing new but it was okay. Character design and story development, on the other hand, I find them frustrating though. Why? Let me start with the synopsis of the story which is as follows: Qiao Anhao and Lu Jinnian had secretly longed for each other for thirteen years, and now that there's a possibility for them to be together, even though the circumstances may be unconventional, neither one can refuse their inner desires any longer. Hurled into a false marriage, Qiao Anhao treads carefully towards the cold and reclusive Lu Jinnian, but after years of near-missed opportunities and deep misunderstandings, how could their last shot at love possibly run smooth? **\"Nation Husband\" is a Korean term awarded to a man who is perfect in the eyes of the public - an ideal husband. Source: Webnovel Keywords there are: secretly longed for each other for thirteen years, false marriage, years of near-missed opportunities and deep misunderstandings Just from those keywords alone, it\u2019s safe to expect a tragic, heavy drama love story. It was indeed tragic, it was indeed dramatic, and it was a love story. But a little bit too much tragedy and too much drama for my taste. I mean, most of the complications they had could\u2019ve been avoided if they just TALKED. Like two proper adults. I get that there are \u201cbig\u201d and \u201csmall\u201d complications in a story, but even the smallest things were blown up because they couldn\u2019t properly communicate. Ugh! To be fair though, from the beginning until the first hundred chapters showing their \u201cnear-missed opportunities\u201d really moved me. I literally was crying my eyes out for them! How tragic! How dramatic! I was full on sympathetic. But then, a few hundred more chapters later and they still have no progress in their relationship! Why?! I just don\u2019t get it anymore! I mean, they are supposedly married, although fake, with the person they have been in love with for more than a freaking decade! And then what? They can\u2019t even have a proper conversation with each other without hurting and insulting one another. That was when the story gets frustrating for me. Really frustrating. It was no longer a case of \u201cnear-missed opportunities\u201d but rather the Female and Male Leads acting like perfect idiots. The tragedy and the drama, they are bringing it on to themselves. I got so frustrated and tired of it and could not go on reading more of their freaking love story. If you have better tolerance than I do or prefer that kind of stories, then that would be a good story to read. If you are into strong FLs and MLs though, I would suggest giving \u201cFull Marks Hidden Marriage: Pick Up a Son, Get a Free Husband\u201d a try. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t that great. I tried reading the novel itself\u2014got to chapter 500 through sheer force of will, and I even tried reading the webtoon/manga version of the story. But the Male Lead is just too...antagonistic for me. He jumps to conclusions and makes irrational decisions too quickly. Meanwhile, the Female Lead is too subservient. The entire book is a thousand chapters based around a miscommunication, and with all the things these two have done to each other in retaliation, it\u2019s a wonder they end up together at all. If you want a more powerful female lead, I suggest \u201cPerfect Secret Love: The Bad New Wife is a Little Sweet,\u201d \u201cTravelling to the Future, It\u2019s Not Easy to be a Man,\u201d \u201cAnarchic Consort,\u201d or \u201cMesmerizing Ghost Doctor.\u201d (Also, check out \u201cThe Experimental Log of a Crazy Lich,\u201d or \u201cThe Daily Life of an Immortal King,\u201d if you want hilarious characters and ridiculous adventures.)
