            "answer_text": "Look at me. Read me. Are you reading? If I hide all the important facts in lines and lines and lines and lines and lines of text you're less likely to read the whole way through and you'll never find out all of the interesting things I have to say because nobody likes to sift through mega-graphs. Isn't this easier to read? Don't you pay more attention to every word when there are so few? Doesn't this look better, specifically on your mobile device (if you're so inclined)? It's all about readability and getting the reader\u2019s attention. Small paragraphs work wonders in that regard. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing has rhythm. A longer sentence may simply be a way to mix-up that rhythm, a refreshing respite from the staccato sea of attenuated thinking that characterizes this text-and-twitter-infatuated age. But it may also just be the best if not only way to give some complex issues the deeper exposition they deserve. On top of that, a noticeably long sentence that\u2019s actually coherent (underscore \u2018coherent\u2019) is a bit of a \u2018work of art\u2019 \u2014 don\u2019t you think? Even a little victory. To pull-it-off without losing the reader requires skill and effort. If you accomplish that, I think you also create a special connection with the thoughtful reader. ",
