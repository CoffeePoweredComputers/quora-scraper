            "answer_text": "Here is my suggestion. Try it and let me know. 1) You are not giving enough time to your body to recover. Take 8 hours of sleep. 2) Morning time is when brain is most active thus try to read 30 minutes to 1 hour for the things you are going to study in school. This will allow you to raise many questions when same subject is taught by your instructor. 3) When you study try to focus on subject at hand. Make sure to control your brain to stop wandering around. If you have true focus, you will remember about 50% of things you read. Other 50% can be solidify in memory by putting that in real world practice. 4) Imagine pictures and live scene for the knowledge you gather from study. Our brain remembers things better when it is presented into picture form. Idea is to visualize strong image which you can't forget thus you will able to recall it when you need that information back from your brain. 5) Study Memory storing system. We can use our memory like computer file system. There is many books available on amazon kindle on same topic. Put this in practice. 6) Try to share what you learned to others. By teaching others, you are solidifying your own memory. ",

(alternatively, a more colloquial speaker would respond with \"no shit\"). In general, in your situation and level of stress, while you need to reduce the stress by eliminating some of the causes, it also helps to make sure you are on a good diet.  Also, I would strongly, strongly advise for taking an extra 200-400mg of magnesium per day in the form of magnesium citrate or some other well absorbed form, together with 500-2000mg of vit C on an empty stomach before sleep or right after waking up.  It will give you back some of your good sleep, energy levels and ability to concentrate, memorize things and think more clearly.  Magnesium is the 2nd most important mineral in your body (metabolism, nerves, brain, bones, skin), and your body starts using up & excreting extra amounts of it during times of stress. Also, high doses of 5000 IU or more of vit. D (taken with e.g. omega 3 capsules, or other fat containing food/nutrition) are shown to give you a boost in energy, similarly to bathing in the sun for 1-2h, not to mention other health benefits.
