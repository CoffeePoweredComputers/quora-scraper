            "answer_text": "Torque is the rotational equivalent of force. Just as an applied force causes a body to accelerate translationally in the direction of the force, an applied torque causes a body to accelerate rotationally in the direction of the torque. Just as force equilibrium implies that the sum of the applied forces causes zero translational acceleration, torque equilibrium implies that the sum of the applied torques causes zero rotational acceleration.
