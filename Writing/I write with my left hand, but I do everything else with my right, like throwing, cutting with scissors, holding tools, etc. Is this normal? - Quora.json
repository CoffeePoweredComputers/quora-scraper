            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cI write with my left hand, but I do everything else with my right, like throwing, cutting with scissors, holding tools, etc. Is this normal?\u201d I\u2019m about the same way. I write with the left hand. I use scissors with the right. I throw with my left hand. I hold a fork with my right hand, and my left hand cuts the meat without switching hands. I generally use a mouse with my right hand, though I can use my left just about as well. I pick up a drink with my right hand more often than my left. I kick a ball better with my right foot. I\u2019m a mess. I suspect my speech area is on the left. (I\u2019d love to know.). I suspect my brain\u2019s language areas are strewn all over. All my life I\u2019ve thought a bit differently than others, and I suspect this confusion contributes. None of that seems to have been a problem for me. Good luck discovering yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of \u201cnormal.\u201d You sound a lot like me, so I'm inclined to think you're perfectly normal. I write with my left hand because my teachers insisted that I pick one hand for handwriting. I do most other things with my right hand, or equally with both hands. I think a lot of lefties are like this, because we grow up in a world made for right-handed people. It\u2019s easier to just use your right hand than insist the world rearrange itself for your convenience. ",
