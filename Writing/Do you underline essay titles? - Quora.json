            "answer_text": "Are you referring to the essay\u2019s title or the title of another essay mentioned in the text? Notwithstanding, I will try to answer to the best of my ability. In the past, before the use of word processors became a thing, people wrote essays on typewriters. These typewriters had no italics or bold features to emphasize text. So, the underline feature served as the universal indication of emphasis. Nowadays, modern writing guides don\u2019t recommend the use of underlining to emphasize texts. A major part of the problem presents itself as the hyperlink feature, which is similar to underlining. Therefore, all modern writing styles discourage students from underlining an essay\u2019s title. You can use Title Case capitalization instead. You can also use italics or quotation marks when mentioning another essay in the title. Deconstructing the Literary Devices in \u201cThe Old Man and the Sea\u201dIf the essay title appears in your text, then you shouldn\u2019t underline it either. You can only use italics or quotation marks. \u201cIn his interpretation of The Old Man and the Sea\u2026.\u201dAlso, you cannot underline titles in the Works Cited page. If the essay is an excerpt from another publication, it should be enclosed in quotation marks. If it is a stand-alone publication, italicize it.

            "answer_text": "\"Do you underline essay titles\" If you mean when writing about or referencing other people's essays, I would italicize the title. If you mean the title of your own essay, I would use 12Pt bold if you're using a word processor and no underlining. If you are writing your essay on paper, then underlining would be a good idea. With digital documents, underling is generally avoided no because underlines imply a hyperlink. ",

If you can't make italics on your ancient word processor, then underline books and movies to indicate that you wish you could put them in italics. Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat . (Note: I don\u2019t know how to underline on this web page, so I left the italics.) No matter how old your word processor is, essays still go in quotes. Lewis Thomas wrote \"The Medusa and the Snail.\" But that doesn't mean that you put the title in quotes when you are writing the essay. At the top of the essay itself, you just write the words of the title; you don't put them in quotes. ",
