            "answer_text": "There is much good information in all these answers but there is one thing I didn\u2019t see (and I may have just missed it) and it is something I think is really important: Examine your own attitudes about and toward women. Look at the culture, beliefs, values, and mores you have grown up with and that you have now. Consider the relationships you have with other women, like your mom, sibs, other family members, friends, & coworkers. Think about female characters in books, movies, etc that you have seen. What do you like, dislike, admire, feel impatient with, etc? All of these things will influence the believeability of your character. I have read many books written by one gender with interesting, fully-realized characters of the opposite gender. Then recently, I picked up a book which was written by a man\u2014a rather prolific writer but not really well-known off the internet\u2014and this book had a female main character. It was awful. His females were simpering idiots who waited around for men to show up and rescue them. Now this would have been fine if that was what he was trying to write\u2014but his characters were supposed to be strong, decisive warrior women and learned mages\u2026after looking at some of his other books, it appears that all of his women seem to defer to men who save them, make decisions for them, and tell them what to do. These females all seem happy with that state of affairs. I read his bio and I have some ideas about where his attitudes may have come from. Thus, my suggestion to you: examine your beliefs and biases so that the only \u201csimpering idiots\u201d (I\u2019m using analogy; maybe you don\u2019t think women are \u201csimpering idiots\u201d) you create in your books are the ones you mean to create.

            "answer_text": "Well for starters, don\u2019t do this.  For the most part, write female characters the same way you write a believable male character. Women, so I\u2019ve been told, do not go about their days dwelling constantly on being women. Just as you don\u2019t dwell constantly on being a man. They do whatever they do, and think about that. They only think about being women when being a woman specifically matters. Now, since you\u2019re not a woman, for those specific situations, research is your friend. Talk to women you know. Ask them what stands out to them as wrong with poorly written female characters. Ask them what rings particularly true. I\u2019ve written quite a few female characters over the years, and as it happens the majority of my beta readers are women. Supposedly I\u2019m pretty good at writing women. I think for the most part it\u2019s because I don\u2019t actively think about them as women. Given a particular situation, I don\u2019t consider how a woman would respond, I consider how Nadya, Selena, Irina, or Kazya might respond. If being a woman is relevant, I mull it over and figure out what seems reasonable. If I can\u2019t figure it out, I ask women I know what might they do, and use this as a basis for what I write. Don\u2019t be afraid to play to stereotypes, but don\u2019t be bound by them either. Men and women are different. That\u2019s immutable fact. But it doesn\u2019t always matter, and it doesn\u2019t mean that all men are the same or all women are the same. It\u2019s fine to have a character who cares a lot about her appearance. It\u2019s fine to have another that doesn\u2019t. Just\u2026be aware how long makeup takes to put on. I literally polled a bunch of women I know, asking both about time and complexity, because I needed to know for a story I wrote. One of my characters puts a lot of care into her appearance, and when her girlfriend noted that she took a mere fifteen minutes to get ready in the morning, that was an alarm bell that something was off. It also tells experienced readers about how long she usually takes, and the amount of effort she usually puts in. Incidentally I\u2019ve also learned that I\u2019m a big fan of smokey eye and oxblood lipstick on women. The point is, if your character cares about her appearance, it\u2019s not going to be effortless, unless it is and you need to explain why. Magic is a valid answer. If she doesn\u2019t does that make people view her differently? If so, how? Or does it not matter in this culture? Then there are physical differences. It\u2019s fine to have a badass lady who kicks ass. But don\u2019t forget that, barring magic, technology, mutation, or just winning the genetic lottery, she\u2019s going to be smaller and weaker than most men she meets. I addressed this in a story where a lord\u2019s daughter had to learn to swordfight, and her instructor relentless drilled this lesson into her. His solution then was to make sure she was perfectly skilled. Since she could never rely on strength to win the day, she\u2019d have to have perfect form. So she kicks ass by fighting smart, and practicing for hours a day. Finally, don\u2019t forget about mental differences. There\u2019s plenty of research that shows how men and women typically differ in mentality. But the point here is that you shouldn\u2019t have all your women think the same way, or think exactly like all the men. Women tend to write men who emote more than we really do. Men tend to write women who emote more than they really do, or who are stoics just like most of the men. That\u2019s fine for a few specific characters, but realize these should be exceptions, not rules. Don\u2019t be afraid to have a badass who still feels like a woman. Gal Gadot\u2019s Wonder Woman, for example, is both tough as nails and still very feminine. And don\u2019t forget how cultural norms can affect all of this. Your characters are people first, people who happen to be women. And when in doubt, research!  Original question-How do you write a believable female character in a story? ",
