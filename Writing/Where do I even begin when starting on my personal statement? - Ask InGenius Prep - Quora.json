            "answer_text": "Hi Grace. Thanks for the submission! I\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions on Quora about the personal statement and I completely understand why. This is a huge part of your application and it requires a style of writing that you probably aren\u2019t used to. We aren\u2019t typically asked to write a 650-word essay about ourselves, especially in high school. Since this is a reflective essay, that is where you should begin when working on your personal statement - by reflecting. Think back to how you\u2019ve spent your time while in high school. What clubs were you involved in? What classes did you take? Then start to dig deeper. Here are some of my favorite brainstorming questions that will help you turn your past experiences into personal statement topics: What\u2019s an extracurricular activity that has shaped your personality and character?When did your academic area of interest first start to matter to you? Was there a specific event that sparked your interest?Is there something you\u2019ve done or experienced that changed you forever in a positive way?Once you\u2019ve thought of some topics, start writing drafts. Don\u2019t worry too much about the word count or if they\u2019re perfect yet. Just get your ideas down on a page and see how you feel about the topic. Later, you can focus on tailoring your ideas, hitting the 650-word count, and polishing your ideas. But when you do get to that point, I\u2019d highly recommend listening to this interview with my colleague Hannah who\u2019s a writing expert from Stanford. She talks a lot about how to best edit your essay and what a good personal statement really looks like. But to focus back on the question at hand, start your personal statement process by simply reflecting. Think of activities or moments that have impacted your life, write as much as you can, and decide which topic resonates most with you and will be the most impressive to an admissions officer. ",
