            "answer_text": "There is no quality requirement that you write every day to be successful. Novels, screenplays, stage plays are all driven by the warp and weft of plot, theme, character, dialogue, pacing, etc. It does not turn on like a faucet just because someone told you that to be successful you have treat it just like a job. Drudgery rarely inspires creativity. The truth is you will be more successful if you creatively write when you feel most creative \u2014 and it is unlikely to happen between 9am and noon, an hour off for lunch, then again 1pm through 5pm. Maybe you can be creative on Yelp if you treat it like a job, but the principal difference between plot-based writing and event based is the endurance of creativity required. Yelp is sprint writing; novels are a marathon; movies and television are triathlons. You don\u2019t train for a marathon by running a marathon every day; same for triathlons. Keep notes when you\u2019re not actually writing; let the creative scroll continue to run even though you\u2019re doing something else. Read authors you respect and you\u2019ll begin to pick up style and pacing as if by osmosis. Understand the milieu you\u2019ve chosen. If you want to be a book writer, understand the different story telling formats: chose a tense and stick to it; understand the strengths and weakness of first-person writing; have a plan for chapter lengths. If you want to write movies, SEE movies. Not just the ones coming out, but the classics as well. You need to be conversational in the craft. Understand how a three-act structure works instead of merely a vague understanding of a beginning, middle and end. Understand what \u201ctheme\u201d is and to meander it through your work. If you want to write for television, move to L.A. because if you\u2019re not there, no one is going to take you seriously. Movie scripts come one at a time. Televisions scripts come 13 at a time, executed over the same time as a single movie script. Learn to play well with others, because television is the ultimate collaborative environment. Get expert in four and five act structures and stop apologizing for act breaks to commercials. If you work in television you will be working everyday, but the episode plot and arc will already have been determined. Finally, \u201cpublished\u201d is a term that\u2019s lost a lot of meaning in the past few years. Book publishing has changed dramatically and the plethora of channels and cables have become the digital publishing platform. Don\u2019t narrow your focus until you have a good idea of how you think creatively \u2014 because if you don\u2019t know how you think, you won\u2019t be able to be creative. And don\u2019t believe everything you think! ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to write very day to become a published writer. I have been a published writer since I was 10 years old. That means I have been published for something like 57 years. During that time, I once stopped writing for about a decade. It didn\u2019t even remotely affect my ability to be published afterwards. In fact, when I went back to writing, right from day one, I started winning prizes for what I wrote. The idea that one has to write every day is presented by those who teach others or encourage others who want to learn to write for publication. It\u2019s pretty stupid advice. The bottom line is that we learn literacy when we go to school. Good writing has more to do with grammar, vocabulary, and structure than anything else. It has very little to do with having an imagination. That is part of storytelling. Creative writing requires both a good command of language and storytelling. However as published writing is generally non-fiction (artcles, news stories, etc.). it definitely has more to do with the level of literacy. Once you learn to write, you do not have to write every day to become a published writer. This is why I was already published at ten years old. I simply learnt basic literacy and I read a lot. In order to become a published writer, you need to be a thinker (in order to be able to analyze data), have a capacity for finding something to write about, plus have an ability to \u2018hear\u2019 what you are writing in the same way that the reader will read it. That way you can determine if it is any good. This is why any good writer does not need to have others \u2018critique\u2019 it. If you can\u2019t \u2018hear\u2019 you own writing, then you will never really be a good writer. There is too little emphasis on reading these days. The thing that made me a writer was that I was reading book a day by the time I was eight years old. Within a few years, I was reading between two and four books a day. It was reading that gave me the flow of language that is needed for publishable writing - not writing every day. This is why they say that all writers are readers. The thing is that wannabe writers are not necessarily readers, and readers read at at least three books a week. ",
