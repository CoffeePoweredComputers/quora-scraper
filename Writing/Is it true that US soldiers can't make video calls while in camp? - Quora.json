            "answer_text": "Let me give you a true story as to why deployed soldiers are not allowed to make cell phone calls of any type while deployed. Several years ago I was the Chief of Military Operations in South America, Central America, and the Caribbean region for the United States Army South (USARSO). As such, I and my predecessor so no problem allowing an exception to USARSO policy and allow deployed Reserve and National Guard personnel to have and use their cell phones while deployed on missions in our AO. Now, flash forward to a mission in Northern Equador. During the mission one of the HUMMV operators seeing a local indigenous woman and her children walking down the road and stopped to give them a lift. This in itself was against regulations. Failing to slow down to cross a local bridge the driver miscalculated the actual location of the bridge road way and hit his front right wheel in a gap in the bridge. This flipped the vehicle and threw the driver and his passengers into the middle of the bridge. Now comes the reason no cell phones are allowed. Instead of using his radio to call in the accident to his CO he called his buds back at base camp to come and get him. They came took some pictures on their cell phones to include the woman who had broken her arm in 2 places and was noticeable shaken by the accident. To make things worse, his buds sent the pictures, to include a nice video, home to their spouse\u2019s. They also took the women and her child to the local clinic and paid her $20 for her trouble. As a result one spouse contacted their local news and paper with the story and pictures and video. These pictures were used that night on the local news. I was contacted the next day by the USARSO Chief of Staff to find out why I had not reported the accident as soon as I was notified of it. Apparently, the State Adjatant General, he is the Commander of the National Guard within his State, and he wanted to know about the accident reported on the news. Things went down hill from there. ",
