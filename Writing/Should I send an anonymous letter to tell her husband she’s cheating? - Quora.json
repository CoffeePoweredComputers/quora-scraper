People lacking morals will tell you to mind your business. Ignorant people will tell you that maybe they're happy or that he treats her well. You know, besides betraying her. What I can tell you, 100%, is that if my partner was cheating on me, I would hope someone would have the decency to tell me. I wouldn't care who or why. I would just want to know. It wouldn't \u201cdestroy\u201d anything, and I would be 10 times more hurt finding out later. Always tell them. ",
