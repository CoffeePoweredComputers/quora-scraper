            "answer_text": "The overall plots are the basic mystery plot described by Tanusree Nair, with the solution at the end, though in some of the Sayers books there are one or more chapters after the culprit is found. Christie seems to like imposters a lot. Five of Sayers\u2019s ten Wimsey novel plots, and some might say a sixth, depend on some technical or medical gimmick, two of which seem pretty doubtful now. Wimsey and the police often spend a lot of time coming up with and rejecting one theory after another. ",

            "answer_text": "Agatha Christie typically writes what is called 'locked room' mysteries, where a murder occurs in circumstances that seem almost impossible. The murderer usually appears to disappear into thin air, and sometimes the murders are taken for suicides initially. In addition, Agatha Christie's murderer is almost always one of the known characters introduced in the earlier chapters. She never has a stranger or a wandering lunatic commit the crime. Often, there is a family group or collection of guests present, and only these people could have committed the crime. This means that her novels are much less police procedurals (tracking down the unknown killer) and more psychological investigations (who of the characters we know did it). ",
