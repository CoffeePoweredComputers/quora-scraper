            "answer_text": "Stick to facts, which had better provide a good reason for your difficulties. Were you ill or injured? Was there a trauma? Emotional problems that you did not handle well?  Blame no one or nothing. Just state the diffIculties as a fact. Then assume full responsibility for the outcome (failing the class).  Let's say you had a bad break up. You would report that you had \"emotional difficulties\" and that you \"did not take advantage of the services available to me\" and as such, you dug a hole for yourself that you couldn't climb out of. Or, if you are an English major, you dug a hole out of which you could not climb.  You would not say \"my girlfriend dumped me and I was upset which led to me staying drunk for three weeks, which is how I got in the situation,\" which makes you sound like a victim who is not responsible for any aspect of his life Again, just stick to the facts, own up to whatever it is you did (bad choice, faulty time management, took on too much, etc.) and in conclusion cite that  this experience afforded you  a great life lesson that will serve you well as time goes on.  You might say that you feel strongly that you have a good grasp of the material and do not need to actually repeat the course but rather just retake the exam.  The last sentence is \"I appreciate your kind consideration.\"  Do NOT say, \"Thanking You in advance.\" No no no  Close with \"Respectfully yours.,\" followed by your signature.  Create the letter as a Word document, then print it out and sign it and put it in envelope and post it. Use the proper title of the person's position in the salutation and the proper citation for the outside address.  No one sends letters by post anymore, so when a letter is received, it is sure to get attention. Everyone loves getting mail. Yours is a serious, formal matter and needs to be presented in a serious, formal, respectful fashion. Don't even think about doing this via email.  Best to you. Let me know how it works out. ",

Definitely do not do the following. 4/24/19 123 abc street 456 def drive Greetings Doctor Who, I am sincerely concerned for my final grade and the potential risk to my degree. The exam your 2:00 p.m. class took last Friday has severely impacted my G.P.A. and I would like to appeal for a better grade. I know you are a very busy person, and I would like you to consider the following items before you deny my request. You have a thousand students all in the same course, all at the same spot in the curriculum, so that is a thousand tests to grade over one weekend. If I had to do that, I would honestly give up after the first fifty and fail everyone else. I try to be understanding, and you must have been exhausted after dealing with The Master and could have easily marked my test wrong. I mean, putting a thousand test grades in, one could have easily gotten lost in the papers and gave someone a wrong grade. There\u2019s always a possibility for error, especially as we get older. Not to mention, we both know that you have a special place in your heart for Clara, Sarah, Rose, Amy, and Romana. They only made hundreds because of that. Also, I know that being the only person who failed, I am the one you personally hate with a fiery passion. Let\u2019s not forget, there have been many occasions where I genuinely have gotten questions correct on the homework, and you purposely marked them incorrect. I have a realistic concern that your grading may be mistaken on my exam. I would like you to review my exam and check for such errors. I know my request is within the University guidelines and I know I will get results soon. Thank you for your time, Silurian Dalek P.S. I hope this helped. ;) ",
