Instead he(or she) will be picked up by (Insert person/persons permitted to pick up) at the end of the school day. Thank You(Your signature) Then your child needs to remember to give it to his teacher (For Elementary grades) or take it to the attendance office (upper grades) at the start of school for the proper processing. Otherwise, your school just might be legally bound to place the kid on the bus even if you show up at the end of the day! (So if your kid is forgetful, a call to the school to make sure the kid DID submit the note could be helpful in ensuring the proper paperwork is completed) ",
