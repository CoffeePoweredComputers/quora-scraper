            "answer_text": "Myths, in themselves, are composed to tell a story, yes, and quite a few are made to tell a story that explains a natural phenomenon. The Thunderbird, for instance, was made for the purpose of explaining what thunder is. When the Thunderbird beats its wings, the resulting sound is its namesake- thunder. Myths are typically made to explain natural phenomena, yes, but some believe myths are based on fact, and some actually are. Whether you believe in Christianity or other related religions, it is an actual fact that a man named Jesus was executed by the Romans around the time people believe Jesus from the Bible was crucified. That being said, I am not trying to start a belief argument, but that actually DID happen. Some are made just because. Take Norse mythology, for instance. There isn\u2019t any explaining of natural phenomena, no once real person, these legends just came into being. They told of how the universe was created, yes, and they tell of humanity, yes, but many stories don't have a point in explaining anything. That isn't to say they aren't cool, though. Myths are created for many different purposes, but HOW are they created? Well, that's\u2026 well\u2026 complicated, to say the least. If we go back to the Bible, most sources say that many people contributed to writing it, between prophets and just normal people. While the books are pretty easy to trace back, many myths aren't. A lot of myths are told by mouth, created by people who tell their children the stories we know today. This is how a lot of Native American myths started, but the disadvantage of word-of-mouth is that it's not a physical rendition of their beliefs. A disaster happens and many people die, we\u2019ll say. What happens to those beliefs? They're scattered to the winds, only resurfacing if the children who survived remember them. Oh boy, here we go. Norse mythology. How did that start? Well, I'm not too sure about that one. It's a compilation of tales about the struggles and triumphs of many different creatures and people, so it's VERY hard to trace. Chances are that it began word-of-mouth. There's little evidence of when they began writing things down, and a lot of contradictions occur within the writings. Those contradictions are key to understanding how Norse mythology started. When it's just stories being passed down, some things are lost in translation, and not every household has the same stories. Therefore, when the writings began, it was roughly the same story, but only roughly. If it were based off of one source, there would be no questioning the key elements of the stories, so it's safe to assume that Norse mythology was never in solid book form. All in all, myths are a great way to explain things you don't exactly know about, and understanding how and why they were created is also helpful in understanding the myths themselves. Hope this helped! ",

            "answer_text": "Where do myths originate? A2A Some myths, as the other answers suggest, are stories that try to explain phenomena that were, to the originators, mystical in nature, a way to explain something that was beyond their current knowledge. Earthquakes, volcanoes and floods. Other myths are stories that teach morals based on the originating society/person\u2019s belief system. Pandora, Ikaros, Trymskvida, the Samaritan. Then you have myths that just tell a story, and is repeated by many, so it takes on a life on its own, such as urban-myths. Prime example, albino crocodile/alligator in the sewers. There is a sub-category of these type of myths that are currently popular, and those myths are the conspiracy theories, such as chem-trails, anti vaxx, 9/11 and so on. But all in all, myths are stories that are told by enough people that it enters the societal memory, are such that they are not easily explained away by current knowledge, and appeal to certain aspects of the psyche. Such as the fright center of our brain (many urban myths fall under this category). So to answer the question: Myths are stories that originate from a persons imagination, are told in such a way that the listeners remember them and use them themselves, reaches enough people that the story is not forgotten when the originator dies (popular), and for some types of myths, are explanations of events that the people do not understand the reason for, or feel that the current explanation is not good enough. Hope this answers the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do myths and legends originate from? according to writers store, The great myths and legends were not authored by individuals the way stories are today but were evolved naturally and instinctively by unconscious processes in oral traditions. Even if they started out as made-up or true stories, revelations or dreams, they still ended up for long periods of time in oral traditions and that became the principal dynamic behind their creation. The process went something like this: it began with a real or imagined incident or event that was worth repeating, something so intriguing that we were compelled to repeat it. It was passed along by word of mouth, from person to person and from generation to generation until it had been told and retold millions of times and existed in a hundred different versions around the world. Each time a story is retold it changes. This is due to certain natural but curious tendencies of the mind - the tendency, for instance, to remember things that make a strong impression and to forget things that don't impress us very strongly. There is also a tendency to exaggerate or minimize, to glorify or ennoble, to idealize or vilify. Beyond that, there's a natural, unconscious tendency to analyze things, to take them apart and put them back together in different combinations and a natural tendency to simplify or edit. The tendency to conserve energy in nature is very strong in everything we do, including how we organize and store our thoughts and memories. These are all things we're very aware of. We experience these curious tendencies constantly. They are a significant part of our everyday lives. We all know how hard it is to get a story straight, or accurately remember something we've been told or even experienced, if it hasn't been written down. You tell someone close to you something exciting that happened (an incident worth repeating) and when you hear it repeated later that week or even later that day it's been severely changed. It's the cause of many serious misunderstandings. Well, you can imagine what happens to a story that has spent hundreds of years in an oral tradition. It has been thoroughly and completely changed. We can see how this works if we look at certain important historical figures and examine how the real incidents which surrounded their lives and were worth repeating were evolved by oral traditions into marvelous and even miraculous tales that contained important bits of a truth hidden in the creative unconscious self. In great stories, this hidden truth is a significant source of power. ",

            "answer_text": "While we\u2019re still learning how advanced the ancient world truly was, we do know there were some things they didn\u2019t understand yet. Ever notice how many civilizations have flood stories? How the Bible has a flood story? Hurricanes are not a recent phenomenon. Chances are, the ancient world had been hit with numerous hurricanes, and they struggled to explain how and why this was happening. Especially when the ensuing floods caused such terrible damage. So they sought to explain what was taking place. Did they infuriate Poseidon? Perhaps they weren\u2019t hospitable when Jupiter and Mercury disguised themselves and sought shelter, ala the Baucis and Philemon story? Myths are a good way for people to explain the currently unexplainable. And they often have a message, a moral. It could be as simple as not trying to fool the Gods, as Tantalus tried. Or it could be taking responsibility for your actions. ",

            "answer_text": "Myths are usually inspired by actual events or real people. With the retelling of the story, the involvement of some god or another is usually added to the story, and the level of difficulty is usually inflated to make its accomplishment by a normal human impossible. So the success must be due to the individual being a demigod. Some instances I have in mind are the Trojan war, the myth of Minos\u2019 labyrinth, and the myth of the Golden Fleece. All of these stories were initially written off as complete fabrications, until archaeological digs proved that the events did in fact take place, although as mentioned, they were embellished over time.
