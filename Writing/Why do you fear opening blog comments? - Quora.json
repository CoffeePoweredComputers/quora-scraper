            "answer_text": "It may be due to fear of the unknown. Also an unopened comment is partially hidden from view, which means anything could be lurking in there. Some unfortunate people who may have been subjected to trolls in the past may fear opening comments. This is perfectly understandable, and may take time to be overcome. However, you should see a comment not as a challenge, but something that is welcome. It is an amazing opportunity to find out what someone thinks of your post. You never know, it could be truly wonderful! And remember to answer your comments too. This is very important if you want to send out an indication of which kinds of comments you accept on your blog, and to encourage your readers to write similar contributions of their own. If you fear the act of commenting, read this post. ",
