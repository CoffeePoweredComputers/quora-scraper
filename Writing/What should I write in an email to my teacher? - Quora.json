            "answer_text": "It really depends on what you want to say to your teacher. I\u2019d avoid saying anything in an email you wouldn\u2019t say to her face. If you are writing to thank her, then do so, but do it without getting effusive or flowery in your wording. If you are writing your email to complain about your grades or your treatment in her class, then do it in a calm, polite manner that gets your point across with a minimum of angry words. Make statements, not accusations. ",
