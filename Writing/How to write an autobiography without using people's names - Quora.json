            "answer_text": "You can use their names, especially if you\u2019re sure said people would be okay with you revealing their private matters. If that\u2019s not the case, you can use a fake name: \u201cI\u2019ll call him Chester,\u201d or just refer to the person in some other way than their actual name. It\u2019s okay to do that. If you have to change everyone\u2019s name due to sensational content or threat of lawsuits, then it would be better to fictionalize your story - write the brutal truth but change all names, places and other details that would give it away. If you fictionalize your story, chances are no one you\u2019re writing about will recognize themselves, as most people have little awareness of what they\u2019re really like. ",
