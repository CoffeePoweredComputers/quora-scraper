            "answer_text": "I think it depends on the author. Some surely know it and don\u2019t care, so long as they receive a royalty check. Others probably aren\u2019t aware they\u2019re bad writers and simply love what they\u2019re doing. As an editor, I\u2019ve received some truly trash books and there\u2019s only so much I can do to pull them up out of the mire. Some authors don\u2019t really care if what they\u2019re writing is crap, they know they can still publish it through Smashwords or Kindle. Price it at .99 cents and someone will buy it. Even if they don\u2019t finish it, it\u2019s only .99 cents so who\u2019s going to complain? This works, because tons and tons of people have that mindset, so the author is making a decent amount for crummy work, and that\u2019s fine with them. I have actually had a client tell me, when I informed her that there\u2019s a line between writing erotica and just describing explicit sexual acts, that her readers don\u2019t care about the content, they just want to read something that gets them going. As an author it can be frustrating to see the plethora of muck that comes out on a daily basis. On the other hand though, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that my first published book wasn\u2019t ready to be published, and nor was I at the tender age of 20. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing, my writing was still a bit childish, and I didn\u2019t understand the requirements of the publishing world. I know that book is not the best, though I stand by the story and will until I die. The story itself is golden. The mistakes I made were hard lessons learned and my subsequent books are much much better. It boils down to listening to editors, agents, publishers, and reviewers. As much as we hate to admit it, they do actually know what they\u2019re on about, and will only make you better as a writer. The people who don\u2019t listen are the people who don\u2019t care, and will continue to inundate the market with drivel. ",

(Unless if you\u2019re Robert Louis Stevenson. We don\u2019t talk about him.) We need refinement, our skills need to mature, and we figure that stuff out by working on our first project. It isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s hard work. I can only imagine that putting in that hard work helps people to assume that, because they\u2019re getting better, they\u2019re good. If you\u2019re writing a novel, keep writing it. Don\u2019t think about if you\u2019re good, don\u2019t think about your style - write, keep writing. Let it build, let it flow, let your confidence and research shape your story into a quality narrative. ",

But you don\u2019t specify what you mean by \u2018bad novel\u2019; badly written, superficial content? It has happened that some famous writer heavily criticised the newly published novel of another famous writer, as was the case for James Joyce\u2018s (famous) Ulysses when it came out. One such critic, which I shall not name, had said \u201cIt\u2019s rubbish\u2019, though s/he changed her/his opinion later.

I found this to be true with a lot of novels, but then there are some that I just do not get. When I read/listen to novels I list them on a spreadsheet, rate them 1 through 10 by narrator and story and then I rate them for myself as well on Amazon. I just finished listening to my seven hundred and third auto novel. There are some I wish I never wasted my time and others I wonder \u201cHow come no one made a movie about this yet?\u201d So I guess the answer is, It\u2019s all subjective. ",
