            "answer_text": "Dear anonymous . I'll be frank with you. I didn't read any books when I wanted to jump into freelancing, I just did. Joined few websites started bidding on projects. Of-course books can help if you want to work on your skills, but why go to books, go learn the hard way :P that could be fun too. You've mentioned engineering, so I understand the connection with books :D but say goodbye to them now. P.S. - if your question is more about resources (not books) and where to start - please let me know, I can suggest few things. ",
