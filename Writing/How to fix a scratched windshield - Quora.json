            "answer_text": "Hey Mike, thanks for the A2A ... There are kits made for polishing windshield glass. I'm assuming you're trying to get scratches removed from the wipers or maybe you used a scrubbing sponge on the glass to remove some sap ....whatever.  I've never used any of these kits. My fear is that I would've made things worse than better.  In polishing glass, especially windshield glass, you have to get the surface perfectly smooth and I don't think you're gonna do that with any of these kits. You may be able to remove the scratches and the glass may look good in the daylight ...but unless the surface is perfectly smooth headlight glare at night is gonna be a big issue. Add a bit of rain or mist and you may have a condition much worse than the isolated scratches you have now.  My advice is either live with the the scratches ...leaving well enough alone ...or just splurge for a new windshield. If the glass is scratched up enough to be noticeable and a visual hindrance then just get new glass. I recently replaced the windshield on my 2011 Subaru Forester (due to a rock crack) and it ran $420 (using Safelite Auto Glass). But this was a windshield with electrically heated sections for the wipers and one made in Japan by the OEM supplier ...your windshield may cost less.  ",

            "answer_text": "This depends on how deep the scratches are. For light scratches, Michael\u2019s answer is prime. His options work well for almost any type of light scratches in your glass, I would heed his answer! If your windshield has been neglected and the wipers have really worn into the glass, unfortunately the windshield may need to be replaced. Especially if you mistake an actual crack for a scratch or if there is a deep chip in any spot. These need to be either sealed or replaced as soon as possible as if water seeps in and freezes it can spread and crack your entire windshield. Honestly, I recommend that you figure out what windshield your car takes and you can normally find the actual glass for decently cheap on ebay. From there, if you do not have the tools or knowledge to replace the windshield yourself, local automotive mechanic schools are always looking for actual cars to work on. Take it to one of those and they can normally help you out for free! Hopefully you do not need to replace your windshield but it is good info to know just in case! If you just need to buff it out or use a compound, I recommend you have that on hand for the future as well so that if it happens again it doesn\u2019t get too bad to where you need to replace the windshield. Even if you get a chip, you will want to get some temporary seal kits so that it doesn\u2019t spread before you can have it fixed! Hope this helps. ",
