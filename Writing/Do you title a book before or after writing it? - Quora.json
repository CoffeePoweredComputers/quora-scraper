            "answer_text": "It depends on you writing style, and what your goal is. If you put the title before, you got yourself a fixed story, it means you have to be sure of what your story is and what it is focused on in a way that no matter where your story goes, it will always come back to the main idea behind the title. If you put the title after, you got a flexible story, it means you have an idea of what you want, but you don\u2019t know for certain where it\u2019ll go from there, your focus on the story varies, sometimes the focus will go to this character\u2019s development, and then it will focus on another character in a different place, never to come back to the first character that appeared in the story. Sometimes even the goal of the story will change. You delay the writing of the title so you have a proper title at the end of the book that covers a general idea of the goal or setting in your story. An example of fixed story: The Harry Potter Saga, by J.K Rolling. She goes wild in imagination with her magic universe, It ran for more than 5 books, and the main characters encounter many challenges, but the spotlight always goes back to Harry Potter, the hero of the story. An example of a fixed story with a flexible title: Twilight Saga. The title had nothing to do with the story (which focused in the relationship and environment surrounding the main characters), it just sounded cool. An example of flexible story: Wonder, by R.J Palacio. She hits the spotlight with a multi-perspective story that holds the attention of the reader in more ways than one, it has one main story to follow, yes; but she gives you many magnifiers, each that will make you read her story in ways you have not seen on the other magnifier. Additional Notes: A good book is bound to follow a good story. Being flexible or fixed doesn\u2019t change that fact. However, have in mind that being a flexible writer is much more difficult than being a fixed writer, since you don't really have a safe-place. This means that you don\u2019t have a guide to go back to in case you lose your way with plot twists, developements, character's deaths, etc., If your story goes south when you meant it to go North, you will probably end up deleting everything from the moment you started to go South, which sometimes can be pages.

            "answer_text": " A book title is, in my opinion, the ribbon or card for a gift. Yes, you can wrap a gift with a non-descript wrapper. But, without a ribbon or card on it, the gift just looks incomplete and unspecial. Besides, how are we going to know that the gift is for us, from whom it came from or if it is even a gift if there are no cards nor ribbons? I think it is the same about a book title. I once wrote a short story. I let (or rather, forced) my classmates read it so I can gain their honest opinion about it. Being a careless kid, I forgot to put a title. Do you know what they told me about the story? \u201cSo, what\u2019s the title?\u201d That was their first \u201copinion\u201d of my story. Therefore, it doesn't really matter if you have written a great piece. Readers always notice the title first, during and last. Now, let us go into the question! (Sorry for stalling. haha) Do you title a book before or after writing it? In my case, it depends on the...uhm...theme or idea I got. For example, I had this story about a vampire. I am...not going into deets. But, I did not write a title at first. I let the story go on until I finished the first scene. Then, I got inspired and titled it. Second, I once wrote a title after I had finished the story. So, mostly, I write my book title in my essay or story at the end or during the writing. If you ever need any help with writing, you can always check my bio! I hope I helped you. ",

Having just released a book the other day, I have a list of 4 titles on the to-do list, 1 of which potentially has 5 sequels, and another is potentially another series book 1, but not decided yet. I do occasionally change a title while writing, but not often. If the title isn\u2019t self evident 3/4 of the way through writing, I\u2019d say there is a problem. By then, the book should be focused enough for the title to be obvious to you. If you don\u2019t have a title by the time you finished the book, I\u2019d say something is very very wrong, and it will need a decent editor to sort out why you didn\u2019t get a title for it. There has to be something lacking. Blurbs are the same. It\u2019s very rare for me to not have the blurb down before the book is complete. After completion, if the blurb isn\u2019t in you head, the book is lacking in some way. ",

Every other time, the book\u2019s focus has changed, often dramatically as ideas have developed. The one time I knew what would happen was with a school project, one of many, when the idea was that a little girl, a brilliant cello player would in the last chapter, end up playing the Elgar Cello Concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under Vladimir Ashkenazy. In order to write it, I met with Ashkenazy, Principal Cello Katie Hewgill and Concert Master Dene Olding in the Green Room of the Sydney Opera House to ask their consent to being part of the story. This ended up like this:  But even then, the title wasn\u2019t settled until the book was finished. In most other works, I settled on a title anytime after about half way through the writing process.

According to me,title should have a relevant connection with the subject of your body,and sometimes even after writing 100 pages of your book,we feel confused what should actually be the suitable title.I feel the best solution for this is to take a temporary title in mind and proceed your writings and complete it first and then after go through your writings\u2026.you never no\u2026the appropriate title may be somewhere hidden behind the body of your writings. But in overall,I want to say one thing you might follow either of the choices,but try to give a title that can connect even the front,middle as well as the ending parts of your writing!! ",

You let the marketing people do whatever it is they do and you keep making the software. Eventually, the marketing people get told to bring it home because the software is going to be released and you join the two up. (Brochures are made, websites built, whatever\u2026) I give my work a title, I change it when I feel like it, when it is done, I might give it yet a new name. I don\u2019t marry the name. The name is just the project name for the book until we get down to the end. That way, I don\u2019t have to be stuck on something that doesn\u2019t fit. But I still get the benefit of working under a specific working title. I recommend this approach and if you do something like it you won\u2019t dig in your heels when a publisher suggests a different title. Or when you decide the original title is garbage. ",

Generally speaking, the title has to be over the top, and I have to have at least a very vague idea of what the story is about. Then I go from there. Long about 2002, I very quickly jotted down the titles of a series as they came to me. There were about 21 titles. Thus far I\u2019m on book 17 of that series, with the first 16 having achieved some success. There are a couple of titles that really stood out, and I believe that they have sold better than others because of their titles. One was The Devil To Pay, but the best of the lot was Longnecks And Twisted Hearts. So, title! I hope this helps. All the Best! ",

It is purely personal preference, I know some authors who don\u2019t title their story until they are ready to publish, while others spend ages thinking of a title before they start their first chapter. The only thing I would advise, is don\u2019t let your worries about having the perfect title, stop you from writing the book itself. If you really can\u2019t think of anything, finish your book, then share it with a few beta readers and ask them for an opinion on their title choices. Thank you for your A2A and good luck :) ",

This is often the case, and if you come up with a cool headline, you don't have to give it up. If you feel that the title fits your book, that it is what you want to write about, then you should not refuse and you can consider the title as a beacon. This is a fairly common situation and you can use it in your favor. Secondly, if you don't have a title yet, but have an idea, it's logical to start writing down the idea and only then come up with a title. In this case, you don't have to make up the title yourself, you can ask your friends to help you choose the title. As you can see, there is no clear recipe. But if the name of the book is not there yet, it is better to give it a draft title. ",
