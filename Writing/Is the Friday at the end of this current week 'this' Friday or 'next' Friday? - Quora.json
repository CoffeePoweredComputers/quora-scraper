            "answer_text": "\u201cThis\u201d Friday means the Friday at the end of this current week. \u201cNext\u201d Friday means the Friday at the end of the next week. There are \u201cother expressions\u201d which would not be helpful. To be accurate about ` which Friday` or any other day, just add the date eg. \u201cFriday 15th. Many native speakers get confused about \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cnext\u201d and so \u201c this coming Friday \u201c does seem to help. But I think the date helps more for people who are forgetful. And, writing it on a slip of paper may clarify things unless the slip of paper gets lost between this Friday and next Friday. ",

            "answer_text": "You could use either. This Friday might imply the closest in time, going forward. Next Friday is quite specific, meaning the next Friday to occur, so maybe the best choice. For a Friday that just passed, you could say last Friday, or Friday last. For one beyond the coming Friday, you could say (the, optional) Friday after next. This seems to be a confusion for even native speakers and a conversation trying to establish just which Friday is meant often goes back and forth and includes checking calendars and dates. ",

            "answer_text": "The terms can be a little ambiguous but in general\u2026 \u201cThis Friday\" generally always means the nearest Friday that is approaching, but not any previous Friday. \u201cNext Friday\u201d is a little less clear but it is usually taken to mean the Friday that is a week or more away. If said on a weekend, it typically means the Friday at the end of the coming week. If said in the middle of the week, it typically means the Friday of the following week. If said on a Monday, the interpretation really depends on the speaker. ",
