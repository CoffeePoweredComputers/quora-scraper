            "answer_text": " Image: Brendan Rile | CC BY 2.0 If you don\u2019t mind campy pulp fiction, read Mickey Spillane\u2019s Vengeance is Mine. Part of his Mike Hammer series, this book has Spillane\u2019s trademark machine-gun prose style and a surprise twist at the end that impressed my fourteen-year-old self. I won\u2019t reveal the plot, but there\u2019s this debauched private investigator who usually wakes up with a wicked hangover. He has a fifth of Irish whiskey in the bottom drawer of his desk, and gargles with it to clear his head. Mike Hammer smirks at his own mug in the mirror, saying devil-may-care things like, \u201cIt was a hell of a shame I wasn\u2019t handsome.\u201d Hammer has a raven-haired secretary named Velda\u2014she\u2019s a big girl with \u201cmillion-dollar legs\u201d and no last name\u2014and an office somewhere in Manhattan. He wears a hat and raincoat and has a license to pack the big fat .45 he\u2019s carried since his service in the Pacific Theater in World War II. Mike Hammer is big and tough and mean as a bear with a boil on its ass. He slaps, punches, kicks and head-butts his way through the streets and alleys of New York, dispatching bad guys with practiced panache. When he needs artillery support, that rod is in his fist. He never gets slide bite as he squeezes off rounds, gunning down hoods and commies alike. And when they go down, they stay down: those .45-caliber slugs make holes \u201cbig enough to poke your finger through.\u201d Hammer chain-smokes Luckies and flips the butts in rain puddles. He hangs out in bars and slouches in greasy spoon diners. And when he slaps a dime on the counter for a cup of joe, you know what that coffee tastes like. Mickey Spillane sold 200 million books in paperback. He never called the people who bought his books readers. Spillane called them customers, and gave them what they wanted. He wrote his first Mike Hammer novel (I, the Jury) in nine days. Vengeance is Mine was his third book in the series. No one I know reads him today. Renegade private eyes fell off the bestseller charts years ago. But Ayn Rand was a major Mike Hammer fan back in the 1950s, and wrote Spillane a number of fawning letters. Spillane\u2019s gritty fiction was crude, grotesquely over-the-top, misogynistic and politically incorrect. The man wrote like he had Joe McCarthy hissing in his ear about reds under the bed. The Russians were coming for sure. Prejudiced? Sure. He could offend you. On the other hand, Mike Hammer may sound quaint to readers unfazed by zombies and vampires on feeding frenzies. So who knows? He might even amuse you. ",

One reason I detested the film version  They completely ignored the whole \u2018raison d\u2019etre\u2019 of the film\u2026 Why? Because it\u2019s an American film - and the hero has always got to wear a white hat. ",
