            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, even though I don't know much about this topic. First, I've always been amazed by how little God talks to people in Scripture. If you count it up, outside of the Gospels it doesn't happen as much as you would think. With that in mind, the best starting point would be to replicate the context of people in the Old Testament who heard from God. Often, this experience happened to people when they were out in the wilderness,  separated from their regular lives and people. Therefore, I would suggest finding a really quiet place, and just wait. God won't come at command like a servant. No, you're going to have to wait on him. And you might be waiting for a long time. But that's okay. Learning how to wait will teach you how to be better in touch spiritually even if you don't receive divine revelation. ",

            "answer_text": "No matter you are a Christian or a Muslim the Scholars and specially the one close to God has always shown us the way how to talk to him or get near to him. For example, The second shia Imam after the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh),  Imam Hasan Ibn Ali was once asked by a person: What is the distance between Heaven and Earth. (As in how one can reach the kingdom of God). Imam replied: \"The cry of an oppressed person when he bows down for worship\". Even Jesus used to cry to his Lord and these are the teachings we get from the great personalities. The tears are your weapons against evil and takes you close to the creator. ",
