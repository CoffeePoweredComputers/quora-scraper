            "answer_text": "I met her son, who she said was the Pope. That works.    I met her son, whom she said was the person she most loves. That's a mistake.  I was trying to construct a correct sentence using \"whom,\" but I can't do it.    I met her son, whom she said she loves. That works.  but as long as your fragment as \"who she says was,\" then we have to have \"who\" rather than \"whom,\" because the pronoun is the subject (not the object) of the whatchamacallit.  \"Who was the Pope.\"  \"Who she said was the Pope.\"  \"Who was the principle suspect in the Lindbergh kidnapping case.\"   Whatever the missing part of your sentence turns out to be, the word \"who\" is the subject of whatever follows the comma.  Therefore, we use \"who\" instead of \"whom.\"   You could make the first example above more clearly correct by adding commas around \"she said\": I met her son, who, she said, was the Pope. And, of course, since English is shedding this pronoun case, we never have to say \"whom\" except when we're quoting John Donne's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\"  So, when in doubt, say \"who.\"   Also, if you want to be nice to future generations and people learning English as a second language, say \"who.\" ",

            "answer_text": "It should be \"who\" since \"who\" is the subject of \"was.\" If you dropped \"she said,\" you would get: \"I met her son, who was ....\" Clearly, in this version, \"whom was\" would be incorrect.  Another way to understand it is: \"She said he was ...,\" and \"he\" would then be replaced by \"who\"\u2014not \"whom.\" \"Whom\" can be used only if the son is the object in the clause. For example: I met her son, whom she said the police were harassing.In this sentence, the relative clause is constructed from the sentence: She said the police were harassing him (the son).Since \"him\" is the object in the clause and it is in the objective case, it would be appropriate to use \"whom\" (objective case of \"who\") when constructing the relative clause in the larger sentence.
