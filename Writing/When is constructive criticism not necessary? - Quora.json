            "answer_text": "When you understand that your constructive criticism is too late, and the other person really needs your encouragement. If the goal is important enough, the person will usually ask for your input. It might not be a direct ask, but it will be there if you listen. (When people are about to engage in a mission that will more likely than not be unsuccessful, I like to prepare them for the possibility, based on knowledge and experience. I do the same when people get their hopes up, against the odds. I try not to dash hopes, but I have to be honest when I believe the other person will be crushed by an outcome that is different to what was expected. Not sure if this is \u201cconstructive criticism,\u201d but the people I choose to tell, I know to some extent, and those who have listened are sometimes more prepared for reality.) ",

            "answer_text": "When there is no next time and you are sure the action can never be repeated, so there is no way that the person will need to know how to do it. Then, it is too late for constructive criticism. When a person understands their errors and takes the corrective action themselves, then constructive criticism is not necessary, because they already figured out what they were doing wrong. For me constructive criticism is the most welcome kind, because it helps me determine what can be done to prevent the error next time. However, most people seem unable to give it, either because they are unable to separate the person from the action, or their criticism is an emotional one based on how they felt the action affected them.
