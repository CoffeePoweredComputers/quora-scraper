            "answer_text": "To improve the clarity of what? For answering's sake, I'm going to assume you mean to improve the clarity of your writing. Already we're not off to the best start in that case. But regardless, here's the one most powerful tip you will ever come across in terms of improving writing clarity: Editing. Go back through all what you've written and edit it for clarity. Remove the fluff and distracting points. Make your sentences clear, punchy and to the point. Don't drag it out. The more dragged out it is, the more potential there is for it to lose clarity. Not sure where to start? Read this: http://boostblogtraffic.com/editing-tips/ To practice this, simply write something and continually edit it down for the sake of clarity. Eventually you'll need to edit far less. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "USE PARALLEL FORMS Parallelism in writing means expressing similar parts of a sentence in a consistent way. Elements alike in function should be alike in construction. Parallelism is an important element of style because it builds clarity and power. Note the following sentence in parallel form: \u201cIn the summer before college, I waited tables, sold magazines and even delivered pizzas.\u201d Now compare this with a nonparallel form: \u201cIn the summer before college, I was a waiter at a restaurant, pursued magazine sales and pizza delivery was my third job.\u201d Do you see how the parallel version reads more smoothly?  Now you try it: Rewrite the following sentence using parallel structure: \"All business students learn the basics of accounting, marketing fundamentals and how to do manufacturing.\" ",
