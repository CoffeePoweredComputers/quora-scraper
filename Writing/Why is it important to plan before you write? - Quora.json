            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s not important for everybody. There are many writers who are pantsers - they write what comes to their mind, without planning in advance. And they seem to do just fine. As for writers who are planners, it\u2019s important because some writers can get lost when writing unless they plan. They may not know what to write next and get stuck, or they may not like what they write when they just go with the flow. It also has a lot to do with the kind of story you\u2019re writing. Complex stories are a lot harder to write without planning. If you walk in a small village and just take turns in random, chances are you\u2019ll be fine by the end of the day. It\u2019s hard to get lost in a small, simple place. However, if you aimlessly walk around in a huge maze, you\u2019re going to get lost very quickly. And getting out of there is going to be a lot harder than if you had thought of a plan to get through it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well! It's not really necessary for every other person to plan everything before tracking down their thoughts. I know a few writters who writes what comes to their mind instantly. But sometimes, a poem or a story needs a bit structural planning that's it and there's no harm in it I guess. So better to be prepared in advance with a plan :p . Secondly, I get lost whenever I start writing :p . So basically, I do plan a bit before opting for \u2018poems' or \u2018stories\u2019. Last thing I wanna mention. (For those people who loves writing like me :\u2019D )  Is it addiction ? Haha. I don't know what you will call it up but all I can say, everyone out there has the ability to think but what's make a difference is how we put all thoughts in a sheet of paper. And for me ? It's those pages of my diary where my soul breathes. :\u2019) :\u2019D ",
