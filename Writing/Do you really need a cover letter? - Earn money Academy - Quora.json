            "answer_text": "I see I am bucking the trend here, but I have a different viewpoint. As an employer with limited time, I don\u2019t want a cover letter unless I ask for one. Recently, we received more than 130 resumes for a position. The job description was very clear and specific. I did not ask for a cover letter. About 15 people submitted one anyway. I didn\u2019t look at a single one. There were several no-kidding requirements in the job posting. Since we posted the opening on Indeed, we were able to require candidates to answer 5\u20136 questions to see if they met those requirements. Any candidate who did not meet any of those requirements was immediately ignored - we didn\u2019t even look at their resume. Resumes of those who did meet the requirements were reviewed further. If they had typos or terrible formatting, they were put in the NO pile. You may wonder why resumes with bad formatting were eliminated. Well, the position was for a Ux/Ui designer and if they cannot format their resume well, then they are not good candidates. Unlike others who answered this question, I don\u2019t need a cover letter to convince me that a candidate is worth interviewing. If there is some information about a job or experience or qualification that the candidate feels is worth sharing, that info should be on the resume. If it is too much detail, it should be saved for the interview. I\u2019m sure there are certain positions where you might want the candidate to wax poetic about their extra qualifications or interest in a position. But for most jobs where the employer may be reviewing hundreds of resumes, cover letters are unnecessary. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes! And they add more value than you may think to your candidate profile. Your cover letter is the perfect place to go into detail and really highlight not just what you know, but the capacity in which you have put specific skills to use and the specific accomplishments you have achieved throughout your career. I like to think of a resume as a sales pitch in which you are showing your experiences in a concise manner. However, try to think of your cover letter as the actual presentation. You are allowed to go into more detail and really show the recruiter that you know what you are talking about and that you aren\u2019t just inserting words on a resume. Lastly, you want to convey your message as to why you are interested in this job. What is it about the company that speaks to you. By taking the time to simply write a tailored cover letter is going to speak volumes to the Hiring Manager because it shows you took the initiative and care. Even if they decide to just glance at it and not read it in its entirely, I can promise you that 90% of the time your profile is going to stand out more from someone who simply doesn't put in the effort.

            "answer_text": "Unless you are willing to rely on your resume to communicate what you know about the business and industry to which you are applying, and to show what you might be able to contribute to the organization, skip the cover letter. Some letters are never read. Some are used to open a window onto your interests and abilities. The best letter I ever wrote was for a job that I had never done before. The letter began: In case it is not clear why a lawyer, car sales person, and headhunter for lawyers should be your next [law school] Career Services Director, here are the four constituencies of the office, some of their primary problems, and a few of my recommendations. Good luck. ",
