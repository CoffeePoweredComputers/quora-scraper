            "answer_text": "There is no set rule or even a guideline. Write what you have time for. If you can only write one page a day, and do so, in one year you\u2019ll have a 365-page novel ready for you to review, edit, proofread, and work on a lot more. Since you\u2019re more likely to write 10 or 20 or more pages a day, it won\u2019t take you nearly as long. Go by the old rule of thumb, 250 words per double-spaced page. Your computer will give you a different word-count, but that\u2019s okay\u2014it\u2019s all just a \u201cguestimate\u201d unless you sit down and count each word including \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d and if you have time to do that, you\u2019re not living your life to its fullest. If you can only devote one hour of your day to writing your novel, that\u2019s okay too. It\u2019s your book, your project, and you\u2019re the only one making the rules. Write for yourself, to please yourself, to take delight in watching the words cover the page, in feeling the excitement of the way your expressions and dialogue blossom in your mind and flood out onto your page. It\u2019s not a chore. it\u2019s not something you must do in order to prove something to someone else. If it\u2019s not what you\u2019re doing to give yourself the satisfaction of eventually sitting back, looking at the stack of pages, or number of megabytes in the file, it\u2019s not worth doing. The days of the lonely, tortured scribe sitting on a hard bench in a cold attic struggling to create the most erudite or elegant work ever written are way, way in the past. No one wants you to suffer. No one will believe you if you claim you do. Nowadays, people will just shrug and say, \u201cIf it\u2019s such a pain, why do it?\u201d You\u2019re the only one who can drive you to write. When eventually you can type the words THE END, having finally finished the race, and experience that \u201cdamn, I\u2019m good!\u201d feeling, you\u2019ll know it was all worth it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you set out to write a novel I think you have to adopt a disciplined approach, I don\u2019t want to suggest you should flagellate yourself, or punish yourself for not working here, no I simply mean it is useful to be stern with yourself and set a target quantity of work to complete daily; this has worked for me in the past, writing essays, articles and similar pieces so I believe what I am saying. A novel is made up of Chapters, and each chapter is divided into pages, sections, paragraphs and sentences. From the incremental addition of these on a daily basis we can reach that happy day when we have completed a large volume of work; then the real fun begins with revision and editing! I have always found it useful to adopt that very scientific method of \u2018Chunking things down\u2019. This expression refers to the process of refining your task into discrete parts. Planning out to some extent, once you have begun to visualise your novel it is useful to consider the whole as being made up of distinct parts, and to approach each part with focus; as you build each part this will also inform the next one. If we can set aside the macro objective, and really zoom-in on the part we are currently working on, this will give us a more structured way of working; otherwise we will lose momentum and begin to fret about not arriving quickly enough at the finish line! All I really mean by this chunking down is to concentrate on the incremental developments, to think in terms of each element separately, so that we can more effectively deal with the scale of our creation. If we are always thinking about our novel in its full entire form it will become diminished, exhausted before we can get there. I have read that many of the really productive, prolific novelists set themselves a minimum word count for each work period. My own inclination is to simply let rip, and pour out the words as they appear in my mind; stopping whenever I feel like it. Alas! This creative, undisciplined approach simply will not allow us to achieve very much, and we can give way to our lazy, indulgent tendencies all too easily. Because I know I am moody, somewhat disinclined to work at times, I also know I have to be my own tyrant! This is hard work, we are expending all kinds of energy. So, yes 1,000 words per day is a good number, you can break this down further to 500 in a morning session, break for lunch and settle in to a further 500 for the second session. Something like that, of course we can break it up however we wish. Incremental is one of my favorite words, very large projects are achieved via much smaller increments of work. It is definitely a good idea to become strict with yourself, and force yourself to work to a structured metered word target. In two weeks that is at least 14,000 words, 28,000 per month. Your novel* will be finished before you know what has happened. *Or whatever project you have with writing. You don\u2019t have to make it 1,000 words, 500 is also a good number, the important part is the regular production schedule. ",
