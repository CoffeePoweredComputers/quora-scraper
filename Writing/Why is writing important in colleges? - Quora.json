            "answer_text": "Writing is medium through which you can convey ideas to people without needing to meet them face to face. College presents many situations where you may need to know how to convey your ideas effectively. It will also be an important skill throughout your life, and ideally college should help prepare you for life in general. My major has nothing to do with writing, I\u2019m in engineering, but here are a few ways writing has been useful and may be useful in the future for me: -Writing emails to professors asking to be involved in research/asking for letters of recomendation -Writing Resumes/Cover Letters -Writing up reserch proposals -Writing Reserch Articles (like the kind that you might find in a peer reviewed journal) -Many many other random miscelanious resons, such as a guest post for the school newspaper, writing answers on Quora, helping write an Eulogy, ect. These are just a few examples, but no matter what direction you take in life, at some point someone is going to want you to write, and so colleges want to make sure that you\u2019re prepared when they do.

            "answer_text": "Writing is very important in college because you have to be able to communicate well in reports, speeches, papers in the work force. Two of the biggest subjects that high schools students across the nation need remedial work in when they go to college are math and reading/writing. Many years ago an engineering professor wrote an article about an exam where he had to do a lot of writing on a paper/report when he exited college. According to the English grad student that graded the paper, the engineering prof, when he was young, didn't write the report very well but he did pass. The engineer said that he, the engineer, didn't think that it was a big deal but he eventually found out that he was dead wrong because he spent 50% or more of his time writing letters, reports, speeches, etc in regard to the work he did. This is something for all students to be aware of. ",
