            "answer_text": "Not allowing women to walk around top-less. As a female, I have NO intention of going topless, to the beach or the park or to walk my dog. But men do it all the time. Women should not be placed in harms way, because (generally) women are smaller, shorter and have less muscle-mass than men. Things like; Firefighters, Police Officers, anything Military related, these jobs require upper-body strength, and greater muscle-mass, all it takes is one direct hit and the female Police Office goes down. NOTE: My point being, female Police Officers should always have a male Police Officer with her at all times. I am not saying we shouldn\u2019t have female Police Officers, I think we should have MORE female Police Officers but the fact remains that women are smaller & weaker, men are bigger & stronger. There are different rules in place for sports. Men\u2019s & women\u2019s rules for any sport (I\u2019m not going to name them all) are different based on male & female abilities. I think this is correct. Cheers, Happy December 1st ! ",
