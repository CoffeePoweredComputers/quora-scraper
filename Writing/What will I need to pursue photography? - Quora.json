            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat will I need to pursue photography?\u201d I am taking the liberty of making couple of assumptions here, You want to pursue photography as hobbyYou donot have any detailed information of photography (clicking pics with mobile doesn't count)You donot have advanced gear for photography. [again mobile phone doesn't count].In this case you have to start with a camera. I would really suggest to go for a low price used DSLR / or advanced point and shoot where you do-not have to spend a lot of money and you could easily sell / pass it on to someone else who is interested in pursuing photography. There are many choices for DLSR and if you are looking in the low budget range, there is not much that can go wrong. I am not mentioning prices here as i am not aware of your geography and donot want to under / over sell you on the prices. Same goes for point and shoots where some advanced ones come with manual mode which allows you to manipulate iSO / Shutter /Aperture. You can even use your phone, the only constraint being it will not allow you to change aperture which is one of the top reasons for buying a camera. Once you have the gear, find out a tutorial for the specific camera and try out all the features of your camera. You should be aware of what your camera can and cannot do to make most out of it. You might also need some image editing software , Lightroom and Capture One are preferred ones but you can also look for free alternatives like VSCO and Snapseed. Editing images is heavily underrated and misunderstood. its not just applying filters. There is a lot to do to make the best out of what you have captured. And the most important aspect is the passion. Make sure you click at least one picture daily. It could be epic of something from your daily routine, like coffee or book or anything. the subject doesn't matter. it helps you to start getting a perspective of what / how / when to click. Check out for instagram / flickr (i am oldschool) accounts of people who have a pic a day kind of albums. You will definitely be inspired. Best Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are planning to pursue photography full-time and are surrounded with people that rather have you drop your dreams than support you through an unprecedented artistic path which could totally ruin you but can as well make you popular, then you will need an unwavering belief in your passion, and abilities. I am passionate about photography too, but I chose to sideline it. This is not because I lack belief in my photography but for the fact that I can\u2019t imagine monetizing my photography- it would ruin the art for me. Anyway, I believe, photography as an art is quite lucid. And even if you are still an amateur, you can learn pretty quickly. Photographers range from gear-heads whose technical knowledge exceeds their artistic ability, to \u201cartists\u201d whose interest in camera mechanics is minimal. Photography draws on both sides of our brains- the logical left and the intuitive right. The logical side helps operate the camera mechanism; the intuitive side helps direct the content, composition, and emotional intent of the picture. What the photographer sees is as important as what the camera sees. Experienced photographers know that the mechanical side needs to become almost reflexive to allow the artistic side to produce well-exposed photos. Moreover, I did suggest you learn how to edit photos in Adobe Photoshop. ",
