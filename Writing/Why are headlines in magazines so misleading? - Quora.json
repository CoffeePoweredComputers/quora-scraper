            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure exactly what you mean, but often the headlines in magazines (as opposed to newspapers) are intended to intrigue you and to be witty, rather than to inform. So, for example, a magazine feature about topsoil erosion might well be headlined GONE WITH THE WIND even though it\u2019s not about the movie of that name. It\u2019s literally true, the article is about something that is gone as a result of wind, but the real intention is to raise a smile. By contrast, an article on the same subject in a newspaper would likely have a much more descriptive headline: FARMERS FEAR FURTHER SOIL LOSS IN SEASON OF HIGH WINDS As a result of this difference, the magazine headline will probably be followed by a sentence or paragraph in large type - smaller than the headline, but much larger than the article text itself - which explains, more straightforwardly, what the article\u2019s about. (Journalists sometimes call this a \u201ckicker\u201d, \u201cintro\u201d or \u201cstandfirst\u201d.) The newspaper article doesn\u2019t necessarily need that, because the headline has already done that job of explaining. Incidentally, there\u2019s another reason for headlines, both in newspapers and in magazines. Quite simply, they tell you where a new article starts - and for that purpose, what they say doesn\u2019t even matter. This is particularly true in magazines. You turn the page and you\u2019re confronted by four or five words in huge text. You immediately know that this is the beginning of the next article, even before you\u2019ve read what those words are - let alone made sense of them. ",
