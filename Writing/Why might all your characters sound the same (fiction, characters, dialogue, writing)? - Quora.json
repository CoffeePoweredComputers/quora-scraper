If you\u2019ve got a good understanding of the character, can get in their head, then they should take on a voice of their own. Writing a character is a bit like acting, you are writing what they would say the way they would say it, rather than you. Without that, there\u2019s only one person for them all to sound like: the author. Writers in all fields often comment on how their characters say things they, the author, would never think to say. When this can happen to you, this problem will disappear. A strongly fleshed out character will practically force you to do it their way, they tend to take on a life of their own. It\u2019s a bit like being possessed. And with that cheerful thought, godspeed :) ",

Take the peoples in your life as the prototype of your characters. The more people you meet, the more characters you can write. 2.Imagnation. Find the key features of characters and what experience makes them get the features. Try to imagine you have the same experience as your characters and how you will act and talk. ",
