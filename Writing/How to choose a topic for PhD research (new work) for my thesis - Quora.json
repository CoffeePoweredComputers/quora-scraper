            "answer_text": "It depends on a bunch of different variables, and I am not certain what is your area, or whether or not you are already in grad school. I will assume you are not yet there, but thinking ahead. Also, As Robert Bronsing implied, there are many situations where you just don\u2019t. This is specially true in the most applied part of STEM, mainly because you need access to certain hardware and supplies that cost quite a bit of money, and the funding institutions are not going to give it willy nilly to someone who, academically speaking, is in diapers. Usually in these cases, you are accepted within a specific lab, and the lab director, who is usually everyone\u2019s adviser, assigns you the problem you are going to work in. As research is some times unpredictable, maybe you would need to adjust your objective later on, but you are a bit more restricted on the scope. Also, even if your research does not necessarily depends on access to a million dollar machine, or the use of a ten grand set of reagents, there are many institutions that require you to be admitted by a specific professor. Then either your advisor will choose the topic, or you choose within your advisor\u2019s areas of expertise and set of interests, a topic she can help you with. If that is the case, I would consider you read all her publications of the last, say, five years at least (if this is your situation, you should have done this even before applying), and maybe read a few of the papers who she cites, or who cite her. Now, there are other situations where you have a lot of freedom to pick your own adviser within the department. For example, that was my case. I knew I wanted to work in an area of mathematics applied to the processing and exchange of digital data. My original plan was to work on something related to cryptography, and thus, I was thinking of going towards number theory. But I found a few interesting problems on Analog to Digital Conversion, that are more on the analysis part of math. If you are not in this area, this might not make too much sense, but within math, number theory and harmonic analysis are very different areas, and I was not working anywhere close to the intersection. If the last paragraph does describe your situation, then my suggestion is the following: During your first year of grad school, or until you find your adviser, go to every single talk in your department, or skip only those in particular subareas you know you are not really interested. If you click with one of the topics, read a few papers about it (same as before, the paper of the talk, and then papers cited in or citing such paper). Once you have done this for a few topics, you will start figuring out what you like, and you could go to the particular professor who works that particular area. If they are willing to take you as their student, then, Yahtzee!. Also, if you did your homework well, then you might even be able to suggest the particular problem yourself. But be prepared to be told that you are being overly ambitious. Sometimes we think we can solve this huge problem in a few months, but even solving half of it might take years. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you really supposed to come up with your own topic? Where I am from you actually apply to a position where the advisor has already gotten a grant for the research and the PhD student does the work. Because as an outsider in a certain field, it is very difficult to come up with original work yourself as you need quite a bit of knowledge to do that. That said, without knowing what field you\u2019re in, you could search the literature for a specific problem and see if you can use the papers you find to think of a different approach to that topic. For example, if you find that reflex modulation in humans is interesting, you could do a study in rats. But as I said, you need a good overview of the literature first. ",
