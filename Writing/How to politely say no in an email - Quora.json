            "answer_text": "Try to keep it honest but if you can, pay them a lot of compliments, like what a great idea or how good of them to try and work on this problem. Tell them how much you\u2019d love to be able to help them with such a fantastic cause. Make them feel good. Then you can say that regrettably you can\u2019t fit this into your busy schedule, or your focus is elsewhere at the moment or even that you just don\u2019t get involved in [subject] as a rule. You don\u2019t have to explicitly say why you\u2019re saying no. You can also say that it\u2019s \u2018no for now\u2019, and that you might reconsider in future - give them a time when they could try you again if this is realistic. As a bonus, suggest someone else who can help instead of you (especially if you know that person will actually help). Wish them luck if it feels right, and if possible suggest your availability in a smaller way if you think that might be useful. ",
