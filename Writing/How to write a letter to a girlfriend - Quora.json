It happens when your feelings are overwhelming you and that person is not around.When I was in love, there was a time I missed him terribly. I took a paper and scribbled whatever that came to my mind about how innocent his eyes looked when he sees puppies, how his eyelashes are the most perfect curls, how the way he gives me a wink makes my heart stop a beat, what he means to me and how I miss him when he is not around. A letter is a reflection of your heart and feelings.The moment You feel like telling your love something just start writing. Let the words flow with the fluidity of your emotions.Tell her things that she thinks you miss, but you take note of. Tell her something about her that you noticed and she doesn't have an idea about. The moment you start writing, it should not focus on words, language or grammar. It is just the heart telling another heart how its beats are synchronized. ",
