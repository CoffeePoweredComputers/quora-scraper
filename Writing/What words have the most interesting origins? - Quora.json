            "answer_text": "I think two very interesting and related words are lord and lady. Have you ever wondered that these two fancy words, beginning with an \u201cl\u201d, must\u2019ve been connected? Or even wondered that, deep down in their roots, they have to do with simply eating bread? For that\u2019s what being a lord and a lady meant in Old English with the underlying meaning of \u201cmasters of the household, rulers of a fiefdom, husband and wife of a landowner family\u201d. A lord was your hlafweard, your \u201cguardian of the bread\u201d: hlaf \u201cloaf\u201d + weard \u201cguardian, keeper, ward\u201d. Correspondingly, his wife and your milady was your hlafdige, the \u201cmaid of the bread\u201d or, going even further back in the etymology of this expression (dige < daege), the \u201cmaker of bread dough\u201d. What the origins of these two sophisticated, high-status words indicate is a much more rural and simpler way of life back when the Anglo-Saxons still lived in world where being the landowner and, consequently, the owner and guardian of food storehouses was the very definition of power and wealth. It also suggests the tremendous relevance of bread and, more broadly, the wheat and barley from which it was made for the poorer population. Germanic tribes were originally, way waaay back, mostly pastoralists with an economy very rich in dairy products and meat. However, as they improved their agriculture techniques and increased their population a lot, cereals, much more productive and able to feed a larger population with less resources, became the staple food especially among the poors, the servants.  So chic and ladylike, isn\u2019t it? lol Meat and dairy was increasingly a luxury regularly consumed only by the elite - the same elite that, while they ate pork and beef, made dough and then distributed bread to their servants and their clients dependant on their household and farm. So, next time you casually see Duchess Kate Middleton or Prince Charles, remember that, as their subjects, you can demand that your milady make bread to you and your milord keep it safe\u2026 or, if they\u2019ve run out of bread, pull a Marie Antoinette and demand your due brioches - \u201clet them eat cake\u201d. ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "What words have the most interesting origins? Whether you\u2019re a native speaker or currently learning English, you\u2019ll be amazed at some of the stories behind words you use every day. From tales of frenzied Viking warriors to a theatre-owner\u2019s bet to get people using a made-up word, a little-thought-about history lies waiting to be discovered. Knowing more about the words we use makes studying English even more fun, so here are some of our favourite word origins \u2013 and we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface! Quiz The story behind the origins of the word \u201cquiz\u201d is so good that we really wish it was true \u2013 but it probably isn\u2019t. Legend has it that a Dublin theatre-owner made a bet that he could introduce a new word into the English language within a day or two (the amount of time differs in different tellings of the story), and that the people of Dublin would make up the meaning of the word themselves. So he wrote the nonsense word \u201cquiz\u201d on some pieces of paper and got a gang of street urchins to write it on walls across Dublin. The next day everyone was talking about it, and it wasn\u2019t long before it became incorporated into everyday language, meaning a sort of \u201ctest\u201d, because this is what the people thought the mysterious word was supposed to be. According to the telling of the story recorded in Gleanings and Reminiscences by F.T. Porter (written in 1875), the events of this humorous tale unfolded in 1791, and this is where the story becomes less convincing. The word \u201cquiz\u201d is attested earlier than this date, used to refer to someone who is eccentric or odd (hence the word \u201cquizzical\u201d); it was also the name of a yo-yo-like toy popular in 1790. That said, it\u2019s still difficult to find a compelling explanation for the origins of this word, so perhaps there is an element of truth in this excellent story after all. Nightmare It sounds as though it refers to a female horse, but in fact the \u201cmare\u201d part of the word \u201cnightmare\u201d (a terrifying dream) comes from Germanic folklore, in which a \u201cmare\u201d is an evil female spirit or goblin that sits upon a sleeper\u2019s chest, suffocating them and/or giving them bad dreams. The same Germanic word \u2013 \u201cmar\u014dn\u201d \u2013 gives rise to similar words in many Scandinavian and European languages. Interestingly, in Germanic folklore, it was believed that this \u201cmare\u201d did more than just terrorise human sleepers. It was thought that it rode horses in the night, leaving them sweaty and exhausted next day, and it even wreaked havoc with trees, twisting their branches. Sandwich  The nation\u2019s favourite lunchtime snack gets its name from the 4th Earl of Sandwich, John Montagu. The story goes that 250 years ago, the 18th-century aristocrat requested that his valet bring him beef served between two slices of bread. He was fond of eating this meal whilst playing card games, as it meant that his hands wouldn\u2019t get greasy from the meat and thus spoil the cards. Observing him, Montagu\u2019s friends began asking for \u201cthe same as Sandwich\u201d, and so the sandwich was born. Though people did eat bread with foods such as cheese and meat before this, these meals were known as \u201cbread and cheese\u201d or \u201cbread and meat\u201d. The sandwich is now the ultimate convenience food. Clue Who knew that the word \u201cclue\u201d derives from Greek mythology? It comes from the word \u201cclew\u201d, meaning a ball of yarn. In Greek mythology, Ariadne gives Theseus a ball of yarn to help him find his way out of the Minotaur\u2019s labyrinth. Because of this, the word \u201cclew\u201d came to mean something that points the way. Appropriately enough, Theseus unravelled the yarn behind him as he went into the maze, so that he could work his way back out in reverse. Thus the word \u201cclew\u201d can be understood in this context and in the context of a detective working his way backwards to solve a crime using \u201cclues\u201d. The word gained its modern-day spelling in the 15th century, a time when spelling was rather more fluid than it is today. Hazard  Our word for danger or risk is thought to have its origins in 13th-century Arabic, in which the word \u201cal-zahr\u201d referred to the dice used in various gambling games. There was a big element of risk inherent in these games, not just from the gambling itself but from the danger of dishonest folk using weighted dice. Thus the connotations of peril associated with the word, which got back to Britain because the Crusaders learnt the dice games whilst on campaign in the Holy Land. Palace  The word \u201cpalace\u201d is another English word with origins in Rome. It comes from one of Rome\u2019s famous \u2018Seven Hills\u2019, the Palatine, upon which the Emperor resided in what grew into a sprawling and opulent home. In Latin, the Palatine Hill was called the \u201cPalatium\u201d, and the word \u201cPalatine\u201d came to refer to the Emperor\u2019s residence, rather than the actual hill. The word has reached us via Old French, in which the word \u201cpalais\u201d referred to the Palatine Hill. You can see the word \u201cPalatine\u201d more easily in the form \u201cpalatial\u201d, meaning palace like in size. Genuine The word \u201cgenuine\u201d comes from the Latin word \u201cgenuinus\u201d, meaning \u201cinnate\u201d, \u201cnative\u201d or \u201cnatural\u201d, itself derived, somewhat surprisingly, from the Latin word \u201cgenu\u201d, meaning \u201cknee\u201d. This unlikely origin arises from a Roman custom in which a father would place a newborn child on his knee in order to acknowledge his paternity of the child. This practice also gave rise to an association with the word \u201cgenus\u201d, meaning \u201crace\u201d or \u201cbirth\u201d. In the 16th century the word \u201cgenuine\u201d meant \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cproper\u201d, and these days we use it to mean \u201cauthentic\u201d. Ketchup  It\u2019s hard to believe that this British and American staple started life in 17th-century China as a sauce of pickled fish and spices. Known in the Chinese Amoy dialect as k\u00f4e-chiap or k\u00ea-chiap, its popularity spread to what is now Singapore and Malaysia in the early 18th century, where it was encountered by British explorers. In Indonesian-Malaysian the sauce was called \u201ckecap\u201d, the pronunciation of which, \u201ckay-chap\u201d, explains where we got the word \u201cketchup\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the 19th century that tomato ketchup was invented, however; people used to think that tomatoes were poisonous, and the sauce didn\u2019t catch on in America until later that century. One couldn\u2019t imagine chips or burgers without it now! Thanks for reading. source : www.oxford-royale.co.uk ",
