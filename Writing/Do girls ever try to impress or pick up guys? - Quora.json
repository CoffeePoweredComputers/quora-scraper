            "answer_text": "Putting aside the time and money girls put into their appearance.. which is for a combination of men, other women, and themselves, girls often will make an advances towards a guy they are interested in. Not every girl, just like not every guy will. But.. society is sooo vastly different for each sex, that a number of things are standing in the way here affecting people's behavior, beliefs, and perceptions revolving around this subject: Traditionally girls were expected to wait for men's advances. And we're talking like.. for your parents & grandparents, not centuries ago. It was unbecoming for women to approach a man. It made her look bad/desperate/slutty and made the man feel less manly. A little further back it was downright scandalous for a woman to be date a man without supervision and/or the man requesting permission from the father to take the woman out.Women are raised to be polite, especially with men (explained next) which is why reasons like \"I don't want to jeopardize our friendship\" are given. What she means is, \"I don't think about you that way, but I don't want to hurt you.\" You know when you're interested in a girl and when you are not, so does she. It's not like you stood a chance and then got friendzoned after spending too much time being nice to her, you were never in the running in this scenario. But she doesn't want to upset you.About being polite to men: Women are taught to .. fear men, in a way (more importantly, in a necessary way). Let me explain... Ask a room full of women if they've ever just been followed by a man on the street or in a store.. probably a large majority will raise their hand. Ask a room full of women if they were advised to never walk alone at night, if they keep pepper spray on them, if they vary their running routine to lower their risk of being jumped and raped by a man who has noticed them and learned their routine, or if they've had random groups of men yell out come-ons at them just walking down the street... At least one of these applies to every single woman I know, all of them apply to me. The world is vastly different for women than it is for you. We know not every man is a threat but we are raised to keep an eye out to protect ourselves.. and many use politeness when trying to remove themselves from situations that could be threatening (turning down a guy quite often results in being referred to as a bitch or a lesbian or being stuck up or.. lazy friendzoners, for instance ..). We can't seem to just politely turn someone down, we have to be called out for it and shamed like we did something wrong by not being attracted to someone.In general girls act nice and polite and it is often misconstrued by men as flirting. I'm not saying every situation is like this, or it's never really flirting, but many girls who appear flirty are probably not really being flirty, they're just being girls... I don't know how to explain this one any better. Guys flirt with intent, girls are just \"flirty\" by nature. But when it's done with intention (and it certainly often is) you should be able to catch the difference. But many women are not that blunt about it for fear of appearing \"easy\" or \"slutty\" also from being taught that men prefer a chase.It's all rather complicated and diluted. The gist of it all is that women do try, and \"friendzoning\" isn't really a thing the way you picture it. She's either attracted to you or she's not. If she is then becoming friends with her only adds to your level of attraction, it doesn't subtract from it making you \"just a friend.\"  **also, I'm not saying that a relationship can't start off with one or both people seemingly unattracted to the other and then attraction comes over time.. but this rare occurrence is like the opposite of friendzoning.. and, again, rare. And can only come through time and zero pressure from either party forcing the message: give a relationship with me a try - or whatever it is you think girls should do instead of honestly turning you down. Think about if a girl you were friends with liked you and asked you out, but you felt nothing for her romantically or physically, would you date her if she asked? I would hope not, no one would benefit from that. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course they do. They dress attractively,do their hair, wear perfume, and whatever else they think will attract men. This is not the only reason, of course, any more than a guy gets buffed only to attract women. Women also like other women to think they look nice, and they like to see themselves looking good as well.   A girl may spend a Saturday home in her p.j.s or in old sweats or jeans that are too big and have bleach stains, but in the evening she will get all dressed up, makeup and hair, and go off to a club or a party. When a guy she likes asks her to dance or buys her a drink, she feels great! Nowadays, women will often make the first move, buy a drink, ask him to dance, and it's fairly common for women to split the dinner bill or to pay for tickets to a play or concert.  You say that women sit like an idol and lazily friendzone guys - sure, some guys are friends, you can't fall for everyone, and having friends of both sexes is normal and fun. If you ask a girl out and pay for dinner and she thinks of you as a friend, next time you go out,  ask her to split the bill. Tell her you're glad you're her friend, she'll be really pleased.  It seems to me that you need to be a little more realistic. Not every girl you buy a dinner for is going to fall in love with you. In this modern society it's common for women and men to be friends - be grateful for all the friends you have.  Try to be a little less anxious about the whole thing. It's supposed to be fun to date, to get to know people. If you're more relaxed and can think of a woman as a person, not a whole separate species, you'll more quickly find one who sees you as special, and then  you won't have to be a lonely misogynist. Wishing you more fun in the future, and thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "Sure we do, but we need to be subtle about it. If a woman advertises that she is looking for a partner, she'll often be labelled tramp, slut, ho etc. Wheras a guy gets called a stud, legend etc.That then leads to rape culture, where the woman is blamed for any ills that then befall her - her clothing was too skimpy! She wanted it really, if she didn't want it, why didn't she fight back? I'll admit that I never wear makeup, it's very rare that I'll dress up. But I never needed to, as I ended up with my boyfriend by virtue of spending time with him. We went on roadtrips together, hung out on our days off, we worked together soon would see each other on a daily basis, which meant we got to know each other in a non rushed manner. The problem with your question is more of a societal one. Guys feel they need to go all out to impress a girlfriend, shower them with gifts, buy expensive things, when really, I would love a cheap dinner of fish and chips watching the sunset. (Cliche I know). Or go for a walk in a forest or go to the swimming pool together. Picnics at the botanic gardens. Unfortunately guys feel they need to keep raising the bar, which adds an air of desperation, when really, as a women, I think we need to be treated as people. Make friends with us first, then take things from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Pareto principle: in a given system, 20% of the input is responsible for 80% of the output. Applying that in man-woman attraction principles: only 20% of men trigger attraction on 80% of women. In fact, I would argue it's even more aggressive, I would put 10%-90%. Your reasoning is correct, but it comes from the simple fact that you are on the 90% remaining men who don't trigger strong emotional signs on women. Women don't consider you precious and, therefore, don't care much about you. The thing is: most women already have one man in her mind, and she does work hard to get his attention.  Yes, they may hook up with others, but will only try to be noticed by a exceptionally low fraction of men. Wanna drive a woman going crazy from sexual attraction? Show her this guy:    \"Oh, that's unfair, I am not Daniel Craig!\" Sure, you're not. But you can work on your skills and presentation to raise attraction levels (tons and tons of material out there). But it will take time and practice. The big question is: are you willing to work at improving these skills for years to become more attractive to women? ",

            "answer_text": "The social dynamics of traditional courtship make it more likely that men try to court women than vice versa. Evolution has a huge part to play too - everything from the peacocks tail to the bull elephants overgrown tusks is an ornament the male developed to seduce the female and prove that his genes were worthy of being included in her child.  In western and westernized societies the classical patriarchal view of women needing to be courted is reducing, so given a comfortable situation and non-sexist society, it is very well likely for women to impress a guy. For this to universally happen, you need to wait another couple of decades yet. The evolutionary behavior traits are not likely to be erased in such a short time of civilization though, so don't hold your breath. ",

There are a number of reasons for this: I look women in the eyes.I do not hit on every woman I meet.I do not pursue women.  That is not to say that I do not show interest, but I do not try to convince women to \"go out\" with me.  I did that for a short while when I first went to college, and it got me absolutely nowhere.I learned how to flirt.   I learned to do so in a way that makes it safe for a woman to take the next step.Despite all of this, almost none of my relationships have come from this activity.  Mostly, my relationships came out of social situations where we had a mutual interest. Here is a clue.  If you think a woman is a \"piece of ass,\" most women sense that, and they will stay away from you, unless you have some other feature that interests them, and in that case, she is most likely looking for something short term. If you are trying to buy women, just be honest about it, go to Vegas and hire a hooker.  You will be happier. ",

            "answer_text": "If they do, they risk being called sluts. Or accidentally getting a stalker, or worse yet, a rapist who will say that \"she was asking for it.\" The power differential requires that women be very careful about this. And most of them already get more unwanted attention than they can stomach anyway.  Being a man trying to get the attention of a woman is a little like being a white cop trying to earn the trust of the black community in Alabama. The behavior of your brethren has made them suspicious of you. This may not be your fault, but you need to be aware of the reality of it and compensate accordingly. ",

Now a day women are treated as equals and it's perfectly fine for a woman to hit on a man, heck as a mildly shy guy I encourage it. Also I've had quite a few girls demand to pay for there own food and meals, your using some outdated stereotypes that still apply to some women but not all. ",

She brings hours of preparation to the table; shopping for clothes, obsessing about her weight, makeup to look pretty, practicing how she walks and talks while trying not to think about if he is going to think her smile makes her look like she has horse teeth...

If you make it to dinner with her that means you passed the initial interview. Of all the guys that were interested, she picked you.  Your turn. ",
