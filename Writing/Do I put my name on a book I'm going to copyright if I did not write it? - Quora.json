            "answer_text": "You are asking a whole bunch of questions on one sentence. I find this is common when someone who has no expertise in a field wants to ask a specific question, but doesn\u2019t know enough about the field to phrase that question. Or they have a whole bunch of groundwork they need built for them in order for their question to ever make sense to them. First of all, \u201cShould you put your name on a book that you did not write?\u201d That depends on the circumstances. What sort of book is this, a collection of short stories you are editing? When it really comes down to it, it is the publisher that decides whether or not your name should go on this book. And in what fashion. If you are self-publishing, I would recommend you ask other self-publishers, since you are currently unequipped to make decisions of this sort. If you are going the traditional route, clearly you should ask the publisher. Next part is, \u201cI want to copyright something I did not write. Is there an issue with this?\u201d Uh, yes. There is a huge issue with this. I don\u2019t know the context of what this book is (by the way, question details explaining what brought you to ask this Quora question is always super-helpful to writers). But my hunch is that you are about to make a false copyright claim over written works that already have copyright protections owned by the original authors. Either that or you are about to claim copyright ownership of a work that is actually in the public domain. Both of these are illegal. I have advice for you, which you probably don\u2019t want: Any business plan or project that uses content created by someone other than you (or your business) must be reviewed and approved by a lawyer. The legal risks are too high. Real publishers have a legal team review their books before they publish them. If you are self-publishing, why are you skipping this step? There are usually ways to use someone\u2019s content in a legal fashion, eliminating the risk of being sued. A lawyer can guide you to those ways. Please see one. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the circumstances, and how. For example, if you\u2019re editing a compilation, you could copyright it as a compilation, and put your name on it as editor. If you\u2019ve hired someone to write something for you, then the contract should specify how or if the writer will be credited. Most often, the author would be credited as author, while you might be credited as editor or publisher. Some books have several credits: for example, I publish in the tabletop RPG industry, where a book may have multiple writers, editors, proofreaders, layout artists, a line editor for the line it\u2019s part of, and so forth.
