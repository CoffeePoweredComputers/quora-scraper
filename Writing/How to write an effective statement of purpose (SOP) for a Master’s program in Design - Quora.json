            "answer_text": "I look at the Statement of Purpose as nothing but a resume or its covering letter. As the committees has to read a few hundred of these SOPs, the statement which is innovative and creative (as you are looking for creative side of design) will attract the attention and compel them to read it again.  So, I would like to give few direct headings so the reader can look where you want him to look. I made the paragraphs very small so the reader will not get bored. If you have give your resume it would be easy for me to give a more viable and true SOP.  About me:  I did my graduation in (specify) from (college and University) in the year xxxx and I have obtained excellent grades.  I have a passion for interior design as my father is directly connected to the Architecture related matters.  I look at the interior design is more about understanding the client\u2019s unspecified values and beliefs and to convert them into a public statement by creating the client\u2019s vision in the shape of interior design.  My objective is to understand, learn, interact and get in-depth knowledge on the Interior design which includes the architecture, environmental issues and most important is that I would like to emphasize on the green architecture. Why I want Masters Program from a reputed university:I was fascinated by the article on St. Moritz Church which was renovated recently and there is such a clarity and beauty in shaping the entire building without changing its ancient archaeological value. So I asked my self about \u201c Do we really want more plastic trash to bring aesthetics or beauty or to make a statement through interiors?  In the west the technologies are not stranded, research is not one time issue, creativity is not a monopolized business and I am really confident that my ideas, my creative skills blossom without much hindrance. What I did to support my interest / passion:(Speak / explain what you did)   What I can gain? My inherent creative ideas can be explained and get them a shape and get the real feed-back.  That gives me the immense confidence to face actual challenges in interior designing.  Because my objective is to face as many challenges as I can so that gives me large unspecified challenges by which my capacity to come up with creative design aspect will be increased / enhanced.  ( I will stop here - I do not know how far you will like it.. but I made an attempt without looking at your resume)Thanks for the opportunity you have given to me. +I suggest you visit  July 2013 Archives - DezeenSt Moritz Church by John Pawsonand read all issues -  visit swismiss  and go to hermanmiller web site read all issues ",

            "answer_text": "As you are ready to apply for a design school, there are some things you need to consider and creating a high-quality SoP for postgraduate architecture engineering is one of the first things you\u2019re going to face. This element of your application is of great importance and if you don\u2019t write in properly, you\u2019re likely to be rejected from being accepted into the program. There are many important points which are to be covered in your design statement of purpose, some of them are: Give reasons why you\u2019re interested in this particular field.Explain what makes you unique and how suitable you are for this program.Name your ambitions and future goals.Tell why you\u2019ve chosen the university you're applying to. The common mistakes to avoid in your SoP for design program are the following: telling your whole life story;forgetting to change your SoP when applying to another program;sending your statement without editing and proofreading;making your text too long;not being professional in your statementwriting something you wouldn\u2019t say in person;being disorganized.And finally, when you\u2019re writing the statement of purpose in design, show how confident you are, include details in your examples and explain why this program is the right choice for you.
