            "answer_text": "You find the seventh degree of the natural minor scale and then raise it by a half-step. This pitch should sit one half-step below the tonic tone, so you can also think of it that way. The leading tone is already present (raised) in the melodic and harmonic minors, and in the major as well. Correct musical spelling is important for a number of reasons, no matter how bonkers it may seem to you at first; if the letter-name of the leading tone is the one that comes just before the letter-name of the tonic in the musical alphabet, then you\u2019re on the right track. In most keys, an accidental will also need to be applied. In F-sharp minor (or major), the leading tone is E-sharp (not F natural\u2014heavens, no). And in G-sharp minor (or major), the leading tone is F-double-sharp, not G natural. ",
