            "answer_text": "I already answered a few versions of this question. Here\u2019s a fragment where I quoted Malcolm Gladwell: Ten thousand is just a random number that someone attached to that \u201crule\u201d because it sounded good. Now he regrets it. Malcolm Gladwell, the guy who is usually blamed for \u201cinventing\u201d the \u201crule\u201d, (see Robert Frost\u2019s answer) writes: \u201c(\u2026) practice isn't a SUFFICIENT condition for success. I could play chess for 100 years and I'll never be a grandmaster. The point is simply that natural ability requires a huge investment of time in order to be made manifest. Unfortunately, sometimes complex ideas get oversimplified in translation.\u201d My translation: a monkey hitting random keys on a keyboard for 10,000 hours will be still a monkey hitting random keys on a keyboard. Only older. For more, see: my answer to How was the 10,000 hour rule of mastery finally exposed as an urban myth? my answer to Is there any way how to shorten 10000 hour rule by deliberate practice? my answer to Is the 10,000 hours rule works for all fields, if not, can you provide an example? my answer to If I practice piano for 10,000 hours, will that actually make me an \"expert\" pianist? Read about the failure of \u201cthe Dan Plan\u201d here: The Average Guy Who Spent 6,003 Hours Trying to Be a Professional Golfer. At about halfway through his 10,000 hours plan he was almost there, but he tried to overshoot his goal, exaggerated a bit his training, and his back gave up. Some people will make the perfect omelette or scrambled eggs on their first attempt; others won\u2019t make it in a lifetime. Read those answers, look around on my profile page, google the \u201crule\u201d, maybe you\u2019ll understand why I consider it a dangerous myth. ",
