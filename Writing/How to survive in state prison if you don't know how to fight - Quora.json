            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do you survive in state prison if you don't know how to fight?\u201d You don\u2019t have to be an MMA fighter to survive prison. I didn\u2019t get into any fights while in prison but I did learn how to co-exist. Although it is an advantage to be capable of fighting in case you find yourself in a situation in which you need to defend yourself, it is important to note that no fighter can beat everyone. So, regardless if a person can or cannot fight, the primary objective is to avoid pissing someone off while also not being a pushover. You want to be \u2018likable\u2019, you want to be valuable and you want to be trustworthy. It really doesn\u2019t matter if a person can fight or not because any opponent that chooses to target someone is going to plan out their attack- they will assume that you will fight back until you show them that you won\u2019t. Some fights are unavoidable, but you still better give it your best effort, and if your best isn\u2019t good enough then you better at least get some payback later when you have the advantage of surprise. Nobody is going to fault a person for not fighting fair in prison- what they are going to fault a person for is a failure to stand up for themselves. You do not need to know how to fight to take a pointy object, walk up behind someone and start ramming it into their kidneys repeatedly. You do not need to know how to fight to crack a guy in his head with a padlock in the stairwell and watch him tumble down the steps. I myself witnessed a guy get his get-back (for\u2026 something): he put baby oil on the floor outside another guys cell door and then threw scalding hot water on the guy while he was in his cell. When the other guy ran out of his cell, he slipped and fell. The guy that had set the trap was waiting for him and began beating his target on the head and hands with a padlock. He broke both of the guy\u2019s hands. Needless to say, regardless of what that altercation was about, the guy that got his hands broken would never be able to put his hands on anyone ever again. That guy never came back from medical, so either he checked in to protective custody or he was shipped out to another prison. In any case, I never saw anyone go after the guy that set that trap in retaliation during the remainder of my stay. In prison, you don\u2019t want to be the toughest guy on the compound (being labeled as the toughest can and will get you targeted). Prison is about respect, and it\u2019s also about standing up for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to be a badass you just have to be willing to defend your manhood. If you demonstrate that you\u2019re a man you\u2019ll have backup from others of your race. Others in your race who definitely are badasses! Like it or not, prison is very racially divided and it\u2019s best to embrace this mindset before you get off that fucking bus. If you do a lot of time it may be difficult to disassociate yourself from ingrained racism but it can be done, It took years for me to break free from my self imposed prison brought about by years and years of living that fear based racist bullshit but I eventually broke free from it. I will also note here that I saw many (kids mostly who had no business in prison with people like me) who arrived and showed a shit ton of courage but who couldn\u2019t fight their way out of a wet paper bag. But once they demonstrated who they were as men we worked with them and taught them how to fight. Most of these people never had the need to learn until they found themselves with a felony conviction. They had courage and wanted to learn. Some weight training and sparring and next thing you know, he\u2019s kicking some ass! This is just my experience. YMMV. ",
