            "answer_text": "I haven't, but I used to offer a resume/CV/cover letter service on fiverr.com. For $5 I would use your existing information to build the document of your choice, using a tasteful layout that I often created myself. I would include three revisions (in other words, I would make changes to the first draft up to two times). I created about 50 documents for 25 clients. Of those, all left great reviews of my work, so I'd say it was worth it for all 25 to have good-looking, up-to-date professional documents. Ten wrote later on to tell me that they had been hired using the materials. Two were especially lucky; a woman who knew little English and had me help her to draft business proposals for a hospital, and a gentleman who wanted to apply for a grant. The woman won a $10k bid to provide framing services for the hospital, and the gentleman won the grant for his business. So I'd say it's worth it. Just do your research and don't hire someone who can't make you look awesome on paper. (EDIT: Forgot to mention, my qualifications for writing these documents for others included AP English courses in High School, a job with a prose/short story editing company, and a Portfolio/Resume 101 course while earning a masters degree. So I'm not a literary master, but did have some experience with the use of the english language :P You should always make sure whomever you hire has some qualifications!) ",

            "answer_text": "I did a lot of research into resume writers, researching Chicago resume writers and Dallas resume writers., etc. honestly everywhere I was traveling on business I was looking. I actually landed on Otto Resumes (www.ottoresumes.com) and worked with Emilia. I found out that they had won a national award. I am glad I did. I did not go with the cheapest. I went with the ones I was most confident would deliver the best work. I was on $115k at director level. Their resume enabled me to secure interviews, and eventually get the jo at VP level. I got 4 interviews from 4 applications.. all higher level positions (bare in mind I have NEVER held a VP position or higher) I ended up getting a job paying $54k more.. with a higher bonus structure.
