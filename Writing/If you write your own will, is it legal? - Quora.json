            "answer_text": "If you write your own will it may be legal depending on the jurisdiction, format, and execution. Each jurisdiction will have their own laws for what makes a valid will. If a lawyer is not drafting or reviewing the will it is important to make sure that one is following the laws of that jurisdiction to make sure that it is valid in form and execution. If by writing your own will you mean handwritten in some jurisdictions a holographic or handwritten will can be valid, but in most jurisdictions it will not be. If by writing your own will you mean drafting your own will by typing it up in most jurisdictions one is able to act as their own lawyer including the drafting of estate planning documents such as a last will and testament. It is always recommended that if one is able to hire a lawyer to draft and help execute the will that is the best course of action, but if one is determined to draft it themselves there is nothing stopping them from doing so. Drafting one\u2019s own will carries increased risk that it will not have the proper form, format, and legal language for it to do what one wants it to do and may end up doing quite the opposite if not done properly. There is also the risk that the will may not be valid because it is not executed properly such as not being signed by the testator or the person making the will or the correct number of witnesses and other legal requirements that if not present will not make the document a validly executed will and in most jurisdictions be the same as having no will at all.

            "answer_text": "Yes, with qualifications. Wills are generally subject to an old concept of law called the Statute of Frauds. Basically, the will is a contract between the estate, its executor and its beneficiaries with the basic quid pro quo that the beneficiaries are entitled to the bequests of the document as long as they follow any conditions laid out in the will, often dealing with real property and other items of significant value. As such, there are requirements the will must meet in order to be considered valid in court. In writing - This is implicitly covered in the circumstances of the question, but while a will can be dictated, the will in verbal form is generally not valid in most English courts no matter how many people heard it being given.Witnessed - There must be an unimpeachable witness to the creation of the will as a legal document. This is usually a notary public, who is legally required to testify as to the matter of any signature laid down in their presence and on which they affix their own mark. They must also log the signature and safeguard such logs for life (or as long as they hold the license; the records usually revert to the county on the notary\u2019s death, retirement or other surrender of license). However, it doesn\u2019t have to be a notary, as long as you\u2019re confident whomever it is is both willing and able to testify when needed, and that their testimony cannot be questioned or excluded in legal proceedings for any of a number of reasons a plaintiff against your estate might be able to come up with.Between living persons or entities in existence as of its execution - This is a little-known rule known as the rule against perpetuities. Statements of this rule can get quite convoluted, but it generally breaks down to the following; you can bequeath valuable property to anyone who is alive, even in utero, at the time of your death. You cannot bequeath property to a person or corporate entity that is either defunct or not yet conceived as of that time, including \u201cto your bloodline in perpetuity\u201d. The actual statute is considerably more complicated and is generally to some effect along the lines of \u201cproperty claims created by a legal instrument must complete within 21 years and 10 months of the execution of the instrument\u201d. Among other things, this means that you cannot control the conditions on which your beneficiaries transfer the property on their own deaths. You can bequeath real property on the condition that it not be sold outside the family by the beneficiary, but your beneficiary can bequeath the property to whomever they choose without passing on any such condition.Property involved must be free from all other encumbrance - Simply stated, you can\u2019t give away things you don\u2019t own. This goes way back to, of all places, the Catholic Church, which had a fairly substantial problem from time to time of clergy, from parish priests all the way up to the Pope himself, giving away church property to their children, embroiling the Church in drawn-out and costly legal battles over questions of ownership of the real property. This is the primary reason modern Catholic clergy take vows of chastity and poverty; these are binding oaths that release all claims of heredity and ownership to any property they may be entrusted to manage as an official of the Church.In less extreme examples, say you have a timeshare. You cannot will the entire property to your descendants, because you don\u2019t own the entire property, only the right to occupy it for certain times of the year. You can will that interest in the property to someone else, as long as the contract you signed to gain ownership allows such a transfer.Property must be willingly accepted by the beneficiary - Another fairly simple one; you cannot force someone to take your bequest. This is part of what makes the will a contract; your will is the offer, and the beneficiary must explicitly signal their acceptance of the property bequeathed to them, along with any terms. You can dictate what should happen if anyone named in your will doesn\u2019t claim their bequest (a chain of right of refusal, donated to charity, liquidated in estate sale and the money distributed among participating beneficiaries), but you cannot give any explicit instruction forcing the beneficiary to take possession.These things (and others I didn\u2019t cover) sound really simple and obvious, but failure to draft the will in accordance with one or more of these rules has gotten the entire document thrown out as unenforceable, leaving you without a legal will, which in many jurisdictions leaves you subject to the \u201cdefault will\u201d of the jurisdiction, defined by \u201cintestate distribution\u201d laws. These are very general provisions of estate/probate law in whatever states in which you own property, that essentially create a hierarchy of primary beneficiaries of your estate, which may be logical in the general case but are probably not what you specifically had in mind (especially if you wanted to leave anything - or everything - to someone who isn\u2019t a relative by blood or marriage). These laws even vary by jurisdiction, so that lake house in Vermont which, if it were in your home state of Tennessee, would be given to your spouse as you had intended in the first place, could instead go to the closest blood relative of yours residing in Vermont at the time, or it could even be forfeit to the State of Vermont.
