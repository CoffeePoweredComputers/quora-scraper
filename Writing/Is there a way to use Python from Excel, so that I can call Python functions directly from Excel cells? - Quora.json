            "answer_text": "Yeah, you can use xlwings or pyxll.And you still can use the COM approach using the PyWin32 module. But i suggest a better approach where you'll use EXCEL spreadsheets  as a data input support (excel is a very good tool at manipulating and normalizing data).And use Python as your main scripting and data mining tool, that way you'll get a good separation of data and logic.Take a look for IPython, Pandas, numpy, openpyxl and the Anaconda python distribution.Hope it helps.
