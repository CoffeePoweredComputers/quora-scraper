            "answer_text": "Yes and no. For example, there is no mention of Nick\u2019s being mentally disturbed and hospitalized in the novel, though this addition to the plot in Luhrmann\u2019s film seems to me justified because it hints at just how profoundly the tragedy of Gatsby\u2019s death\u2014with all its symbolic import for America\u2014has affected Nick. Some of the music in the film is anachronistic. However, as someone who has led many college level discussions on the novel, I say that the film is as close to a perfect cinematic adaptation of a great book as I have ever seen. I was getting goose bumps in the theater. I have heard a lot of nit picking complaints about the overuse of CGI in the film, but I can\u2019t take those very seriously. It\u2019s a wonderful film. I wish I had a way to watch it at home in 3D because it does resonate so well with the book. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as movie adaptions of famous novels go, its more faithful than most. It\u2019s also much more fun. As Mr. Milliman has already pointed out, the framing device of Nick writing his account as part of some sort of recovery, isn\u2019t in the book. See the Wikipedia article on the film for Breanne L. Healman\u2019s list of four other (fairly minor) departures from the novel. However, she fails to mention that the director also cut Gatsby\u2019s father appearance at his funeral. ",
