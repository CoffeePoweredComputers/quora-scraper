            "answer_text": "Thanks for your request Sanaz. If you mean a computerised AI-based system, then the most popular proofreading service is Grammarly. This is like an advanced version of Word\u2019s spellchecker and enables you to check your own work for free (there is also a paid version) in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, sentence structure, and so on. However, it\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019d still have to do the work yourself using their suggestions, and it\u2019s not always accurate since it\u2019s based on AI rather than a true human understanding of language. The other option is to hire a proofreader, and in my opinion this is a better option because you\u2019ll get a more accurate result than using a computerised system. What\u2019s more, when you find a good proofreader, you can develop an ongoing relationship with them and rest assured that your documents are in good hands. There are various proofreading services available online (either personal websites of individual freelancers or companies who provide proofreading services via a range of proofreaders). If you Google \u201cproofreading services\u201d, you can find plenty of these, so you\u2019d just need to compare the offerings from the various websites to find the best one for you. Alternatively, one of the fastest ways to find proofreaders online is using freelancing platforms such as PeoplePerHour, Upwork, and Freelancer. There are hundreds of freelance proofreaders on these sites, and you can quickly compare their feedback, prices, and level of experience. Plus these sites provide messaging, file sharing, a review system, and payment protection, so you get security in the working relationship. Best of luck finding the right proofreading service for you! ",
