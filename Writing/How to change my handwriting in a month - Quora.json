            "answer_text": "So, what happened was, I truly enjoyed the summer break, but it's a fact, that I didn't write anything while in it. Now that school had started, everyone has beautiful handwriting like always, while I have a child's handwriting. I wanna write prettily and gain back my good handwriting, but I've been trying so hard without gaining anything, that I've lost hope. Is there any quick and easy way to solve this and retrieve my handwriting? ",
