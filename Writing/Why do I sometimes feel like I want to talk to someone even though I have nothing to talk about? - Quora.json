            "answer_text": "Everything is in your brain. It's all about trust and mutual understanding which instills in you the feel of being close to someone that you want to talk with them even if you have nothing to talk about. Sometimes they are your best friends, sometimes not but most important of all you feel comfortable in their company that you don't want to miss in any circumstances. You seek advice from them because you think that the advice they give always turns out to be best for you. The whole point of this is you think that person also cares about you. Hope I answered your question. ",

You see a lot of elderly people and stay-at-home moms with small children do this at checkout lines,the bank etc. They just want a few friendly remarks from another adult. So do we all. ",
