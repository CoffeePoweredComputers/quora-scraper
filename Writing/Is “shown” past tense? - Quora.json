Thus, it is an adjective that describes the state of something that had been displayed in the past. \u201cThe dog was shown at the county fair.\u201d It can be used in a present tense in the even that it describes a showing that took place some time before the reader\u2019s experience of the word. \u201cHere, I am shown the evidence against me.\u201d It might be less dodgy to use \u201cwas\u201d instead of \u201cam\u201d, but it can be used thus in a scene where the narrator is recalling something.

It is in the form called the past participle, which is used in addition to other words in various tenses. The simple past tense = showed (NOT shown). BUT The present perfect tense = have shown The past perfect tense = had shown The future perfect tense = will have shown Thus, you can see that \u2018shown\u2019 is a form of the past, but it is specifically the past participle, and it is used in the above tenses. This is a common mistake I see (the difference between, for e.g., showed and shown) as an editor, so don\u2019t worry! ",
