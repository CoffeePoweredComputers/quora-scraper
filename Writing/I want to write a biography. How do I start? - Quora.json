            "answer_text": "I'm going to give you an answer that is only applicable if you're looking to write the biography of someone that you can speak with. If that's the case, I'm going to outline a simple strategy so you can start (and finish) a biography of that person in a very short amount of time. And it will be interesting, easy to read and something that authentically captures your subject. So what's the strategy? In a nutshell: Interview your subject and write down their answers. A bit of background, when my daughter was born my wife and I realised how little we knew about our parents and their family histories. We wanted to capture their life stories for her (and to be honest, us too). We went searching for something easy and fun and perfect for a novice writer. We didn\u2019t really find anything that worked. In the end we designed an interview with 101 questions for our parents to answer. Every question was designed to be thought provoking and take no more than a few minutes each to answer. We broke up the questions into different \"life chapters\" like childhood, work, love, children and more philosophical questions as well. Questions like these: What advice would you give to your 18 year old self?What\u2019s the most valuable thing your parents taught you?If you could share a meal with anyone in the world, who would it be and why?We used these questions to interview our parents. Not only was it a wonderful way to spend time with them, hearing about their lives in person, but we were also helping them record their stories to be shared with friends and family. My wife and I got so excited about how well our parents\u2019 books turned out that we launched A Life Untold (www.alifeuntold.com) to give absolutely anyone the ability to write and print their life story into a beautiful hardcover book. And because it was designed specifically to help our families get started with writing their life story, it's worth trying if you're struggling to take that first step. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to write a biography is to come up with a short chronology of your life. It's nothing fancy. Basically, it's just a collection of information that begins at the beginning, proceeds to the middle, and ends up where you are currently. Once you get that out of the way, you can then look at the gaps and then fill in important events. The first part of writing a biography is essentially to come up with a timeline that is complete enough. This is crucial. There shouldn\u2019t be any gaps. Once you do that, then you can look at each period and see if there are important themes or attention-grabbing incidents that would make them worthwhile. You have to remember that people are not interested in seeing a second-by-second, blow-by-blow documentary of your life. They probably have a lot of other better things to do. They want you to get to the good stuff immediately. How can you pick apart your biography so that you zero in the \u201cmeat\u201d of your story? You need to look for classic themes. These involve issues of personal growth, overcoming adversity, discovering something new, resolving conflicts, and other similar themes. In other words, you need to look at your life story to pick out these themes that resonate with people from all over the world regardless of their background. That's how you create a biography worth reading. There has to be something in it for the reader. After you've collected all this information and organized it, then you need to prioritize. Which themes resonate the most? Again, you only have so much space to work with. If you don't have any writing experience, this is probably going to be the roughest part. You\u2019ve already done the information collection. Now, you have to prioritize. Now, you have to \u201cedit your life.\u201d This takes quite a bit of work. The good news is you can outsource this to expert writers. While you can outsource to a writing company like Bulxter that works for really cheap, you can also retain the services of a very experienced and quite renowned autobiography and memoir-writing experts Anna Lennon Lewis or Gene Eugenio and others. There are a lot of reasons why people would want to outsource something that they typically would want to write themselves like they're all biography. Maybe they're not good writers. Perhaps they just don't have the time for it. Possibly, they're not all that motivated. Whatever the reason is, a lot of your problems go away when you outsource. With that said, you still have to take ownership over the project. You need to give a clear guidance to your writers so the finished products would meet your expectations. ",
