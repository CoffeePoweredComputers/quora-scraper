            "answer_text": "There is no best ideas because each person is different. What you want to do is pick out something you ate truly passionate about or a hobby that you love. That will give you a foundation for building a business that could generate the equivalent of a full-time 9-to-5 paycheck within a couple years. The challenge you will have is learning how to create a website to leverage that knowledge and learning how to figure out what to write about to get traffic coming to your website that you can convert into a cashflow. (Hint: it's not the obvious topics that will make your site a success.) Of course, you will also need to learn how to write for the internet. I just recently started launching a new business that will help people who have that thing they are passionate about or a hobby\u2026and turn it into an online business for them. My plan is to charge a program fee of $995 (or $1,250 for an e-commerce store) to design and build a full custom website and do all the work writing artickes and building traffic. The client will be billed $25/month for hosting and any license fees for specialized software needed for the site \u2026 but those bills will be accrued until the website is generating the income to cover those costs \u2026 so the client never has an out of pocket expense for hosting. Then when the website is generating a profit the first dollars will go to the client until they recover their initial program fee. And after that the income will be split with my business getting $1 out of every $4 and the client getting $3 out of every $4. The only thing the client will need to do is to provide feedback on outlines fir artickes they are sent. No writing. No learning to create a website. No learning Search Engine Optimization to drive traffic. Just provide the topic and some specialized knowledge as to why people would be submitting search requests asking abkut things related to the topic of the website. I want to make this as easy as possible for someone to create a business so they don't need to rely on a job that we all learned might suddenly disappear. But this program us not for someone who wants a big income immediately. In the first 6 monts there probably will not be any income and in the first year the income might only climb to a hundred dollars a month or so. But by the end of the 2nd year this could grow to a couple thousand a month and maybe to $4,000 a month. It all depends on the topic and the monetization opportunities. The important thing is that my business is committed for the long haul to help the client achieve their financial objectives. I would like to hear feedback on this idea and if anyone reading this will be interested in something like this. I will be putting a lot of money into launching thus program (it is going to take far more than the program fee to grow the websites to the point where they can earn that kind on money) and I want to know if people will be interested\u2026 ",

That said, there are some general rules of thumb when you\u2019re validating an idea or niche. Ask yourself\u2026 Do people actually want this?Are people willing to pay for this?Does the niche have the budget to actually pay for this?Does this solve a problem? How pressing is the problem?Do I have the experience to help people get the result they\u2019re looking for?If you can answer \u201cYes\u201d to all of these questions \u2014 and you\u2019re interested in the idea or niche \u2014 then there\u2019s your green light. Go. You can never be 100% certain about your idea or niche. The only way you\u2019ll discover if it works is by trying \u2014 and taking consistent action. It\u2019s better to choose the wrong idea or niche and change course than to endlessly ponder about which one you should try. ",
