            "answer_text": "Hello teen, welcome to our family! I would like to consider myself flexible, but if you do not follow some simple rules I will become strict. 1. Sleep Go to bed whenever you\u2019d like. As long as you are waking up for school and your tiredness is effecting your schoolwork, it\u2019s cool with me.On weekends please do sleep in. I would like you up by 11am, maybe noon, to participate in some family activities.2. Substances You are a teenager and bound to make some mistakes, so I will excuse a few occasions but please don\u2019t put yourself in danger and please be safe.Alcohol is fine in moderation. I will give you wine with dinner upon request starting at 14 years of age. Once you are 16 and I deem you are mature enough, I will drink with you so you don\u2019t go crazy at some party.Weed is okay also in moderation. I personally do not want it in my house, so take it outside or do it with a friend.Smoking is a no from me. If i catch you with a cigarette, it is not going to go well (see \u201cpunishments\u201d).Vaping is strongly discouraged but I know how easily accessible it is, so please just be smart. A vape is another thing I never want to catch you with.Any hard drugs (cocaine, meth, shrooms, etc) are strongly FORBIDDEN. I do not want to be planning your funereal at the ripe age of 35.If you are under any influence please call me and I promise to drop everything and come get you. There will be no consequences as long as I bring you home safely. 3. Punishments Your punishment will depend on the nature of the action committed. Here are some ideas that can be fluctuated depending on the severity of the action:I can severely limit your screen-time. I am not going to take your phone away and put it in a safe because I do understand phones are so important in today's society. I will allow FaceTime, phone calls, text messaging, and school related apps. I will turn off any games, social networking, etc. I think that is fair as you can still communicate to friends but will not be able to use the \u201cfun\u201d apps.T.V. time will be eliminated. I don\u2019t know about you but I can\u2019t remember the last time I actually watched T.V., so this shouldn\u2019t be too tough of a punishment. I may add on changing the log in information to Netlix and Hulu.I will still allow certain visits with specific friends. They will take place at our home so I can keep an eye on you, since you have done something to decrease my trust in you.4. Electronic Devices You will receive a phone during the summer leading up to middle school. It will be my old phone, and I will grant you an upgrade once you prove you can be responsible with such a device.If you want the latest game system everyone is raving about, I will try to get it for you, but it will go one of two ways. You will either pitch in by doing house work for money or using your paycheck from an outside job, or you will receive it for the next upcoming holiday, whether that be your birthday, Christmas, or the end of the school year. At the end of the school year I will buy you a nice gift to congratulate you on completing another year of excellence, as long as you don\u2019t receive any D\u2019s or F\u2019s.5. Clothing & Piercings I think clothing and piercings are some of the most powerful ways to express yourself. If you want to dress like Jojo Siwa and never pierce your ears, that\u2019s great! If you want to wear black crop tops, birkenstocks, and get an industrial piercing, that is also great! Or if you are more of a gold dress and stilettos type of girl with some basic piercings, that\u2019s also totally fine.If you identify as a male teen, you also can wear pretty much whatever you\u2019d like. If you want to rock some heels and a dress, go you! If you would rather opt for some skinny jeans and a tee, that\u2019s fine by me.I will allow any ear piercing, however I will not allow any face piercings besides nostril & septum until you are 18 years of age. I do want you to prove you actually want each piercing, and ensure you are not getting it just because Jessica did. You can prove that by presenting me with research. This can include the piercing process, healing process, cleaning instructions, etc. I also will wait one month before bringing you to the piercing shop to once again ensure this is not something you will regret.6. Sex(uality) If you are lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, asexual, or any part of the LGBTQ+ community, I will still love and support you just as much as I already did! Just let me know if you ever want me to address you by different pronouns and I will try my hardest to do so!Sex is a natural part of humanity. Teenage hormones are raging, and teens are beginning to explore their bodies. If you choose to be sexually active, there is nothing I can do as a parent to stop you. I will have a box of condoms in a disclosed location for your use, and if supply gets low I will purchase more.For girls, with your permission I would like to put you on birth control after you start your period. This is not just to protect you from pregnancy, but I have a family history of period-related issues, and birth control seems to help them. Of course if you are not comfortable with this I will not shove pills down your throat.7. Mental Health Mental illness is also common among my family, lucky us! If you show any signs of any type of mental health issue, I will do my best to give you whatever help you need. I will sign you up for therapy if you\u2019d like, I will put you on antidepressants, I will do everything in my power to give you the help you deserve.8. After High School I am not going to force you to go to college, you are now legally an adult and that is not my responsibility. If you would like to take a gap year, that is fine as long as you work a job during that time.If you would rather go straight to work and skip college, that is fine as long as you get out of my house within a reasonable amount of time9. Final notes I\u2019m almost 16 right now, and I know I have made a lot of mistakes. I have done a lot of stupid stuff that would make my parents would punish me for the rest of my life if they found out. I\u2019ve mixed vodka with monster. I\u2019ve hid a vape in my closet. I lost my v-card. I\u2019ve took a sharp object to my skin. I\u2019ve messed up, and I guarantee I will continue to make mistakes. But mistakes are part of growing into adults. The mistakes I\u2019ve made will make me a better person, and better parent, in the future.",
