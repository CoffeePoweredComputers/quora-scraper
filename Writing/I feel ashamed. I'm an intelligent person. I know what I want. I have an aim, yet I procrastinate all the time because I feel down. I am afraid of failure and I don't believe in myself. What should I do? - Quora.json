            "answer_text": "You were so focused on your self. But your focus geared towards the negative intellect you may have even if you were an intelligent person. When you say I know what i want , I have an aim, reading those statements, i felt how firm you are. But i almost fell from my seat when the following statement contradicted your first statements. You procrastinate all the time because you feel down. That is the reaction of people who believed they are intelligent. But why does an intelligent person feel ashamed and afraid of failure. You are afraid to fail, but you do not believe in yourself. So, yes! You were right for asking, \u201c what should i do?\u201d In the first place you must have been feeling that shame, and so you feel down. On second thought, you were ashamed because you believed you are intelligent but you procrastinate, the emotional effect of feeling down. So, if you were afraid of failure you should not procrastinate. You must be too sensitive that you were easily affected by your own uncorrected nagativity. Remember that you are rebelling against your self, the reaction ofwhich was procrastinating. With your opposing behaviors and character, you really have got a lot to change for yourself. Think of the reason why you feel down. Where does your feeling of shame originated. You know why? They are the reasons why feeing let down. From those negativity, you feared failure, so why do you not believe in yourself? if you were not possessed of the ability to decide for yourself, you should try it now. At least you would have to think only of your self, your future. I am certain you were only affected by people around you. You keep following them, and you cannot disobey their command. If you believed you could lead your life to a better state of mind, why not do it. You know what you want. Actually the people around you were used to your attitude of following their rules, whatever that is they are now irrelevanf. And you were also used to following them. It had became a habit for both of you. Sometimes people superior to us demanded a lot from people who they consider are their followers. They did not know that they had been dominating for the longest time. But why should you follow if it was not right for your life? The future is yours, you owe your success to yourself. In fact, you have lost that firmness because the people around you did not understand that their way is not relevant to the people of the present generation. Now you were torn between two worlds. But you can slowly cHange it. You may not also want them to feel bad. So do it without letting everyone know. And do not forget that you are doing it for your future. credits : Pinterest  ",

            "answer_text": "I have read many of the answers here. And they're all efficient methods which you can use in your daily life. But what I think is it will be good if you search about a disorder called as ADHD. If you read its symptoms, you may relate with it or you may not. But if you do relate, don't declare yourself as anything, but just consult some mental health professional. Next, I want you to search about something called as \u201cself-sabotage\u201d. I feel you need to heal from whatever it is that is making you procrastinate. It's not going to be easy, it's definitely going to be tough for you to heal. But it will definitely be worth it. Remember, we don't get what we wish for, we get what we work for. No pains, no gains, right? Right. Just thinking, planning but not actually doing anything is the most useless thing. Action is the most important habit we can ever develop. Just make a list of habits which you have to develop, habits which you have to get rid of, and delegate new healthy habits in place of them. Lastly, just remember that everyone's journey is different. Other people have seen and experienced their own problems, so please don't compare yourself with them. Being inspired by someone is good, but don't compare yourself unnecessarily. Being ashamed and with regrets is no way to go through life dude! We can fight and dominate, or hide and evaporate in this world. Here it seems your fight is little with others but more with your own inner negative voice. At the end of our lives, most probably we'll be regretful about not doing certain things, rather than doing something. Just aim, plan and execute. I know there are a lot of circumstances and obstacles in the way, I know it's not easy, but if it were easy, everyone would do it. In this case, according to your question, you yourself have become the reason for your regret. You are regretting about not working harder. You are regretting about not working enough. You are regretting due to your wasting time. I don't know your whole story, maybe there are other people responsible for it. But remember, if you don't achieve what you deeply want, the one who's gonna be extremely regretful about it in this whole world is you, especially if you know that you are the main reason. There may be some wounds in your heart and mind, heal them. Even if you take professional help from a doctor, the one who can heal you is yourself. You only have one option, that is to be strong. You have got to be strong, accept your reality and have to believe in yourself to make changes for not letting it happen ever. I repeat Action is the most important habit which you can ever develop. You will get endless lists of habits and tips and strategies from people here, but remember your soul knows what it needs to be done to be satisfied. Don't get overwhelmed over these many lists of habits or don't overthink and try to do everything in one day. Plan and execute, plan and execute. Execute the next day, whatever you've planned. Don't plan and procrastinate. And do search about ADHD. Take care. ",
