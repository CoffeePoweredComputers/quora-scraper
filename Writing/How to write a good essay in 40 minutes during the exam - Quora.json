            "answer_text": "Take the first five minutes and don\u2019t write the essay. Plan. Decide what your thesis is. Choose your supporting arguments. Jot them down. and make sure the order has a logical flow to it. (That can be \u201cputting my best argument first/last\u201d if you want\u2026just don\u2019t make the order random.) I\u2019m NOT talking about whole sentences or a first draft of anything\u2026.just make yourself jot down the ideas in order, as a way of verifying you have actually ideas before you start writing. Because\u2026If in that time you find you can\u2019t come up with three supporting paragraphs, or don\u2019t know how to support the thesis, you\u2019ll find out in the first two minutes, not after half an hour of wasted time committed to an essay that\u2019s doomed from the getgo. Try another thesis. If you are asked to argue for or against something, the opposite argument may be easier to write about than the one you actually believe. Sometimes you don\u2019t figure that out until you have to decide what your argument is. This serves three purposes: 1) Ensures that your introductory paragraph will be a good one. Most people write an introduction based on their initial idea, and then, as the paper develops, get a better sense of what they are trying to say. They may craft a good conclusion to wrap it all up, but the start of the essay is still weak. This way you have thought out what your arguments are and how they tie together before you craft those few vital first sentences. 2) Helps you choose a thesis and supporting arguments that you can write a lot about. Sooo many people start an essay and then discover halfway through they don\u2019t have enough to say. They start adding fluff for length. Better to dump your idea in the first five minutes and switch to something else than waste a half hour on sub-standard writing. 3) Organizes your essay so it is easier to write. And less likely to get off track. Five minutes seem like a long time to sacrifice? Well, this is actually the standard advice from the old SAT test, for which the essay was 25 minutes total. Even in that short a time, the benefit of taking a few minutes to plan meant the finished product was longer and better. And if this is for the SAT, or any standardized college entrance test\u2026length matters. It shouldn\u2019t, but it does. A recent study of SAT essays found a direct correlation between essay length and grade. The best way to manage that is to pick a subject to write about where you have a lot to say. ",

A lot of people zero in on the writing aspect of essay-writing \u2014 which is important, of course \u2014 but they also neglect the very important aspect of building up experience in planning essays. This neglect is also a neglect of the modern schooling attitudes in many, many countries. In my schooldays over 40 years ago, we had essay homework that DIDN\u2019T require the written-up essay. The homework required us to produce the plans and outlines for various types of essays and topics. Over time, that helped us to develop skills in planning for extended writing \u2014 and then helping us to internalise those skills so that we could develop quick MENTAL plans for writing under pressure (such as in exams). So to write a good essay under a time limit is first to build up experience in planning essays. ",

Your task: to figure out the likeliest subjects of the essay questions on the final exam. Come up with no more than three subjects. Next, write the three essays, using all of the books and other material at your command. Then, reduce the essays to outlines and memorize the outlines. On exam day, you will find that your professors has chosen one of the three essay questions you and your friends predicted. Now, expand the outline you have memorized and write the essay. You will get an A+ on your test (assuming your short answers are right) and your professor will smile at you when he returns the graded essays. This is what I did in college. Works like a charm. Oh yes, in world history, the night before the final, I made a list of 100 important dates and \u201cflash memorized them\u201d \u2014 that is, absorbed them into short-term memory, memory not intended to last more than 24 hours. When taking the final and writing the essay, sprinkle these dates into your work like salt. ",
