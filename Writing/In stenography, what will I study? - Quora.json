            "answer_text": "If you are talking about machine stenography, you will study a \u201ctheory,\u201d which is one of many ways to stroke a word on a steno machine and have it translate (basically). After that, there is a lot of speed-building, which is when your instructor reads material to the class and your task is to write everything down as s/he reads it. Sometimes you might be called to read what you have written to the rest of the class. Speed-building will be a constant throughout your training, until you get to ~200 words per minute, when you should then be sent out to intern with a local court reporter, captioner, or CART provider. You will also have to take English and Grammar classes, Legal Terminology, and (sometimes) Medical Terminology, and in your final speeds, you will be trained on one of the commercial CAT (\u201cComputer Aided Translation\u201d) programs. Hope that helps a bit \u2026 ",
