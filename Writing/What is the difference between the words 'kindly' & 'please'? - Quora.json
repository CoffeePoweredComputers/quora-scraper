            "answer_text": "What is the difference between please or kindly? And where to use? \u201cPlease\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cIf it pleases you \u2026 .\u201d or, at an intermediate level of abbreviation, \u201cIf you please.\u201d. This interpretation implies that the following phrase is a request, and the person addressed is to feel free to deny the request. \u201cPlease\u201d is sometimes used in an emphatic tone, in which it carries the additional meaning \u201cThis is highly important to me.\u201d. (In this context, it might be more appropriately spelled \u201cpleas\u201d, as if \u201cI am pleading.\u201d, but that is not standard practice.) However, it then retains the meaning that \u201cYou have the right to refuse.\u201d. \u201cKindly\u201d means that the person addressed would increase the happiness of the requester by complying, but the following phrase is a command with the same force as if that adverb had been omitted. It is often used ironically, with emphasis on the adverb, to mean \u201cIf you comply, we will remain on good terms; otherwise, I will force your compliance.\u201d. This is according to my experience in Canada, and in North American and European literature. I cannot speak for Indian job recruiters, but I suspect that an applicant who refuses to comply will be dropped from consideration. ",

The first is in tortured commercial-speak: \u201cWe request our customers to kindly put their baggage in the overhead lockers\u201d (now I\u2019m on the aeroplane I\u2019m a passenger BTW), or even \u201cWe kindly request our valued customers\u2026.\u201d The other is when you're being a bit snarky: \u201cCould you give me a bit more room, please?\u201d means \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you should have realised this, but if you move along a bit we can all be comfortable, thank you, <smile>.\u201d \u201cCould you kindly give me a bit more room\u201d means \u201cStop your bloody manspreading, recognize that other people have rights, and stick to your own seat.\u201d My perspective is that of an old Brit with a middle-class education: YMMV.

In that context \u201ckindly\u201d means exactly the same as \u201cplease\u201d. I occasionally use \u201cthank you kindly for\u2026.\u201d(whatever) in written communication, instead of simply \u201cthank you\u201d or \u201cthank you very much\u201d. It\u2019s just a matter of not wishing to express things always in exactly the same way. I agree with Mark Harrison\u2019s comment that \u201ckindly\u201d can also be used in a more sarcastic or contemptuous way, in conversation, depending heavily on tone of voice - but that would not apply in the context you are describing.

And where to use?\u201d I find that Indian job recruiters have a tendency to use \u201ckindly\u201d instead of \u201cplease\u201d when requesting that I send my r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, so there\u2019s probably a cultural thing going on in Indian usage. It is not correct in American English, where \u201cplease\u201d is the correct word. As I noted in my comment to Mark Harrison\u2019s answer, \u201ckindly\u201d is an adjective, as in \u201ca kindly old woman\u201d. ",
