            "answer_text": "I lot of people do so at some point of their life. Most do so, like yourself, as a scream of discontent and desire for help. Somewhere in the future you will laugh about today and this question. Think of this question: what did all your forefathers endure? And what for? How did they find the strength to deal with hunger, death, war, crime, broken hearts? Was it not to give you a shot at life? And also ponder about this. Just a hundred years ago life was terrible. Vast quantities of healthy people died like flies from an unknown disease called the Spanish Flu. At the same time entire villages sacrificed their young guys in some silly war in Europe. In fact travelling to any nearby country or city was something to worry about. And look at us now. Paul Getty, once the richest man on earth in that time would have paid all his money to have our healthcare, transportation, instant access to anywhere via internet. Never before was it so easy to take a sailboat and drift around on some paradise beaches. Or party at some great location. And think of this. Never before have people with disabilities ever been this free and capable to partake in our world. If you had a handicap 50 years ago, you be locked up in some barn or asylum and get daily shock therapy. There are very few people who survived insulin deficiencies before some 50 years back. My mother went one day into hospital to check on a small breast pain.. came out a week later with cotton fillings. What an amazing world we live in. And to top it all off. Within some 10 years doctors hope to have cured alzheimer, many of current cancers are curable, and maybe in 20 years they will begin to extend life expectancy to 200 years.. live long enough and your kids might become 500. Now I understand you are no doubt upset by some orange baboon being elected\u2026 but seriously\u2026 do not use a permanent solution for what really is a temporary problem. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Keep it like a time capsule. In twenty years open it up and read it. How do you think you will feel about the same issues? Quite often, time heals many wounds and we can look back and and realize that many issues which loomed large were actually quite small and not worth taking our lives over. Like, everything in high school. With this new gift, hopefully you will use what insights you glean from contemplating your past and maybe help change the lives of others. I had a 14 year old boy frequent caller who wanted to step in front of a moving train. I asked him to keep away from trains and he said ONE RAN THROUGH HIS BACKYARD. I asked him to call every night at nine because that is what time a train passed by and we would be here for him. He eventually chose to live and every time the train passed by he said he used it to remind himself how much he wanted to live. I remember reading a call report, one of his last, and as he was talking to the hotline specialist, a train went by and he ran outside with his phone and held it up so the specialist could hear it rumble by. He said \u201cThat is my life, and it is going somewhere.\u201d Made me want to cry. Now, every time I see a train I think . . . in one more hour my shift is over. ",
