            "answer_text": "Someone working in the field of medicine is expected to read at least the Lancet, JAMA, New England Journal of Medicine and the BMA regularly; not an easy task. Clinicians are interested in conclusive results that have an impact on their day to day work. They will expect the journals not to burden them any further. These journals already have a waiting list of articles that need to be published and may find the need to publish inconclusive and failed research articles to be a further burden. Because these journals enable the clinicians access to articles that have an impact on their clinical work ,they will probably postpone the publication of failed and inconclusive research articles to such an extent that they may never get published. They already have a rejection rate of around 90% of the papers they receive -what an unenviable task for the referees. Nevertheless, those who are interested in research may find these articles useful. They may shed light as to why the results failed to show benefit of the drug, procedure or protocol, and scrutinise the methodology and offer constructive criticism. Inconclusive results will be scrutinised in similar manner but the publication of these may act as a catalyst for further research. Those who conducted research and had no acknowledgment of the hard work they did may find solace in the publication of failed and inconclusive articles. Junior trainee doctors climbing the ladder towards the jobs of consultants have to prove that they have done research and published papers and my find the publication of such articles, though they give failed or inconclusive results, make their CVs more attractive to gain such positions.

            "answer_text": "As I understand the question, \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d is a reference to the erroneous belief that people\u2019s self continues to exist in a sentient form after physical death. Imagine the academic landscape as a civilization with a central capital representing mainstream thought, frontier towns representing the study of emerging science and uncharted territories representing new thought. For people standing at the center of civilization, everything toward the uncharted frontier is less real. Mainstream science exists within the capital city. It exists to a lesser extent as we move toward the frontier. People at the center tend to dismiss ideas not at the center, and more aggressively debunk those on the frontier. I stand at the farthest frontier of thought in my study of paranormal phenomena. This is especially true because I allow for the possibility of Survival Hypothesis. Looking back at the center, everyone seems to be debunkers of my study. At the same time, I find that the academics are increasingly less well informed about the subject as they are closer to the center. The lay community is more accepting of the idea of Survived personality, but as the question suggests, they depend on academics for guidance. Laypeople tend to be less well informed about the science behind the Survival Hypothesis, and therefore, their acceptance is more based on belief than on discernment. The people who study things paranormal, including survival, are known as parapsychologists. In practice, most parapsychologists are closer to the center with perhaps less than ten percent supporting survival. Even amongst parapsychologists, most are poorly informed about the science and would be unable to apply what they know about it to pose a well-informed argument for or against. When current understanding of psi functioning, psychology, physical science and reported possibly paranormal experiences are considered, it becomes evident that rather than asking if survival is real, it is better to seek understanding about the nature of consciousness as it relates to psi functioning. In the question\u2019s wording, the assumption of \u201csurvivorship bias was reduced and failed or inconclusive studies were published\u201d presuppose that survival is not a fact. It may not be a fact, but the existence of considerable research and anecdotal evidence supporting the hypothesis must be accounted for. Any study failing to address that evidence is incomplete and is not science. ",
