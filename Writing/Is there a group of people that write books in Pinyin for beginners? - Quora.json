Trust me and forgive me for not elaborating, as I\u2019ve included this view together with pinyin texts I wrote myself in my other answers. Mind you, a lot of people, Chinese or non-Chinese, rely on characters for their livelihood. Of course they shall not donate pinyin to you. To get around Hanzi Wall: Hightlight texts, Copy, Paste, Convert and Refine. To write pinyin articles, you may use iPad self defined dictionary and short cuts. For example, tpye yw, you\u2019ll get yinwei; type sy, you\u2019ll get suoyi, etc. http://m.fuhaoku.com/tool/pinyin.html ",

BCR starts with very simple texts that repeat the same common characters over and over again. I have thought of producing some easy reading texts all in romanization, but it may not be worth the effort. ",
