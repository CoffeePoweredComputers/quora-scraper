            "answer_text": "How to write an apology letter to your best friend will depend on a lot of things. For example, how wrong was the thing you did? If someone raped, beat up, or stole from their friend (for example), I wouldn\u2019t advise that they write a letter of apology. I would advise them to leave that person alone and let them heal and grieve and decide whether or not to have contact, and under what circumstances. Some things just can\u2019t be \u2018fixed\u2019 and trying to maintain contact when there\u2019s been abuse or a crime committed is only going to make things worse for everyone. And trying to make a list of excuses of why you did what you did and to make up reasons why the friend should forgive you isn\u2019t going to make things better between you, even if you know/believe that it was \u2018just a one-time thing\u2019. Hopefully that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. Sometimes the friendship, for whatever reason, is just over. Maybe something bad happened, or maybe the friends simply drifted apart and realized that they don\u2019t have anything in common and getting together is awkward, annoying, or takes too much energy away from things that they\u2019d rather do. In a situation like that, especially when feelings of loyalty and nostalgia keep coming up, it\u2019s tempting to try to find closure through a letter or a card, but really, you\u2019re just keeping a wound open. People change and grow, and although it\u2019s nice to believe and hope that all of us will love our friends and be with them all our lives, the fact is that lifelong friendships are pretty rare. In such a situation write a short letter expressing your feelings about the friendship, but then put it away in a memory box or maybe hold a little ceremony where you take the note and burn it and then blow out a candle to say goodbye to the friendship, or write it on ecologically safe paper with non-toxic ink, make a little boat out of it, and release it into a river. If you keep attempting to make contact the other person will feel obligated to try to respond in some way, and that constant push-pull of obligation and growing apart tends to make things hurt for far longer than they need to. If there really is a reasonable chance that you and your friend can continue the friendship, then sometimes it\u2019s best to keep it simple. Find a card that you know your friend would really like, and write something like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I miss you. I hope you forgive me. Call me if you can.\u201d Or something like that. If that person is not someone who likes cards, then a simple email or text will work. Don\u2019t keep texting over and over, though. Instead of emphasizing your desire to make amends, it becomes creepy and stalkerish, and the person is very likely to just block you or delete your emails unread. If that\u2019s already happened, I think it\u2019s important to back off instead of repeatedly trying to make contact. Using a different format, like a written letter, is not going to make things better. It will make things worse. You can\u2019t force the friendship to continue, so trying to make your friend understand how you feel and the sincerity of your apology is only going to make your friend feel like you\u2019re not listening to them when they ask you to stop trying to contact them. I hope that you and your friend make amends, or if not, that you forgive yourself, even if your friend doesn\u2019t forgive you. And if you did something really awful, please don\u2019t just live with that as-is. It\u2019s more important that you seek counseling or some other form of help instead of making amends. The loss of a friendship in the case of an egregious injury that you\u2019ve inflicted is the least of your worries. You\u2019ll need to do some soul-searching at the very least, and possibly get some professional help to not only make sure that you don\u2019t do something similar again for the sake of those around you, but also so that you yourself have a higher quality of life. Take care and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Dear XYZ, I realize you don't have me now and you don't want to have anything to do with me or our friendship anymore. I accept that. But before I go away for good, there are some things I really need to say. I'm not gonna go away bitter or mad, I'm just gonna let it go and cherish the friendship that we had. I know I\u2019m probably the last person you want to hear from, but please hear me out. I don't know where to start so I\u2019ll start with this; I\u2019m really upset that our friendship is gone and it made me miserable for the past couple of months. I just want to say I'm sincerely sorry for putting you through my angry/frustration. I know I made it seem like your fault, but it was never your fault, I was lying to myself and it was easier to blame you than to realise that. Our friendship is too valuable to me to end over this. To find another friend like you would be impossible, you\u2019re caring, patient, funny... I can go on and on, and it doesn't feel right without you anymore. I didn't mean for things to be like this and wish I could take everything back to when we were close friends, I know I can't but I can show you that this will never happen again and I'm still the guy you trusted and thought of as your best friend. I keep apologising because I\u2019ve been completely in the wrong to be so inconsiderate and act like I have, I wasn't the friend I should have been but I don't want to lose you because I think you're worth holding on to, I don't know why, but whenever I had a bad day, or week you always made me feel better, you were one of the few who could do that. I hope you forgive me :) Your friend, ABC. ",
