            "answer_text": "Before I answer any question about Belgium, I always make clear that I live in Flanders. So my perspective is from someone living in the northern part of Belgium and of course very personal. However these 4 answers below are often heard in our parts: The weather can be very depressing from November to February Since I am writing this answer at the end of November, I\u2019d have to start with the weather. Although moderate by means of temperature, it gets grey for a long period of time. The above picture shows what we get for about 4 months. I know a girl from Russia who really hated this weather. She said that back home it got very cold, but the skies would be clear most of the time. A family from South Africa who used to live down the street from me thought otherwise. They loved our 4 seasons and the weather changes as in SA, the sun shined all the time, always. I guess beauty is in the eyes of the beholder but we do get more suicides and mental illnes in the fall here. 2. Don\u2019t stick your head above the ground level is an expression in Dutch which discourages people who want to stand out from the crowd. Most of us just go about our day, minding our own business and watching those who from time to time try to achieve greatness. Just to laugh and comment them whenever they hit an obstacle. The very fact we\u2019ve got a saying to prevent you from giving something your best shot, says a lot imho.  3. Living close to one another When you live in Flanders, your neighbour\u2019s not far away. Nor is: his barking doghis lorry gearing up at 4 a.mhis spouse screaming at him at nighthis children playinghis\u2026 Oh well, you get the idea. 4. The undefeated, undisputed champion of the world in\u2026 taxes Belgium has a progressive tax, which means that higher-income individuals pay more taxes than lower-income individuals do. Its top progressive rate is 50%.  Income from property, work, investments and miscellaneous sources is all taxable. Employees also pay a social security tax of 13.07% of their income. It\u2019s not exceptional that people are better of not working and living on a unemployment fee. A lot of people are also buying services and goods undeclared, avoiding the 21% VAT. Of course this leads to less public income and\u2026 higher taxes\u2026 ",

It\u2019s a unoutspoken low profile country with a bureaucratic government focust on bullshit issues, taxes and low profile politici. It\u2019s a country were people try to do their own things avoiding government and other officials as much as possible. ",
