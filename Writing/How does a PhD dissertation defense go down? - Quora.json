            "answer_text": "The answer to your question depends partly on the country. The shared parts are that the candidate gives a short explanation of the research (try to give this as a real presentation, not a recital!), and is then asked questions by a Committee that includes the candidate\u2019s Supervisor and experts from your university and from further afield. Only the Committee can ask you questions. For each question, a good strategy is to thank the person for the question, then repeat/rephrase it to be sure that everyone understands YOUR understanding of the question (hopefully the same as the questioner\u2019s). Then answer it, possibly referring to specific passages in your dissertation. The amount of time allotted to questions is timed carefully, and its end can be abrupt. It can be very useful to work with a coach in advance, so that you have a strategy for different types of questions \u2014 for example those where you don\u2019t know the answer or those that are really outside the scope of your work or those where the Committee member is mistaken. It\u2019s useful to have strategies worked out in advance. That part may be public or private, depending on the country you are in. The Committee then has a private conversation about whether to grant a degree and whether to give it a distinction. You cannot hear any of this. The original ceremony then re-convenes to tell you the result. This is where it can be different. Where the defense is public, it is likely that your Supervisor will not let you defend until passing is a certainty. That means you will already have done a lot of revision in advance. A yes includes handing over your PhD certificate and sash. It is still possible to fail, if people don\u2019t believe the work is yours or they have evidence that it\u2019s plagiarised, for example. If the whole thing is behind closed doors, you are likely to be asked to make certain revisions \u2014 but the committee will generally (assuming there is no need to fail you \u2014 as above) sign the necessary paperwork and leave it to your Supervisor to make sure you make these revisions. There may also be other, purely national rituals (the paranymphs, in The Netherlands, for example), that your Supervisor can tell you about. If you live where PhD defenses are public, attend a few. It may put your mind at ease. ",
