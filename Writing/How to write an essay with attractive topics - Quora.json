            "answer_text": "First, there is a potential ethical issue here. One who writes paid essays may well be helping students cheat their way through college. You should only write essays for publication or posting on a website, etc., legitimate reasons \u2014 not to help students cheat on their education. If a student can\u2019t write their own assigned essays they don\u2019t deserve a passing grade. Services that are guaranteeing a grade and high security are probably helping students get expelled from school and blacklisted if they get caught turning in assignments that are not their original work. Doing that is extremely risky because it\u2019s easy to detect this kind of cheating. A student\u2019s entire future life can be affected by academic cheating. Ghostwriting academic essays is morally corrupt and buying them for submission as your own original work is just as wrong as plagiarism. In fact, it falls within the definition of plagiarism, which is to represent that someone else\u2019s writing is your own. My personal ethics prevent me from offering essay writing services for this reason. I essay for legitimate publication only. If I also get paid, then that is acceptable. Or I need to assure in some way I am not helping to defeat the educational system. Some of my friends in college got expelled for this kind of thing. Next, the answer is simple. You need to derive essay topic keywords and use the free Google search term tools to rank the keywords for popularity. Keywords that are also essay topics and also in high demand in the market are popular, by definition.Popular keywords mean attractive topics if you do this well. Good luck with your honest, original essay writing. Don\u2019t sell your soul for money! Joseph ",
