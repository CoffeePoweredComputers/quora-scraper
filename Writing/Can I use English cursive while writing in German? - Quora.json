            "answer_text": "I'll have to disagree with the answers posted before this. Umlaute and \u00df are not going to be a problem. Place two dots above your regular os, as and us, and you'll be fine. Use \u00df where appropriate.  The problem is that proper English Cursive is fairly different from the two sorts of cursive that are taught in German Schools. A nice, well-developed English Cursive handwriting is a bit hard to read for most Germans - mind you: not as hard as the German Cursive/S\u00fctterlin type scripts in use in Germany up to roughly WW2, but still... With a simplified Cursive / Block hybrid, you should do fine, really. It'll be quite similar to most Germans' everyday handwriting. If you're going to handwrite longish texts that need to be read by others frequently, you might want to stick with Block letters,  but otherwise, I wouldn't worry about it much. ",

            "answer_text": "You can do that if you write the Umlaute \"oe\" \"ue\" and \"ae\". But the \u00df will be a problem since if you write \"ss\" it will be a misspelling. Especially because 20 years ago \"dass\" was spelled \"da\u00df\" and many other words. So it's not always as well. Because of that everyone is aware of the difference and they might think it is a mistake, which might take you a few points in an exam. But just for communication it's totally fine. ",

Hence any German should be able to easily read your letters. (I struggle daily with my colleagues' chicken scratch handwriting.) Be aware about dates, though.Our syntax goes DD.MM.YYYY.It'd be awkward to mix up i.e. 10.04.2016 (US: 04/10/2016) with 04.10.2016 (US 10/04/2016). ",
