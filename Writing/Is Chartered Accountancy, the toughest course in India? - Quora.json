            "answer_text": "No, I don't think CA is the toughest course in India. Medical science seems the toughest course to me. In order to become a doctor you have to start working right from class 11 onwards because the medical entrances in India are difficult and if you miss out on the government college seats you have to pay a quite steep fees for a private college seat. Once you get into a bds/mbbs course, you have to work for 3/4 years for your degree. Not only is the course quite vast, the terminologies are quite complex to remember and ultimately you have to remember each and every minute detail because one mistake can endanger a human life and that is quite a heavy burden to live with. After you are done with your study of 3/4 years you have to intern for a year and that marks the end of your bachelors degree. The pay is quite less and the hours are long. Sometimes students face trouble to find patients to perform practicals- practicals on which they are going to be marked. Imagine, if you cannot find enough patients or you make a mistake on that one fateful day, you stand compromising the past 4/5 years of your study. If you choose to do masters, you have to keep studying for clearing another entrance. Masters is usually 3 years long and you have to constantly work as resident doctors. The hours again are long and often the shifts go late in the night. You might not be able to squeeze enough time to have a meal peacefully. Also imagine being surrounded with sights of illness and blood, day in and out. You are working and learning continuously and you have no clue where your life is headed. Getting jobs is a problem, setting up a private practice requires hefty capital investment in instruments and clinic space. And building goodwill takes a long time especially when a doctor is involved because any other damage can be undone or rectified but a dent in your health due to wrong treatment may or may not be capable of being undone. I am pursuing Chartered Accountancy and I know what a pain is to struggle with the complexities of the course and the irregularities of the system. This course can be depressing. But I still don't believe it is as tough and as vast and as challenging as becoming a doctor. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the answer and then you yourself will know the answer without me telling you. The journey of a CA student starts from CPT (I will come to direct entry in the later part of this answer) where the student is made to sit for 10 hours everyday if he appears for CPT in 2 months. 4 big modules containing loads of information. How easy!Then comes CA Intermediate. Huge portion to learn in a limited amount of time. If you are enrolled in the new course, you have to study 26 huge books in 10 months along with additional material provided by the coaching classes. I won\u2019t take RTP into consideration. Very easy!Now comes King of the Ring, CA FINAL. This is to be studied alongwith the dreaded articleship period of 2.5 years approximately where you have new situations coming up every single day at your office as well as coaching classes. If you are staying at a PG or hostel, you have added troubles of that too. Easiest of all!!If you cannot clear this course in first attempt, people taunt you and you have to go through the worst shit of your life. Sometimes, even parents do not support you. YES, the same people who were there for you until now, might not support you in some cases. Again, how simple!If you enter this course through direct entry scheme, i.e. after the completion of your bachelor degree, you are screwed more, as you have to commence articleship along with CA Inter where time is a big constraint even without doing articleship. Don\u2019t tell me that this is difficult\u2026.Working hours are never less than 12 in a day. Show me a CA student who doesn\u2019t work for 12 hours and I will agree with you that CA is overrated in India.We crave for vacations as Sundays are never \u2018Sundays\u2019 for us.Even after becoming a CA, the struggle doesn\u2019t end. You have a huge responsibility on your shoulders as the financial engineer of the economy. THE WALL too, mentioned the importance of CA and the kind of efforts and sacrifice that CA course demands from you.Many people say that a CA student doesn\u2019t know how to enjoy but that person has not met a CA student in his vacation time. Meet us once in our vacation, and we will show you how \u2018wild\u2019 we can become.CA students belong to that tribe, who craves for vacation but has to work real hard to enjoy the vacation.BCom? What is that? We just write papers but we don\u2019t know the subjects. Yeah, but we do pass in all of them.Never ever say that CA is overrated, as we work our ass off to get that prefix before our name, and we have every right to be proud of that prefix as well as our honoured profession.Just to have a look at how I prepare for my CA exams, take a look at this answer: Anmol Khimani's answer to Can CA aspirants share pictures of their study room?Kudos to CA students as well as Chartered Accountants. Your appreciation makes me write more and more. Thanks for reading. Ever yours, Anmol Khimani #A. ",
