I would like to know what causes tef and why do daily updates on the QPP dashboard total earnings rise and fall? Rises out of the blue are as mysterious as falls; Neither monthly, weekly or daily earnings add up or match tef movements. The figures don't add up or give a clue or reason what or why wise, except possible mergers gone unnoticed or reverted and deletions. On mergers I have read and duly noted and noticed earnings on a question. Then losing those earnings as a result of a question merger. When the merger is in error, appealled, then reverted, earnings reappear from zero or where they were before the merger? When a merged question is unmerged it returns to qualify for further earnings if any. I understand the process here and not the why. (It feels retrograde and unfair here.) Attempting to do or run a business in the dark regardless if it's for pennies or peanuts has a labour of something other than love of money to do with it. Fumbling in the darkness, combined with other influences and curtailments is almost a sectionable behaviour or one with a short future to look forward to. I love being a Quora User. Quora partner and I don't care how others think. I will not throw it away or be instrumental as far as I'm able in being banned or thrown out ,without a clue or or warning. I accept it as a given that none of us here are immune to unknown Lurkers and Users activities. I can handle some mystery with faith and good will no problem. Money mysteries though can keep me up at night trying to figure them out. Second guessing, going round in circles looking for answers in the same place. Makes getting to sleep frustrating and a pointless waste of a good night\u2019s rest. Can anyone help or get help to explain the reasoning and options available to find out why tef's occur in the first place. (As the advertiser has paid-up job-done, why take back what's already been duly earned and fairly accounted for, drawn on and banked?)  This post is the basis of a draft for an email to Quora partners help and information desk. If you have anything to add or know more about QPP tef\u2019s please comment on here.Thank you.

In this context, \u201cconcern\u201d is not used in the sense of \u201cto worry\u201d, but rather, in one of its original senses of \u201cto be of interest\u201d, so \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d means that the letter is addressed to whoever is the person most suitable to deal with the matter raised in the letter, especially if you do not know the name of the person or the rank or position they hold, or if the letter is to be sent to more than one recipient. For example, if someone asks me to write a letter of personal reference, I will begin the letter \u201cTo whom it may concern\u201d as I anticipate that it will be sent to a number of different people or companies.
