            "answer_text": "Yes, i also had this feeling before, sometimes I still do. I guess you can say it's some form of psychological interference from the way normal things work. It seems there is always an answer to every question. But looking at ones self from another perspective, we must understand that we are not just body and consciousness, but body consciousness and spirit. Our body communicates with us through nerves, our consciousness with our thoughts, and our spirit through our way we have yet to understand. Our spirit is our true self which knows all but tells little. Our mind is our fabricated self that knows little but tells all. When we entered into this physical realm, we became disconnected from our spiritual self (it's sort of like an oil and vinegar mixing sort of thing). That is why we have little knowledge of our true self; we only feel ripples or reflections that bounces us along in our life. Little by little, our true self seeps out of us and it combines with the world around us and we have what is known as a fabricated identity. This is what not only us but other people see when they look at us. Every now and then when we become disconnected to the world around us and draw within ourselves, we sometimes have the ability to mix the oil with the vinegar. This sometimes is that third person perspective that we become aware of. Sometimes it's easy to confuse this third person perspective with a symptom of a multiple personality disorder, which most times if you talk to a psychiatrist they will agree to, but when it's only this one person and the thoughts are different from a multiple personality disorder symptom, then you know well who it is. I'm not saying that this is what you have, all I am saying is that this is coming from a different perspective. Maybe you do have a multiple personality disorder, I certainly am not one to say. All I am saying is \"what if\"... ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDissociation\u201d or \u201cdepersonalization\u201d might be terms used by a therapist, if you were to talk to one. I\u2019m not so sure that you need therapy, because I suspect that your situation is pretty common and easily explained \u2014 but be alert\u2026 if this explanation doesn\u2019t ring for you, you might want to seek help. It could be more serious. Everyone has an ego \u2014 I don\u2019t mean that \u201ceveryone thinks they\u2019re better than everyone else\u201d, in this case the word \u2018ego\u2019 is more technical: we have concepts of who we are, and those concepts are vulnerable to various kinds of psychological threats. For example, if you believe that you\u2019re a good singer, but you get mocked during a karaoke session at the local bar, you will probably feel shame and anger and self-doubt. That is a \u201cthreat to the ego\u201d: evidence that you\u2019re not who you think you are or would like to be. Because of the way that ego is constructed, it\u2019s always vulnerable \u2014 there\u2019s always some possibility that something which will happen could invalidate your ego. Some people get so accustomed to the anxiety of this that they don\u2019t notice it anymore. And, they structure their lives to avoid all of the things that might cause anxiety, by eliminating any possible situations where ego invalidation might occur. They take no risks, make no promises, offer no claims to being special or different, etc. \u201cLiving small\u201d is a phrase which hints at that approach. Another strategy for reducing the anxiety associated with ego maintenance is to \u201cbecome the observer\u201d \u2014 to take the perspective that you\u2019re just a spectator in the stands of life, not really a participant on the playing field. The observer can\u2019t lose, right? Especially if they don\u2019t even cheer for one side in the contest. Being an observer is a low-risk way to be: the sportscasters aren\u2019t going to call you out for missing a kick, if you\u2019re up in the stands just watching. You\u2019re safe. But there\u2019s a downside to all of these ego-preservation strategies: if you have to protect yourself from all risks in life, or detach yourself from fully engaging, life becomes less alive. You don\u2019t feel much, you don\u2019t have a lot of vision or commitments, you don\u2019t love deeply, you don\u2019t get to experience the richness of living. Meanwhile, time is passing. And it doesn\u2019t go on forever. At some point, it\u2019s likely that a part of your mind will start doing the math, and asking \u201cis that all there is?\u201d\u2026 a sense of loss or despair, a sense that life is passing you by, a longing to be more real and alive\u2026 those kinds of thoughts and feelings may start to torment you. The regret of looking back and realizing that you never really started your life is a pretty sharp pain. Maybe sharp enough to wake someone up. But do you want it going that far? ",
