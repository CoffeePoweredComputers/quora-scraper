In terms of television programs which have attempted to compete with SNL in its time slot, the most notable was \u201cMad TV\u201d, which aired from 11PM to Midnight on Saturday nights from 1995 to 2009. Other competition included a pair of shows hosted by Howard Stern in the 1990s, one on local NYC area station WWOR and another syndicated by CBS. However, SNL has never had a serious ratings threat in its timeslot through its 40+ year run. ",
