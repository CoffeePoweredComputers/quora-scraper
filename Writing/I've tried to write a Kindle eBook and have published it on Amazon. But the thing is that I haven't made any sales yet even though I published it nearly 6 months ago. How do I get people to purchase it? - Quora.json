            "answer_text": "I had to go to the India site (after reading another answer) and typing in your name in order to find your book. That\u2019s your first mistake. India is about the worst performing Amazon store for eBooks. Publish it everywhere! You cover image is fine, although the planet looks like its been squashed by changing the image size. But why are the titles duplicated? It not only looks weird, it jars you as downright peculiar. The blurb is boring, and it\u2019s plot. Who is the main character? What are the challenges? What are the stakes? No plot, no backstory. No sales - no rank, so impossible to see what categories you selected. But since you didn\u2019t publish in the .com store, you probably didn\u2019t use any of the special keywords either. Lose the about the author in the front matter. That goes on your authorcentral page, not inside the front of books. And I wouldn\u2019t mention English teachers in it, just you love of space. It\u2019s very obvious English is your second language. What I dont understand if you only put this in the India store, is why is it in English? (Edit: I see it is on the other stores, but your name wasn\u2019t findable in the search function, and you haven\u2019t created an Author Central account, which you need to do.) Lose the Alert. Its a serious turn off for would be readers. They can see its a short book by looking at the pages number, they dont need to be told you might be doing longer books. No-one cares about this sort of thing. Until you get book 3 out, no-one is going to take you seriously. The copyright statement needs work, but you dont put it in as an alert. Its just a statement after the copyright, which you didn\u2019t do. Check what other books do, and make it similar. Your table of contents is for a print book. You don\u2019t put in numbers, since eBooks don\u2019t have fixed pages. You do a ToC with links to the chapters, not page numbers. Your formatting appears to be corrupted. If this was deliberate, you have an issue to work out. Dialogue by different people goes on separate paragraphs. The way this is presented now, makes it almost unreadable. This needs a professional editor. I\u2019m sorry to be blunt, but as presented, this is unlikely to ever be fully read. Just the insertion of time breaks and place breaks makes the story disjointed, and puts off any one reading further. This is not how you write a novel. You probably have a decent story there somewhere, but there is so much wrong with this, it\u2019s no surprise you made no sales. Lastly, it\u2019s overpriced. You have US$2 on it, when it can\u2019t command more than 99c. So it should be whatever the minimum India price is for 35% royalty. No short story for a new author can command more than 99c. I suggest you find an author forum or group where you can ask for advice on how to fix this, or find an editor who can. But it needs a serious amount of work. Edit: I\u2019m taking the liberty of adding in a comment and my answer to that, since its worth it for anyone reading. Sorry for all the trouble sir, I\u2019m giving up on writing. No, don\u2019t do that. Every single author wrote a crap book the first time, with no exceptions. Every single successful author had to figure out how. Every single author now making a living from novels at one time said exactly what you just did. Park your ego. That\u2019s what tells you to quit. You need help from other authors on how to present your ideas. You need an editor (everyone does to start with). And you probably need to read a lot more of the successful books to see how they flow. Being an author is a long and brutal learning curve, but if you are a writer, you\u2019ll go the distance. Hang in there. You made a start. All you need now is to hone your craft. It takes time, and brutal advice taken to heart makes you a better writer. Every single author had something similar said about their first novel. You just chose to do it publicly. Take the lumps, and work on your writing. As the captain says in Galaxy Quest: Never give up, never surrender! Or an older quote: Full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes! ",
