            "answer_text": "Yes, they MUST be included in CAC. CAC by definition must be FULLY LOADED with anything and everything that is included in acquiring a customer. Sales commissions are 100% part of that. They must be always included. In fact, you must include all salaries, all discretionary budgets in marketing and sales, even the real estate area that is commensurate with the amount of space your sales and marketing teams use. Otherwise you will get a false positive of a lower CAC and you don\u2019t want to start scaling unless you really know correct SaaS metrics. Also see my answers here where I go into more detail on this point: What are some of the known data points or benchmarks for CAC (Customer Acquisition Costs) in B2B Enterprise SaaS?How should I calculate customer acquisition costs in a B2B SaaS business?",

            "answer_text": "Either way you\u2019d arrive at the same LTV/CAC ratios. Since the commissions are a cost of acquiring the customer, adding them to CAC seems \u201cmost correct.\u201d Depending on what other insights you get from your CAC and LTV, subtracting them from LTV instead might muddy up some of your other calculations. For example: pulling a high-LTV group so you can understand who your high value customers are and how to find more of them. This is something that would be affected if you took sales commission out of some customer\u2019s LTVs - they might erroneously get bumped down into a lower LTV bracket. ",
