            "answer_text": "The prime reason could be that Chetan Bhagat does not write Books! He writes screenplays! All his books have typo errors, and flout all possible rules of grammar.. Like that wasn't enough, it adds no literature value. They are mere gossip columns with a fair mix of action, romance, friendship and sex. The 'hinglish' used in the books are the final nail in the coffin called 'books' by Chetan Bhagat. So when the whole intent is to present masala, and not value addition, filmmakers get what they desire the most, a 'paki pakai script' ",

            "answer_text": "He chooses themes that appeal and converts them into stories that have no substance, much like many of the movies being made in the Indian Film Industry off late. His sole purpose is to create a script full of vernacular. People consume them because they are presented like an easy Hindi film with a backdrop, a hero, a heroine. There's plenty of scope to add music, drama, comedy and tragedy and viola! You have a quickly concocted, ready-to-use film for Bollywood's easy consumption! ",
