            "answer_text": "In the US, at least, everyone does have access to an enormous number of books for free. We call this system a public library. But libraries buy the books and there\u2019s no good reason to make all books free for all in every other situation. If you do that, then you have the following problems. Depending upon how you do this, it\u2019s likely that no writer or editor or cover/interior designer will ever get paid. Why would they work for free? Some will of course, but they tend to write the stuff that only a tiny fraction of the reading public want to read, and almost none of the books that people need to read. (Textbooks especially will stop being published as they tend to be EXTREMELY expensive to produce.) If you have governments pay for books, then which books will they support, and how will they decide who gets how much money? In the US, we have almost 1,000,000 different titles and editions produced every year. The vast majority sink without trace, usually because they\u2019re dreadfully badly written, or at least not as good as several other titles that are very similar. But of the 100,000 or so that do well, who will decide which ones are how good? Literary critics? They have a dreadful track record at predicting what the reading public really wants and how much they want it. Civil servants? Not really a good idea either. Look at the popularity of selections from the NEA, for example. The market does an exceptional job of making sure that the people who produce the books that readers want most get the most money. That seems like a good idea to me. As for poorer nations: as long as they\u2019re not indulging in rampant piracy, publishers routinely donate container-loads of extra books to them. Of course, there are quite a few countries where people feel entitled to steal the work of the publishers and authors and they don\u2019t get a thing. But that\u2019s fair, too, don\u2019t you think?
