            "answer_text": "As a new author, I did a lot of researching on this prior to writing my first book (and am in the process of writing the second - so the research continues!) I found that the best selling business books are around 100\u2013150 pages - but this translates into 30,000\u201340,000 words which is a more accurate number because of fonts, page sizes, margins, etc. Most business books in general are 200 or less simply because after that point it becomes very repetitive or the content gets very specific, limiting the audience of the book. This also did not include business books for a specific function - such as a mathematical explanation textbook on option pricing. Yes, this is a business book but with a very narrow focus and specific implication. I did research on general topic business books, not specifically used in an academic setting - which also tend to have higher page numbers due to the nature of the writing. For my next book, I\u2019m aiming for 35,000 - over half way there! ",

After that, the author usually finds multiple ways of describing the same concept. Stick to books of 200 pages or less and you'll learn a lot without wasting much time.
