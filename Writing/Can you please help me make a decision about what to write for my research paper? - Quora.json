            "answer_text": "Research writing develops as you write. There is always a question what to write and what not to, and this leads to confusion. Here are few tips to keep in mind while writing a research paper (based on my research experience so far): Most important: Have a feeling, I need to write the greatest research paper of all times.Each word counts: if a thought can be expressed in 10 words, never use 11.Each sentence is important: Convey as much information in less sentences.Provide enough context: The paragraph should continue the story. Always answer, why do you write this paragraph as first sentence of every paragraph.Introduction is the summary of the paper and abstract is the summary of the introduction.Conclusion is additional information to the abstract. It is meant to attract the attention of the reader to your research paper. So, don\u2019t forget to provide the key findings, scientific methodology, and the future scope of your research.Last but not least: follow the following flow chart: Follow the next flowchart too and quickly grasp the fundamentals of research:  ",
