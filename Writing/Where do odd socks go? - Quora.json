            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an issue which has puzzled launderers for decades. The prevailing mechanical theory is that they sometimes work their way past the rotating drum into the larger machine, where they wear away over time and the resulting lint is likely expelled through the vent tube. On a different note, Jerry Seinfeld once explained it in a comedy routine, where he explained the life of a sock consisting of nothing but being crammed into stinky shoes. And occasionally, one of them decides to make a break for it and try to find freedom. He created the image of a lone sock lurking inside the inner doorway of a dryer, waiting for their chance, and when the person\u2019s back is turned, they make their escape. But, unfortunately, we\u2019ve all had the experience of driving down the street and seen a dirty, rumpled sock lying forlornly next to the curb. Another sock that didn\u2019t make it. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to realize, they are just a part of a complex life cycle. The earliest stage is dust bunnies, typically found under beds and behind couches. These will slowly grow until they undergo the first metamorphosis into socks. At the appropriate time these will migrate out of the house and undergo their second change, appearing as tire retreads, typically along highways. Another few months and they undergo their final metamorphosis and are seen as abandoned mattresses in ditches. As they decay, they resultant dust bunnies migrate back indoors to complete the life cycle. They are thought to be distantly related to the paper clip, empty pen, Budweiser beer can, rusty bicycle organism. ",
