            "answer_text": "Most of the other answers here are what I'd call Feel Good answers--ones that display the writer's warmheartedness while failing to address the issue.  Actually, issues. \"Homeless\" is the wrong word, to start with. It assumes that the street person in front of you, begging or just hanging out while looking disheveled, is homeless--and that the person's putatitve homelessness defines their problem. But many so-called homeless have homes, and you're jumping to conclusions from the way they look. The best-known professional beggar in my small city, for example, turns out to have a government-subsidized home in a nearby city, to which he returns every night from my more affluent one where the begging is more lucrative. Even more important, a third to two-thirds of what are called homeless people are mentally ill (it varies by whether you agree that drug/alcohol addicts are mentally ill). These people don't want your homeless shelters unless they're allowed to get high on the premises (none allow this of course). And many actually homeless people who are not mentally ill don't want to stay at government shelters because they're afraid of those who are mentally ill--often for good reason. Liberals and conservatives colluded to empty the nation's insane asylums out onto the streets back in the 60s and 70s. Now instead of insane asylums we have the streets and the prisons (at least a third of America's prison population is mentally ill--many severely so). We think we treat the insane more humanely than they did in the 19th century. In fact we're worse. Today you cannot commit anyone to an insane asylum involuntarily for more than a number of hours, in most cases. All over the country thousands of families live in terror of an insane adult son who keeps threatening to kill them--and the cops tell them their hands are tied until the son does kill them. Then they'll act.  So we need a policy for the mentally ill separate from a policy for sane homeless people. The unpalatable truth is that we need our insane asylums back. It's insane to let the insane run around loose--that's bad for both them and for us. Next, we have juvenile runaways, often escaping abusive family circumstances, some even having been kicked out of their homes. These need help within our foster care system.  Then we have the street people--ones who have homes but choose to make their living on the street begging, then kicking back the rest of the time. Here the question is: should begging be legal? And if you think it should, what about aggressive panhandling, say, of small women and the elderly, accosting them at ATMs? Still think that should be legal? Lastly there are the sane people who aren't drug users, who have been forced out of their homes by poverty. These are the homeless--and they deserve a different policy and different treatment from the insane, the runaways, and the street people. But there are also the cities and their merchants. Shoppers avoid areas thronged with street people--especially aggressive beggars. This materially impacts cities. Do these merchants and these cities deserve none of our warm-heartedness? ",

            "answer_text": "Currently I am homeless, I have been for a while now, dealt with this problem for an on and off stance due to financial problems, never been a drug addict or an alcoholic, currently I do have a clean record, no criminal charges currently, however I did ran into trouble with law enforcement before, I did snag two and three misdemeanor charges back when I was 18, 20 and 21 years old, it is a very personal and long story on how those three different occurrences have transpired and resulted. By the grace of God himself I have a clean record now, thankfully. but back to the whole situation at hand, here in Virginia, especially in Hampton Roads/ Tidewater where I am presently residing at, the homeless here are at an actual catch 22 stand still with services and resources that are not nearly adequate enough to help, it is a 50/50 draw basically. the commonwealth law has made it nearly impossible to attain housing and employment, no one likes to hear the cold hard truth about their own state\u2019s system and services behind closed doors, it isn\u2019t illegal to be homeless here, it is however also not legal to trespass either, Should it be Illegal to be homeless?? To the wealthy and well off, their answer wouldn\u2019t be too hard to say \u201cYES\u201d, now to the people that live a middle class to low income lifestyle?? their answer would be NO, more than likely, because Homelessness is not only a social problem, it is a people problem. we tend to forget that they have feelings too, they have as much human rights as the rest of us, there are actually two types of homeless people in this country in the US, one being the stereotypical vagabonds that rather sit on their ass and beg and feel like the world owes them everything and their in a delusional state, which is obviously mental illness at play in it\u2019s primal form, let alone drug addiction and alcoholism comes right behind that semi- narcissistic attitude and behavior, in some cases when an interaction is made between a homeless person and a stranger or pedestrian that walks past, it can scare people off and cause conflict and police involvement, this is where a lot of people would rather fixate and have an agenda on the homeless and assume all homeless people are unfit and deserve to be placed in an institution or jail for their irrationality. that\u2019s a real complex issue to help differentiate. then there are homeless people much more like myself and people similar to my situation, regardless of gender involved, that are fighting to get on their feet and get their own life back, it is hard out here, it seriously is! there isn\u2019t a day that goes by that I don\u2019t sit back and really look at our social crisis with the homeless population being at a rapid rise in our cities, I am doing the very best and hardest that I can to get out of this situation, legally and properly. as of right now, I was wondering if any of you would give me any accurate information on which city is more friendlier and willing to help the homeless, there isn\u2019t that many cities that are so enthusiastic and empathetic towards this situation. shit, if i was able to be a mayor or a city official for whatever state that I happen to live in, I\u2019d fight hard in the legal system to abolish any restriction on homelessness locally, I\u2019d rather see trade school workshops and local churches be openly willing to take people in and let them rest and recover for a good little bit and literally treat everyone like a decent human being for once, like seriously, it is sad as fuck to watch people laugh and taunt and belittle and bully the homeless, that shit really doesn\u2019t make any sense at all\u2026 any help will be greatly appreciative!! God Bless you guys!! and Thank you for taking the time, reading and considering my thoughts on it! ",
