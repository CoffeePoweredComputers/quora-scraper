            "answer_text": "To verify if your content is performing well or not, check if it is useful to your intended audience. A business should measure conversions: Content does not work in isolation. It is a business asset that not only represents what you do, but helps you conduct the business itself. So, good quality content will make business easier.Your Sales team will have to haggle less.Your Customer Care will have to answer fewer questions.Your PR will spend less time to douse fires.Your Marketing team will churn out less but more effective content.You will have more meaningful conversations with your customers.Your brand will keep growing stronger.Non-profits should measure the impact of their initiatives: Quality content would enable you to effectively utilize your resources.Helplines would be able to focus on aiding individuals in distress instead of clarifying what they can and cannot do to confused callers.Easy access to useful content would lead to better relationships with partners, donors, and regulatory authorities.You will be able to meet and even exceed the standards of transparency as expected by your audience, resulting in a stronger brand.All organizations must engage in testing!: What you measure, you can improve. Testing must becomes second nature to content creators. While it is natural to take directions from the leadership, the content team must play an active role in researching requirements and measuring the performance of content. This is better known as Content Design. Content that is effectively designer to meet the needs of the audience, will naturally perform well.I did not focus on Google Analytics since there are tons of useful articles out there already on this subject. My inputs are about the big picture results that you should expect after creating content and optimizing it for Google Analytics. However, good content needs time to deliver results. Rush jobs may bring some attention your way, but it won\u2019t be enduring. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many ways to figure out the performance of your content. But in order to keep it simple. I only stick to 2 metrics. #1 - Heat Maps #2 - Email Susbscribers With heat maps I get to know how much and where all audience engaged with my content. The more dense the heat map, the more is the audience relating with the content. Secondly, with the email opt-ins I get to know how much did the content convert. This is the real test as to whether or not the content evoked the audience to take the call to action. ",
