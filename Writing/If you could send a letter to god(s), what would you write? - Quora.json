            "answer_text": "Last night, I had a dream that I was becoming angry with my brother because I would open my mouth and he would say what I was about to say including \"Stop it\" and \"Shut the **** up\".   That dream turns out to be very relevant to my answer.  I believe in an omnipresent, omniscient God who knows me much better than it's possible for one human to know another.  He already knew the prayer that I will pray tomorrow before humans ever came into existence.   So the letter I would send to God is no different from what I pray every day. And the reason that I pray is for me.  Prayer makes me take note of the people around me who need things and turns my heart and mind to God.  But then, I can take this question in another sense.  If I were to write a letter to God, simply what I would I say? Dear Lord:  Thank you for the existence you've given me.  Thank you for all the great people in my life.  Help me remember to take care of them and think of where I can help them the most.  Help me to remember everything they do for me.   I'm grateful for being where I am at, since the majority of the world was not born into and does not have everything that I have.  Help me take care of the people around me and remember how lucky I am.  I struggle to build things and bring my own dreams about.  I hope this is what you intended me to do because that's where my yearning is.  Take care of all of us.... protect us from one another.... Help us all to remember what we have and for those of us who can share to share the wealth.  I love you very much, Lord, and hope to see You after I die.  In Jesus' name, Amen.      ",
