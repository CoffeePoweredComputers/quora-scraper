            "answer_text": "Since fanfiction is my literal drug of choice, here\u2019s some Dramione fics you should savor. These fics are not for the light of heart nor are they written horribly. The writers are magnificent. Matter of fact\u2026anyone interested in checking out this sordid, hysterical, wtf was I drinking last night couple should hit these stories up. Most of these are ranging from T to M, cause seriously\u2026anything less is an insult.  Mine By: Curiositykils (Veela Fic set Ten Years after the War. Draco is a Veela. Hermione isn't his Healer. She's just his.) There have been a few fics to top this, but yeaaah\u2026if there was a GOLD STANDARD, than this is it. I just read the title and already started turning red. hahahaha19 years later By: Cuteblndegoddess (Post DH. Canon with all seven books. Hermione and Draco have to work together on what should be a simple project. But something that happened 19 years earlier changes both of them. Dramione eventually.) Snarky, wholesome, freaking goodness!Isolation by Bex-chan (He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. \"There,\" she spat. \"Now your Blood's filthy too!\" DM/HG. PostHBP. Now complete with epilogue.) Read this supernova and leave a love letter to the fanfic authorThe Slow Thaw By: camnz (Hermione is serving at Malfoy Mansion after the war was lost. In her bleak existance, she manages to find ways to cope. Contains nonconsentual. COMPLETE.) They lost the war\u2026Draconian Heart By: camnz (Hermione had known the bitter end was coming, but it still took her by surprise as their cottage was crumbling from the force of the Deatheaters' assault. There really wasn't any hope left, but she would fight none the less. The dark side had won and there was no place left in the world for the remnants of her side, so this is how it ends. Very DARK - contains non consentual.) Bad end, but damn good story. Probably keep tissues near by though\u2026 there\u2019s one helluva twist.Consequences by camnz (Hermione is acting funny, watching Malfoy during class and during dinner, and Ginny is urging Harry to do something. Surely Hermione couldn't be under the influence of a spell or a potion; she wasn't acting completely stupid, but then maybe she was too smart to show something like that.)DramaA Private War by camnz (Hogwarts decides to hold an academic tournament to rally the students after the end of the war, providing Hermione and Draco a chance to air some unfinished business.) A dazzling fic!!! <3 (Posted note: Haters can hate Dramione, but you can\u2019t deny the golden fanfics that spring forth for this pair! I always believed Draco had a deep seated lust/hate for Hermione. She was perfect in every way except for being a Gryfindor and a \u201cfilthy\u201d mudblood. Hermione stood up to him, was the brightest witch of her age, stood by Harry Potter, and destroyed every believed prejudice ever had by \u201cpurebloods\u201d. She\u2019s like a metaphorical kick to his nutz. Of course, Draco is gonna go apeshit and be the biggest asshole in the world to this chic. He wanted her to die, because she was untouchable. lmao) And he couldn\u2019t mess w/ her\u2026 ",

Operation Cheer up Granger But Don\u2019t Die Trying by MyPhoenixLament, rated T- It made the world seem a little unbalanced; Granger was supposed to be Grangerish, and that was simply a fact of life. In which Hermione behaves oddly, Draco goes to ridiculous lengths, and Harry has no idea what's going on. The Ten Labors of Draco and Hermione by evilrabidplotbunnies, rated T- THIS STORY IS DANGEROUS. IT HAS CAUSED NUMEROUS PEOPLE TO BE KICKED OUT OF LIBRARIES, RECEIVE STRANGE LOOKS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS, AND GO CLINICALLY INSANE. DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, READ THIS STORY. ESPECIALLY NOT CHAPTER 19. Suppressed Emotions by hopelesslydevoted.xx, Rated T- \"Granger what the hell?\" Draco asked looking at her ruffled clothes, and her face covered in blood. Hermione let out a loud sob and threw herself into his arms. - Draco and Hermione are forced to live together after Hermione gets attacked during patrolling. Relying on her worst enemy to keep her safe, what could go wrong, right? Children of The Dark by cleotheo, Rated T: It's time for Harry, Hermione and Draco to start school. But what happens when two of the golden trio aren't who they appear to be and are best friends with a Slytherin? Dark Hermione! Dark Harry! First in a seven part series. Queen of Swords by ravenslight, Rated M: Hermione Granger is the weapon they never intended to create. And she will bow down to no one. / Voldemort wins AU. Slowburn Dramione.

My recommendations are: The Hoax (Dramione Story)This is one of the clich\u00e9 plots that Hermione wants revenge on poor Ron, but the pace is somewhat slow, the romance I mean, and a great read. Simply IrresistibleAn AfterWar! story where all the characters are adults that have jobs. An interesting take on Dramione. I also recommend you read the sequel, it has a peek of the background in Hogwarts. Dramione: WANTEDThis one is gold.

It takes place a few years after the war and Ron cheated on Hermione with a model named Sadie because he had wanted something new, something different and Hermione was too invested in her work and never really made an effort, or at least not the kind of effort Ron wanted and needed. Sadie cheated on Draco with Ron, simply because she could and Draco contacted Hermione, originally it was so he could get revenge by making Hermione really beautiful to show Ron what he\u2019d been missing and it\u2019s revealed that the two slowly became friends when they retook their seventh year at Hogwarts with Ron and Harry. The two eventually have feelings for each other. I don\u2019t usually like Dramione fan fiction but this one is so beautifully written and makes so much sense that I love it. https://my.w.tt/B1vUpUSB47 ",
