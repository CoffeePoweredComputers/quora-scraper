            "answer_text": "Readers don\u2019t respond to paragraphs; they respond to passion and intensity and the tumbling of sonorous words. If your paragraph strikes their heart, their mind, and\u2014with your care as a writer\u2014their ear as well, they will read it over and over, share it, quote it, pass it from hand to hand. People who have never heard of stanzas or iambic pentameter love to recite their favourite lines from Shakespeare. If you write about a single small thought, and ease it open to show its perhaps timorous beauty, help it hold the reader with a vibrant concrete image, maybe even add a self-reflective or ironic comment upon it, you will have written a beautiful paragraph.
