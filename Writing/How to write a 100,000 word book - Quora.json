            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t worry about the big number. Break it into small, achievable steps. I generally go by word count, so I set a target for maybe 2,000 words a day (which is very achievable for me, most days). You can also just tell yourself \u201cI\u2019m just going to write this chapter.\u201d Or, \u201cJust this scene.\u201d Maybe just a paragraph! Anything you do is forward motion. Some people are plotters (meaning, they like to have the entire plot laid out in detail before they start) and some are \u201cpantsers\u201d writing by the seat of the pants and following inspiration. I\u2019m a \u201cplanner,\u201d which I feel like is midway between. I have a relatively light outline that gives me freedom to explore inspirations when I hit them. Think of it this way: if you do 1,000 words a day, you will finish in \u2026 100 days. That\u2019s just about 3 months. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Now, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re done. Just that you\u2019ve completed your rough draft. For the next couple of months you can work on really editing and rethinking things to get the book where it needs to be. Then get feedback and external opinions. Then do it again. It\u2019s totally achievable if you break it down and follow your process. And once you do it once \u2026 you know for a fact you can do it again. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m currently writing a fantasy novel, which will be around this word count. I have just hit the 20k words mark. I think my best advice is to just start writing. Once you\u2019ve begun you can get a feel for how realistic that word count is or how long it is likely to take you. I started this project by allowing myself a one-year time limit to get the book finished. To be clear, 50 days of writing 2000 words lets you hit this goal. In a short amount of time. So I\u2019ve given myself a time period where I can write less than 2000 words a week and still make my deadline. Another way to hit the word count is to find writers that you can clock your word count in with. Make use of what is already available. If you participate in NaNoWriMo to pump out your first draft you\u2019re already halfway there! If you know how you work best make sure that you implement a system that compliments your working style. I work best to deadlines, so I put a deadline on my work. I work best with others, so I have writing groups that I\u2019m a part of. If you\u2019re not sure about your writing method yet just try out a whole bunch of different techniques. This is the time to learn and make mistakes, perfection isn\u2019t necessary until the final draft. I can\u2019t wait to see you on the bookshelf! ",
