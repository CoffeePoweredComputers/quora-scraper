            "answer_text": "Because truth be told, the Media holds a lot of power. Imagine the amount of careers, dropped simply due to the media fucking up. \u201cAziz Ansari, raped someone!\u201d There. Career over. It doesn\u2019t take that much to destroy a reputation. Seriously, how about this, Have you heard of the 1990s greatest defender, Alvin Robinson? He played for the San Antonio Spurs, and even the GOAT, Michael Jordan said, \u201cHe\u2019s the toughest sum**** I\u2019ve ever played against\u201d. Of course you haven\u2019t. Because Alvin Robinson, was reported to have been running a small-time human trafficking ring! It was ALL over the news, and ruined his repuation, so much so, that he\u2019s been basically written out of history! In 2015, it was proven that the girl he met, lied about it. Entirely. There was NEVER any actual proof. That\u2019s why the media is so powerful. Yeah, sure, it\u2019s a justice fuck-up too, but just the implication that Average Celebrity A did X, means that it\u2019s over for him/her. Or that politician A did Y, means he/she\u2019s out of the party. It doesn\u2019t matter if you did anything or not. Depending on who you are, you can be DESTROYED by the Media. I think High School students these days should be aware of tricks by the Media to make them believe a false narrative. Tell them to read into things, always search the source, and validate the claims, ect. Don\u2019t be the person the Media wants you to be. I\u2019m not that smart, and I understand it. ",

            "answer_text": "I have studied \u2018Media Studies\u2019, but not to a high qualification. What I have found is that there is a lot of social studies that come with it, of which you can use the knowledge to help improve everyday lifestyle. You can get an understanding of how the public react to certain marketing campaigns which is great for a business aspect. Through knowing the teachings of \u2018Media Studies\u2019, allows organisations to predict how they can make positive impacts to the public with their marketing techniques. Many media techniques are used by large businesses to promote themselves. For example, when I was studying \u2019Media Studies\u2019 a particular topic I found interesting was the \u2018Influence of public figures\u2019 and how it can manipulate the public. Many organisations use social media influencers to push our their products, even though the influencers may not be relevant to the product or use it themselves, they still lead the public to make these purchases. Why? All because someone \u2018famous\u2019 told you to? Yet if someone was to come up to you on the street and recommend a product you had never heard of, you probably wouldn\u2019t show much interest. A book I found great to read if interested on the impacts of media is Marshall McLuhan\u2019s \u2018Understanding Media\u2019. ",
