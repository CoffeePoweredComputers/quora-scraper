            "answer_text": "That depends on the site. Comments can be highly valuable as they encourage conversation with your reader. That provides relationship opportunities as well as increased chances to close a sale. Many blogs stopped allowing comments to weed out the spam. Personally, I set my comments to moderation required to allow me to choose if the are legit or spam am for editing prior to weed out links and such I do not approve. I also suspect there is a SERPs correlation to comments. The comments, the more valuable and interactive the content and it stands to reason Google is more likely to show it in search results pages, To further combat the majority of spam I use Cleantalk and find it 99% effective. It\u2019s rare when I see a real spam comment. As a reader, I love commenting. I interact as I would on social sites building reciprocal relationships, guest blogging and link opportunities, and creating authority. Comments also create nofollow backlinks offering referral traffic and an indirect ranking signal. ",
