            "answer_text": "\u201cPulpy\u201d means \u201cin the tradition of the pulp magazines of the 1930s and \u201840s.\u201d (Yes, there were pulps before and after that, but they weren\u2019t what people think of.) The pulps were cheap, disposable entertainment, with no pretensions to be anything more than that, so they tended to provide fast-moving, action-packed stories with very little emotional depth and no concern about accuracy, realism, or even consistency. They also paid by the word, so the stories were often needlessly long and sloppy, with lots of adjectives and exclamation points, and with whole scenes that didn\u2019t add anything much to the plot but did add to the word count \u2014 and which always moved fast, because the cardinal sin was letting the reader get bored. Pulps usually had lurid covers, often more lurid than the stories inside, because back then any sort of explicit sex would get them banned from several cities and meant the magazine couldn\u2019t be sent to subscribers through the U.S. mail on a second-class permit. Violence wasn\u2019t a problem; standards were different then. So you\u2019d get covers showing beautiful women in impossibly-tight red dresses being tied up, or threatened by brutish gunmen, or kidnapped by hideous aliens. You\u2019d have stories where entire cities are destroyed by mad scientists\u2019 impossible weapons, or robots rampage through New York, or dinosaurs escape from a time portal and eat cops like candy, or cavemen emerge from hidden tunnels to carry off pretty girls for unspeakable purposes. Heroes were strong and handsome and generally perfectly willing to blow away dozens of gangsters with .45s or Tommy guns. It\u2019s a tradition still carried on by the crasser elements of Hollywood, particularly in low-budget films. So \u201cpulpy\u201d when applied to a novel probably means \u201cfast-moving fun, but dumb.\u201d ",
