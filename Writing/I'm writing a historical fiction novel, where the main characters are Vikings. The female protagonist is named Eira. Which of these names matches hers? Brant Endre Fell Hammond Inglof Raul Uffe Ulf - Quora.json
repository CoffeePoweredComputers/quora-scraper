            "answer_text": "Fun question! OK, let\u2019s see.., Brant, Endre, Fell, Hammond, Raul are too Westernized. Ulf is overutilized in fantasy. I\u2019m going for Inglof. It sounds sufficiently foreign yet it\u2019s easy to read and pronounce. If her first name is pronounced like \u201cIra\u201d it also goes with that. Uffe is also good, but I\u2019ve seen that before. Creating names is good exercise for writers. You seem to have a knack for it. Good luck with your book! ",
