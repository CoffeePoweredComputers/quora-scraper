            "answer_text": "Homework, in the lower grades, is given for the purpose of helping students retain skill sets that they've either mastered or have been working on during classroom instruction. It is important that the homework assigned be at a level where the child can work independently, without more than occasional adult support. Other than providing a quiet place for the student to work and perhaps some cueing to began homework, the child should do well on their own. If the child is unable to complete the material assigned, either because of the homework's complexity or its' length, then the assignment should be modified. The only exception that I made for this rule, when I was teaching, was my assignment for 10 to 20 minutes of reading per evening. Reading aloud to an adult, a sibling, a neighbor, or a friend was best performed as a social activity. Is homework beneficial, for lower grade students, if it follows most of the rules above? Yes, as practice is important in the retention or the gaining of academic skills. You are also teaching the student to be self-monitoring and to take responsibility for their own learning. Remember to match the assigned homework to the student's ability level and to gradually increase the time spent on homework as the student moves into higher grades. Upper grade students benefit from homework for many of the same reasons that lower grade students benefit, particularly the retention and practice of grade-level academic skill sets. Where things change for upper grade students is in the amount of time spent on homework and the addition of term papers, reports, and the practice of skills (math, foreign languages, sciences) as the time necessary to review all subjects for middle and high school increases substantially. Now comes the grim reality that exists for many of today's students. Many of our students do not have a quiet area in which to study as they are living transiently and move often, or the chaos that surrounds them precludes the ability to work outside of school. Many schools routinely have study halls and/or after school programs for students to complete homework assignments. While the work is not completed at home, the idea is for the student to successfully review information, write papers, or practice skills outside of the classroom. ",

            "answer_text": "Homework is meant to extend the class work beyond schooling for many reasons. It should not be harmful, ever! If it becomes so, tell your teacher and your parents, even the school administration. The brain is interesting when it is learning. First when you hear a teacher read or lecture you are passive, and while they make it make perfect sense in class, you may not learn the nuances to have this information go beyond that day. If you takes notes in class you are using yet another part of your brain the interpret what is being said and physically write the parts you feel are relevant \u201csubject matter\u201d to remember. Homework helps the brain as it forces you to find the answers (or attempt to find them) with whatever means you have available. If you let another answer your problems, you have allowed someone else to benefit from establishing some mental rigor and self mastery over problem solving that comes from doing work that leads you to getting the answer. The best way to truly learn a subject however, seems to be to teach it to someone. The reason being that the brain must employ it\u2019s own understanding, then it works to re-frame the information so that it can then call upon it\u2019s own understanding. Once all this is done, the effort to explain a subject clearly to another and have them understand it further deepens the material taught in the original student\u2019s brain. If you use tools or models or playacting, this further brings up the creative side of the brain and again solidifies further the information that first was presented to you as simple the work from another that you may or may not ever remember. Each part of the brain involved with this information makes a matrix of places from which you may recall the information later on in life. Also, you will eventually make correlations to other subjects by having the total understanding in your mind. This is what studying is for, to prepare your brain for more and more complex ideas and thinking that is needed and useful with and beyond the original subject you are studying. Schooling is an ever increasing level of information and education that starts with small ideas and the building blocks of a larger education that will allow you to become adept at dealing with the world when no one is there to help and you must make all the decisions. Besides there are time restrictions for each class, that limit the actual amount of information the classroom may to impart to you. You are meant to learn how to use your brain when schooling is done and the ability for others to be there to answer your problems is over\u2026 as a mature adult. You are being groomed for preparedness and self sufficiency, even though no one ever tells you that you are learning the bare minimum of what older well adjusted people know and comprehend. Good luck. ",

Or should we do what one school did and have two sets of textbooks one for home and one for locker, which erases the need for I forgot my textbook at home or school excuse. On top of the teachers working with each other to not overload on schoolwork at home. To where English has a test one week, math another and so on so you limit the amount of tests that student needs to study for at once. As a college prep student my one semester classes where it was only one semester for that class the workload equaled two semesters literally, we had to do two assignments a day. Maybe we shouldn\u2019t ask more from teachers but less from students ",

            "answer_text": "Most certainly homework helps students learn more. Homework plays an important role not only in the academic life of the student, but also in their personal lives. A homework system that is structured and supportive will give your children the skills of organization, time management, self-discipline, and self-confidence that will serve your students well throughout their lives. Here are ten (10) benefits of giving homework: 1) Students learn about time management Homework is an effective tool when teaching your child about time management. This means that time management should extend beyond the classroom and into your home. Whether your child needs to play or complete some light chores, it\u2019s in your best interest to provide your child with ample time to complete their homework. Homework demands a fresh mind and complete concentration. So, you should make it your mission to ensure that your child is well fed and refreshed before beginning any assignment. When you supervise your child to complete their homework, you subconsciously instill a sense of responsibility and prioritization in them. Your child should be in a unique position to prioritize on tasks with your guidance. This strategy makes it much easier to complete multiple tasks within a specific duration with ease. 2) Homework provides a measurement of students\u2019 learning for teachers Have you ever wondered whether your students have understood your content? Then consider giving them homework. Based on the responses obtained from the assignment, you will be able to tell how well your students learned the content. If the responses are unsatisfactory, then be prepared to revisit the chapter and break it down to simpler subtopics that can be understood with relative ease. Chances are your students might not have understood complex terminologies that proved frustrating to recall when completing their homework. More importantly, encourage your students to follow up with questions on concepts that are ambiguous to understand and explain. Also, feel free to introduce various types of learning styles to ensure that the specific content is understood. For instance, musical lessons are best taught with the aid of musical instruments. On the other hand, visual lessons are best taught with the aid of sample objects. 3) Trains students to solve problems Problem solving is a critical aspect of the learning process and it evaluates your child\u2019s capacity to reason and make informed decisions. When in a classroom setting, your child is given the unique advantage of problem-solving various questions with the assistance of their teacher. But when at home, they must rely on recalled information to execute ideal solutions to the problems at hand. Implementing this strategy is no easy task. It demands concentration and the ability to seek immediate clarification on solutions that are difficult to understand. If your child can successfully learn how to solve questions in class, they are in ideal position to replicate this strategy at home with the proficiency it deserves. As a parent, it\u2019s imperative to instill confidence in your child from an early age. Confidence is crucial in building up self-esteem and helping them raise questions without experiencing doubt and scrutiny from their classmates. 4) Gives students another opportunity to review class material If you thought that learning ends in school, then you are sadly mistaken. Learning extends to the home environment for any serious students. When your child completes homework regularly, they are given a unique opportunity to review class material. This constant revision not only builds on their knowledge but also expounds on their ability to recall information fast and identify alternative solutions to the same problem. When your child does their homework, the learnt information is ingrained in their mind based on multiple revision exercises. The more exercises that they complete, the easier it is to approach such questions in future. 5) Parents get to see the content being taught in school Homework isn\u2019t just beneficial to the student. It is equally useful to the parent, especially when they are interested in their child\u2019s progress and performance in various subjects. A brief 10- or 20-minutes skim of your child\u2019s homework brings you up to speed on the specific content taught in school. From your evaluation, you can assist your child in identifying alternative solutions to specific sets of questions. However, it\u2019s advisable to encourage your child to identify solutions by themselves in preparation for examinations that are tested on individual comprehension. 6) Students learn to take responsibility for their part in the educational process Homework is widely considered to be an ideal way to instill responsibility in students. By enforcing homework regularly, students are subconsciously informed on the need to take education seriously. Each assignment completed brings your child a step closer to achieving their educational goals and taking responsibility for their life decisions. In short, homework prepares your child to take responsibility for much bigger tasks later in life that are more challenging and demanding than school content. This perspective equips your child with a growth mindset that is crucial in overcoming setbacks and realizing their set goals and objectives. 7) Students learn to do things even if they don\u2019t want to It\u2019s a fact that most students don\u2019t like homework especially when they must forego their favorite hobbies at home. But enforcing homework on your child is advantageous in teaching them that they must do things even when they don\u2019t want to. Your child should be prepared to do such things that will become prevalent in adulthood. It revolves around embracing sacrifice and foregoing instant gratification for delayed gratification. Being prepared to make sacrifices that will yield remarkable results isn\u2019t reserved only for parents but for their children as well. By embracing sacrifices, your child is in an elevated position to weed out distractions and focus on the task at hand. It isn\u2019t easy but turning off the TV and cellphone is a great way to test their concentration and threshold for sacrifice. 8) Trains students to work independently If you\u2019ve ever wondered how you can test your child\u2019s independence to complete assignments, then setting homework questions is a great strategy to begin with. As a parent, it\u2019s imperative to give your child ample time to do their homework before rushing in to assist them. This allocated time is crucial in recalling learnt information and identifying effective alternatives to various questions. Providing your child with ample time to do their homework speaks volumes about your level of trust in them. This level of independence and trust assist your child in making informed decisions on what makes sense in their future career aspirations. 9) Students learn to stay organized, act and plan Completing homework effectively is a systematic process that entails following the assignment\u2019s instructions, doing research from various sources and taking notes from various publications. Such guidelines can only be completed when your child practices organization, takes notes and plans their work. It is important early enough to ensure that the task is completed within the set time. Failing to plan accordingly puts the quality of the assignment at risk by affecting its relevance and length. Such issues can be avoided by taking the time to organize, research and complete their assignment to ensure that relevant information is obtained. 10) Deepens students\u2019 understanding of a subject matter Understanding concepts from a classroom setting is admirable but taking the time to complete assignments speaks volumes about your capacity to go the extra mile in deepening your understanding. Often, homework breaks down complex terminologies and concepts to make the learning process effective. Based on proven research, students that cherished doing homework exhibited advanced understanding of various topics compared to those that shunned assignments. Homework can be assigned for a variety of reasons. At times homework is given to reinforce concepts introduced in class, to ensure understanding on the part of the student, and as a tool for the teacher to determine the level of understanding in his or her classroom. Homework assignments may be given to introduce students to concepts or materials that will be presented in class the following day, \u201cfront loading\u201d as it is sometimes referred to. Then there is the homework assignment that extends and incorporates multiple concepts that have been taught in the classroom over a longer period of time and brings them together in a cohesive package, such as a research report or oral presentations. Homework should be used as a tool designed to: provide practice of skills and concepts introduced in class, to strengthen basic skills, to stimulate and further personal interests, to develop independent study skills, to develop initiative and responsibility, and to keep parents aware of their child\u2019s curriculum and academic progress. We value homework as a gauge for student understanding of material, view it as an opportunity for all students to prove their knowledge of concepts taught, but most importantly we feel that by completing the assigned work students are taking initiative to engage in their learning, developing organization skills, and becoming independent learners.

            "answer_text": "While the answer can be complex, essentially the answer is yes, up to a point. I would also clarify that homework helps to move information from short-term memory into long-term memory. I think we can all agree that practicing a skill improves the skill. You would never stand in front of a group of students, demonstrate how to hit a baseball with a baseball bat, and expect them to be able to successfully perform that skill at the game the next week without practice. If you have not mastered a skill or you can't recall facts, then homework is a great way to get extra practice. Also, actually doing exercises and actively working with a new concept or idea helps you to better perform the skill or recall information in the future. Math really is the easiest example. While, I may understand what my teacher demonstrates in class, if I don't practice it myself I will forget the steps and the formulas. Everything my teacher has said will be put in short-term memory and will be lost in a matter of minutes. If I take that information and I practice doing it myself, it then begins to be written into long-term memory. The more you practice it, the more lasting that long term memory is. I will say that there is eventually diminishing returns on practice. If you have mastered the skill and find you can also access and use the skill without needing a reminder, lots more practice is probably unnecessary. If your teacher assigns 15 questions, and by the end of the assignment you are completing each question correctly and without needing to reference your notes, then the homework was valuable. If you master the skill by question 15, but the teacher assigned 40 questions, then maybe the homework was overkill. Do your homework! ",

            "answer_text": "Is homework harmful or helpful? This topic causes a lot of controversy. So let's do less than two hours per night.  It's unusual that we hear this question because most of the adults consider that homework is beneficial for students but young people are totally against it. This is because teachers usually leave us an excess amount of homework that causes us to stress out and to be extremely tired. The next day there are actual studies that prove that a lot of homework is sound for students but that to some extent it is good. I am going to talk about how homework is harmful and helpful at the same time. Why homework is helpful well studies say that the homework helps you to improve thinking and memory. It also makes you to develop positive studies skills because you get used to work after school and not just during class indeed you review and practice what you have seen in class. Well I'm not completely against homework but in certain way I am I mean it helps you write but here's the thing we're all day in school and after spending that amount of hours teachers ask us more academic work. For instance in high school we have a teacher for each subject and somehow each of them leaves us homework. So we end up school with tons of it. There comes a time when we get so stressed and copy-paste the information from the web without even paying attention to it and we're learning. Then when you have to do an assignment in teams and no one helps at all you get so stressed that no one's doing nothing and you end up doing everything plus the other ton of homework you already had. Another reason is that it takes you a lot of time any distances you from family and friends and also your extracurricular activities. Homework may seem annoying but in the long run it Fitz\u2019s. I'm not saying that having tons of homework is okay because it's not but that doesn't mean we don't have to do it every teacher is giving you an excess amount of work try to approach him and maybe try to extend due dates or cut off some work. You lose nothing with trying so remember you can be the student who gets good grades and tries their best or the bad student who flunks every subject and doesn't even try. Some of the important research work suggests that homework can be good for you but too much is not a good option. In Favor of Homework Kids may not like having to do homework but a new study out of Germany says it's good for them, and that is a line of approach that works with kids all the time. It's good for the kids. Not just in the classroom, the researchers found it has links to kid\u2019s motivation to do the right thing and work hard. This was a German study as we mentioned, kids between the grades of 5th and 8th grade. It was a survey. They said how many of your last ten homework assignments. Believe me, you can't trust a fifth of a 7th grader. I'm not saying based on personal experience. I was one at one point. You can't trust it. You found that nerds are going to nerd. The more you do your homework, the better the kids are. We should all know this. I was thinking about this because I was someone who always did my homework not alone but with some online study help. Never had to be asked to do my homework, took it very seriously. Then I have our youngest brother who is the youngest of four and it was always a struggle to get him to do homework, and you wonder how much personality does play a role in that. When I heard the study, Is homework good for you or not?, I wonder if the kids who are leaning that way of being conscientious and maybe we are a little bit neater were already doing the home work. Is it the doing of the homework that caused you to be a better person? This is a correlation, not a causation. I suppose part of this is the scientists were checking out conventional wisdom, if you're someone who do you see your homework, you're probably responsible in other areas of life. Parents make you do homework and you do it. In your regular life, you're a slob. Or there's an age you take things seriously. 8th grade is not one of them. Normally in adolescence, you have a dip in your responsibility, which i think we remember that, but making sure your kids are doing your homework can balance that out, which is cool. The big question is how much. How much homework is enough? How much is too much. This is a tough one. It can be very overwhelming. A lot of kids, you come home, you have a couple hours of homework. It's good to have balance and teachers think about that, too, especially at the middle school level. Some think so too and I think parents need to make sure their kids are still having fun and taking that time to be kids. The research is super mixed on this. There is a correlation with good test scores on older kids who do their homework, but the younger kids, it also is correlated with being stressed and sleep deprived. As per a survey 57% of students don\u2019t get enough sleep due to homework. Against homework Some feel it hateful too. Like I'm really glad that I don't have to do it anymore. I never did it. I got a real crappy grades. Some people feel that homework is the worst. A new study in the journal of experimental education is on board with student woes that is the research found that too much homework can actually negatively affect the lives of high school kids. What's too much more than two hours a night which still seems like a lot to me but I'll roll with it study explored thousands of California students from high performing schools in middle class communities to give you an idea of one metric of student success. 93% of these students went on to either a two or a four-year college the problem was that more than two hours of homework keeps these students from spending time with their families and friends learning social skills playing games and doing extracurricular activities. Homework is cool and all what you know what so is being a teenager totally what are the greatest and most important things that I miss about being that age is being relatively stress-free high school kids aren't physically and emotionally equipped to handle too much stress. The study found that for 99% of them homework was a stressor which is okay it should be a little stressful so you get it done but what's striking is that for 56% it's their primary stressor more so than tests themselves or the pressure to get good grades. Most of the students also reported sleep deprivation because of their homework. To be clear I am talking about high schoolers not college students. I remember my little brother when he was in middle school he'd come home sometimes with two or three hours of work every night. Which just seems a little intense. Is it necessary to do this for a smart educated population? The association for supervision and curriculum development collected Studies on homework over the entire last century and it turns out attitudes about homework are cyclical in the early 20th century homework was thought to improve discipline as well as learning but by the early 1940s post World War two families thought homework was interfering with family activities. Then by the 50s Sputnik was launched and the Soviets were winning the space race and we were like oh my god so education discipline and homework back kitchen-table until the space race ended because by the 1980s we were fighting against the scourge of homework again long story short. Research shows homework is positively correlated with achievement and success in education but doing too much can be harmful and stressful. Parents play an important role in this too. Like when I was in 8th grade my mom used to force me to do my homework but of course I would agree to it that I was blamed for this. Teachers blame you too saying that this is because of a student\u2019s laziness. But what they don\u2019t see is the consequences of forcing a student to do homework. It's a balance in the end of school should make sure homework is assigned when appropriate and then it's not busy work because that is not sweet for nobody. I had so many teachers who assigned a ton of mindless busy work you know there's nothing quite like it to make you hate school. I think feeling overextended really causes students to shut down instead of stepping up. So you got to give them a challenge push them but not so far that there's no time to develop other non-academic skills balance everybody. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the research, no. Research into the value of homework has shown that homework before high school has minimal to no effect on student learning. Some studies have shown a weak correlation between homework given at upper grades an academic achievement, depending on the quality of the work. Even then, the correlation is small, and shows that too much homework becomes counter-productive. And increased homework does not increase a child's understating of the subject. After spending a day at a full-time job of learning at school, children are expected to take a second shift at home. Homework frustrates students and leaves them intellectually exhausted at the very time their brain most needs a break to process the learning it did that day. It leaves students less interested and able to pursue their own intellectual interests. Particularly poorly designed homework associates learning with frustration, tedium, and exhaustion. It turns potential valuable family time into nagging as parents become homework enforcers before they bond with their kids after a long day. Homework doesn't necessarily enforce understanding of the academic content. If a student doesn't understand a concept, forcing them to repeat their mistakes twenty times in a row, on their own, away from teacher guidance, will not help the student to further understand the concept. If a student does understand a concept, practicing it twenty times on a worksheet does not necessarily ingrain the concept into the brain. This might apply to sports, music, physical skills, or artistry, but this does not translate to understanding concepts. Just because kids have worksheets to fill out or facts to recite into short-term memory does not mean they are learning. Homework that is too hard or too easy drives kids away from the love of learning. Does homework build character, self-discipline, and responsibility? No studies have shown this to be the case. It may seem intuitive, but it would also seem intuitive that forcing kids to digs holes and re-fill them could also build character and responsibility and persistance, but this does not make it meaningful. There are many other ways to build strong character that would be meaningful. My own son loves board games. He would much rather be engaged in a game that takes spacial reasoning, logical deduction to anticipate what move I might make, fairly complex math to calculate which risk might give him the most reward, or using basic economic skills to know if he has the resources needed, or should first invest to get more resources to use later, and long term planning as he develops his strategy. Should I discourage him from even opening the game until he completes extra math worksheets that research has shown will not help him understand the concepts better? If he would rather play outside with friends or myself, should I ignore his social development and the research that shows that physical movement is absolutely essential to brain growth, and instead nag him to cram facts into his short-term memory? Often, homework is not even meant to be an occasional, hopefully well-designed, reenforcement of concepts studied in class. It it more often given as expected busy-work with the expectation that kids should be doing something, anything, and then creating work to fill the mandatory homework time. Sometimes this is given under the guise of \"Life as an adult is hard, so kids better get used to it.\" The greatest danger of homework is that it could drive potentially engaged students away from a desire to learn. It associates learning wth tedium and exhaustion. It often leads to a lack of sleep, impacting the readiness of the brain for the next day. And it robs time for kids to pursue their own questions and intellectual pursuits. An engaging teacher might inspire a love of learning in the classroom, and then give mandatory homework out of a sense of expectation and undermine the love of learning at home. While robbing children of the choice of how to use their personal free time. Homework has not been shown to help students below middle school learn, and has shown a small effect for upper grades, depending on the quality of the work. There is a growing trend among teachers to assign less and less homework and even among some schools to be completely homework-free.  ",

            "answer_text": "As a current student yes. At my intermediate school (middle school) they did not give out any homework because they believed that it didn\u2019t help you learn more or improve students skills. So when I first came to my high school and I got homework it was a lot but I didn\u2019t get too overwhelmed or anything like that but I feel like if I didn\u2019t get math homework or homework for subjects I needed to improve on I wouldn\u2019t be learning as fast. When I first went to intermediate (middle school) they tested us to see if we would go into the accelerant class (smart person class) and I was about at level and then when I was at the start of the next year when they did the same test again to see if any one else would move to the accelerant class I got the exact same I didn't go up and I didn\u2019t go down. Although it can also be different for people in different circumstances. I know some people have too many after school activities to able to complete homework. And too be honest my school isn\u2019t too strict if you ask for an extension so you can have more time and you have a good enough reason it is most likely they will give you more time. ",

            "answer_text": "My chemistry teacher once wrote on a report card \u201cA? E? I have no idea because he doesn\u2019t hand in homework\u201d. I did get an A in exams, thanks primarily due to the teaching (we had two teachers, splitting up for theory, but in a big group for practicals). However, I did look at the homework, at least. And then dismissed it as being easy. Vygotsky\u2019s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is the important thing. In simple terms, once you understand addition, there is no point in practicing addition. Add multiplication until you understand that, and so on. Homework is typically designed to be effective for the middle 60-80%. Outliers, both at the top and bottom of the curve, are either going to be finding it a waste of time or too time-consuming. Deliberate practice - working in that ZPD - is a good thing. Well-designed homework does that, at last for more than half of the class. In that sense, it is effective. I\u2019ve read of secondary school students here on Quora that are given hours upon hours of homework, in addition to their schoolwork. If they are spending significantly more than 40 hours per week on their studies, they should be asking why. It may be that they are not concentrating in class, that they don\u2019t do any preparation in \u201cholidays\u201d, but it also may be a lack of communication between teachers, and between teachers and their students. My figure of 40 hours is for active learning, in class and at home, and disregards passive learning - reading books or watching educational video material without feedback. Assuming subjects have equal weight, simply divide 40 by the number of subjects for roughly how long one should be spending on it, in total. My school had eight periods of 40 minutes, which were filled with lessons including P.E., up to O Level (before GCSEs), 4 lessons per subject. So anything more than an hour and a half of homework per week was not effective. At A Level, there were only 8 lessons per week for three subjects, so 16 hours of class leaving up to eight additional hours per subject. Aged 16+ you should probably know what homework is effective and what isn\u2019t, but you may - like me - be less than competent at communicating back up when it isn\u2019t. ",

Based on latest research titled Visible Learning [1] book written by Prof John Hattie, based on synthesis over 800 meta-analysis on various influences on student achievement, homeworks has few impacts on students learning. Visible learning literally means how teachers help students to learn through the eyes of the students and help the the students to become their own teachers[2] .  Hattie identifies all factors that influence students learning including the students, the school , the curricula , the teacher , the teaching and learning approaches. Homework is one the factor in this research and it can be found that homework has almost no impact on children learning. Even in the current visible learning research, homework rank on 159 out of 252 factors that is identified[3]. The impact size of homework only 0.29[4]. Even giving giving effective feedback and clear instructions is way better for students learning compare to giving homework with impact size around 0.73.   Personally, I also believe that there are many other approach and strategies that will be more effective to have a positive impact on children learning compare to giving homework. Even in Finland where considered having good education system, there are no homework that giving to students and students can still learn better[5] .

Other than math we had very little homework in grade school, occasional homework in middle school and a bit more in high school. Most high school students signed up for study hall and were usually able to complete homework for all their classes in that hour. Now middle school students can get hours of homework every night and high school students have to deprive themselves of sleep to slog through all their homework. Why do kids get so much homework now? Educational reforms usually aren't educators; they are industrialists who fear a shortage of a suitable workforce will limit their ability to amass wealth. The main purpose of public education isn't to produce enlightened souls but to make productive members of society. Actual education is secondary to rule following, respect for authority and building a strong work ethic. These reformers believed students needed more homework to mentally prepare them for unfulfilling careers. True education comes from curiosity and creativity. Long hours of homework makes kids hate school and stifles their curiosity and creativity. ",

SOURCE:Do Parents Need to Control Whole Studying Process? | Pro Homework Help Remember the main purposes of homework: to build rote memorization and automaticity; to provide time to deepen understanding though elaboration and to increase readiness for new information.Assign homework that includes very few concepts so students can learn them on a deeper level (Healy, 1990).Match homework to the learning goal for a more focused learning experience.Provide appropriate and timely feedback. Students need to know what was correct, what needs to be changed, etc., and they need this information sooner rather than later. Waiting several days or even weeks to provide feedback limits or even eliminates the effectiveness of the assignment.Parental involvement should be limited to facilitating the completion of homework \u2013 not teaching content or doing the work for a child. Parents who get too involved in an assignment inhibit rather than enhance learning.Cons of Homework  SOURCE:When Is Homework Harmful? Homework is frequently the source of frustration, exhaustion, family conflicts, a lack of time for kids to pursue other interests and, perhaps most disturbingly, less excitement about learning. Fourth grade students who did no homework got roughly the same score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) math exam as those who did 30 minutes of homework a night. Students who did 45 minutes or more of homework a night actually did worse. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. There are various reasons. One is pure logic: if a child has understood the task from the classroom he doesn\u2019t need to do it, it is better and more constructive to do other things; if he hasn\u2019t understood it and he doesn\u2019t know what he has to do, it is absurd to do it all by himself, as he won\u2019t know how, so - in the best of the cases - he will ask for help, usually some colleague or one of the parents; then the primary objective of the homework is not achieved, as instead of the child doing it by himself, it is the parent or the colleague who does it. Another one is that it takes time from familial coexistence. When at home, children need to socialize with their parents and siblings, with their friends or neighbours, they need to play and/or rest. Spending time with the family, resting or playing is more important, especially when the child already has spent 5\u20136 or more hours at school. The third one is related to the way we learn: after learning something, the brain needs a time of reflection and rest in order to assimilate and cement the knowledge. Swotting up on the syllabus won\u2019t help acquire solid and lasting knowledge and informations, actually it might have the adverse effect. And there is another reason related again with the way we learn, but from another point of view: it is true that we need to repeat certain activities in order to learn or to achieve excellence in what we do, but we also need to have a personal motivation - personal curiosity, personal need to know, or simply personal pleasure to do this activity. If we don\u2019t have this inner motivation, for much that we repeat something, it won\u2019t help us learn or even like it; what\u2019s more, we might even get to hate it. On the top of it, the last conclusions about the way we assimilate knowledge or skills indicate that we learn better when we move around, touch or feel things, and especially when our five senses are involved in an activity; that is why human beings learn a lot better and more when they play (yes, we all \u201cplay\u201d and experiment all the time; playing is about learning, working and exploring, playing is about creativity and curiosity, about making mistakes and then get the things right). Usually there are a lot more pleasurable ways to learn things, but unfortunately schools never take them into account, or plainly and simply they are not able to apply them because their structure prevents it. Their only solution - which obviously doesn\u2019t work with everybody and in every occasion - is doing homework, even if it is not efficient. I attach the cone of learning to see how other activities are much more efficient and fun, when it comes to real learning, than homework or all the boring classes at school.  ",

However I respectfully state that for home schooled children, a hour or less of homework given once or twice a week can be a good idea. When my two children are a bit older, I plan on giving them 30/40 minutes of homework twice a week to essentially challenge them and keep them busy as well. Properly done, it can be useful. Take my word for it. For me personally, homework is about developing proper habits and teaching independence too. I have looked up homework projects online for geography etc. The important thing is to vary the homework often to keep the children interested and motivated. For example for history homework can be based on a documentary or newspaper article. If you view homework as a supplementary aid, you will not go wrong. At the end of the day, that is what it is really. Nothing more, nothing less. I work for a tutoring company and we have strict limits on homework to follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no Homework has value when its used to reinforce students learning and not used as a punishment. My favorite styles of homework (the one I most agree with) is 1) when its leftover classwork- that students had time to complete 2) projects/portfolios- when the student is well aware of expectations and has rubrics and 3) when its an assignment that will actually reinforce learning and can be used as a study guide- things like guiding questions, or practice sheets that help understanding. Things I don\u2019t agree with: homework as a punishment- like if the students were particularly awful that day and they get a mundane worksheet. If the homework is too easy, students get bored and put it off. If its too hard and the teacher has very strict expectations, it can be discouraging. I think the problem comes when teachers (and sometimes students) don\u2019t give ample time or direction with the assignments. Lack of communication and rushing things result in frustration. ",

That small amount of homework is helpful- it helps me understand, revise, and keep up-to-date with work. However, if I am doing several hours of homework for most of my subjects? That is the most harmful thing you can force on an already stressed and exhausted child. Hours of homework make me feel overly pressured, panicked, and after a while, I just don\u2019t care anymore. Small amounts of homework every now and then is helpful, doing hours of homework for every subject is harmful. Please, teachers, we\u2019ll enjoy class and school more. ",

            "answer_text": "The word homework sends a fear or revulsion to the students and parents too. Some people feel that homework is an effective way to reinforce the concepts that student learns at school. Others feel like that homework would be better and meaningful activity that brings the parents and child together. Here are some of the pros and cons to discuss this topic that is given below: The advantages of homework: 1) Students can do the practice at home: Repeating the same questions, again and again, may be boring, but it also reinforces the practice of discipline. To get the better skill, repetition is necessary. Student gets better answers by repeating the same queries. Complete the homework every night, especially with a difficult subject. The concepts become easier to understand. It gives them an advantage when they seeking for their career. 2) Students learn time management skills: Homework is basically completing the task on time and student can revise the whole things which they had studied in the classrooms. It also forces children to develop time management skills. This creates in the students to develop the problem-solving skills and research skills. It also puts parents and children into a position where positive decision-making skills will be developed. 3) Creates a communication network: Homework is a bridge that opens lines of communication between the school, teacher, and the parent. This allows everyone gets to know each other better. It helps teachers to understand the needs of their students better. It allows the parents to find out their child\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Together, they can make an educational plan and encourages the best possible learning environment. The disadvantages of homework: 1) Encourages a sedentary lifestyle: Long homework assignments require long periods of sitting. A sedentary lifestyle has numerous and direct associations with premature death as children age. Obesity levels are already in a high record in many communities. Homework reinforces certain skills and encourages knowledge retention, but it may come at a high price. 2) Every home has not got a beneficial environment: There are some parents who are highly invested in their children. Parents may be involved in every stage of their work or there may be access to teachers or home tuitions who explain the difficult concepts. In other homes, there may be little or no education investment for the child. Some parents push the responsibility of teaching only on the teacher and they do not even provide any homework support at all. Sometimes parents wish to be involved and support their child, but there are barriers in place that prevent this from happening. The pros and cons of homework are all over the map. Many parents and teachers follow the personal perspectives and create the learning environments around the students. When parents and teachers clash on homework, the student is often left in the middle of the tug of war. By discussing these key points, each side can work to find some common ground so our children can benefit from a clear and precise message. Quantity may be important, but quality must be the priority for homework if students want to be successful. To get the best assignment help, you can take help from Assignment Help Online. I am referring their name because I used their services personally and got satisfactory results. ",

            "answer_text": "In a system based on memorization, the intent of homework is to aid memorization. When learning anything, experience using it helps. Homework is supposed to be like experience. So homework is supposed to be helpful. But we don\u2019t memorize well and don\u2019t learn well from memorization. We can memorize when it\u2019s something we value memorizing. That\u2019s why many kids find it easy to memorize hundreds of Pokemon and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics. Some kids even think it\u2019s fun to memorize all the states and capitals. Working with those, even practicing, will aid in memorizing. But if kids are made to memorize even Pokemon against their will, it might go in but it won\u2019t stick. They might be given homework to get it to stick faster but unless a child is interested or the information is used most of it won\u2019t stick beyond the test. Do teachers put a lot of thought into what they assign? No, they\u2019re too busy. They trust the book and just assign the even numbered problems. And since a little bit of homework helps memorization, many have come to feel that more is better. So kids are loaded down with homework. So the question doesn\u2019t have a simple yes or answer. Homework supports a system of memorization but memorization isn\u2019t the best way to learn. Even when homework does help memorization, there isn\u2019t a lot of thought that goes into what\u2019s assigned to aid in memorization. It\u2019s just based on the idea that any practice helps memorization and more practice must be better. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most important things in learning is reinforcement. It takes time and practice to learn something, and just doing a couple of exercises on it in a lesson and then not touching the subject again until exam time (I\u2019m mainly thinking in terms of classes I\u2019ve taught, so Maths and English =- things that have formulas that need to be learned then followed) isn\u2019t going to promote learning. Learning by rote is not a good thing - just knowing that 2+2=4 is no good - you need to be able to apply it, and know WHEN to apply it. That\u2019s why homework is such a useful tool. It enables the teacher to teach the theory and give some examples of application, then the student can take it home and learn to apply it in their own way and at their own pace. There isn\u2019t enough time in lessons to do this, especially considering the amount of subject-matter that needs to be covered in a relatively short space of time. One example is my daughter. She is very artistically minded, and she also has hearing problems. She has struggled immensely to grasp some concepts in Maths that her classmates have understood quite quickly. Therefore, because she is only one out of 32 kids, the teacher moves on to something else, meaning that my daughter not only doesn\u2019t grasp the original topic, but now has to add a completely different one on top of it. Having homework to cover all the topics has enabled me to give her targeted help on the things she has most trouble with. She recently got 100% on a test because of the work we did as homework :) ",

I have seen one weekly homework sheet that was good only in that it required application of skills across a variety of areas- spanned multiple intelligences and Piaget. Homework is valuable in reinforcing skills taught, helping establish study routines, and helping students develop time management skills. ",

We had a 2 year time frame (closer to 2 and a half years but that\u2019s besides the point). We were only given one hour a week to finish this course, and a lot of those lessons were taken by outside speakers and the like so completing the course within lessons was impossible. We struggled finishing courses we had around 3 lessons a week on, so one lesson a week was not viable for finishing said courses. Our teacher set homework for us just so we could get what we needed from the course. In the end, I score a 6 in my RE GCSE and I reckon if I had not been set all this homework I would\u2019ve struggled to get a 5 in RE. ",

Let us present you some example, I had watched and downloaded many videos of children playing the piano ages from 4 to 8 or 10. All them were very good. Some of them were asked how much they practiced, and most of the replies were like 4 hours a day. Then, to become an average student, it is enough with the time spent in school and there is not any need for school homework. But if you are an ambitious parent, and desire seriously your child would make a scientific career, then he is not going to make it without lots of school homework. Not less than an hour or two a day. I can accept the proposition that to learn well to play the piano is a lot more difficult than that to prepare oneself to make a scientific career. But think that times are very hard today, and most people that finish a career had problems to find a job. Some had ended working on a wallmart, but they had to hide they made a degree about something of science. Why it is so difficult? There is a lot of people with science degrees. Never had been so many in all the damn history of humankind. Then, it makes sense for a child to do homework if the parents are willing to help the child with encouragement. If parents do not like science or books, it does not make any sense to encourage the child with this extra effort. Let him be an average child and do not worry at all. ",

Ideally, homework will be used as an opportunity for the student to practice on their own time and at their own pace a concept they were taught in class. Doing something with the whole class is good, but applying it on your own is even better, sometimes. ",

Too little homework and nothing is truly gained, but too much and it becomes viewed as a chore that people despise doing. It is when homework crosses this line that it gets the bad rap of being pointless. For example if you were to give two integrals for calculus students to solve there wouldn\u2019t be much of point, since they won\u2019t really gain anything from that. On the other hand if you were to give fifty integrals then after awhile nothing more is being gained than if they did less. ",

A vital skill for life. You have to fit the homework into your life. After school, much of life is fitting in things you don't really like doing! All good practice. Stop complaining and take advantage of what is offered you., ",

Have Nobel Prize winners been determined to have completed hours of homework? Is there less crime in a community where school policy demands not less than 2 and not more than 3 hours of homework a night? Do students perform better on state assessments if they have perfect grades for homework completion? Do students do better on state assessments if they've attended homework heavy schools vs. homework light schools? Effective in what regard? One reason we don't know much about homework is because we don't know what we want it to accomplish - so how do we design a study to measure its effectiveness? Education in general does very little that's evidenced-based and homework is no exception. Your question will largely be answered anecdotally - teachers will insist they know a universal truth based on their personal observations in their classroom - A fairly recent book by Alfie Kohn called The Homework Myth worked to summarize what research has been done on the effectiveness of homework.

Feedback on your homework may also help you to see where you\u2019ve gone wrong or need to improve.

The only way we make changes in our brain is by working to do that ourselves. Homework can be one form of that. Whether or not it\u2019s beneficial depends on how stable the home is, how self-directed and self-motivated the student is, whether the classroom time is being used more for group instruction, what the nature of the homework is and so forth. In traditional schooling where class time is spent on group instruction, students are self-motivated or parents are actively engaged to encourage homework, home life is stable , homework is well-designed, and homework is collected/graded for timely feedback homework may be where much of the learning actually occurs. In other situations, it can be useless or even a decided negative. In terms of the limited amounts of research out there, I think the evidence suggests that on average in U.S. government-run schools homework may be a net neutral. ",

Give ur students some time to think about themselves. So that they can participate in other things or they can learn other things too , especially interaction with people , which most of the students today are lacking. Teach ur students like that so that they study on their own in home . And if they will do self study in home . Then firstly they will understand things more precisely.

If students have time on school to practice doing problems then that individual work need not necessarily be done at home. You cannot learn to write without writing, and you cannot learn to do academic research without actually doing some research. Hence teachers assign papers. If you only want to get out of school what the teacher has predigested for you into lectures then you may not need to do additional reading but ",
