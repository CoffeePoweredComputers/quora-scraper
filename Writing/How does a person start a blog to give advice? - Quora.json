            "answer_text": "You kind of have it backwards.First you need to produce content to demonstrate that you are someone that people would trust to answer questions of.You could always answer questions on Quora and write blog posts here too. If people value what you are saying, they may choose to follow you and may even read your blog posts. Then you could set up your blog separate to Quora if you think this is of value, and invite people to ask questions.A better venue for this might be a podcast - find a topic that interests you and preferably someone else (or guests) you can have a dialogue with, and invite people to write emails / post twitter messages with a hash tag, and post to a forum to ask questions that you answer on the podcast. If you have enough listeners, you could also use a chat channel and live stream if you want to add a bit of daring!The main thing is though that you have to build a reputation. You don't just get it overnight (unless you are the very few who start some kind of meme) - it is something to be earned and requires effort and persistence.If you really want to do this, rather than it being a self-indulgent whim, this won't deter you though - so the sooner you start building the reputation, the sooner you can get to your goal - although I suspect that the journey itself may make the goal less important in time and help you discover new goals you won't have anticipated.
