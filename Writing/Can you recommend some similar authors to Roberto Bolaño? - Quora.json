            "answer_text": "If you're interested in somewhat irreverent/comical but well written latin-american prose (that's what I remember from reading Bola\u00f1o), I would strongly recommend Jorge Ibarg\u00fcengoitia. Plus he's a mexican, and he talks about Mexico. If you want a darker, more realistic yet introspective kind of literature, there is also Juan Carlos Onetti, from Uruguay. He's a brilliant writter but his novels are hard to come by. If you're more interested in poetry (Bola\u00f1o is quite fond of poetry), I would recommend Jaime Sabines (mexican). But really, most latin-american writers have that certain flare that international readers seem to find appealing in Bola\u00f1o. You could read Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Carlos Fuentes, etc. I promise it won't be a waste of your time. ",

            "answer_text": "I cannot answer this question based on my existing knowledge.   I can suggest a process I have used occasionally, so you can do your own research.  The websites I most commonly use (past google) for book reviews are Goodreads (a reader site) and Amazon (a seller site).  Goodreads lets you search for books based on your preferences you give them.  Amazon suggest books when you click on the page for specific books.  You can get suggestions that way, and read reviews to find out what specific readers think of specific books.  (Perhaps you know this already.) My quick check on Bolano leads me to believe I ought to look up more about him and his books, so perhaps it was good for both of us Quora suggested I answer this. ",
