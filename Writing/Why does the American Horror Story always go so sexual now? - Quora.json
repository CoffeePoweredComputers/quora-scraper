            "answer_text": "Just a guess. Sex and death are the two fundamental issues in human life. Horror has long fused both of them to heighten dramatic tension, set up the old \u201cif you\u2019re not virtuous, you deserve to die\u201d trope, and contrast. Sex is life-affirming. Also, IMO, sex affects ratings, especially with the desired demographic. It can also make a viewer uncomfortable, which can then trigger a better response to the scares as well. Again, just my opinion. ",
