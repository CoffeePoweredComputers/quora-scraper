            "answer_text": "yes but like all synonyms they are not exact matches, you have to be conscious of the fact that the term synonym means similar to not the same, So a solid 8- percent of the time it wont make a difference. I would willing to say closer to 90 percent of the time , but there is a subtle difference in an expression of direct relationship that is a usage point and not a grammar one, so you are right 90 percent of the time it will make little difference but generally I prefer to use due to to reflect a direct correlation or if I am going to build a list of reasons . you are also going to want to use due to particularly when you are wanting the reason to be because of policy, law order etc, So to summarize, yes they are synonyms, this does not mean that you are always going to want to interchange them, grammatically they can always be switched, usage wise not so much , the general usage of due to is to reflect a directness of effect or an authority , You are going to use it for more direct inflection , I tend to prefer to use due to if I am creating a list or citing a policy. for example : due to general order one, all personal will remain at post until dismissed. It has a more authoritative edge . But yea L 98 percent of the time it does not make a difference unless you are trying to create a rhetorical effect . Like the same way you might chose to use a contraction or might not choose to use a contraction. Sometimes you would want to use one over the other , other times you wouldn\u2019t. English is a difficult language not because of pronunciation, but because the grammar, vocabulary and usage can all act independent of each other. I have drifted . I hope I was help. ",

            "answer_text": "Not exactly. \u201cBecause of\u201d always indicates that A caused B. For example, applying heat to the kindling point of an object causes it to burn.\u201d \u201cDue to\u201d can mean that A affected B without actually causing it. For example, schools are sometimes closed \u201cdue to\u201d inclement weather (snow, ice, flooding, etc.). The weather conditions don\u2019t directly close the schools, but the schools are closed by local authorities because the weather represents a danger in getting children safely to and from school. ",
