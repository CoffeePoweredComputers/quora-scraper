            "answer_text": "If you want to work with traditional publishers, good luck. I don\u2019t know how many are actually keeping cover designers on staff these days. You\u2019ll probably need a contact. But right now, you can offer your services to independent authors. First, I would set up a website with samples of your work. If you google \u201cpremade book covers,\u201d you\u2019ll come across tons of sites as examples. Some artists make covers ahead of time, authors search the site and find the one they want, and then you add the title, author name, and any other details requested. On the same site, you can offer to do custom work, where an author would come to you with an idea and you develop it together. One very popular cover artist for indies goes by the name Damonza. Look him up. I regularly commission cover art. I look for sample covers that are professional and not home-made looking, and I look for art that resembles what is selling right now (research covers on the Amazon Bestsellers lists). If you go to Writers' Cafe, you can start a thread for your services. This is a forum that TONS of indie authors visit daily. Many artists advertise their services here. We\u2019re always looking for great artists, as many of them are busy, and indies publish often (4+ times a year). Put your info in a comment. I might need you soon. :) Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Edited to Add: Apologies, I didn\u2019t see the detail of your Q. You can post an ad at Kboards\u2019 Writers Cafe. They let you post a small catalog (several pictures/illustrations that represent your abilities) and links to your website.  Note that I am answering as an author (aka potential client) and also someone who has freelanced for a good part of a decade. I am not an illustrator myself. Study the market. I am answering with the assumption that you are looking to work with self publishers. You\u2019d want to take a look at bestseller lists and figure out what kind of titles with illustrated covers are raking in money. Are they in a genre you can work on? Do they match your particular style?Write a business plan. Do you need to create a whole brand new portfolio? Can you create more than one catalog to attract different potential clients? How much do you want to charge? How many projects a month can you handle? How many projects a month do you need to make a comfortable living?Build a portfolio. Create a website and upload your work. Make sure that the design is optimized to display your beautiful illustrations. Pay attention to keywords and any other things that will help you direct traffic to your site.Advertise. Find potential clients and schedule promotional offers (can be based on seasonal events or on your discretion - new illustrator type of thing). Lurk on writers\u2019 fora to see where people who write the genres that need your service hang out. You can find out their preferences & their budget and thus, post ads based on the information you glean. A lot of writers\u2019 fora allow cover designers and illustrators to advertise their businesses.Good luck. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy the process and find many, excellent clients. ",
