            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to skip repeating what other people have said, since I\u2019ve used all of their advice at various times across the years. Mario\u2019s \u201cgo out and LIVE, and it will inspire you!\u201d, Madi\u2019s \u201chum to yourself in a quiet room; get a tune and freestyle\u201d, Steve\u2019s \u201clearn the structure and keep even what you think is bad\u201d, Syd\u2019s \u201crecord or write down everything\u201d, Matt\u2019s \u201cwrite constantly, even when you\u2019re blocked\u201d. You\u2019re asking for \u201cthe best way\u201d. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, there isn\u2019t one. But there is a \u201cbest way for you\u2026at this time\u201d. That is, there will be ways that work better for you some years, and other ways that will work for you better other years. Why the emphasis? Because other people will have other ways that work better for them at the same time as you do. But that means you just need to take their advice and play around with it until you find the one that works constantly, with a great amount of output. Then when the output dries up\u2026you go do another method and keep playing around with it. In my opinion, medleys are a little easier than lyrics (because they follow rules), but lyrics are also very easy. For medleys, you need to know the tricks of transition, which is a theory-based thing. Existing songs (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re doing cover medleys) have four things that differ between them: tempo, key signature, time signature, and chord structure. For tempo, accelerando and ritardando exist - not precisely a problem unless the change is incredibly dramatic. Key signatures are helpful if they\u2019re right next to each other (see barbershop songs for an example of medley technique, and there\u2019s a Whitney Houston song that changes key I think four times in succession for examples), or the two songs that you\u2019re melding at that section have similar or identical chord structures i.e. Axis of Awesome - 4 Four Chord Song (with song titles). Time signature is probably the biggest problem, but most pop songs are 4/4 these days so not an issue, and 4/4 to 6/8 isn\u2019t a hard transition regardless - and 3/4 and 6/8 are closely linked. Whether you do transition bars or segue (as in EDM), this is more of a technical skill rather than an artistic one (though arguably it contains some artistry.) You can apply the same skill to original songs, too. If you\u2019re doing lyrics, my way of doing things, to again mixed success over the years, is the same way that I do poems. I get something inspirational (beautiful art), put it in front of me, have a message, intention, or concept that I want to say, and then write a text that rhymes. I\u2019ve used the exact same concept repeatedly, especially on bad days, and because the picture changes, the words change too. Or the concept changes, and so the words change too. And because there are a million, or more, pictures out there, I never run out of inspiration, I only ever run out of time. And some days, maybe I have bad concepts, so I\u2019ll go back to older works, remember those concepts, and use them instead. That\u2019s the end of my answer.  But let me use an example, yes? To explain my way further?  http://zandraart.tumblr.com [Alexandra Kern] Concept I\u2019m using is \u201cthe city shines like gemstones and sunset, I\u2019m seeing this for the first time through your eyes\u201d Random key signature: G major, chords are tentatively I-IV-V-I which is G, C, D, G. Left behind the diamonds, in their earthly tombsleft behind the shadows of evening in their gloomLeft behind the sun and its bright unlikely glareAll of that I left to fade into thin air But I\u2019m seeing the city again through the smokescreen and the lightof pollution that blocks the stars, it\u2019s what\u2019s in your eyesI\u2019m walking along hand in hand, smiling at your grinThe joie de vivre, you have to have, to live in the city that we\u2019re in I\u2019ve walked the streets with fear, with decadence and alone,Seen the underbelly of the beast I call my home,Behind York Street there\u2019s a gang of men with sunglasses and foam,Who throw out the owners of new restaurants who don\u2019t Work the way they do But I\u2019m seeing the city again through the smokescreen and the lightof pollution that blocks the stars, it\u2019s what\u2019s in your eyesWalking along with you, hand in hand, I\u2019m smiling at your grinThe joie de vivre, you have to have, to live in the city that we\u2019re in Gunfire - smoking along the stretch of streets.Blood diamonds - they drain the places where traffic meets.Slaves and people who dream of white lines, Accountants locked behind tax and battlelinesKids who grow up too soon but too blindNothing but terror, a place to leave behind But I\u2019m seeing the city again through the smokescreen and the lightof pollution that blocks the stars, it\u2019s the gemstones in your eyesI\u2019m walking along hand in hand, smiling at your grinIt\u2019s the gemstones and sunsets, the beauty of neon, the joy at the city that we live in Walking, rubber-band bass, melancholy gritty singer, practically spoken, e.g. Leonard Cohen, possibly with unexpected chord changes. Could be duetted. Heavy cymbal use for drums, but light taps, more jazz drums than rock drums. As a first draft, it\u2019s kind of terrible, but with more practice it could be something. Done, and that\u2019s a song in 10 minutes. ",

I just finished two songs for which I wrote the choruses about 30 years ago. I was stuck, so they were just \u2018junk\u2019 choruses, right? I\u2019m glad I hung on to them. As to how to write melodies and lyrics: Get some basic books on songwriring and learn the basic song forms, learn about rhyming schemes, what makes a chorus \u2018good\u2019, etc.Write. A lot.Listen to music and think about the melodies and lyrics - What makes rhem tick?Read and travel. That wll expand your vocabulary and your imagination.learn the basics of music theory: scales, triads, and chords. Will help a lot in the melody department.Don\u2019t get hung up about what comes first: chords, melody, or lyrics. I\u2019ve done all three. Do what works for you on that particular song.I hope this has been helpful to someone! ",
