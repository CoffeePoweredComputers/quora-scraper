            "answer_text": "Gladly this week is Global Accessibility Awareness Day. I am accessibility advocate and here to post accessibility tips. It totally change lives of disabled and make them confident. Accessibility solve barriers that disabled person faces ( and doesn\u2019t fix the disability instead). It also ensures that inclusion exists. It will focus on for the deaf and hard-of-hearing peers. Captions - such as live seminars, classrooms, meetings.There is difference between auto-captions and manual captions. Manual captions is preferred since it is 100% accuracy and no typos. Also it is smooth and easier to read. (Refer to Netflix captions. Love it !) Captions should be little big and in white color with black outline. It will reduce pressure on eyes.

Sign Language Intrepreters Acts as a third person to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing worlds. Sign language intrepreters work across in many fields such as video relay services ( alternatively called as phone calls for the Deafs), meetings, news etc.  Source: Google Images  Source: Video Relay Services - Google Images It makes us easier to make appointments with doctors and other formal services quickly and independently. 3. AI tools Might be helpful for short term or quick communication. Auto-captioning software translate voice to text in real time - to 90% accuracy depending on the speaker\u2019s accent and the background noise. Not ideal for long term use- for instance, in technical meetings etc. 4. FM systems (only for hard of hearing): FM devices cancels all the background noises and send sound signals from speaker directly to the hearing aid or cochlear implant to increase speech understanding in large halls or classrooms. (Deaf might not find it beneficial)  Not only all these methods helps the disabilities, also on the business level, ensuring the websites or products are accessible will expand the customer base and promotes diversity.
