            "answer_text": "It depends on the style being used for the writing. AP style doesn't use italics. In general, we put quotes around book titles, movie titles, opera titles, play titles, poem titles, album and song titles, radio and television program titles, and the titles of lectures, speeches and works of art.\u2014 AP Stylebook (@APStylebook) March 27, 2019\n In the Associated Press Stylebook, which is used by newspapers, all composition titles have quotation marks around them. In headlines, they have single quotes.  In the story, they use regular quotation marks. Punctuation such as periods or commas go inside of the quotation marks.  In MLA, titles of self-contained works are italicized, and titles of works which are a part of a larger work are put in quotation marks.[1][2]  This means that many essays written for classroom assignments, especially classes such as English, will require that book titles are in italics. Similarly, APA puts book and periodical titles in italics.[3] Many book publishers use the Chicago Manual of Style, which dictates that book and musical album titles are italicized, but chapter name and song titles are put in quotation marks. Whether the title of a work is italicized or put into quotation marks differs between styles. While writing, especially if submitting a work for publication, it is important to be certain of which style the publication uses and to adhere to that style.

            "answer_text": "When I was teaching the rule was that you used quotation marks around an item that was published separately, not as part of a larger work, even if it was relatively short such as Wordsworth's Tintern Abbey. You used italics in print or underlining in writing for a work that was only a part of a larger work, such as a chapter or a short story in a collection, even a whopping short story but Henry James that was a hundred pages long. By extension, an album or CD would be underlined or italicized, while a single cut would be put in quotes. A particular wrinkle of the MLA style sheet was that anything that made a paper look like it was published when n fact it had not, was considered deceptive. So no right justification, and underlining instead of italics. This may have changed. I don't know. I remember when the MLA required that the underling not extend into the spaces between words. This was rendered absurd by the IBM Correcting Selectric. My son tells me that the word processing induced reduction of space after a period from two spaces to one is facing resistance by commonwealth countries. ",
