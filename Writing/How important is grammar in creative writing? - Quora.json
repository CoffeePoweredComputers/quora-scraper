            "answer_text": "How important is grammar in creative writing? If all you want to do is write for yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter. If you want to write for others and potentially sell your work, then you simply have to do the study and practice. I am a programmer before I am a writer. When I was young\u2026 I sucked at English. I liked comic books and I genre fiction and got it in my head I wanted to write stories that turned out the way -I- wanted. I joined a pro-writing class at age 15, and barely scraped through with a \u2018D\u2019. The instructor took no mercy on me just because I was 5 to 10 years younger than her next youngest student. So, my stories and chapters came back bloody. I learned from my mistakes and I got better. Now, I help other writers. Like anything else it\u2019s time and effort. Grammar is fundamental to writing. Meaning is critical to story. Bad fundamentals distract the reader. They say the writer doesn\u2019t care enough to figure out the basics. That\u2019s not a message that reflects well on you.  ",
