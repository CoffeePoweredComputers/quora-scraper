            "answer_text": "Every department has different guidelines, but we did not make a written report on the majority of our calls. Upon going back in service we would enter a status in the computer - a 10 code that indicated the action taken. [FYI: My info is dated as I retired in 1990] The most common were: 10-61: gone on arrival / not found10-63: Complete - no report made10-65: Complete - report made10-66: Complete - arrest made10-67: Complete - citation issuedEach call also had a case number assigned to it and if we generated a report it used that case number.  Arrests, victim reports (theft, burglary, assault, etc) - all of course had reports. Suspicious person/vehicle, domestics, routine 'disturbance' type calls - typically did not (unless there was an arrest, damage or something transpired where we needed to document the who/what/where). In addition to the formal reports, which were public record, we could also complete field activity reports - a one page written form that was sent to CID (detectives). This was typically used for suspicious activity, though few used it.  When I retired (1990), while we had been using computer terminals in the cars for many years, all of our reports/citations were still done 'manually'. Now with many departments utilizing laptops/computers to complete their reports, I imagine and hope they document most everything - at least the who/what/where info. While the case reports are public record and one could access them by going to the record room, completing a form and paying a photo-copying fee - accessing the dispatch/call log data probably requires a court order - though that is just a guess. That information could be a lot more interesting and considering the potential privacy issues, I would hope there are some strict guidelines on it's access and release. ",

Always wrote something, although a lot of times it was classified as an intelligence report, no enforcement action. If we got called for a pharmacy robbery or burglary, prescription fraud, or a complaint involving a registrant (someone authorized to prescribe, dispense, or administer controlled substances) those got written up for the record. Investigations generate phenomenal amounts of paperwork. People have no idea how paper-intensive the job is, and it has to be perfect, because sooner or later, the defense attorney is going to see it, and if there are mistakes, he\u2019s going to beat you over the head with them for as long as he can and love every minute of it. And you\u2019ve got to account for your time, your car, official property signed out to you, your buy money, money paid to informants, evidence, etc, etc. It wasn\u2019t unusual to work on a case for 24 hours straight, and then spend another 12 doing paperwork. That\u2019s what I tell people asking about careers in law enforcement. You\u2019d better be a good writer and be comfortable filling out government forms, because that\u2019s about half your life.

But calls for service also include things like disabled motorist, well - being checks, suspicious person (activity found to involve no crime), traffic crashes, traffic control, shots fired ( we get LOTS of those calls during hunting season - callers bought the house in the spring and were ignorant about deer hunting), 911 disconnect calls (but dialed cell phones, crappy landlines when it rains), domestic arguments ( verbal only), and a host of other complaints that don't involve crimes \u201cbut ought to be a crime\" according to the complainant. Most of these calls are \u201clogged\" with a short comment in the dispatch log (e-records), while some officers keep notes in steno pads or similar notepads. ",

These usually went nowhere, but it covered your ass in case the nothing incident turned into a something. Most of the things I did generated no report. If I made a traffic stop and didn\u2019t write a citation or make an arrest, there was no report. If a citizen reported suspicious circumstances and it turned out to be something innocuous, there was no report. If I moved a piece of debris out of the roadway, there was no report. In each case, I would end my radio report that I had completed the stop or call with \u201cNA\u201d (no action), \u201cAC\u201d (advised and complied), or some other disposition code indicating what I did.
