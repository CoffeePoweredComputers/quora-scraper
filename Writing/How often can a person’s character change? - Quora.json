While strictly speaking there is no upper limit, the greatest probability is that a person will never change their character. It can, and should, however develop over time, more noticeably in the younger years, or after surviving a crisis. Out and out change is highly unlikely, and not something I have ever witnessed. However it may appear somewhat like that when dealing with a fraud artist. ",
