I'm fully committed towards my goals and I can proudly say it ! I would do anything and everything possible to accomplish my mission ! How ?? Okay I will tell youu.. Stop discussing about what the world is doing , discuss what and how your world is doing 1.Wake up with positive thought of winning* . As a man thinks in his heart, so is he! Think greatness, think success, think breakthrough! Rise up to do the needful. 2. You're here on purpose* . Success comes to those with success consciousness. If you think failing, don't be surprised of the outcome. Ignite your passion, shine your light! 3. Convert your ideas to things that make life pleasant to your generation. Never think of defeat, put that vision of yours accross and never mind what anyone will say to distract you. Get going! 4.Remember Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jnr. and the rest, they are vision minded beings. Go for your dream, be unstoppable! Let your dream belts your world! Never mind defeat, move on! 5. Continuous practise makes you a shining star* . Never allow your background put your back on the ground, make your life count. Break barriers, be inqusitive, be persistent. 6. You are unstoppable!* Believe in yourself, make sure you are on the winning side because you are truly a winner . 7.Laugh about your mistakes, But, learn from them. Joke over your troubles, But, gather strength from them. Have fun with your difficulties, But, overcome them. That's the way to live LIFE. 8. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. Get confident being uncertain. Don't give up just because something is hard. Pushing through challenges is what makes you grow. 9. Sometimes the best thing you can do is not overthink, not wonder, not imagine, not obsess. Just breathe and have faith that everything will work out for the best. 10. Always have a successful exit than a favourable entrance... Bcozz, what matters is not being clapped when we arrive but being remembered when we leave Cheers \ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\ude09 ",
