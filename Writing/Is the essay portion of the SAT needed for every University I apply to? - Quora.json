            "answer_text": "It really depends on which schools you\u2019re applying to and what the rest of your application looks like. There is a list of SAT essay policies of College and Scholarship Providers on the College Board website that is helpful. The top schools are pretty evenly split. Most liberal arts colleges do not require or recommend the SAT with the essay, but there are a few exceptions. And state schools are also pretty evenly divided. If the university recommends it (not requires it), it would still be in your best interest to do the essay. As always, check with the admissions team at the universities you are interested in to confirm their policy. They will be happy to walk you through their specific processes. Best of luck! ",
