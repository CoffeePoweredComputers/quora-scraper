            "answer_text": "I got several tutoring assignments straight out of junior college with no formal experience. Here are some practical tips based on what worked for me: Ensure you have excellent grades. Most parents looking to hire a tutor want someone who can help their child build a strong foundation in a subject and excel in their exams. Having excellent grades shows parents that you know how to master the subject and the strategies required to score in exams. This gives them hope that you will be able to guide their child to achieve similar success. I had straight As in all the major national exams I took in school and no parent has told me yet that they doubt my competency as a tutor just because I don\u2019t have a diploma or degree in Education.Decide what kind of students you want to teach. Teaching students in primary school is very different from teaching students in secondary school or junior college. You may find it easier to establish rapport with on age group than another, depending on your personality and life experiences. For example, I chose to work with primary school children because I get along with kids well and find them fun to teach. Once you have earned the trust and respect of your student, he/she will be more receptive to your teaching and both of you will look forward to classes.Market your services. Start by asking the people you know, like family, neighbors, friends because they are the most likely to take notice and hire you. I identified some my parent\u2019s friends with children contacted them to ask if they needed a tutor. A couple of them said yes, and that\u2019s how I got my first batch of students. Now, I get new students by by referrals. Alternatively, there are numerous websites dedicated to matching tutors with students. If you are concerned that you won\u2019t be able to stand out from the crowd, try advertising on education forums and peer-to-peer marketplaces.Keep your fees competitive in the beginning. Go and find the market rate is per hour is and set yours a notch lower. Parents tend to stick with the same tutor if they see that their child is making progress, so you can always negotiate for a better hourly rate later. It\u2019s more important to get your foot in the door first. I increase the fees every year as the student progresses a grade up.Develop a teaching strategy that works. The first thing that you\u2019ll inevitably be asked by parents is what you intend to do in the 1.5-2 hours they\u2019re paying you for. You must know the latest syllabus and exam requirements. Find out what difficulties the child is presently facing, figure out your learning objectives, and divide the time allocated for lessons in a sensible manner. For example, if a parent tells me that their child needs help with vocabulary, I might make a list of words which they should master and devote 0.5 hours of class time to constructing sentences with them.Make your terms and conditions clear from the start. Just because you don\u2019t have any experience doesn\u2019t mean that you should let parents step all over you. I\u2019ve encountered the occasional parent who would try to lowball on fees \u201cbecause other tutors are charging less\u201d, would routinely pay the fees late, or kept cancelling and rescheduling lessons on their own whim. Work out a clear policy with the parent from the start on matters like these and if both of you can\u2019t agree, then it may be best to let the assignment go. It\u2019s not worth the hassle at all.Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Not having experience is something that happens to literally everybody when they first start something. Of course, experience is valuable and should be sought after; however, don\u2019t believe some that say it is the only way to learn or get better at something. There are plenty of ways to increase your knowledge and understanding of a subject/topic/skill. With online learning, educational content has been widely accessible, ready to help educate people through formal lessons and even sharing other people\u2019s experiences with learners. Unfortunately, first-hand experience is something you don\u2019t have until you get it (funny one huh?). When it comes to tutoring, one of the best ways to gain teaching experience is to teach someone for free. You can connect with students both locally and online to help them learn. You can offer to teach them for a period of time. Both of you should treat the situation as if it were a formal tutoring arrangement. You should prepare for and deliver all your lesson as if you were hired to teach them. This new experience would lay a solid foundation for you to build your tutoring business. Those you taught for free are potential students, their word of mouth can lead to potential, and finally, you could join a platform that connects you with Learners. LearnX, is the social learning app that connects teachers and students. You can find students to teach for free or a tutor can teach you in exchange for you teaching them. Check it out, and nice job being proactive! ",
