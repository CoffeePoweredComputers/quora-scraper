For ANDROID - WhatsBlueText is the first android app in the play store which allows you to write blue coloured font in social media websites like (Facebook messenger, Instagram) and Instant messengers (Hike, BBM and Whatsapp). Follow the simple steps to use WhatsBlueText application for messenging, Status update and Name Change. Go to Google Play store and download WhatsBlueText Stylish Font App.Install.You will see two text box on top. Type anything in first text box.Surprisingly you will see a stylish blue colour font in next text box.Tap on that text box to copy blue coloured text. You need to invite 7 friends to use this app or Purchase a pro version to skip the invite.Once you invite 7 friends, you will be automatically redirected to Pro version without paying a single penny.Now you can enjoy the fancy 25+ styled text for free. Sadly there\u2019s no possible way (to my knowledge) to change Whatsapp text colour in iOS platform. Will update the same if I get any. THANKS FOR THE A2A :) ",

If you see anyone having font color of their WhatsApp chat changed, it is because he's using some modded version of WhatsApp which is illegal as well as unfair to use. Don't use modded versions of WhatsApp. They can steal your data and besides, WhatsApp is being strict on unofficial WhatsApp users. Recently WhatsApp banned many of it's users just because of this.
