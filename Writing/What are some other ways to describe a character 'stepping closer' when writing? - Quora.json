            "answer_text": "Think more broadly about what it means to act. There are ranges of approach to depicting movement which can serve one or multiple purposes. The structures mentioned in the question are of the basic 'verb + preposition' form: \"stepped (closer, toward, away, into, etc.)\" Most of the time this works and it's unnecessary to dig beyond that foundation. There was an action, something happened, and there was some consequence -- good enough. The feeling of 'repetition' cited in the question reveals the problem with relying on the basics all the time or in the same way. One mark of literary work, for example, is the use of upgraded verbs. Words like 'stepped' become words like prowled, stalked, bounded, crept, etc. This isn't an easy style to maintain for long and it can become tedious to read. Using fancier words for the sake of pacing eventually gets old, too. At this point it's worth considering the purpose of the paragraph, the sentence, and the overall scene. What is being accomplished? What sort of character development or mood is being communicated? The compromise position tends to be found in using a combination of sentences or phrases to capture the impression of a scene rather than relying on boilerplate description. This part is tricky because it's about the selection of detail (perhaps with embroidery) rather than just relating 'what happens.' Hemingway's \"A Clean Well-Lighted Place\" is a short master class in this form (though this link lacks good formatting). Or you could try some of Salinger's stories;\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\" comes to mind. In form, Hemingway's descriptions aren't much different from the normal stuff. It's the space and pacing that makes them electric and alive. He takes a neat telescoping perspective when it comes to creating the street where his story takes place. We get details about the people who are passing, hints at a relationship, and finally a sprinkling of gilded detail with the number on the soldier's collar -- what an observer might notice in the present. This variety of scene setting places the viewer within the story's context. We create the place out of our own experiences and in the process it becomes more real. The author acts as a guide to what should be seen. This is what I mean when I talk about 'framing' actions. If there is too much 'stepping' going on then it is possible the scene is not yet focused or compressed, or that other observations are not being made -- that the focus has shifted to physical facts and away from more abstract insights. It is the difference between an ordinary step and the footstep that echoes before it, too, is swallowed by the hospital corridor. Ask: does the reader need to see this? If not, move on. If so, either place it somewhere in the ordinary narrative flow (sometimes walking is just walking) or slow down and frame it to be seen. ",

It sounds to me like you need to read more fiction. Plenty more will suggest themselves when you do. ",
