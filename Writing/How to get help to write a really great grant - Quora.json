They have a program called SCORE which has retired business administrators/executives with experience in many fields. You may find one who has written a grant or had oversight over a grant program. The grants I used to write were Federally funded programs. They would issue extensive guidance packages. I highly recommend reading everything in the grant application/guidance package thoroughly. Follow their formatting (font, page margins, etc.) exactly. Follow the sequence of the grant guidance package. For example: If they say one page summary of your project, be sure to answer all the questions they ask in your summary. Follow page limits exactly. Check and doublecheck your mathematical calculations - your grant will be graded on how well you follow the guidance, questions answered, and correct math in budgets you include. The party offering the grant may have pre-proposal conferences by telephone or web video. Be sure to listen or watch these, and ask all questions that come into your mind. There are no dumb questions. If you have plenty of time before the grant is due and it is a Federal grant, you can request a copy of the last successful grant with the highest score. This is also helpful to see what the organization considers an outstanding grant application. Paid assistance: If you are familiar with the networking web site called LinkedIn, you can search for grant writers. Check with local colleges or community colleges, or State funded universities. Check with your local library to see if they have any grant resources - for example, my city library maintains a CD of grant assistance resources and you may find a grant writer. If you search for grant writers, freelance grant writers, etc., on google, you will find a lot of links. Here\u2019s a few that I found: How to Hire a Grant Writer GPA ",
