            "answer_text": "Well, it is a very broad subject and one could approach it from many angles and on many levels. If I were to write this thesis for my University degree, I would consider the speech Trump just made when he went to Poland, two days ago. You can make it as political as you wish, but the premise of your thesis should be either you agree or disagree with this thought, notion, philosophy, policy that governs a country, in in this case, the US immigration Policy. Trump. or more accurately, his sicker advisors like Steve Bannon and Steve Miller and their staff believe that Islam is taking over the world, specifically the Western world, it is us and them, it is the Christianity against Islam mentality, therefore, we are against them, and it is time to arm and fight them head on. What they are saying is that increased immigration is bad, \u2018increase immigration into a country is a sign of weakness, not strength\u2019, apparently they are conveniently forgetting their own Irish heritage, the starved Irish immigrant parents and grand parents, and have become what we call the nativists, as Trump has, even though his own mother was born in Germany, everybody came from the old world, the true natives are only what we call Native Americans, nobody else can claim it, shamefully , we treated them very inhumanly and poorly at the very best, or as they put it immigration is for \u201c a people , a civilization that wants to die\u201d. They want to stop immigration of people into the US because they are not Irish, or pure white or whatever\u2026.. This would be my argument and by putting forward the fact countries like the US, Canada, Australia, NZ, and many others, they happened to be English speaking people, just look at South America, would not have become what they are without their immigrants. Stop being racist!! America is America because of its immigrants, just remember Einstein! ",

            "answer_text": "Your thesis statement is your considered opinion on a particular aspect of immigration\u2014there are many issues to consider. You will need to do some research to decide what you think about immigration, and then craft a sentence that clearly states what you think and why you think it in 25 or fewer words. If you can\u2019t get a clear opinion in that short a space, you need to do more research until you have enough information to have an opinion worth defending, which is what the rest of your essay does: it defends your opinion. Counterintuitively, the more narrow your focus, the better your argument will be. For example, you might argue that people who have served in the armed forces should be given a route to citizenship even if they were undocumented. You would have to have some reasons to argue that your idea is a good one and would be beneficial both for the people in that circumstance and for the country as a whole. ",
