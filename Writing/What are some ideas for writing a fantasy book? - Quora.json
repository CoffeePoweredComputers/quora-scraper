            "answer_text": "Create a world enough like ours to be familiar, but with some real weirdness that makes readers do a mental double-take. In one of my books, I have the protagonist end up in what appears at first to be a normal town, but every now and then, he catches a flicker from the corner of his eye, and on turning around could have sworn that tower wasn\u2019t there a moment ago, or that house was a different shape, and so on. The protagonist and his companion are captured by the townspeople, the senior of whom call themselves \u201crevenants\u201d. The prisoners are to be regularly bled for the purpose of feeding \u201cUncle Gruon\u201d, a huge dragon who sleeps in a mountain lair. The entire town and its inhabitants are formed from the dragon\u2019s dreams, and the town disappears when the dragon wakes up. The revenants are recurrent dreams who become aware of the situation over time. They realise that as long as the dragon is kept sated with human blood, it will continue to dream them and not wake up: so now, they keep it fed with the blood of passers-by, who are kept in a special (non-dream) compound. Some are kept as breeders, and some know of no life outside the compound. The protagonist, Grimm Afelnor, a magic-user, astrally travels outside the confines of the compound and seeks out the dragon\u2019s mind. He finds out that the dragon was once the dream of a wizard: now the wizard is the dream of his own creation. As long as the dragon sleeps, the wizard cannot wake up. I thought this was adequately weird. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my favorite authors, Patrick Rothfuss, once said something that really resonated with me. \u201cIf you want to write a fantasy story with Norse gods, sentient robots, and telepathic dinosaurs, you can do just that. Want to throw in a vampire and a lesbian unicorn while you're at it? Go ahead. Nothing's off limits. But the endless possibility of the genre is a trap. It's easy to get distracted by the glittering props available to you and forget what you're supposed to be doing: telling a good story. Don't get me wrong, magic is cool. But a nervous mother singing to her child at night while something moves quietly through the dark outside her house? That's a story. Handled properly, it's more dramatic than any apocalypse or goblin army could ever be.\u201d You shouldn\u2019t be asking this question. Besides the obvious thing of you not coming up with your own idea and taking all the accomplishment away from writing your book, first and foremost, you should be thinking of a good story. ",
