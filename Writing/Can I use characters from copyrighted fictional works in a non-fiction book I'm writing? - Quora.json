            "answer_text": "I spent the last two years in creating what I wished to be \u2019a fanfiction saga so well written to make you forget it\u2019s unofficial\u2019. It\u2019s a saga of novels I started in 2015 after two years only because of censorship that kept me away from the internet even if my blog was for free (my freeshare blog was censored by U.S. copyright protection organization, the DMCA). I could finally release my novels for free thanks to character\u2019s creator permission ONLY (writer David Morrell, a worldwide famous author that was not easy to take contact with\u2026 Not at all). My personal story made me ran into various legal threats because even if my books have always been for free, they finally turned out quite successfull in terms of both public and critical acclaim, thus creating the wrath of some of the copyright owners\u2026 And I received ALL of that wrath (whoa!). That\u2019s the reason I talked in lenght with lawyers and copyright owners about what I made, and I have a first hand knowledge about the subject. That said, you can\u2019t publish what you want to write. You can DISCUSS other author\u2019s character, but you can\u2019t create \u201cWHAT IF\u201ds scenes AND sell a book like that. You can FREESHARE only a work like this, but you can\u2019t publish it and sell it. In order to publish and sell creative content featuring copyrighted characters, you have to reach a deal with ANY SINGLE copyright owner involved in what you made. Meanig that you have to pay for every single character (pay its publishing company for Harry Potter, pay Disney for Donald Duck and so on\u2026 you got the point). I am Italian, but don\u2019t let the country I belong make you think our laws are any different\u2026 because they don\u2019t. And if I mess up here in Italy, legal action from US to Italy is pretty immediate thanks to international agreements. Sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "Quoting or referring to an author\u2019s work in the context of a discussion of his or her narrative techniques is usually fine. Writing original material in their fictional universe isn\u2019t, because then you are no longer discussing *their* narrative technique, you are using their creative concepts to demonstrate your own. quote them to make your point and then simply write your own material without specific references to their work. \u201clet\u2019s say that instead of this scene, an author decides to focus on how a wizard and his apprentice might go bowling together\u2026here\u2019s a sample scene (with characters I created)\u2026.\u201d. There\u2019s no point you can\u2019t make with your own original material. Honestly, if you give out copies of an original scene with Rawling\u2019s characters in it, the odds of a copy winding up somewhere without people realizing she didn\u2019t write it is pretty high. It doesn\u2019t matter how you present it or what disclaimers you add. people who email snippets of things don\u2019t include all that stuff. That could turn into real trouble down the line. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say exactly as you put it yourself. You're already using Harry Potter and Hermione Granger to get your concerns across to us. You're not ripping off H.P. and H.G. to create another fiction with those characters, but using them for explanatory purposes. It's like if I were to use Mickey Mouse and Topo Gigio (Italy's answer to M.M.) to make the point about rodent rearing and things to avoid. So long as I am (and you are) not using those characters in a negative or defamatory way, chances are it wouldn't cause a ruckus from their creators. Updated 29 Dec. 2014 to add: Having said the above, Mark L. Levinson makes an equally serious and valid point against using those characters. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that if your use of the works is an integral part of your discussion of tropes, narrative concepts etc. then you should be okay.  You wouldn't be so okay if you invented dialogues using someone else's characters merely to add interest to a topic that you could have explained equally well without them.  Especially if you chose characters whose owners ferociously guard their rights.  Your best option is to consult a lawyer who knows the field. ",
