            "answer_text": "Why are there more male authors than female authors? I agree generally with the answers so far. Historically, there is a significant gap, because historically, it was much easier for men to both obtain the education to write well, and the experiences to have something to write about. Even fiction writing needs to be informed by some degree of experience, at least in the modern age when it\u2019s likely someone who does have experience will read it. (It was fairly easy in the 1100s, for instance, to get away with writing whatever you wanted about China, or in the 1500s about the native Mexican tribes, if you lived in England or Spain - it wasn\u2019t likely you were going to get a lot of informed audience objections. It\u2019s more difficult today to get away with certain kinds of fabrications.) Not to mention that a book by a woman had to be extraordinarily good in order to get published, in the past, while the barrier for men was not nearly as high. (Or she had to be independently wealthy or famous enough to ensure its publication!) Something to keep in mind looking at modern publishing is that some authors do write under pen names, and sometimes those pen names deliberately obfuscate the gender of the author. For instance, in science fiction and fantasy, female writers sometimes go by initials, especially if they have a distinctly feminine first name. Sci-fi in particular has generally been seen as a very male genre, in the same way that science itself has been seen as a male field. In romance, alternatively, some male authors write under more neutral-sounding pen names, because romance is seen as \u2018a woman\u2019s genre\u2019. Some pen names aren\u2019t even a single author - Ilona Andrews, for instance, is the pen-name of a husband-and-wife writing team. I assume the bookstore in your comment did their due diligence and actually classified the authors correctly, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind when scanning book titles and authors on a shelf. The author\u2019s gender may not be what you think or assume that it is. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have any actual credentials in this, but here\u2019s what I can gather: It\u2019s hard to say whether this is actually true- whether there really is or was more men in writing. It used to be that, as in many occupations, female authors simply didn\u2019t receive the attention that male authors. Female authors were often cut out of what was considered \u201cgreat literature\u201d, and didn\u2019t get studied in colleges until recently. It\u2019s not that female writers didn\u2019t exist; it\u2019s just that it has taken time to rediscover their work. Even so, women weren\u2019t cut out completely- think Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, or Louisa May Alcott and Little Women, a personal favorite; also, the works of Virginia Woolf firmly lodged themselves in the literary canon. Nowadays, though, it is substantially easier for women to get into writing, and to get that writing noticed. There really isn\u2019t any barrier preventing a woman with a good story from getting it published, that a man in her place would not also face. The entire Harry Potter series written by Joanne K. Rowling is proof of this. We could also debate adding Stephanie Meyer, but I am not the kind of person who enjoys Twilight. Now, if you\u2019re not just talking about fiction authors, but things like journalism and writing for magazines\u2026 I do not see a significant gender difference there. If there is one, I don\u2019t have an explanation. ",
