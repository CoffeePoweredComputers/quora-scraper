Grey is manipulative and creepy well before the \u201cBDSM\u201d stuff comes up. I put BDSM in quotes because THAT is not BDSM, that's straight up abuse. And some of the things Grey says he's done in the past are outright dangerous. Using zip ties as wrist restraints and then leaving the sub tied for hours can cause nerve damage! This book is poorly written, it glamorizes abuse, it makes BDSM in general seem way more messed up than it actually is, and some of the acts mentioned can be downright dangerous. ",

I also tried reading the first Hunger Games book but the story of it, the fact that kids have to fight in a game to the death, is a ridiculous plot idea. Both books, I had to put them down when I was halfway through them. ",

She is shown constantly whining for no reason,making wrong choices ( which affected badly for others) throughout the series. She is shown incredibly selfish and used her parents, Jacob, Mike Newton ,Jessica many times. No sane human jumps from cliff or tries to get gang raped ( and still complains about Jessica ). Love of bells and Edward doesn't seem true as it's based on good looks and good smell, there is hardly any friendship , time or same interests they have to believe their love. If you want good love story of vampire and human, I feel Hotel Transylvania is 10 times better, interesting and emotional too! ",
