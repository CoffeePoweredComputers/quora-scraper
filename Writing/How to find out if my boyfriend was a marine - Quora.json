            "answer_text": "I am part of an organisation that ousts individuals committing \u201cStolen Valor\u201d by claiming to be military veterans and heroes, but who are actually lying about it for personal benefit. When offenders are dicovered and proven, we publicly release the fact that no records were found along with proof of the claims that turned out to be lies. The U.S. government keeps exacting, tedious records of those who served. General Military Record information about those who served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America are public information. You may request Veterans' Service Records through the National Archives. Please see link for more information: Veterans' Service Records ",

Normally, they have Marine clothing, pictures of them in uniform, Marine decals on their vehicles, Marine buddies, and they call each other weird names like Gunfighter 2 or Warlock 6. Being in the military is a lifestyle, looking around my office I see a lot of Army stuff and I\u2019ve been out for 8 years now. Clear as mud??? ",
