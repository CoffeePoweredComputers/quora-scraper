A : \u0935\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0928 \u091c\u093e\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u092c\u094b\u0927\u0903! [tentative meaning - view all the sides to the given situation to reach the reality or the truth] When base of the argument is restricted to satisfying our ego we argue, and generally we take a stand which suits us. In such case our thinking is always prejudiced because we open only those cards which are favorable to prove our desired end. Then we stretch the point beyond reasonable limits after which it becomes unrealistic. With exaggeration we take it to illogical end and lose the reality aspect in it. We might win the debate but lose in reaching the truth. Therefore, if we want to understand the reality, [say the \u2019golden mean\u2019] you have to think from all the possible dimensions of given situation. Particularly, when you draft a legal document, you make various provision regarding how the things should be, however, simultaneously you also have to think of what should happen if the things do not go as per the agreement.

Now say you want to write for the topic then include the points that you have for the topic as well as try to defy the points against the topic. I hope you are getting what I'm trying to say. In the case you are confused then give me a topic in the comments and I'll tell you what I mean. :) ",
