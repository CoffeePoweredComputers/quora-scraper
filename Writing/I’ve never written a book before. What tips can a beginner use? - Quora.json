            "answer_text": "Since I was 6, I knew I wanted to be a writer. I thought that every writer needs to sit down and write the whole book in one set. I know it\u2019s pure madness. Here\u2019s why. I didn\u2019t have the habit to write. I didn\u2019t know the process. With those 5 books , you will kick off your writing career. 1. The Achievement Habit By Bernard Roth  Image from here Admit it\u2026 writing is hard. It\u2019s natural to feel discouraged. \u201cMaybe I am not good enough\u201d you may whisper.

The Civic Tech Leadership Program selected participants with Bernard Roth at the D. School We had an interesting conversation about design thinking. He is famous for his book The Achievement Habit. \u201cIn The Achievement Habit, Roth applies the remarkable insights that stem from design thinking\u200a\u2014\u200apreviously used to solve large scale projects\u200a\u2014\u200ato help us realize the power for positive change we all have within us.

Rework By Jason Fried And David Heinmeier Hansson  Image from here Most writers think that great content will save them all the time. Think about Mel Robbins for example.

Carry on reading. \u201cMost business books give you the same old advice: Write a business plan, study the competition, seek investors, yadda yadda. If you\u2019re looking for a book like that, put this one back on the shelf. With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who\u2019s ever dreamed of doing it on their own.

            "answer_text": "If you have never written a book, but has written short stories, essays or poems you have a good start. Otherwise you\u2019ll need more time. The first thing you must absolute decide is what type of book you want to write. A novel is quite a complex task to be undertaken by a newbie, I think you\u2019d better start with short stories. Even if you do want to write your own autobiography, it\u2019s a good way to begin structuring it, one step each time. If there\u2019s a long and overarching story to be told (like your autobiography, but it can be a fiction too), your first step is to plan it. Write down your bits of information in small cards and begin ordering them sequentially as they connect to each other. If you want, you can use larger cards and write notes on their backs, but my tip is to give each card a title and a reference number. Then you write bits of text that will be referred to by the titles and numbers on the cards. Don\u2019t use a computer at this stage to prevent losing touch with your history as you fiddle with it and gets distracted by internet and all else. Let the playfulness of shuffling and reshuffling the cards help you develop your ideas and the relationship between them. Collect these cards in a shoe-box (or a proper file if own one or can afford to buy it). Keep adding cards (and bits of information) as you imagine them. Don\u2019t mind with the form at this stage, your goal is to think up every element you\u2019ll need in your book. Among the things you need to write down are the characters (their full names, even if you won\u2019t use this information in the end), their family trees, their relationships, love interests, past affairs, preferences (remember James Bond: \u2018stirred, not shaken\u2019), job, physical traits\u2026 But you\u2019ll also make such \u201ccharacter cards\u201d for places, buildings, companies, pets, even particular trees or anything that might be relevant to the story. When you have a good-sized collection of cards, it\u2019s time to begin selecting which bits of information you\u2019ll need. The first step here is to categorise your information. Characters go into this shoe-box. Places go into that other. There\u2019s a third for characters that will only be mentioned. A fourth for places nobody will visit, but only talk about. A larger box, drawer or file will contain the scenes you have already written. When you have all properly sorted, pick the most relevant events and the characters and places related to them. Try to imagine ways to bridge these together, if they appear to be broken apart. Ideas you won\u2019t use go into a \u201cslush pile\u201d or a \u201cgarbage box\u201d. Don\u2019t throw them away, a writer\u2019s garbage today is the same writer\u2019s treasure tomorrow. When you are sure you have your facts straight, write down a detailed synopsis for them. Keep working in chronological order. Walk before dancing. Now site before your computer, open your favourite text editor (mine\u2019s NeoVim nowadays) and begin writing down each scene in the story. Follow Neruda\u2019s advice: you begin with a capital letter and finish with a period, in-between go your ideas. Write the story sequentially to help you find inconsistencies. If you want your book to tell the story in patchwork way or beginning in media res or any other fancy technique you\u2019ve read about, rework it like that after you have told the story in full and going from A-Z instead of Y-P-A-Z-S-X-C-D-J-M-K and whatever. As you write, try to whisper the words, imagine how they sound. If that\u2019s not sounding good, that\u2019s not good. Don\u2019t overload information, use only what you need and when you need. If the character\u2019s hair colour is not meaningful to the story, don\u2019t even mention he has hair. Don\u2019t shove your vision into the face of your reader, let the reader room to imagine the story his way. Re-read your text after you have finished it. Find someone of your trust to read if for you and find inconsistencies. Re-write the book in your preferred order now. Re-read it again. Ask someone\u2019s opinion about how it reads now it is shuffled (if you have shuffled it). Never hesitate to cut what seems to be excessive and always think twice before you need any information which is not obviously missing and avoid inconsistencies like the plague. If your character must carry his luggage upstairs, don\u2019t mention later that he has checked in to a single-story roadside motel. If your hot lass has undressed fully, don\u2019t let her appear on a window wearing see-through lingerie. Don\u2019t kill the same ancestor in two different ways, unless you make it clear somewhere that your character is a liar, has bad memory or is being lied to. Use appropriate vocabulary. Don\u2019t mention a swarm of fish or a school of birds. If you\u2019re not sure, keep it simple. Don\u2019t lift words from a dictionary to give \u201cpolish\u201d to your text: words which don\u2019t live in your heart won\u2019t be warm to your reader, but harsh. And when you\u2019ve written your book, please let me read it. ",
