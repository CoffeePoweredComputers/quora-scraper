            "answer_text": "Different people are able to focus to different types of music, but I think the most common type to focus to is classical. If you don't like classical, try movie soundtracks. I like The Theory of Everything's movie soundtrack - classical, but with a little modern twist. You can also try acoustics or jazz, although personally I think jazz is too boring. I suggest that you create a playlist ahead of time with music that you know you can focus to and use that when you write your essay. Good luck and have fun trying out music to focus to! ",

            "answer_text": "I'd say it depends on the type of writing environment you require.  I write proposals for a living and find that Electronic/Dubstep helps keep me engaged and in the energetic state of mind needed for that kind of environment.  But, after my wedding, and when writing thank you cards, I found warmth and emotion-provoking music helped to bring out the \"gratefulness\" in my nature; anything from Bubbly, to Fergie's Big Girls Don't Cry, to Paul Simon's I Only Have Eyes for You, and even Pearl Jam's Just Breathe are good examples.   So, in short, find music that provokes the nature your essay's subject requires. ",
