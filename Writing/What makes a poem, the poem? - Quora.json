            "answer_text": "Well poem is all about deploying true emotions in subtle but relatable manner. To make a poem you will need following things MessageA channel to deliver the messageAn environment for that channel.For a change I ll explain my answer backwards. 3. An environment for the channel Well this is from where you start, you have to make an interesting start just to get the readers attention. It may be there even from the title itself. Here is where you deliver your first 2 stanzas. Ideally you can describe the scene, emotion or person. Trust me it's just like you have invited a friend to come over and you are showing your house to him/her. 2. Channel to deliver the message Since you have readers attention now play your cards wisely. Remember this mantra. Readers are always impatient. They loose interest quickly. You have to continuously surprise them, just to keep their attention. This is where your next 2 stanzas come into the picture. It's like pulling a string in order to release the arrow. You can try asking questions in this department. 1.The message. Since you have pulled the string long enough, now don't make them wait and just say it. Express your message. The most important part is it should be relatable enough to create an impact on users mind. In my personal opinion ideal length for a poem is 5 to 6 stanzas. Hope this helps you. Keep inking. ",

            "answer_text": "Well these are just my opinions on this and i am not any professional or anything into this.These are just my views over this topic.A fine poem is the one in which the poet expresses his feeling his ideas and his imagination over various things freely and yet they rhyme soo well that anyone who reads it can feel the same way as the poet wanted it to express it.A poem Always focuses mainly on one's imagination the way he or she sees the world or the way they want the world to be .A great poem us that can touch one's heart. That can make u realize about one's emotions ,Dreams and fears too.These are just my frank thoughts on how a poem can be the poem . ",
