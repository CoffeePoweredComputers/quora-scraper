            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \"formal writing\". I assume you mean writing meant to be seen as serious and for the eyes of someone in authority.  In English, we use various subtle signs to distinguish writing meant for friendly, chatty sorts of communications, from that meant to persuade authorities of our seriousness. For example, we shift from simple Anglo-Saxon single-syllable words to longer Latinate words, because it tells the reader that the contents are meant to be read by those who are more educated and that the writer is being erudite. For instance: \"We got the gang together and headed to the mall\". \"We assembled the group and then proceeded to the mall\".  The first is suitable for a letter, while the second wouldn't be out of place in a legal brief.  If you want to communicate seriousness immediately in your writing, eliminating all contractions will do much of that work for you.  \"We didn't go then, and we haven't gone since!\" \"We did not go then, and we have not gone since!\" The first is friendly, the second is more forceful and measured. You can imagine the speaker bearing down on the \"then\" and the \"since\". The tone is different. It's just one way of many that we apply touches of tone in writing. Writing in English is somewhat akin to writing music, with undertones and counterpoints that aren't readily apparent, but have an effect regardless.  ",

            "answer_text": "Often you can use contractions in formal writing. One of your goals as a writer is to spotlight your ideas and information. You don\u2019t want to distract readers with clumsy wording. So - if \u201cI am\u201d sounds awkward, change it to \u201cI\u2019m.\u201d Often your reader won\u2019t even notice. It\u2019s like the urban legend that you can\u2019t start a sentence with but. Everybody was told that in school. Everybody believes it. But when you start thinking about it, you see sentences starting with but in absolutely everything you read. And then you discover there\u2019s never been a rule against it, and the alleged prohibition has never appeared in any books about grammar and writing. https://bit.ly/StartwithBut My advice to you would be to look at formal writing - and learn from it. Many of the rules we\u2019ve been given are sheer nonsense. (I\u2019m not attacking English teachers - I was one myself for 30 years!) No professional writer would give them a second\u2019s thought, and you shouldn\u2019t either.  ",
