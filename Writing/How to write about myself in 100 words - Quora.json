            "answer_text": "Looking at some of the previous answers, I must ask - can you clarify your question? Did you want to know how to write about yourself in 100 words? Or how to write about yourself in 100 listed bulletpoints? Some of the responses to your question are over 100 words - one is well over 2500 words. Start by using a program like MS Word or Google Docs, that can track your word count. Then just write about yourself. Ask yourself - \u201cWhat do I want people to know about me?\u201d Then check your word count, and revise apropriately - either add or cut words until you hit your word count. Here\u2019s a totally fictional paragraph as an example: I was born on Telstar 47, in the Sondelan galaxy. I grew up in a colony bloc. My parents were colonists from Earth, and I was one of the first children born on the planet. My education was full of the usual topics. When I was 6 years old, I learned to play the tannegard (a guitar-like instrument). I didn\u2019t have many friends as a child. I took a bunch of tech courses after high school, and now I work in IT. I keep the life support systems up and running. If I screw up, everybody dies. No pressure, right? I hope that helps. ",
