            "answer_text": "Do you mean the original movie with Robert Redford (1974), the re-do (2013) or F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s novel?

I thought the 1974 movie was well done. I walked out on the 2013 version. I like the book, primarily for its use of a first person narrator who isn\u2019t the main character. ",
