            "answer_text": "A lot of this seems really obvious but you\u2019d be amazed how easily people fall into the trap of working with untrustworthy writing services. Here the things you need to know Consider your goals first. What do you expect to get out of this writing? Is the writing for a good grade (aka cheating), to land a job, to increase brand awareness, to increase revenues?Look for companies that specialize in the kind of writing you need. Content writers don\u2019t always make good essay writers. A person who can write amazing copy may not be able to write a novel. A press release write may struggle writing an engaging blog.Look at their samples and make sure they can write in a style comparable to what you\u2019re looking for.Check their reviews. More reviews isn\u2019t always better. I\u2019d go with a person with 3\u20134 awesome reviews over someone with 100\u2019s of reviews with 2\u20133% of them negative.Don\u2019t overpay but don\u2019t underpay either. Spending more doesn\u2019t mean more trustworthy, but if they\u2019re offering to provide a service that has a writer making $10\u201315/hr US, you can expect that that writer isn\u2019t going to put the time needed into your work to give you the piece you think you\u2019re paying for. They\u2019re going to try to do it as fast as possible and get it over with then say it took longer just to get a decent wage for their professional work.You\u2019ll find this article very helpful to you also. 5 Silly Mistakes People Make When Hiring A Writer  ",
