            "answer_text": "Yes. A bill of sale is a legal record of an ownership transfer, and it is required by all states as documentation of a vehicle transaction (private party or otherwise) unless the vehicle is being given as a gift, in which case a \"gift letter\" is required. However, what isn't commonly understood is that a bill of sale can be very informal - something as simple as a hand written letter can suffice (just be sure to write in blue or black ink). Here's what you need to include:  Legal name of buyer(s) and seller(s)Full description of the vehicle (year, make, model, mileage, and color)Purchase price, value of trade-in (if applicable), etc.A statement like \"Under penalty of perjury, the parties warrant...\" OR a notary's seal (check with your state's DMV)The signatures of both the buyer(s) and seller(s)Most states have a sample bill of sale you can print out and/or copy online (see one for Colorado here: http://www.larimer.org/motorv/billofsale.pdf), so a quick search on Google should give you a free template to work from. NOTE: If you're considering a private party sale or purchase, you might talk to your local auto dealer about a \"pass thru\" transaction. For a fee, your local dealer will process your purchase for you, which helps to ensure that your title paperwork is up-to-snuff, that you're not doing business with a criminal (i.e. inadvertently buying stolen property), and that whatever payment you receive is valid, as the dealership has experience with detecting fake payment instruments. For a couple hundred bucks, you can save yourself a lot of hassle...and you might even be able to get the other party to pay the dealer's transaction fee as part of the purchase. Additionally, if you can do a pass-thru at the dealership you're going to buy your next car from, you can save a lot of money on sales tax too. ",
