What really matters is whom you are writing for, what the content is and how will that content be received. There are some people who pay $2-$5 ie Rs 100-Rs500 for 1000 words and there are some who the same for 500 words. There have been times where I have written content of approximately 2000 words and yet have received Rs 100 for the same. Basically, it all depends on whom you are writing for. ",
