            "answer_text": "Although most works are one or two (or maybe three) lines long on paper (in CS/CE), the true answer is \u201cas long as needed to give a picture of your work\u201d. Shorter but impactful names can make your work memorable. For example, \u201cCandy Crush is NP-Hard.\u201d We can discern IMMEDIATELY what happens in this work, without going overboard on the length. You could call it \u201cAnalysis of algorithmic complexity in video game Candy Crush\u201d but it\u2019s too long and full of fluff. It might suit the \u201cgowns and robes\u201d people more, but for us \u201csweaters and T-shirts\u201d folks, the simple four-word sentence is enough to deliver the meaning we need. Now, this is my dissertation:  When deciding what to use, I first came up with three candidates, then discuss with the professors which would best describe my work. It wasn\u2019t good enough and still needed a lot of polish. We spent a few hours back and forth discussing my work again and again to ensure that every single word is necessary to describe my work, and no more words are needed to describe my work as well. The best tip I can give you is that you should talk to your advisor about this, and present a few candidates. Remember to present candidate topics, because this is your work. You are the only one person in the world who fully understands your work. Your advisor is merely there to guide you. It\u2019s your work. You know best. Use as many words as you need, but no more than that. ",
