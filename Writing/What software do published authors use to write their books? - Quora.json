            "answer_text": "I was a Senior Technical Writer back in the 90s. I've been publishing fiction for a few years now. Actually published my first short horror story in 1990, though. Death of Heaven is my latest book of horror and insanity. I was told in college never to show anyone your first draft, it's foul and should never be seen by the public. This article here is a first draft. Life has changed. I use MS Word 2013 (as I have Office 2013) for most all of my writing. I also use notepad, all the time. Like, if I'm watching TV, or out with my laptop and get an idea, I write it down and save it. I have many folders and files for titles, ideas for stories, novels and screenplays. I save, everything. All ideas I come up with. I get out of bed to write things down. For editing, I just use Word and I've finally started to use someone to do my editing which is a wonderful thing. I do leave on the editing functions when I write my first draft but I completely ignore it. I know some turn it off until later drafts but I find it faster this way and I don't have trouble ignoring it when I want. I can type quite fast so my thoughts and typing keep up together pretty well. As for a thesaurus, I just use the one built into MS Word. I have a very good vocabulary so typically if I need a word I use the one in Word and I either find what I need or it gives me an idea. Otherwise I go to the internet. You may have noticed there's a lot of words out there. I'd looked into various types of software packages for writers some years ago and I found that I do just fine without them, in using Word. I finally caved about thirteen years ago and bought Final Draft for screenplays but that is more of an industry standard and more reason to use it than Word for prose, really. I use Final Draft for writing screenplays, however. As I have a cover artist, I don't know what he uses but check out my book Death of Heaven and you can see the quality he does. Amazing works. And that is nothing. He has very many types of art. The most important thing in writing is the writing. I know authors who use pencil and paper. I'd rather kill myself. But it works for them. I got to be a fast typist from programming and later from being a tech writer. That can be brutal career. There is no concern for the \"artist\" in you. You get told straight out it sucks, or to tear out this marvelous section, or to start over. Or you slave over some document and they hate it. And when they like it they just say, \"Good.\" It's a good learning field for fiction writing. You learn the bumps and grinds, you learn to produce on time and in volume and you finish things. Or you don't get paid. Unlike fiction writing where frequently you finish and don't get paid, ever, or for a very long time. Writing is rewriting and the first step is to get something down. Then read it and make sensible corrections. Then rewrite/edit. And again. And again. Till you think you will kill yourself or throw up. Then edit some more. Get someone to read it. Edit some more. After enough practice you'll know when you're done. When I started out writing fiction I knew I was done editing and rewriting when I knew if I tried to do it again, I'd throw up. Now I just know when it's polished enough. Then have an editor have at it. That is a collaborative effort so find someone that works well with you and understands your genre and your writings (and personality if possible). If you want to write or be a writer, ignore everyone. Write. Then re-write it, many times. Learn writing as you go if need be. Get readers. Listen to them, find ones who give productive criticism. Anyone can write. And anyone, can get better at it. ",

            "answer_text": "My novel A Kill in the Morning was published on 19th June, so I'm a commercially published author.  I wrote A Kill in the Morning using the tools below. I also self-published a short story called Veronika using the same software.   By the way: Most of these tools are either free or cheap, these recommendations are all tools I really use, and I\u2019m getting no kickbacks for recommending them. First draft tools For writing a first draft of your story, a minimal word processor helps you focus on the words themselves without any worrying about formatting, layout and all those squiggly lines that you get in Microsoft Word. They tend to have next to no options or extra features, so you don\u2019t spend your time fiddling and instead get on with writing. My recommendation: iA Writer/ZenWriter Editing Software The writers I know almost all use Microsoft Word (with some using free equivalents like Open Office). Most agents and publishers expect submissions in Microsoft Word (.doc or .docx) format too, so you are going to need something that can at least save in that format. My recommendation: Word 2010 on Windows  Thesaurus One thing that we all sometimes need to do is find the exact right word. Built in thesauruses are OK most of the time, but for a really in depth exploration of the precise word I\u2019m looking for I use Visual Thesaurus. My recommendation: Visual Thesaurus Critique Critique software automatically scans your work for writing that, though grammatically correct, might be poor style.  I use Pro Writing Aid. I find the \u2018repeated words\u2019 and the \u2018vague words\u2019 reports particularly useful. I paid for the pro version because it integrates into Microsoft Word well, but there\u2019s a web based free version too. Critique sites usually work on a reciprocal basis: you review someone else\u2019s work and get credits that mean that other people review your work. I\u2019ve used You Write On for testing/honing the opening chapters of a novel or the whole of a short story and recommend it though with some caveats, see my article on getting feedback on your novel  for tips on how best to use critique software and critique sites to improve your writing. My recommendations: Pro Writing Aid and You Write On. Software for cover art If you are planning on self-publishing your novel then you are going to need cover art. Self-publishing platforms give you the option for a template-generated cover, but your book will look more professional if you do your own. iPiccy and Pixlr are both free and easy to use image editing programs I use them for experimenting with book covers. GIMP is a free alternative to Photoshop. Photoshop itself is great, but it\u2019s simply too expensive for the amount of use I\u2019d get out of it. I use GIMP for creating book covers when iPiccy or Pixlr aren\u2019t powerful enough. My recommendations iPiccy, Pixlr and GIMP. Publishing software \u2013 Kindle If you are self-publishing then once you have your novel completed and edited, you\u2019ll want to get it on to Amazon\u2019s website. The way to do this is using Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). It is possible to submit Word documents direct to KDP, and I know a lot of people use that option, but be aware the formatting is far from ideal if you do.If you want a really professional looking job then you can convert your book to Kindle\u2019s HTML format yourself. I found the easiest solution was to use Komodo Edit for converting the Microsoft Word document into Kindle specific html. Kindle previewer is a Kindle emulator that you can use to check how your book will look on various types of Kindle. What I have found is that if you aren\u2019t careful then your book can look good on one type of Kindle but terrible on another. Kindle Previewer allows you to quickly switch between Kindle versions and see how the book will look on each type. My recommendations: Kindle Direct Publishing, Komodo Edit and Kindle Previewer. Publishing software - physical booksIf you want to produce a physical version of your book, rather than just a Kindle version, then the easiest option is Createspace. You\u2019ll need to upload your book in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format and your cover as an image. My recommendation: Createspace. Research/planning/backups I use Excel spreadsheets for planning and keeping track of progress on the chapters of the book. Evernote is a kind of scrapbook, it\u2019s useful for clipping inspirational photos, notes about characters, scene ideas, scraps of dialogue, etc. Backing up your work is vital. If you have more than one computer, keeping them synchronised can save a lot of trouble. I use Dropbox to do that.If you have an Internet connection then as soon as you save a document Dropbox automatically uploads it. It also keeps backups of old version in case you have a disaster. My recommendations: Excel, Evernote, Dropbox What about specialist novel writing software? There are various all-in-one software packages aimed at authors. Scrivener is popular, but there are several others too. If you\u2019re the kind of writer who likes to write scenes, character bios and fragments of plot on index cards they might be worth looking at.  I\u2019ve tried several of these \u2018author tools\u2019 though and I don\u2019t think they are worth the money over the software in the list above. Also, individual software tools tend to be more flexible and you can try different packages to find the ones that work for you. There are more details and links to all the tools mentioned on my website at: Novel Writing Software: free and cheap tools for writers ",
