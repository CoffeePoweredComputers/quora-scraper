            "answer_text": "Well, There is nothing wrong to start the career with software testing. But let me assume some things.( assuming only because , as you now I was also fresher and have fear of same :-) May not suit to you.). a) being a fresher out from the collage , where you have been taught about how you can develop software or system and mange the system. b) having high enthusiasm for developing as friends also show casing the small things they developed with fun. There are other things and scenarios as well. Let\u2019s consider one scenario that will help to remove some fear to take up software testing. Let\u2019s say, your developing the bigger system , to understand easily, consider quora. :-) You wanted to develop the quora platform , and you started writing the code as developer.( as developer only Thinks about requirement fulfillment with accurate as possible). Now let\u2019s say there is no software testing person or team in this picture, just couple of peoples who had idea and wrote the code and made it live. Now though they are very good coders, There will be some glitches, as when traffic gets high , information get collected, server gets loaded, and site got crashed. Issue comes to team, when they debug the issue they found some glitches in the database memory allotment, even holes in network section from where the hacker can easily take information. This issue comes in picture and media, and the reputation is went down by night. though superb launch, because of glitches it went down also the reputation they build is also gone. NOW in this scenario, take the software testing people in. Now this peoples job is to find bugs as many as possible , and test beyond levels to ensure in real world scenario it would not FAIL. As software testing people have to have some development skills to perform automation or manual, black box or white box testing., with the mind sharp to find needles in haystacks. :-)/ So, It\u2019s nothing wrong in it., And every company needs software testing people because, before sending to real world they want to test. and a developer will not able to test from all angle. So , yes it\u2019s good to start your career from software testing :-). Hope this helps, Thanks ",

Tonight.\u2019 You love explaining, for the 5th time, why doubling the testers will not take half the time to get it done to the same management team that started the project 2 weeks ago.

You can then master the \u2018Of course it\u2019s my fault\u2019 when admonished for not mentioning ever in any meeting why it was not part of the testing scope. Disciplined in carefully explaining why automation testing does not substitute good manual testing\u2026to the same people repeatedly over the course of several months, possibly years. Mastered how to find your happy place when a project manager asks, \u201cYou can do performance testing. Just take a recorded script and play it a thousand times, right?\u201d Look forward to giving your best \u2018I understand\u2019 look when a programme manager says, \u201cWe have concerns with your testing approach\u201d before the project planning even kicks off. You can appreciate the idea that testing has to explain in excruciating details everything they do, but development doesn\u2019t have to say a word. Every. Single. Day. Possibly weekends. Maybe in your sleep. In the dark. In the cold. When everyone else is making money acting silly on reality television. You\u2019ve clearly crossed Reality Television Celebrity off your career list.

            "answer_text": "It is not a good career choice if you think software testing is just an another job. But it is one of the best career when you think you are like a detective! Especially a detective who cares about his victim and get on to find the defects. As a career,QA or QE leads to Test Manager or something like Test Automation Architect over a period of time. But it is one of the niche field if you choose to learn new everyday. For example, I learnt tools such as TestModelerIO and Mutation Testing as of today Similarly you need to be strong in some specialised testing such as web accessibility testing in this competitive world. So you get a high paid job as well as job security! In my case, I learnt accessibility with extra care since it was taught by someone who dont have 79% vision. Yes-you read it right. He dont have 79% human vision. When he taught me how to test websites to match necessary accessibility standards, I found it more of manual testing and manual testing only! Later understood that manual testing remain strong through these type of special testing. Why am I so much (worried and) care about this accessibility testing? See this image:  Please can you pretend to be this man for one hour and access computer? Kindly give a try. You will know how hard their life as a differently abled user on any websites. How about thinking about this talented chap accessing computer?  Even it was told to me that there are people use their nose or tongue to access computers (not joking here):  If you think I am talking about very less number of people here, it is completely wrong. 16.5% world population is disabled in one or the other kind. It is the actual reality. Reference: WHR We use websites for temperature-check to tickets-booking and almost majority of the work has been made online these days but very few websites are accessibility friendly(painful truth). When users with disability don\u2019t have access to mouse and try accessing keyboard (only) to navigate in sites, do you know how hard it is become? I have written detailed examples on how it affects any user when they need accessibility at: Advanced Selenium Web Accessibility Testing: Software Automation Testing Secrets Revealed, Narayanan Palani, eBook - Amazon.com Mainly I have given this course as a UDEMY training to entire world in which 113 country based participants(2K+) are joined free this month to learn web accessibility:  It was become a new sensation in social media soon after releasing the course and it overtook the previous web accessibility course by 2341 enrolments in the first 24 days of release: Web Accessibility Testing - Selenium,BDD,Axe,Pa11y,JAWS,NVDA Now I am trying to reach more people to tell the secret that this type of accessibility testing jobs are highly paid! Example:  90+ jobs found in Monster UK website itself!  When you test for these special users to make their life easy,please tell me-is it not an interesting career like a doctor,scientist and police? ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. There are so many \u2018aye\u2019 answers. And they are not wrong. My answer is also yes. But, let me add some riders. #1. If you are a tester for a public facing software (like Banking, telecom), yes, it is a good choice. But, if the software that you are testing is for internal use of a company, make sure of an evaluation first. #2. If you are a tester for software being developed in a vendor\u2019s place, even for a public facing software, make sure of an evaluation. (This is with the logic that the company putting the software in public use will have more rigorous testing in place and some \u2018leeway\u2019 may be feasible for the vendor tester. Also the Vendor may not have a full appreciation and the responsibility for the ultimate status) #3. Ask the hypothetical question: if the testing team demands that the software should not be released, will the Management listen? (Agreed - you may not be in a hierarchy to find the answer - but you can look at the trend). If the answer is that you are likely to get Management\u2019s instruction to make compromises, make sure of an evaluation (towards your question) first. #4. Review the project plan - are you sure that there is enough time allotted for testing in the Project Plan? If not, make sure of an evaluation first. #5. During appraisal, does a similar increment percentage / quantum applies to #5. If you are in software testing team where the testing / QA is provided more for ISO purposes, you are in trouble. Though life may be easier right now, you will see later on that you have started slipping in the career. Assuming that you find that the above points have been evaluated and you are happy about them, go into testing. But graduate beyond \u2018following instructions\u2019 for testing. Get an overall idea about the system. Apart from the project manager (rather the mentor or the architect) of the project, only two people will have a very good knowledge about the system: documentation person and the testing person. Become an indispensable knowledge repository. Your value will be increased. ",

            "answer_text": "I have over 8 years of experience in Software Testing Implementation, Training etc. While writing this answer it makes me reminisce all I have done. Lets start assuming Software Testing is not a good job.  As a Test Engineer or probably a QA engineer you would: Learn what the 'software' does?Learn what the 'client' needs?Identify the gapRinse and RepeatThis sounds simple isn't it? Yes, it is. We don't do simple things for long enough. Life gets monotonous and boring. But you can see I have stuck to this for 8 long years, indeed it has got something more than being simple.   Everyday, you learn new things and implement in improvising either: The product/service that you testYour technique of testingNow, lets talk about pay scale.  I am a trainer, consultant and practitioner in various test technologies and types. Since the beginning of my experience I have been paid at par with other engineering roles.  Talk about training or consulting, charges are steep here too. Now, lets understand Job Satisfaction: You are responsible for the deliverable qualityYou liaise directly with the client or end userYou work with the developers If you are filled with curiosity and a driving passion to learn I am sure you would be always satisfied. Also, remember that today, the world is customer driven. Until softwares are developed, testing will be done. Now going back wards, software testing is a job that is simple, easy to learn, pays off well, ever growing and is challenging enough to keep you motivated should be considered as a ____ job. (good/bad) Hope you can decide yourself and fill in the blanks above. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Well there are common myths in the market about software testing as a career choice like:- Myth I . Software Testing as a Career pays Less.Developers are more respected as compared to Testers Reality:- Contrary to popular belief, Software Testers (better known as QA professionals) are paid and treated at par with Software Developers in all \"aspiring\" companies. A career in Software Testing should never be considered as \"second rated.\" Myth II. Software Testing is Boring Reality:- Software Testing could actually \"test\" your nerves since you need to make sense of Business Requirements and draft test cases based on your understanding. Software testing is not boring. What is boring is doing the same set of tasks repeatedly. The key is to try new things. For that matter, have you ever spoken to a software developer with more than 3 years' experience? He will tell you how boring his job has become off-lately. There are alternate career tracks for a Software Tester Once you have got yours hand dirty in manual testing, you can pursue following specializations Automation Testing: As an Automation Test Engineer, you will be responsible for automating manual test case execution which otherwise could be time-consuming. Tools used are IBM Rational Robot, Silk performer, Selenium and QTP. Performance Testing: As a performance test engineer, you will be responsible for checking application responsiveness (time is taken to load, maximum load application can handle), etc. Tools used are WEBLoad, Jmeter, Loadrunner. Business Analyst: A major advantages Testers have over Developers is that they have an end to end business knowledge. An obvious career progression for testers is to become a Business Analyst. As a Business Analyst, you will be responsible to analyze and assess your company's business model and workflows, and especially how they integrate with technology. Based on your observation you will suggest and drive process improvements. Your career progression as a software tester (QA Analyst) will look like following but will vary from company to company:- Software tester (QA Analyst)(Fresher) => Sr. QA Analyst => QA Team Coordinator => Test Manager=> Senior Test Manager . You are a QA either by choice or by chance, known for your quality of bug or for quantity of bugs, emphasizing on manual testing or automation testing, you are playing an important role. The ultimate purpose of software testing is not to find bugs only but to make the product qualitative. As a tester, you are contributing in improvements of the product quality. Knowingly or unknowingly, you are trying to make the world better and that is a big responsibility. All the best ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to look at this. The ideal way says that a software developer should not limit themselves to certain strata and do horizontal splitting of responsiblities. (i.e., into back-end devs, front-end devs, testers, Dev-Ops etc), but rather do vertical splits (where each person learns and does a portion of the whole vertical (right from front-end work to Dev-Ops). Of course, each person has a certain strong area where they are good at, but they also get out of their comfort-zone every now and then and do the other parts. The pragmatic way (which is followed by the majority) lets an engineer pick an area where they are good at and work on only that, while communicating with the people in the other areas to stitch the product together. My observation: Although the ideal way is (as it implies) the best solution, the constraints to achieving it are talent, hard work and time. More specifically:1. Even to achieve a certain degree of mastery and comfort in one strata is quite difficult and takes time.2. Each strata is also continuously evolving and the Dev must spend some time and effort on evolving with the latest trends.3. Hence, to maintain a certain level of mastery in more than one strata is difficult indeed. While it is easy for me to learn more than one strata, it is partly because of my intelligence, education, experience working with a certain level of Developers that has given me this ability. There are those who are more capable Engineers than me and those that less so. Identifying my own strengths and weaknesses are therefore more important than fulfilling some idealistic standards set by someone else. In summary: If you feel that testing is something you feel comfortable with and feel happy about it, don\u2019t let others ideals dissuade you. However, do also remember that if at any point you realize you have mastered testing and want a challenge, try mastering the other stratas. ",

It is usually a choice of an adult person, but there is always a question: how does one start? Today we are talking about the benefits of being an engineer in such a peculiar IT field and how to become a QA Tester. QA Testers are in a great demand these days because 500-600 websites are created every minute. The number of software, digital products, games, and web-platforms is insane, and they all need to be thoroughly checked before release. Hence, many young people wonder how to become a video game tester or a product tester, and what the general QA tester requirements are. Software testers have extensive and very flexible career paths that they may change according to their needs. They can become Project Managers if they have a good understanding of the numerous industries. QA Testers sometimes become DevOps because of their working approach. While developers have an in-depth, detailed way of thinking, testing engineers see the product as a whole, integral object. Therefore, they are able to rule the development process on the higher levels. A User Experience designer is also a profession that may be acquired by more creative QAs. They test products not only in terms of bugs and errors but also in terms of appearance. The list of possibilities can be extended even more, yet the main career path that QA may pave \u2014 is a QA engineer. Strategic thinking, business-oriented approach, and solid knowledge of testing tools and techniques are the major factors for building a successful career. Nowadays QAs can prove their skills by passing the test of ISTQB and receiving the according software tester certification. ",

Testing, then, is also not simple and requires expensive, sophisticated tools, proper infrastructure and highly skilled technical team that works hand in hand with the developers who constructed/coded the software. From career perspective, Software Quality Assurance (SQA) as it is sometimes called is likely to be an integral part of any professional software development life cycle (SDLC). However, due to sensitive nature of defects that are found during this testing, (and also due to complex nature of related team discussions), many companies do not want contractors or even offshore subsidiaries. To become a solid SQA professional, it is necessary not just to know the essentials aspects of software dev and delivery, but also to stay current about the emerging trends and tools, which requires a \u201ccontinuous learning\u201d attitude. Software testers also need to be professional and fact-based in their communications while staying aware of the market pressures and customer demands. Good luck, ",

If you are looking to change to your career into software testing field, its better if you evaluate yourself in terms of your interests, passion and capabilities. I have seen people who really does not like coding or feel difficult to write code often looks to pursue their career in software testing field, however later on its become difficult to sustain and grow to upper level positions. Software testing is also a very challenging field where one need to keep himself updated on new areas of testing, tools, technologies, continuously work on their project management and leadership skills. Clients are now demanding for people who can perform every type of testing like Functional, Automation, API,etc One should have ability to understand the new requirements or features, identify the missing features and participate actively and closely with development and product management team to provide his feedback. You should have good logical thinking, communication and interpersonal skills to grow in this field. You should also ready to learn new skills based on changing requirements. So as verdict if you have interest in testing the software, thinking out of box to identify missing requirements and bugs, good communication skills, then I will definitely advise you to move into this field. Skills can be learned and improved over a period of time, but at same time you should have passion and motivation to work in this field. There are many top software testing companies where you can opt to pursue and work in this field. Hope this will make you better understanding before you plan to make career into field. Let me know if any further information is needed. Regards, Anand ",

And if you are thinking about money you could earn, it is all about selling your expertise! Try To be an expert at something you do, and the better you sell it the better you earn!  I could say good or bad is very relative. While something is good for one it might be bad for another. Now the point is to check if it is good for you or not!! To decide this probably you have to assess yourself, assess the job opportunity, and then map both of them. Check if this is what you're looking at! When speaking about software testing, see if you are guy with good perseverance, question skills, able to think out of the box at every context, able to assess some product and could derive your opinions on how you can make it better - then it is a good option for you. You can do wonders I say! All the best! ",

Many times, we feel a sense of disappointment if the first assignment in our first job is a testing project. This is because the curriculum of software engineering does not include the software testing discipline. So we are unprepared to perceive that topics other than development, DB or network have anything to contribute to software production. It is natural to feel slightly cheated. Besides all of this, Career in testing nowadays is getting very popular as more and more new technologies are coming to town. So press the pedal on the accelerator and boost up your speed .

Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation. Test techniques include the process of executing a program or application with the intent of finding software bugs (errors or other defects), and verifying that the software product is fit for use.

But if you have the interest in software development and still wish to choose software testing as your career choice it would be your greatest strength. Software testing is a good career choice but like every other career it is important to update your skill-set other wise you might no longer fit in the scheme of things and become obsolete.  Couple of questions mentioned below will help you better in understanding the specifics: What actually means by Testing in the field of IT Industry?  What is the scope of manual testing in the IT field? Which companies provide the best scope for testers?  ",

Hell, if I would have know 8 years ago, I would have chosen testing over development :( My peers, the under performers who were given testing (the good performers were put to development) have since then  1. Spent anywhere between 6 months to 6 years onsite; we didn't go anywhere for even a week2. Earned lakhs of rupees as salaries and onsite money, built bank balances and purchased houses and properties and cars; we just earned our basic salaries3. Few stayed onsite, changed companies and settled there; some even married there. We just dreamt.  Everyone is still doing good. What else would you want from life! Go for it, but be the best at it :) ",

However, the difference is the attitude and aptitude that you have for a particular job :) Testing will introduce you to a all round development around Communication skills, technical skills (tools, languages), industry processes and domain knowledge. The exposure is vast! However, you need very peculiar qualities (and that too in abundance) - patience and attention to details. I will not make this answer any longer and redirect to a fantastic description of 'what it is like to be a software tester'. Go to the following link and refer to the very well written summary by 'Vikrant Payal': Should I move to testing from software development? Good luck and may you choose the right fit :) ",

Moreover, Software Testing has many dimensions as in different types testing & multiple tools to enhance quality of the product or application.Apart from Functional Testing; Performance & Security Testing are also important aspect which you can aim to excel in. Just as an advice, do not restrict yourself to only Manual efforts as quality in less time & cost effective - is always preferred. Automation is the future if you are into Testing domain. With basic coding knowledge you can write your own scripts and automate the test cases. Core Java, Shell scripting, VB scripting are most commonly used to write automation code among test engineers.Apart from costly automation tool (like, HP QTP..) companies are inclining towards open-source tools (Selenium is most favourite) which are scalable and comes with zero cost. So trive to get the good hands on the automation tools after you get the good exposure & experience in Software Testing. Best Of Luck !! Hope this helps. For any further clarification, you can revert with your query. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Software testing offers you opportunity to fully utilize your critical thinking and creativity to discover or see things that others do not see. It can be interesting, and intellectually challenging. You have to think out of the box- think of things and situations that others have overlooked. If those elusive bugs were easy to find, they probably wouldn't be there. It is less technological focused than software development, but it does not mean inferiority.  To begin with, there are a few experts like Lanette Creamer,Keith Klain,Pradeep Soundararajan,Matt Heusser who are experts in this field and you can read books published by them to get better understanding on this field.  Some of the testing skills you require as a tester would be understaning of the Project life cycle,Testing concepts,Knowledge of testing types,Programming languages familiarity,Database concepts,Test plan idea,Ability to analyze requirements,Documentation skill and familiarity with the Testing tools. You will most likely have parts of your job you could do without but finding something you have a passion for makes all the difference in the world. If you don't have a passion for software testing, you are likely better off finding something you are passionate about and pursuing a career in that field. ",

Some people work in a store as clerk all their life; if it pay the bills and they are happy with that; then that is a good career choice. Some people have deep problems in accepting what is their place in society; and the only thing they see is to become a CEO. Nothing wrong with that, you need to dream big to go forward, but that makes you live your life always unsatisfied, because you (often incorrectly) think that you are wasting time in a career path. Any job is a good career choice, as long as it pays the bills, allow you go do most of what you want, and make you feel happy. If you can\u2019t achieve this; then the problem is not the career choice but you. ",

If your question is like, I am choosing software testing as my career option what should I learn? Then answer to this is as below. Learn coding, scripting, have good documentation skills, learn selenium and other front end and middle tier technologies, do a small project each time while you learn, after a year or so you are in good position to do lot more then software testing.

However, at times the area of testing is given low importance than development, but basically that depends on the organisational management of the place where you are working at. Usually testers tend to eventually make their way up to Managerial roles in a few years e.g. QA Managers etc. So as i started it depends on the individual whether the roles and responsibilities of a QAE are something they are interested in or not.

So, it is very important that the developer keeps his users safe from such hacker and also from bugs. Software testers are in demand, the capability of the software has to be tested before making it available for billions of people. It is must that the users should not face any difficulties or see any errors while using that software and to come over that the beta/alpha or pre-release variants of the software have to be tested by a software tester/ pen tester.

            "answer_text": "IMHO. A career in software testing is definitely a good choice. But, it comes with its own caveats, and they are: (1) Be completely proficient in at least one programming language- C, C++ (2) Learn scripting in Python. (3) Learn the fundamentals of OS and how automation tools work. Learn at least one open-source and one licensed tool. (4) Data Driven Testing; Setting up Test Data. If you are intent on pursuing a career in load testing learn a good and robust load testing tool. You need to be very proficient in understanding Data Structures in Computer Science, manual testing and automation testing. The load associated with manual testing is generally reduced viz an automation test tool, and testing can indeed be an interesting and lucrative career choice provided one knows the ropes. A good functional tester, if he wishes to, can later graduate to becoming a good business analyst or manager. ",

For an average human being, each of his day starts with a software or an app. So the future opportunities for a software tester is unquestionable. There is a very common notion that software testing jobs are less paid than the others. Thing is, most of the leading companies are paying software testers as much as software developers. This career is good for career growth.
