            "answer_text": "The way I figure it, you need three things to make a biography compelling: (1) the reader must be interested enough; (2) the subject matter must be interesting enough; and finally (3) the writing must be interesting enough.Since both (1) and (2) are a given, I\u2019ll focus on (3). Biographies are tricky. You have to create a cohesive and engrossing narrative out of the many, many small events that makes up a person\u2019s life. It has to be somehow more than just recounting such tedious facts. So \u2026 how to do that? It should begin with the questions that the biography asks (and answers). Let me present you with three biographies that I found fascinating (and I\u2019m a finicky biography reader). they took very different approaches and answer different questions about there subjects Who is the Person?: The Literary Approach When I picked up Reluctant Genius: The Passionate Life and Inventive Mind of Alexander Graham Bell by Charlotte Gray, I was surprised to find that it read like a novel. Gray writes much like an omniscient narrator in a novel, creating a vivid and complete portrait of a man who changed the face of telecommunications and deaf education. She goes into great detail into Bell\u2019s temperamental (but still sweet) nature and his intense relationship with his wife. An excerpt describing Bell\u2019s frustrated efforts at courting his wife-to-be, who belonged to the upper crust of Boston society: In an effort to dampen Alec\u2019s hopes, Mrs. Hubbard summoned him to Cambridge and read him passages from Mabel\u2019s letter. Although Gertrude meant well, it was a cruel thing to do, and it sent Alec into a fury of despair. \u201cDon\u2019t know what is best to do\u2014quite distressed about it\u2014as such dislikes have a tendency to be permanent,\u201d he noted in his diary. His head ached, and he tossed and turned through the sultry August nights. This is a very successful example of an biographer answering the basic question of Who is Alexander Graham Bell? What did he do? Gray answers these questions in a descriptive and engaging way (which was only made possible by the author\u2019s skill and good use of first-person sources). This approach works quite well here because Bell is a very interesting man in his own right. Gray could afford to skimp a bit on historical context here, as Bell\u2019s persona is enough for a book. Why Did They Become so Influential?: The Contextual Approach Some biographies are more about the times than just the person. Jeff Guinn\u2019s 2017 Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple was one such book. Guinn spends most of his time describing the historical context that influenced Jim Jones\u2019s rise to prominence as a firebrand activist campaigning for racial and social equality and his transformation into a mentally unstable cult leader that orchestrated one of the biggest mass suicide in history. An excerpt describing why some wealthy white Bay Area residents flocked to Jim Jones\u2019s church to assuage their guilt and anger over the persistent racial and social strife of the 1970s: For the first time, Jones regularly attracted professionals whose salaries were, by previous Temple standards, astronomic\u2014college professors, successful attorneys, business owners or managers as well as line workers and minimum wage employees. The turbulent times had much to do with it\u2014at every social and economic level, Americans were discontented with escalating racial strife and the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War. Jones challenged visitors to stop talking about problems and actually do something to make America better\u2014Peoples Temple was the way. And when eager, relatively well-heeled applicants arrived in Redwood Valley, they were offered the opportunity to immerse themselves in the effort, often by producing the pink slips for their very nice cars, or the diamond necklace and earrings bequeathed by a beloved grandmother. The Road to Jonestown asks the question that\u2019s a bit more than Gray\u2019s basic biographical question: Why was Jim Jones so successful as a social activist? Why did so many people follow him? What went wrong and got everyone to drink the Flavor-AId? Guin answers these questions with copious historical and cultural analyses. i doubt the basic biography approach that worked in Reluctant Genius would\u2019ve worked here. Jim Jones himself is actually much less interesting than what he created: a church that championed (and to some degree, achieved) racial integration in such turbulent times before becoming a radical socialist cult. It is the Peoples Temple itself that is at the heart of the biography. What Happened Next? The Legacy Approach The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is an unusual biography. The titular Henrietta is dead for most of the biography (perhaps I should call it biography-cum-historical nonfiction). Instead of focusing on Henrietta\u2019s short life, Skloot tells us more about how Henrietta\u2019s death affected science as her HeLa strain became the foundation of many scientific innovations \u2026 and her family. She also manages to incorporate her own story of finding Henrietta\u2019s family and her growing personal relationship with them, revealing how her children grew more impoverished and troubled after Henrietta\u2019s death. An excerpt where Henrietta\u2019s daughter muses about her long-dead mother and what she would\u2019ve thought about her legacy: I\u2019ve tried to imagine how she\u2019d feel knowing that her cells went up in the first space missions to see what would happen to human cells in zero gravity, or that they helped with some of the most important advances in medicine: the polio vaccine, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization. I\u2019m pretty sure that she\u2014like most of us\u2014would be shocked to hear that there are trillions more of her cells growing in laboratories now than there ever were in her body. Skloot answers a question rarely answered in biographies: What happened after they die? What happened to their family? This is a rather provocative question, as Henrietta\u2019s only claim to fame is her cell line called HeLa. But Skloot\u2019s focus on her family brings forth a fresh story about how a tragic death of a mother enriched science but left a family impoverished and motherless. A compelling biography can\u2019t just be written well. It has to answer the right questions. Some, such as Reluctant genius can get away with answering the basic question of \u201cWho was the person? What did they do?\u201d Others must do more. It is often the latter that make the most fascinating biographies. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking. My answer might not be as intellectual as the ones shared so far. What makes a biography compelling to read? I became infatuated with Ernest Hemingway. Why? He and I share the same birthday. Yep\u2026 that is it. For some unknown reason, he resonated with me. At school we had to read one of his books: For Whom The Bells Tolls. I then read as much as I could about what he wrote and about his life. Articles in the newspapers, etc. I even went to Cuba to visit his house and his boat and I also visited the hotel, Ambos Mundos, room 511 when he was inspired and lived sort of like a hermit in the room where he sequestered himself to write some of his famous works. The youtube video below gives you a tour of his hotel room. With the help of the family, the room was converted to a \u2018museum\u2019 where his typewriter and some of his belongings are there for people to visit. The tour of the room starts at around 1.05 minutes or so.  The video below shows the visit to his home named Finca Vigia, meaning \"lookout house\". Finca Vigia is located in the small, working-class town of San Francisco de Paula, Cuba. We could not go into the house but we could look through the windows and look at all of his home where time stood still it seems.  Oh the memories\u2026 Also, we had a tour of his watering holes. THAT was such a hoot. To be able to sit at the same place in this beautiful little pub overlooking the sea where he would have chats with men coming back for their day of fishing. He would listen as they shared his story and he was then inspired to write the book: Old Man And The Sea. So\u2026. when I resonate with a writer, I do get a little obsessed. I also have others where I did pretty much the same thing. Ann Rice is an other writer I obsessed about. I read every one of her books. From the Mayfair Witches to the vampire series to the trillogy she wrote under a pen name, A. N. Roquelor. That trilogy is all about BDSM and it is amazing and so much better than the shades of \u2018boring\u2019 grey. lol I travelled to New Orleans to actually be on the streets she described with such eloquence in her series with the Mayfair Witches. I fell in love with New Orleans through her writing and once I got there, I could so relate and it was an amazing experience. Why did I obsess about her? She and I share the same first name\u2026 Yea\u2026 I know\u2026 There is not a whole lot of sophistication in my choices. There are others and I do not wish to bore anyone so I\u2019ll leave it at that. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say the most important factor for a biography to be compelling is the person it\u2019s written about to have lived as interesting a life as possible. As humans we are drawn to the struggle yet we long for triumph in the face of difficult situations. The more difficult the situation is, the bigger the triumph. This is why fictional stories are so entertaining. A compelling biography will read almost like a work of fiction, with the main character seeming almost larger than life while facing challenging situations and triumphing over them. These challenges and triumphs help shape this real person into the type of person who is worth writing a biography about. An interesting life, sprinkled with achievements from a real person who seems larger than life is what really makes a compelling biography. ",
