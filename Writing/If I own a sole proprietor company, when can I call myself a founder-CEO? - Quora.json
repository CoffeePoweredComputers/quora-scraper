            "answer_text": "I think you don\u2019t know well about the difference between Sole Proprietorship and a company. First, go and study about it in details. The sole proprietorship is not a legal entity. The business particularly relies on an individual who owns the business and is personally responsible for its debts. For example, suppose you opened a hair cutting salon, named it by your name or something else. Starting operation cost will be very low because to start you only need a comb, a mirror, scissors as the primary equipment. You can run it by yourself. You can start it by taking any local licences from the govt. CEO is the head of operations in a company, which is registered under the corporate affairs of a country. In India the certification will be governed by the ministry of company affairs (MCA), which is not like a cup of tea, you easily get it. In a company at least two shareholders are needed with a minimum budget of 100000. The word CEO sounds good in the corporate world, not in a garage or small shop. So stop thinking about bullshits like this. It is not well suited with your personality. Focus on your current small business and try to make it so big that one day you will establish a registered company and people will call you as CEO of your company. ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, you are not a corporation, so how could you use corporate related titles, you would first have to incorporate your business, then you can call yourself CEO or anything you want. Titles mean nothing to most, and if you are sole proprietor and your business is growing and profitable, that is all that matters. If you are the only employee in your business, then ask yourself, if you did incorporate and remained the single business owner, or CEO, and you are doing the work, selling, servicing, whatever, people will question the title, CEO\u2019s manage businesses, not the grunt work, so forget titles, the don\u2019t mean anything to most people you are doing business with.
