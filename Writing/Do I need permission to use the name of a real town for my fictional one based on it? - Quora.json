As long as you steer clear of using the real names of people that lived there in that time, (worth to try and check out the names of your characters, with any historical docs that might still exist), then you will be fine. However, if there were people of the same name, in that time, then it might be possible for their descendents to not like what you have written about \u2018their ancestors\u2019, (even you might think to have made them up), and try and attack you for it.

You can trademark a logo featuring them, but what is trademarked is the logo (art form) and not the actual location. ",
