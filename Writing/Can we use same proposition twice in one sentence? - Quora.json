            "answer_text": "for prepositions, it's best to use the most appropriate preposition available, and using the same preposition twice \u2013 even in a short sentence \u2013 would not be considered bad practice. In fact, if used properly, a little bit of repetition can create a parallel structure that is easy to follow and almost poetic to read: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. ",
