To me it doesn\u2019t matter what color of pen I used, because that is not how I remember notes, Watch this, lets say I want to recall the name of all the Oceans. Now instead of trying to remember what I had written in my notes, automatically various images will flood my mind, Because WHILE writing or reading those notes, this is what I did: I broke all the data into images. Firstly there are 5 ocean if you can remember it, then fine, else imagine your hand with all five fingers stretched and tiny version of oceans (or water drops on each finger) now you\u2019ll remember that there are five ocean, now to remember the names I\u2019ll imagine the globe.I\u2019ll imagine Titanic going from England to America and sinking into the ATLANTIC , I\u2019ll then go to east and see India and curry and remember INDIAN ocean and so on\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Colour of the pen will not help you to remember something BUT it surely can help you to break the information into smaller sections, which then makes it easier to look for during revision. For example, Whenever I used to read the Indian History, I used to highlight the Acts in yellow ; Important statement by a leader in green; Any cool word play in blue. So, when I used to re-visit that chapter, those Acts or Statements would be easily visible and I could recall the things associated with it. Also, don\u2019t start using too many colours as attention would shift from studying to using them. Revision is what would help you remember, a quick revision is what these colours would help in. ",
