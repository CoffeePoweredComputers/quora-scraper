Like maybe my brain has decided it will never write again. Like maybe I\u2019m a failure now. All I\u2019ve wanted to do for the past 30 years is write every day and now it\u2019s finished. I can\u2019t even feed my kids until I write. I\u2019ve written every day for the past 20 years. I\u2019ve written 22 books and thousands of articles. I\u2019m always afraid the flow is going to stop. And often it does. But that\u2019s when a person has to be a pro. The ideas have to flow again: [See Also, 33 Unusual Ways for being a Better Writer] A) COFFEE\u2026 I\u2019m just being honest. Who knows if coffee is good for you or bad for you. But I start writing on my third cup of coffee for the day. I don\u2019t know why it works. But it starts my head spinning. B) READING\u2026 I always read before I write. I tend to read \u201cdirty realism\u201d. Short stories or autobiographical essays that are mostly true and written my quality writers. For each person this might be a different set of writers. I like Raymond Carver, Miranda July, Denis Johnson, Cheryl Strayed, Bukowski, James Frey, etc. When I read them it\u2019s like I click into their thought process and often get my own \u201cdirty realist\u201d story about my life to write about. Or, I might get keyed into the writer\u2019s voice and, thinking in that voice, I might get ideas to write about. I often can\u2019t start without reading first. But reading has given me 100s and 100s of ideas of things to write AND ways to write. As an example, the other day I was reading Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s short story, \u201cWhat We Carried\u201d about the physical items he and his fellow soldiers carried into the jungles of Vietnam and how they also carried emotional and mental baggage. This made me think about starting a business. All the emotional baggage that goes into it. Fear of failure or shame of failing. Worries about my family. Fear of clients. Fear of money. So I wrote about what I carry during my day. Did I copy him? Yes. But premises are fair game. C) SAME TIME EVERY DAY. If I wake up at 4:30. Done reading and coffee by 6, I\u2019m sitting in front of the computer trying to write. Your brain is your slave, not your master. I don\u2019t always believe that you have to do the same time every day. Sometimes I miss that time. But it helps. D) START IN THE MIDDLE. This is the #1 technique to start something. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m writing about marriage. Should I start with the first time I met my first wife? Should I start with my first date ever? Should I start with the first time I considered getting married? I don\u2019t know. Too many choices. So I started in the middle: \u201cAnd then I got a divorce.\u201d The reader is put off guard. It\u2019s a risk that the writer takes (risks, well done, will drive the reader forward). It\u2019s almost as if the reader is being invited into the story mid-conversation. The reader is eavesdropping on a very gossipy story. What will happen next? Why did he get a divorce? From there, the next few lines and paragraphs are usually straightforward. Basically, I\u2019m digging myself out of the hole I created for myself on that first sentence. E) START WITH THE BLOOD. If it doesn\u2019t bleed, it doesn\u2019t lead. I was writing about my first ever customer as an entrepreneur the other day. My first sentence was: \u201cIf you repeat this conversation, I will kill you,\u201d Shlomo told me. If I am doing my job as a writer, that sentence should lead the reader to wonder: what is the conversation? Is this person serious? The next few sentences, maybe even the entire story, will flow from that first line. Another time I was writing about seeing a therapist when I was having nonstop anxiety attacks about money. First sentence: \u201cThe only thing that will help me is if you write me a check for $1,000,000 right now,\u201d I said to the psychiatrist on my first appointment with him. F) DON\u2019T EVER TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU\u2019RE GOING TO WRITE... When a piece of writing is still inside of you its like a baby that\u2019s growing. The baby is feeding off of your vitality, your brain, your emotional strength, and over time it grows. If you talk about it, then you\u2019ve given birth. The energy of the words spills out into the air, leaving no imprint, disappearing. Don\u2019t give birth prematurely. Give birth on the written page first. Then you can talk about her as she matures. G) INSPIRATION. Sometimes I get hard-core writer\u2019s block. I did my reading , my coffee, my analysis of my big past failures, etc and I can\u2019t figure out something to write today. I do several things then to look for inspiration: I look around my room: This inspired \u201cThe Tooth\u201d, and also \u201cThe Ugliest Painting in the World\u201d, and also \u201cIs Burton Silverman Dead Yet\u201d.I go to some websites that always have intriguing photos that might inspire me:Boing Boing, Brain Pickings., The Browser, http://extragoodshit.phlat.net (explicit), etc. For instance, \u201c7 Things I Learned from Louis Armstrong\u201d came from the first item on the list above. 3. My own material. I look back to stories I\u2019ve written and see if there\u2019s a way I can slice it up further. For instance, I\u2019ve written about starting a company in the 90s called Reset. But I never wrote about selling it so here I wrote about that. 4. The most embarrassing things. I had hard-core writer\u2019s block one weekend. So I picked the most embarrassing stuff you can possibly write about and just spewed it out in a post called, appropriately, \u201cWriter\u2019s Block\u201d. H) MAKE YOURSELF THE BAD GUY\u2026 If I\u2019m writing about the time I was incredibly in love with someone I can write \u201cI broke up with her with a text message to her phone.\u201d Or you are writing about how to make money you can start with, \u201cThe worst thing I ever did was steal money from my parents.\u201d Nobody wants to read a story from the movie star about how great he is. People have flaws. Be honest. Be transparent. If readers can\u2019t handle it then they shouldn\u2019t be reading. I) HONESTY CHECK\u2026 Make sure you\u2019re not trying to protect yourself. Protecting others is important. Do No Harm. But if you\u2019re going to tell a story, a blog post doesn\u2019t have to make you the hero. For instance one of my more popular early posts was \u201cHow I Screwed Yasser Arafat Out of $2 million.\u201d Right off I said I needed $100 million. Nobody needs $100 million. Then I described what I would do with $100 million, everything I did to try and get that hundred million, and ultimately what Yasser Arafat had to do with it. The story told itself. But I was arrogant, foolish, a bad guy, and at least at that time, had no idea what I was doing. If I tried to protect myself in the writing then there would\u2019ve been no story. So always do an honesty check. Are you saying something because it\u2019s true or because you are trying to protect yourself. J) SOLVE A PROBLEM\u2026 If I have a problem like, \u201cI\u2019m angry\u201d then I have at least two delicious courses that will make a full meal. 1) what am I angry about. 2) why am I angry 2) how I deal with the anger. and maybe for dessert 4) why am I angry about this right now? Two of my daughters are applying to college this year. It made me think of all the problems I had in college. It made me think of all the problems I see from people I know who cant\u2019 get jobs (despite a college degree) and are struggling with student loan debt. It made me think of the huge salaries college Presidents are getting. It made me think how in the classroom, you only learn classroom skills. You only learn real world skills in the real world. And then I got a letter from the college another daughter is attending which made me angry. They were asking me for $16.92 because of a broken microwave in my daughter\u2019s dormitory and everyone was sharing equally. Which reminded me of the day before when that same college called and asked for a donation. And it doesn\u2019t have to be pure anger. The other day I was watching a video where a bunch of investors were talking about the \u201c5 best investors in history\u201d. But they were getting facts, history, biographies all wrong. I felt if they were calling themselves experts, they should no more. So I wrote my own version. \u2014\u2014 The above ten techniques have basically produced every article I\u2019ve ever done. I probably have writer\u2019s block every day. And it honestly makes me feel sick. My kids know not to get near me when I have writer\u2019s block. Fortunately, today, I just wrote.  Addendum: my go-to writers that I often read before writing. Note: this list could be different for everyone. And the list is not strict. I read many other writers besides these but these seem to be consistently the ones that get me out of writer\u2019s block: Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson, James Frey, Miranda July, Cheryl Strayed, Charles Bukowski, Jerzy Kosinski, Ariel Levy, Tim O\u2019Brien, Hunter S. Thompson. ",

Writer\u2019s Block Solutions Before I introduce you to my magical spell, I\u2019ll first give you a little glimpse of what a writer block is, in case you don\u2019t know what it is!

And it\u2019s writing every day. What stuck with me during that phase, was that a lot of other blogs said this as well. As a solution to writer block, a lot of blogs/people I know advised me to keep writing. And so I did.

For those of you who are not familiar with freewriting, then it\u2019s simply writing without minding any punctuation or grammar. It\u2019s writing at your ease, letting your hands do their work without overthinking it. Go ahead and get your hand to work, allow yourself to be FREE with freewriting. See what I did? Pun intended.

It might seem utopian but it actually works. Now a lot of you will be asking, how the f can practising a hobby can cure my writer block? Well, allow me to explain.
