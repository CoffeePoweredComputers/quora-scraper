It can contain millions of \u201cletters\u201d. It is a work in progress. Really, you could remove this letter: \ud83d\udca9 \u2014 we got along just fine without it. ",

Its pronunciation does not vary and can be replaced orthographically with K or KW. Words containing Q have no homophones that would create confusion if the word containing Q were spelled with K, creating a convergent spelling. Even if there were, you could likely find some combination of C, CW or CU that would differentiate the spelling. Would some words look funny? No kwestion about that. Thanks for the A2A. ",
