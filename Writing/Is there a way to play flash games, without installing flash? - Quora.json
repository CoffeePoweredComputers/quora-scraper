You need some form of Flash player plugin which can run the SWF content.If you mean that you don\u2019t have to install Flash player manually, then use Chrome \u2014 it ships with Flash player installed. You\u2019ll be asked when playing the game whether you want to enable Flash or not. Simply press Allow.If you mean without installing the program Adobe Flash (or Adobe Animate, as it\u2019s called now), then simply download a SWF Player that can run Flash files, like this program: SWF File Player",

You just have to play it on a flash browser, such as Puffin, which has flash built in. Because of this, you can install an Android emulator on you PC and use the games there if you prefer to play them on PC. ",
