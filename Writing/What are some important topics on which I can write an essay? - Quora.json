            "answer_text": "\u201cImportant topics\u201d can be interpenetrated in a few ways: Topics which are very relevant today on a national or even global scale, topics which are about history which its lessons can be taught even today, topics which are about the small things of the average citizenry\u2019s simple life (it\u2019s important because many can identify), and topics with a very firm message in which calls for preservation or reform. Perhaps there are many more in which can be described as such, as long as one has a logical interpretation to the this adjective. Allow me to present a few examples: National/Global Issues: a death of a public individual, a terrorist attack, a horrendous crime, a frightening situation of a certain part of the population (a good example for that can be about the dozens of millions of homeless immigrants and refugees around the world). Something in which you believe that should be change for the better good. Your own opinion about a certain politician or party regarding their public and state decisions.A Certain National/Religious Holiday/Dates Which Contain History: If there is somewhere in the world a certain holiday which is practiced today, few days ago or in the close future, you can write about its history, what it symbolizes, and what lessons and insight we could all learn from those celebrations (or memorial days, if they are not days which were meant for happiness, but for mourn and remembrance). Perhaps an independence day of a certain country, or a birth/death of a historical figure, a certain battle or war which was declared/settled in a certain yet close date.A Certain or Few Anecdotes From The Daily Lives Of Your Community/Population: Some say there is no such thing in life but the daily life of each person. Think of something which everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity, religion etc, can relate to. This is important because it symbolizes universality of the community or nation\u2019s population, if not the entire world. Usage of technology can be a good example, since it is a very relevant issue due to its importance and the various roles it has for everyone in the civilized regions of the globe.Problems/Status Quo That Needs to be Solved: Think of a problem that is left un-dealt with, and think why. This can be a category were one needs not only to state their opinion, but to elaborate in order to convince the public or the authorities to try and solve a certain issue which requires an immediate solution before it\u2019s too late. It can be even technical problems which may embody the potential of terrible, if not dangerous, results. This category requires proof or at least set of logical examples in order to bring your point across.And, my favorite, Philosophical Insight/s: Even though it is a hard-to-read material, philosophy is always relevant to everything anytime. This is because philosophy presents universal questions, issues which are relevant to any civilization and every individual. Even if you may not reach a certain and clear solution, presenting a philosophical issue, subject or question can do enough fine to get people to contemplate and to develop their deep-thinking skills.Apart from the subject, you should remember that you may have a certain amount of words or pages to reach, if this is a formal assignment. It is wise to aspire and reach the the best you can to the limit you were asked for, for the optimum grade and evaluation. Don\u2019t exceed beyond it because it may harm your grade. When I am given an assignment in university and I need to reach, for instance, 200 words and I\u2019m writing on the computer, I always try to reach exactly to 200 words even if it\u2019ll require making a few changes. That way the amount of words in an answer won\u2019t be a problem. This is a very precise and steady work, but I recommend it to everyone who is serious with their studies. ",
