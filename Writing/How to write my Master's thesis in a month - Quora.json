            "answer_text": "The first thing you need to know is that many others have been in your position, and succeeded. A couple of years ago, while working on my PhD , I was awarded a research contract from the Government of Canada to do an analysis that was closely related to my PhD. It was first contract, and right from the start I worried about writing a 125-page report. I had four months to do the research, I also has a colleague who took on 25% of the project. I finished all of my research, and sat in front of the computer for a few weeks panicking. Finally, I got worried, and wrote the entire report, minus the one contribution, in 4 weeks. That is twice what you have to do.Here is what I recommend. Ask yourself how it will feel to not earn your master's after three years. Not good. Fast forward to November 1st, either you finish or you just blew three years and a degree. I assume you did your research, and have a good idea of what you want to do. You need to write a skeleton outline of your thesis. Do chapters 2-5, chapter 2 = methodology, lit review; chapter three = analysis; chapter 4 = discuss analysis, what did you learn? Match this to your thesis statement that you will write soon. Write the introduction and conclusion last.This may sound simple, but you need to be organized and a skeleton does that for you. You should set a goal of writing 3-5 pages daily, as you need to be productive.Good luck, and remember that most of your profs have done this at least once in their careers. ",

The biggest problem will be finding a professor who supports your hurried thesis.Oh, and the self-motivation: Make a plan and stick to it. Use pomodoro-technique. Make yourself free from distractions when you work (websurfing, smartphone). It works for me. ",

Don't copy any one style, absorb a range of approaches, see what works for you. Talk to other students doing a Masters. Write a lot. And then some. Writing is like thinking, not as hard as people think once you have something to edit, but the editing task is vital. Edit carefully with many drafts. Always polish your words (using an online or built-in dictionary and thesaurus) so they mean exactly what you want them to say. Get your stuff read by a neutral person before you submit it. Pace yourself. Use speech-to-text to speed up the process. A voice recorder for brain blitzing a pile of unedited ideas can be good way to release your ideas. Blank paper is forbidding. Once you have generated some relevant words to push around, it gets easier. Be prepared to chop out anything irrelevant - but put that stuff, if it's good writing, somewhere safe, as it may be useful later. Using an outliner for structure and self-chat can help.  ",

Three years is a long time to complete a master's degree, so I suspect that you really lost interest some time ago. If not completing the degree will not hurt you professionally, then honestly, I would let it go. If, however, you need it, then bite the bullet, block the time, and sit down and start writing. Sixty pages is a difficult target for one month\u2019s writing (assuming you've done the research and you have organized your notes), but it can be done. But you are just about out of time so you have no margin for era. If you have not started the research yet, I'm afraid you have an impossible task. But again, if that's the case, you've answered your own question. ",

When I wrote my theses, I was also concerned about the time and effort I would put in. I ran experiments, streamlined the process and documented the whole thing. I came to the conclusion that you CAN write a thesis in about 48 hours if you follow a precise methodology. My book \u201cThe 48h Thesis\u201d can help you.

Knowing what the thesis should say helps in avoiding writing stuff that is irrelevant, and wastes time. If you have already papers from your research (even if co-authored) refer to them and attach them as appendices. (my own PhD thesis was only 80 pages, but had 3 1000-page appendices, because two of the tasks involved multiple people, and one was meant to become a text-book.) ",

I can also say that after doing two masters theses and a PhD, each took at least 12 months to write up. Also, this is a consultative process with your supervisor(s).There is no point in possibly risking years of hard work. You need the best quality you can deliver and this is not a cursory, overnight exercise. ",
