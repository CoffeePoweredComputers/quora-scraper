            "answer_text": "It is hard to define what is and what is not, transmedia. Some argue that it is actually, just the end of a spectrum of how well a single story is able to be comprehended across media.  At one end of the spectrum is strict adaptation; translating one medium into another: a book that becomes a film, a comic that becomes a video game. At the other end of the spectrum would be pure transmedia: the book ends at the exact moment that the film begins, a comic showing the origin of a hero featured in a video game.  This is not a new idea. The most popular example would probably be the Bible. During the Middle Ages, when most people were illiterate, stories were told in multiple ways: verbally, acted out in \"live theatre,\" and told through stain glass windows. The most quoted examples of popular transmedia project include: Star Wars (arguably the most extensive world built across platforms)Star TrekThe MatrixThe Blair Witch Project (their online marketing campaign marks the first use of web storytelling)AvatarLostMuch of the Disney \"formula\" for youth products: this tends to be straddle the nonexistent line between adaptation and TM storytelling but their franchise approach floods the market with multimedia examples.Many comics that have been adapted to video games, feature films, animated shorts, etc.: Superman, Spiderman, etc. (origin stories, sequels, spinoffs, etc.)Current transmedia development runs against the major studio model: projects are pitched to one person in one division of the studio: the film dev guy, the interactive dev girl, the television dev SVP, etc. Because of this, the bigger projects tend to come from either well established franchises, very established creatives, or be independently produced by small houses.  In a bit of shameless self-promotion, I'd also like to point out the promotional project for Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan's The Strain Trilogy. For the release of the third and final installment, \"The Night Eternal,\" my studio created departmentofhumanmanagement.org, which is a fictional organization that lives within the environment of the (fiction) book. This avoided spoilers, introduced people to the world, and hinted at the developments of the third book.  In 2013, our studio also released, MirrorWorld by Cornelia Funke for iOS (iPad only) and Kindle. This app expands on the narrative between the first and second books in Cornelia's series and visualizes the world for the first time. 15 short stories expand on the characters and texture of the world and explain backstory as well as foreshadowing.   Marketing projects definitely can fall into the TM realm. Since storytelling is simply an information product, marketing of any story is simple telling people information about information. The best marketers are learning how to tell stories to audiences so that they learn to love the product before ever experiencing it. If you can coordinate this across platforms, that message will simply become clearer. ",
