            "answer_text": "The History of Native Americans is both fascinating and in many ways, tragic. Estimates range from about 10 \u2013 90 million Native Americans inhabited America at the time of the European arrivals. They had lived in the land many, many years before white man set foot on their soil. It is believed that during the ice age, they had traveled a land-bridge across the Bering Sound, from Siberia into what is now Alaska. They had gradually migrated across the land and southward into Mexico and beyond. The name \u201cIndian\u201d was given them by Christopher Columbus who mistakenly believed he had landed in the Indies. They have been labeled Indians, American Indians, and the now preferred Native Americans. They migrated to all regions of the land and were formed into many different tribes or nations. These were a people who adapted well to their particular regions and made wise use of all natural resources available. They believed in respecting the land and the abundance of gifts it offered. They became proficient fishermen, hunters, farmed crops such as corn, and built homes with whatever available resources their territory provided. Some of these included animal skins, sun-dried brick for adobes, or lumber for long houses depending on the regions.The Native Americans of the east coast met the new 16th and 17th century visitors from Europe with enthusiasm. They regarded these bearded white men as strange but were delighted with the steel knives, mirrors, copper kettles, and other intriguing novelties. The indigenous tribes were more than accommodating and hospitable. Without their aid, the first waves of settlers would not have survived in the land they knew little about. But in time the Europeans disregarded all respect for the valued land and resources and instead displayed insatiable greed and arrogance. The Europeans soon pursued their intent to conquer this new continent with brutal attacks and invasion. The Native Americans soon realized that the invaders would arrive in overwhelming numbers, as many \u201cas the stars in heaven.\u201d Initially, the people of this land tried to co-exist with the Europeans. But many more problems arose. With all their intriguing gadgets, the white men brought deadly diseases to the Native Americans. The colonists and explorers brought measles, smallpox, cholera, yellow fever, and many more devastating diseases. This drastically diminished the Native American population and annihilated entire villages. In addition to this, the arrogant attitude of the ever-growing whites led to the Indian Wars, the Indian Removal Act (1830), and in 1890 one of the worst massacres ever -- Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Here warriors, women, and children alike were ferociously slaughtered by the U.S. Cavalry. The U.S, government began Relocation Programs and the now famous Trail of Tears march where hundreds of Cherokee died from starvation, exposure, and illnesses. The Native American peoples were not only reduced in number but taken from their homes, stripped of their customs, and even forbidden to speak their native languages. Their children were taken from them and sent to schools to \u201ccivilize\u201d them, forced to abandon every aspect of their heritage. In January 1876, the U.S. government forced them to live on \u2018reservations\u2019 where the majority of Native Americans still reside today. And, yes ,, they were definitely civilised in their own way . We shouldn't compare their civilization with ours with the help of OUR LOGIC AND YARDSTICK. ",

            "answer_text": "What do you mean civilised? Native Americans derogatorily called Red Indians had a highly developed civilisation - each tribe its own. They lived in harmony with nature and were / are the original owners of all the land in North America. Eoropesn settlers used inhuman methods including deliberate spread of infectious diseases for which the Indians ( not us! After Columbus, who incidentally did not know which side he was travelling to reach India and called the natives of the Caribbean as Indians!) had no immunity and died in their hundreds of thousands. The Spanish in central and South America were even more brutal. They conquered the natives by using the gun ( euphemistically named Colt Peacemaker). That is how gun culture is integral to American life. The phrase cowboys (often illiterate, unwashed roughnecks) but American heroes and Indians, the bad guys. The native Americans were highly civilised till the arrival of the unwashed hordes from Europe. ",
