            "answer_text": "Writing, like any other developmental skill, emerges when a child's physical, neurological, and cognitive mechanisms have become adequately established. Directed by brain growth, the body matures from the central core to the distal points of the feet and hands. (That's why there's a chronological sequence of rolling, to sitting, to crawling, to walking) So, in regards to writing-readiness: 1) first, the large muscles/joints of the body (shoulders/arms and hips/legs) need to develop and establish gross-motor movement (birth- age 3) ; 2) then the hands and fingers take on fine-motor development and establish skill over time ( age 1 and on); 3) meantime the cognitive regions of the brain are learning about spatial organization, position, direction, shape and form of objects from large and concrete, to small and abstract (like numbers and letters) (birth, age 1 and on); 4) around age 1 to age 3, the child is able to do fine-motor tasks like turn pages, use a spoon, scribble, manipulate blocks and toys; 5). by age 3 to 5, you see maturing grasp of crayons and pencils, with more refined tasks of coloring and drawing; puzzles, zipping, buttoning, threading beads, dressing, brushing teeth happen now. 6) from age 4 to 5, based on individual maturation and brain differences, some children have taken great interest in fine motor skills of coloring, drawing, making letters and numbers, while others will have less interest and require coaxing to execute letters and numbers. Tips: Always judge the timing of instruction by noticing the child's pencil grasp, fine motor control, speed and accuracy of execution of letters/numbers. Letters are first made 'part by part' and move to becoming a 'connected whole'. Reversals are common right into second grade, but a problem with reversals can be made worse by teaching writing too early and too fast. So, take the signals from the child according to their development. Preschool level children can have fun making big letters in the air or on the easel or sidewalk\u2026using large muscle movement. Trace touch-letters on the child's back so s/he 'feels' the shape and guesses the letter or number. Save difficult letters (with directionality) S, J, p, b, d, etc. until easier letters are learned. Never force the writing activity \u2014the experiences with printed words during shared reading and environmental print (stores, restaurants, etc.) are all important precursors to writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Myself, I could write my name when I was 4 and by the time I was 6 I was reading sometimes complex books. My mother gave me a pocket dictionary for my 9th birthday so that I could look up the meanings of new words for myself (I was the youngest of 4 and my mother was working night shift and my father was self-employed and working during the days, so apart from at school and at weekends there was not a lot ).  My 4 year old daughter has been able to write her name since she was 3, and is currently learning simple words (cat, dog, cow, etc), and starting to understand the different sounds that each letter makes (which is an essential skill in translating the written word to the spoken word, since none of us think in letters (I assume, at least)).  We have not pushed her to learn to read. We read books with her daily, and ask her questions about the books and encourage her to want to read, but at her age we cannot force her to practice shaping letters - my wife tried that once and it just ended in tears (on both sides). We let her play as much as she wants, because once she starts school (at age 5, here), then she won't have as much time to be a care-free child, and if there's one good memory of being that age it was the lack of restrictions that came from not having to worry about school etc. ",

            "answer_text": "We tend to think that learning to read and write begins on some specified day when someone sits down with the child and 'introduces' him/her to the skill. Actually, the infant's brain begins to be stimulated to understand the 'code' of reading and writing as soon as the child is born. Hearing the spoken word, seeing shapes, and grouping are all the first steps of reading and writing. We (the grown ups) are the ones who fail to recognize our baby's abilities until it 'looks like' reading and writing to us.And then we jump in and begin or organize our child's thinking and motor skills to suit what we prefer they do with these skills that they have been working on since birth.

A 5 year old should only know how to write I love mommy. Then expand to I love you (pet\u2019s name). Boys are usually more resistant to writing, until they get the idea of writing treasure maps.  First, start with drawing with crayons. Then adding Mommy to the pictures. Then get the twist \u2019n write to make it easy. But before drawing or writing, get him used to sitting down to do things like drawing and writing. Children only sit to watch TV. Best thing for that is board games. Here is a tip. Set up the board and ignore the written rules. Let him tell you the rules. Toddler rules are always waaaay better. I tried to record them, but I was laughing too much to hold the camera steady. ",
