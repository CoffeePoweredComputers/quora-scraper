            "answer_text": "There is no advantage or disadvantage per se for normal writing. Blue and black are the two most common colour and red too to some extend. Gel and fountain pen offer a wide spectrum of colour options that kinda makes things more interesting and lively I suppose. Beyond our everyday writing, many would suggest blue as a means to differentiate original from a copy. And in that sense there may be some advantage for using blue.

            "answer_text": "Blue is discriminated against in certain documents. For example a healthcare professional will normally have the requirement to write in black ink thrust upon him in many countries. I am not sure if it is a legal requirement in some. The idea for this is that the black ink provides a better result if the document is photocopied. This makes me wonder how bad the photocopiers they intend on using are. My scanner has no trouble with documents I write in blue, black, orange, green, red etc. ",
