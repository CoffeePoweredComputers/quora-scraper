            "answer_text": "Many of my best friends as a kid started out as rivals. Of those most of our friendships started with a fight. A big one. Bloody faces and scraped knees etc. When boys get in fights and both are fighting there is a kind of mutual respect gained. One, if it was pre arranged (meet me here after school) and you show up that's honorable. You accepted a challenge. Two, if you fight hard long and well regardless of who wins you've shown you can back up your words. You are someone that can be counted on when violence is needed. You'll stand your ground and give as good as you'll get. Three, if you win and are gracious or lose and accept the loss you've shown you understand that things have been decided. It's over and you dont need to pound the snot out of someone. Or you've lost and you can accept that. You aren't a sore loser and will take the loss without a tantrum or hitting back when the fight is over. (i.e. sucker punching) If you can do these things both parties gain respect for one another. That's something you can build a friendship on. You know if you needed it and you are friends he'd hold his own in a fight. And most guys know once its come to blows and the fight is over so is the argument. No point in being at each others throats after. ",

Hard to hold a grudge until adulthood. If you are an adult, and you fight another grown man who beats you. I shake hands and congratulate them. I also learn from it. I had my ass kicked by a trainer. After he beat me I paid him. I learned a lot during the beatings, so much that by the last time we fought, it was even. He\u2019s my friend. You fight someone all out, and they are up to it. When it\u2019s over the 2 of you have shared something that most people never will. You respect each other from then on. You spilled blood with them. ",
