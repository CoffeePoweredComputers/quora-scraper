            "answer_text": "I believe you are asking about how does water get polluted. If so then, there are a lot of factors that contributes to water pollution. Let us first understand what is water pollution. In simple terms, the condition of any water body that contains harmful content, which is called as pollutant, and will harm humans when consumed and water organism as it disrupts the environmental balance/condition of the ecosystem. There are several classes of water pollutants, the first being disease-causing agents. These category mainly includes viral agents, bacterial agents, protozoa, and parasitic worms. The second class being oxygen-demanding waste. These type of pollutant are able to be decomposed by bacteria by using oxygen in the water. When the decomposition happens, there will be a large population of bacteria living in the water and use up a large proportion of oxygen, effectively lowering the amount of oxygen left for other aquatic organism, such as fish, and usually lead to deaths of many water creatures. The third category would include inorganic, water-soluble waste, such as acids, salts, and toxic metal. Large quantity of these pollutants would render water to be unfit for consumption. The fourth would be organic waste, such as oils and plastics which are harmful to humans, plants, and animals. Some of the major pollution in the ocean come from oil spill by ships. Water pollution is usually caused by human activities. Different human sources add to the pollution of water. There are two sorts of sources, point and non-point sources. Point sources discharge pollutants at specific locations through pipelines or sewers into the surface water. Non-point sources are sources that cannot be traced to a single site of discharge. Examples of point sources are: factories, sewage treatment plants, underground mines, oil wells, oil tankers and agriculture. Examples of nonpoint sources are: acid deposition from the air, traffic, pollutants that are spread through rivers and pollutants that enter the water through groundwater. Non-point pollution is hard to control because the perpetrators cannot be traced. Further Reading: Water pollution FAQ ",

            "answer_text": "Water is one of the resources that is providing by the nature freely for survival of human beings as well as animals but the saddest part is we are destructing our most important resource \u201cThe Water\u201d by polluting it. The major causes of polluting the water are: Acid Rain: Acid rain is pollution of water caused by air pollution. When the acidic particles caused by air pollution in the atmosphere mix with water vapor, it results in acid rain.Industrial Waste: Industrial waste contains pollutants like asbestos, lead, mercury and petrochemicals which are extremely harmful to both people and environment. Industrial waste is discharged into lakes and rivers by using fresh water making the water contaminated.Sewage And Waste Water: Sewage, garbage and liquid waste of households, agricultural lands and factories are discharged into lakes and rivers. These wastes contain harmful chemicals and toxins which make the water poisonous for aquatic animals and plants.Global Warming: Due to global warming, there is an increase in water temperature. This increase in temperature results in death of aquatic plants and animals. This also results in bleaching of coral reefs in water.Eutrophication: Eutrophication is an increased level of nutrients in water bodies. This results in bloom of algae in water. It also depletes the oxygen in water, which negatively affects fish and other aquatic animal population. \u201cThe most common nutrients causing eutrophication are nitrogen and phosphorus. The main source of nitrogen pollutants is run-off from agricultural land, whereas most phosphorus pollution comes from households and industry, including phosphorus-based detergents.\u201d Note: ALGAE:A simple, non-flowering, and typically aquatic plant of a large assemblage that includes the seaweeds and many single-celled forms. Algae contain chlorophyll but lack true stems, roots, leaves, and vascular tissue.  It is a serious matter of 21st century to be solved. No clean water,No survivals,No future!  At last,One thing i want to recommend that start with the less use of plastics. Thank you! ",
