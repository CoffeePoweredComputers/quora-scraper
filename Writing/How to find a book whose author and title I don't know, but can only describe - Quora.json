Do you remember the scene in \"Clerks\" in which the video-store customer asks, \"Do you have that one with that guy who was in that movie that was out last year?\" Librarians field those kinds of questions about books all day long, and are very good at it! If you don't have access to an actual librarian, look at a card catalog for a library serving a large geographic area. My library's catalog (http://catalog.einetwork.net) has a Keyword search that allows users to just plug in any plot, setting or character details they remember. Goodreads.com and AbeBooks.com's BookSleuth (http://forums.abebooks.com/discussions/AbeBookscom_BookSleuthreg/abesleuthcom?redirCnt=1&mobile=y&=) are also worth a shot. Amazon and Google can do searches, too, but searches almost always produce an overwhelming number of results. ",

After thirty years of asking every bookseller, rare and antique book dealer, and librarian I came across, someone invented the internet. I posted in Usenet groups, forums, etc. Nope.

Periodically I'd retry. Nothing. Then, amazon came online., and little boy dragon eating tangerines Returned Elmer and the Dragon (My Father's Dragon): Ruth Stiles Gannett: 9780440421368: Amazon.com: Books  SUCCESS.
