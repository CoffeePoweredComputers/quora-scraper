            "answer_text": "Yes if they're made in the right way. Today's steel is much more pure than steel made in the middle ages or even in the Renaissance. That means that we have less silicon and other impurities within the blade. Our options for the different types of steel have also increased. That being said a lot depends on who made the weapon. If the past forgers had constructed it right they would be able to make a blade Superior to a sword made now if the sword maker today did not use the right techniques. But know if you ever see cutting competitions where swords are used today by professionals and the swords are very high quality they would be able to use them to greater effect than swords made during the middle ages in Europe, Japan an or any other part of the world. The key is impurity in the smelting process however skilled the sword maker was in the middle ages she could not get past the fact that the smelted material was far less pure. The thing is that they weren't to be able to achieve the temperatures to get rid of all of those impurities found in sand and iron ore. That temperature is about 3,000 degrees. You also have to understand that the in technology in steel munufacturing today is downright amazing. I looked at a steel manufacters rundown of everything they can do with steel and they said that that they can make more than 10000 types of steel now for all different purposes. Many of those metals include alloys or the introduction of different metals within the steel so that they can be used for different purposes. Each of them has a different hardness and specific use. Forgers of the middle ages would be very very limited in the types of steel that they could use. You would have rusting and different issues with maintenance as well as more sharpening required for each blade. Chipping and durability would be a problem. You will see in blade forging for modern steel that most forgers use oil to quench their blades. Back then it was almost always required that they use water to get the utmost hardness for each sword and water provide the greatest potential hardnest. Today most blades are quenced oil. That's b ecause modern steel don't need the hardness that comes from the quenching in water in fact the process of quenching in water can cause the blade to crack and be destroyed in modern steel blade making. So the answer is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say in some regards almost always, in others, no, generally not. If we look at steel quality, medieval swords are almost always only regular carbon steels, BETTER manufacturers nowadays use Cr, CrV or Ni steels, all of which have the potential to make for a much better quality sword in material. Yes, even better than the famed \u201cDamascus steel swords\u201d, it\u2019s just a UHCS jacket around an iron core, nothing special about it if you understand basic metallurgy, in fact I\u2019d rate \u201cDamascus steel swords\u201d worse than the average high-late medieval sword, in fact. Ibn Hodeil notes in the 1300s, \"the fabrication of Frankish swords is the work of Genies.\" also noting how the \u201cwork of the Hindus (damascus steel swords) often shatters in cold weather (we are talking modern day Iran, so 15 \u00b0C and below)\u201d Not to talk about historical steel being wrought iron most of the time, which is high in slag, which can lead to earlier material failure, while with modern steels this is less of a concern. Historically speaking a lot of swords also couldn\u2019t afford to be the same kind of steel all throughout, so we have plenty of examples of a wrought iron core wrapped around with a high carbon steel jacket (yes this is the same as how katana are made nowadays and this is how most Japanese swords were made, albeit the highest quality versions of them were made out from a \u201csingle billet\u201d). But still in some swords of Medieval origin you still don\u2019t find slag with regular micrography.  No visible slag in either. What is a production but still material quality is heat treatment. Our ancestors didn\u2019t have the luxury to use thermometers and they are crucial for proper heat treatment. So they had to rely on the color created by the temperature of the material. Fortunately for us, things start glowing at specific temperatures.  So when people saw a specific color they knew when to quench the sword. Where in general modern swords fall short however is the handling department. Unless you are buying swords on the high end like Albion, A&A, Landsknecht Emporium etc. you will, generally speaking, get a worse product for handling than even a lot of very cheap medieval swords. And handling in general is dependent on the form of the blade, even minor qualities (as far as looks concerned), like spine thickness, distal taper, fuller width, fuller length, blade cross section, guard weight etc etc WILL impact on the handling. There are also modern manufacturers that wouldn\u2019t get much praise back then, like Cold Steel, Windlass Steelcrafts, Universal Swords, Nielo Swords, Depeka, Hanwei (they are on the better scale of the not so well handling ones, but their heat treatment has led to many breakages), etc. So all in all, modern swords are better in some regards, in others not so much. Unfortunately for modern manufacturers good enough material is #1 priority (which medieval swords are), handling is #2 priority and only after that there is a need for even better materials, as #1 will determine if it can serve at all or not, #2 determines how it serves both short and long term and #3 is how long it will serve.

            "answer_text": "Let us break this down. Because it's an easy question to answer, with a twist. Certainly, many swords made today, in fact, a majority of them, may not meet - for lack of a better word - the quality of medieval swords. But not because of anything that has to do with our ability to make better swords. It has everything to do with why they are made - to be decoration rather than tools of war. To be imitations of the real thing. The knock-off souvenier katana. The mass-produced cavalry saber that folks swear is an heirloom. Most of the fancy fantasy swords that fetch a high price to today's fantasy collector. Now, if there was a need to make a combat-viable sword the answer is definitely yes. First, none of the techniques of making older swords has truly been lost. Finding someone who knows them may be a little harder - but if there was a need, the knowledge is there to be restored. And even so \u2026 Materials wise our metals are better, our metallurgy is better, and our ability to make and craft alloys is better, and our knowledge of material properties and how to craft them for a particular is better. Wootz steel is an interesting case, where access to a particular metal was lost. But it\u2019s been found again. On the other hand \u2026 even when wootz steel vanished from the medieval toolbox, it did not stop the manufacture or quality weapons that were very battlefield capable. If there was a need, we are perfectly capable of creating swords to match or exceed the qualities of a medieval sword. But we don\u2019t need to. We have created much easier and more effective ways of killing each other. The truth of the matter, alas, is that tragic truth. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. The basic qualities used in the manufacturing process are more advanced. The knowledge and the use of higher quality more homogeneous steels ensure a better end product. The heat is better controlled today as well, we can control it via digital thermostats, the heat can be controlled by single degrees even. As well as the quality of the air and fuel used, preventing any imperfections being built into the sword. Naturally there are always going to be mistakes made and there are people who can make swords of great quality and are masters of the craft, just like the expert blacksmiths and specific sword making manufacturers of the past. And within those groups both ancient and today there are people who maybe mediocre and just plain poor quality swords as well. If they use poor materials, poor heat and poor quality air all can easily cause manufacturing defects today just as easily as in the past. High quality swords require, the best steels and raw materials, the best air quality within the forge and the control of the heat used to melt and forge the materials to make the sword. ",

            "answer_text": "The average modern sword (actual combat or combat ready sword, not cheap production for wall hanging, zombie killer posing, or backyard watermelon chopping) is of much higher quality than the average Medieval sword. However, there were exceptionally high quality swords made during Medieval times can rival the better swords of today. The biggest problem back then was the quality of the steel. It was very difficult to control the quality of the bloom. Much of the techniques went in to compensating for the often inconsistent quality of the billets. Today, we have much better steel production control as well as quality control in the sword making itself. Our understanding of metallurgy is such that we can control the additives to achieve greater hardens, toughness and strength. It should be noted that surviving Medieval swords are not representative of the swords back then. It is usually the best of the best that has survive to today. ",

We have better steel now and better tools with which to work that steel. so if nothing else, a medieval style sword made today should be objectively better, eventhough in actual practical use the difference likely won't be extremely noticable. In terms of design evolution not much had happened since the late 1800s. And its not that the late 1800s sword designs were necessarily 'better' than the medieval ones, they were just better for the specific purpose of battlefields or duels in the 1800s, which was quite different than battlefields in the middle ages. So different, yes, better, depends. When talking about 'modern' swords we also have to take into account that there is a far larger percentage of swords being produced for hanging on a wall as decoration than for use in fighting. So probably 'on average' modern swords are significantly worse for combat than they were in the middle ages, eventhough a high quality modern battleforged sword would be better than one from the middle ages.

It could be that the raw materials are no more or the process had some trick unknown to us. Greek fire is another weapon lost to us. You can not recreate a weapon who had survived countlles battles and was inherited from father to son. Yes the steel , or the alloys are now ten times better. But can you create a sword who is hard on outside and soft inside just from forging? I am not an expert in swords per se, as I am not a Knight, but I know knifes as I caried one on me for 30 years. I have destroyed many. A real knight had only on knife in his life. ",

The sword had actually been clamped in a vice, bent round until the tip touched the proof mark, and then let go. If it wasn\u2019t straight afterwards it would have been on the reject pile. What we can do now is just beyond belief. It would seem like sorcery to a medieval smith. I am guessing that this is one of the reasons the Japanese have clamped down on manufacture. If it\u2019s not \u201ctraditional\u201d then it\u2019s not permitted, otherwise we would have a hundred million Chinese made katanas that were considerable better than most of the traditional ones.

Back when they were seriously used, they designed the swords against the most common issues of breakage in battle. This included softer metal in the tangs to prevent hilt breakage, tear drop style sharpening so the sharpened edge lasts longer, and more tightly fitting the hilt components to the sword to prevent the sword from eventually wobbling. The sheer majority of modern sword makers just don\u2019t take all this into account. As for the steel quality used today, i\u2019d say we\u2019re far better now because we have much more consistent filtering and screening of steels as well as a much broader variety of suitable steels to choose from. Plus we\u2019re able to manufacture said swords much faster than ever now. ",

The reason is that most medieval swords had to be functional weapons while most modern are decorations and as such aren\u2019t expected to hold up. There are quite a few swords on the market which some collectors would call wall hangers and sword type objects as they are simply not practical, due to low quality, bad design or both.

Those are commonly referred to as wall hangers and are usually pressed or stamped \u201cpot metal\u201d which is a mix of several materials to make the production cost cheaper. The most important part of a sword quality wise is the tang. Cheap swords have what is called a rat tail tang which is a threaded metal rod spot wielded onto the blade. A full tang sword is where the blade is all one solid piece of steel that is hammered out to be thinner on the end for the tang without compromising the quality of the sword. ",

From memory, sword production was permitted to continue in 1947. The Japanese sword is considered to be the Japanese highest art-form by the Japanese, not merely a weapon. It takes a great deal of study, viewing of many fine swords and knowledge of what to look for to understand this. ",
