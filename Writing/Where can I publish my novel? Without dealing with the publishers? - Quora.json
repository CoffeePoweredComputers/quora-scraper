            "answer_text": "First, think very carefully about why you want to avoid working with large, successful publishing houses.  It's actually easier to be published by one of them than it is to self-publish a novel and make a lot of sales or a reasonable amount of profit. So, if you're looking for a shortcut, self-publishing isn't it.  If you're looking for a way to do avoid having anyone else telling you what cover art, cover copy, interior layout or editorial changes you should make, then you might want to think carefully about why you want to do it all your own way. Remember that the people making these suggestions in a mainstream house have generally worked on hundreds or thousands of books just like yours -- far more than any single author is likely to handle in a lifetime. They know what works and what doesn't better than almost any author ever could -- experience does count.  Do you want to retain control even IF it hurts your book's exposure or sales?  If you're looking to make more profit from your book, it may be possible to do that -- but despite what the zeitgeist is telling you, that's not always true. Many authors find that they make more money in their career working with larger houses, because their early books sell more copies. Distribution counts, a lot. All of those Author Earnings articles aren't talking about total number of copies sold, but about comparing the mainstream-published author's much smaller take per book, totaled across a LOT more books, with the self-published author's take.  If you sell more copies early on, you have a much larger fan base much faster. That can be leveraged, if you have any marketing chops at all, into a much bigger career, and much larger paydays later. Plus, with a mainstream house, you don't have to think about things like sub rights sales, and all the rest of your infrastructure -- someone else is taking care of all of that, and helping you find publicity options, too. So you have more time to write more books, or to market the ones you have out.  BUT, if you look at all of that, and you think you want to self-publish, and for the right reasons -- which is valid, and there are good reasons -- then you start your own publishing company.  You print POD through LSI or CS (in the US), get your own ISBN block (through Bowker in the US), upload your ebook to Amazon through KDP, and do an ePub with one of the many tools out there, and upload it to whichever of the smaller outlets look to be worth your time.  You buy books on all the aspects of book publishing, too, because this advice and everything else you can find on the internet is not remotely thorough enough to keep you afloat. You need to learn a lot more than we can begin to tell you!  ",
