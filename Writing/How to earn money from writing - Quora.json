            "answer_text": "When I first wrote a novel in 1991 I remember walking down the road and seeing a pretty girl and thinking, \u201cShe might like me now\u201d. I know that a lot of what I write seems to involve whether or not women like me.But that\u2019s what I think about. I want people to like me. And when I was younger, it was more important that women like me than that men like me. I also wanted money. I didn\u2019t want to work for a boss. That scary feeling of being called into the boss\u2019s office after you know you did something that was \u201cwrong\u201d.I put it in quotes because what does it matter now? What did it even matter then?How could you, my sweet baby, ever do something wrong? Note: the above sentence is what I would whisper to myself after being summoned to the boss\u2019s office. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any pride in your work?\u201d\u201cClean out your desk today\u201d.\u201cDid you steal all of the paper?\u201d\u201cWhy did the office cleaning lady find 20 moldy sandwiches in your drawer?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you test the software before it went to the client.\u201d Whatever. It\u2019s because I was busy and no I didn\u2019t have pride in my work. I was 22 years old and looking at women and trying to publish a novel on the side so I didn\u2019t have to work anymore. And I have no comment about the sandwiches.It took many years before I made any money as a writer. And what works then is different now. Right now it\u2019s easier than ever. But the rules changed every 3 or 4 years and they will change again. Just like they change with everything in life. By the way, that first novel, and the four that came after it, and the 50 short stories that came after it, never got published. I used to think I needed to publish something before I could feel good about myself, before I could call myself a \u201cwriter\u201d, before I could have a girlfriend, before I could get a real job, before I could move to NYC. What a pathetic weight on my shoulder to think I needed something controlled by just a handful of people. Those weights stayed on my back for years. When you have weights on you, you can\u2019t move. The weights are only mental. Go ahead. Move. So\u2026GO! A) YOU ARE A WRITER.If you sit down at a blank screen every day and simply do nothing then you are a writer. If you write one word, even better.Some people will disagree. Maybe you will disagree. That\u2019s fine.We also can all disagree. Meanwhile, our DNA is telling us we are pretty much exactly the same. People argue and DNA laughs. B) READ A TON OF STUFF.I try to read pieces or chapters in 3-4 books a day or more. I read at least from one non-fiction, one or two quality fiction, and one inspirational. I try to read at the level I want to write. I do this in the morning before I start writing. If you email me, you can see in the auto response some of the latest things I\u2019ve been reading. At night I relax and read things that are a little more like \u201cjunk food\u201d \u2013 fun things that I want to read but don\u2019t necessarily inspire my writing. If you don\u2019t like reading, you won\u2019t like writing. Before I wrote this morning, I read parts of books from Teju Cole, Bukowski, Eckhart Tolle, and the blog Hyperbole and a Half. Someone wrote in a comment to someone else\u2019s post a few weeks ago: What if James Altucher had to take care of two kids in the morning? Yes, it\u2019s true. Kids suck. But sometimes I do have to do that. Plus I have other responsibilities. So I wake up at 4am and begin reading and writing. Or earlier. Whatever it takes. C) GET RID OF PREJUDICE.Agents, publishers, editors, at the traditional companies are mostly bullshit.They have no clue what they are doing. For the most part they pick sucky writers whose books flash for a week or so and then disappear forever. And they take a year to publish your book after they accept your book. This is not 100% true. But try to gauge the entrepreneurship of the people you are dealing with. You need people as creative as you. It needs to be a team and not a machine. You can traditionally publish, but make sure you are doing it with creative entrepreneurs (cc Patricia Gift ) and not people stuck in the machine. If you think you need a mainstream publisher for reasons of ego or prejudice then you are guaranteed to publish a worst-seller instead of a bestseller. The second you start to think something, anything, is IMPORTANT, then your ego will suffer and your work will suffer. If you are an artist, get your art in the hands of people. That\u2019s your only job. Destroy every gatekeeper.D) SELF-PUBLISHING IS NOT E-BOOKS.If you self-publish, you can make an e-book, you can also make a print-on-demand book through Createspace, you can make an Audio book through Audible, you can make a hardcover, you can even make a t-shirt with your book on it. I have over 20 t-shirts with the entire 67,000 words of \u201cChoose Yourself!\u201d printed on it. My kids have several shirts. Claudia does. Nobody is allowed to walk into this house without wearing that t-shirt. Do what you want. Self-publishing simply means you write a book and you figure out how to get it into the hands of other people. It might just be you sell it on your email list. Congrats! You\u2019re then a published author. In my post, \u201cHow to Self Publish a Bestseller\u201d I write about the details and the numbers.E) BOOKSTORES ARE EVIL.My kids are sad that Borders is dying and that Barnes & Noble is next. Keep your mouths shut, kids! I get it. I love bookstores also. It\u2019s like a work of art to see all of those covers, to thumb through the pages, to grab a pile of books and a coffee and start seeing what books you want to buy. But don\u2019t forget just 20 years ago everyone said Barnes & Noble was evil because they were killing the independent bookstore. I have news for you: the indies were evil also. One guy picking out 500 of his favorite books and no others. Now a B&N might have 10,000 books but Amazon has 20 million books. Why would you ever give someone the choice to limit you. I hope all bookstores die and that Amazon is the only one left standing. Because then every author has a chance and not just the ones the B&N gatekeeper decides on. And I\u2019ll tell you how I am doing my role: I pick out the books I might buy in a Barnes & Noble. I take them to the coffee shop in the store. I buy my coffee and start thumbing through the books. Then I buy the books right there and then in the store. On my Kindle. Screw you, Barnes & Noble. F) PLATFORM IS SHIT.I agree it\u2019s important to have some Internet presence. You need to sell your first 1000 books once you publish and the Internet is a good way to do it. But your free audience is not the way to do it. They read your blog for free. They don\u2019t even want to fork over 99 cents to buy your book. I will give you an example: on my last book, \u201cChoose Yourself!\u201d I obviously encouraged my readers to buy it. But another group, Stansberry Research, recommended it to their paying subscribers. In two weeks through them I sold tens of thousands of books. It took my free audience, which was millions bigger, three months to catch up in sales to an audience that had never even heard of me before. Now my book has sold over 100,000 copies and I\u2019m getting ready to send out another email bundle to another list. This will be infinitely more valuable than any blog, podcast, marketing, whatever I use to promote my book on the Internet.I love the audience for my blog and these posts. I feel it\u2019s one of the few times I\u2019ve seen a community of genuine good people trying to improve. I don\u2019t write here to sell books but to build community and make friends. Most of the Internet is \u201coutrage porn\u201d and I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve avoided that.That said, I am not an expert on marketing. +Ryan Holiday, who is an expert on book marketing (and also told me the term \u201coutrage porn\u201d yesterday), helped me with my book and was an invaluable resource and to this day still is. Ryan and Tucker Max and Nils Parker are building a company which will revolutionize this industry. One rule I have is I am loyal for life to anyone who helps me make money and Ryan definitely helped me. G) BLOG.This seems opposite of what I said above. But blogging is not such a bad idea. How come? Because it makes you write every day. And it also is fun to build friends and community around your blog. But if you want to blog, don\u2019t just register a domain name and start blogging. You won\u2019t get any traffic. I encourage people to find online communities that they like and feel like participating in and start blogging there or guest posting there. If you are unsure of where and how to blog, start by practicing on a site like Quora, which is a question and answer site that also hosts blogs. Practice answering questions there. See what gets upvoted and what doesn\u2019t. Improve your skills. See if you enjoy it. Then start taking some of your answers and making them into a blog. Then start guest posting on other sites. You\u2019re not trying to build an audience for your blog. You\u2019re trying to build an audience for YOU, PERIOD. There\u2019s no money in ads, blah. You have to be more creative than ever how you build an audience. The best Internet marketing I did was when I did a reddit AMA (which Ryan, above, set up).Look at someone like EL James, who wrote Fifty Shades of Grey. I don\u2019t even think she had a blog. She was posting on fan fiction sites for Twilight. And millionaire teenage bestseller, Amanda Hocking, was posting in the comments section of JA Konrath\u2019s site and building community that way. There\u2019s a thousand ways to build community and practice writing on the Internet. Blog is one of them but there are many others. My #1 suggestion: first practice on Quora (cc Marc Bodnick) If you go there, follow me and say \u201cHi!\u201d. H) WRITE EVERY DAY.I had a friend who wanted to be a painter. \u201cWhen I move to Paris I\u2019ll finally be able to paint,\u201d she said. She never moved to Paris. Now she\u2019s a programmer and hates her job. I have another friend who has been working for 30 years on one novel. She keeps hating it and rewriting it. She can\u2019t get a publisher interested. She only writes when she\u2019s inspired. She needs writing groups to push her along. I get it. I get writer\u2019s block also. But writing is a muscle. I used to play in chess tournaments a lot. I was ranked a master. And then I got busy with other things. So my skill level has dropped. It would take me a good SIX MONTHS OF STUDYING three hours a day to just get back up to my old skill level. If you don\u2019t write every day, you won\u2019t know what your potential skill level is. You will be producing sub-par work. And in a world where 15 million books will be published this year, your book will have little chance to shine. It doesn\u2019t matter if you write good stuff or bad stuff every day. Yesterday, for fun, I wrote about how much I enjoyed bowel movements. Will I publish that? I hope not! It was awful! But I wrote because that\u2019s what I wrote yesterday. 1500 words about bowel movements. Mission accomplished. Do the math, if you just write 1000 words a day that are publishable then you have a book every two months. 1000 words a day is not easy. But it\u2019s not hard either. This post is 1800 words so far and I started 20 minutes ago. I\u2019ll spend many more hours rewriting it than writing it but once you start exercising the writing muscle (start with 200 words a day, then 300, etc) you will get up to 1000.There\u2019s a blog about a woman who writes 10,000 words a day and she describes her method. She does detailed outlining first. That method works. When Claudia Azula Altucher and I went away on a silent retreat to write \u201cThe Power of No\u201d, which hasn\u2019t come out yet, we were writing about 7,000 words a day. Sometimes more words is not better. If I write a 1000 words, then by the time I\u2019ve published I\u2019ve usually rewritten and edited it down to 600 words. I) REWRITE EVERY DAY. See above. I feel better about the words I take out then the words I write. First you have a block of stone, then you make a sculpture, then you chisel and fine tune until you have a work of art. Art is born from the rewrite, not from the typewrite. With \u201cChoose Yourself!\u201d I kept rewriting obsessively. One time the book was all finished and sent to editors, designers, etc. Then I did the audio version. KABLAMO! Any paragraph that made me feel like, \u201cUgh, I\u2019m too bored to read this out loud,\u201d I noted. Then I went back home and rewrote the whole book again. And the audio version veered so much from the book it was completely unabridged. Everyone hated me. But I liked the final result much beter. Read your work out loud and cut out anything that makes you lag. J) CAN I MAKE MONEY WRITING ARTICLES?No. You used to be able to make a living writing articles. Just a few years ago. In 2005 I made a good living writing about 3-4 articles a day for different publications while I was running my fund and before I started and sold Stockpickr. But those days are over. People just don\u2019t pay for content. And there are too many writers. It\u2019s a supply and demand thing. If you expect to make a living from articles or blogs then figure out how to do one of three things:  blog for free, but then lead people to a subscription information product. Like \u201cstock picks\u201d or \u201cdating\u201d or whatever you think you\u2019re an expert at and nobody else is. (cc Ramit Sethi Lewis Howes Tim Sykes Derek Halpern Porter Stansberry etc)get speaking gigs. This is hard.do consulting or coaching. This is possible.I\u2019ve never been that great at any of the three above. Well, maybe #3 but only recently. So this leaves us with only one thing. ONE THING works.K) WRITE A LOT OF BOOKS.If you can write one book and it\u2019s a mega-bestseller like \u201c50 Shades of Grey\u201d then congratulations. There is exactly one of you and I know your name: EL James. For everyone else, you have to write more than one book. And for most people, you have to write dozens of books. I was at a dinner recently of a bunch of self-published Amazon authors who were making a living at it. Every single one of them had more than ten books written and published in the prior year or so. +Theresa Ragan, as an example, has 13 or 14 books written (thriller and romance) in the past 2 or 3 years. Hugh Howey, known for his Wool series, has written around 28 books in the past few years. I lost count while counting them. He never stops. I highly recommend his SAND series which just came out. At the dinner there was one woman who had written over 100 books. If she averages $100 a book a month for the rest of her life it\u2019s not so bad. \u201cChoose Yourself!\u201d was my 11th or 12th published book. I have four more books sitting here ready to go. Throughout history the best books have often been written in a short amount of time. Bukowski\u2019s \u201cPost Office\u201d and Jack Kerouac\u2019s \u201cOn the Road\u201d were both written in three weeks. I can find 1000 more examples. Sean Platt has a good book that just came out about writing many books. I recommend it. \u201cWrite. Publish. Repeat.\u201d I think Sean has published over 50 books. I don\u2019t know because he uses pseudonyms as well. Always remember the key rule: an overnight success takes at least five years of solid work (as defined in my prior post \u201cThe Ultimate Cheat Sheet on Reinventing Yourself\u201d). I left out important things: how do you market books, how do you make art, how do you build discipline, what do you write about, and so on. There\u2019s answers for all of those. The most important thing for me: writing without fear. Writing without judgment. Writing without anger. Making writing fun. Writing right now. Writing is about freedom and not money. I want to write to you something fun and useful. And I want you to read it.- \u2013 -(p.s. Share with the people who have books hidden in their drawer.)(p.p.s. don\u2019t ever be afraid. Hit \u201cpublish\u201d. Apologize later. ) ",

            "answer_text": "At some point of time, I used to write for a living. Here are some ways to utilize your writing skills for a living: 1. Writing content for corporate & small business blogs: Low risk, low rewards. Given that content is a great driver for inbound traffic, a lot of businesses are focusing on developing content for their websites. For good writers the pay is between 20-30 cents/word. Thus, if you are writing a 400 word article, you could get paid up to $120. You can look for these jobs in sites like Scripted.com, oDesk.com and Craigslist - http://boston.craigslist.org/wri/ -   http://www.writersmarket.com/assets/pdf/How_Much_Should_I_Charge.pdf 2. Becoming a novelist, screenplay writer or a writer of non-fiction - high risk, high rewards. Published authors through traditional publishing houses typically get 15% of the sales of their book. That means, if you can sell 100,000 copies of your book at $10/copy you could make a cool $150K. Needless to say that this is not easy. For those of us who cannot get top publishers, the option is to self-publish and pocket up to 60% of the sales.  3. Becoming a freelance writer for magazines and trade publications - many newspapers and magazines outsource their content writing. It is prestigious to write for magazines, but the rates can be low at $0.10/word but can be as high as $1/word with an average $0.30/word for reputed publications. In trade publications (like industry reports) the rates can go as high as $0.40-$2/word, but is not as sexy and requires a lot of domain knowledge.  Other avenues: Sales copywriting that appears in product pages, brochures and promotion materials.Advertorial writing - these appear in magazines inserted inbetween regular features. They can pay as high as $500/page.Business plan writingAnnual report writing for corporationsNewsletter writing - both for small businesses and for corporations.Website content writing Brochure and ad content writingProofreading - the rates are typically around $10-20 per hour.Ghostwriting. You write a book and somebody else would get credit for it, by paying you for the work.Technical writing - businesses need somebody to write their product manuals and internal documentation.Running your own blog and making money from advertising. If you have very good skills and a niche audience, go ahead. It is a high risk, medium reward thing.
