            "answer_text": "Let me turn this question around on you. Why do you feel the need for prompts generated by someone else? Look around you. Your daily world is full of drama, detail, and curiosities. Go to a mall and people watch. Make up stories for a couple who seem to be arguing. For a vendor or salesperson who looks bored, angry, half asleep. At the gym or in school, do you see words someone has written on a wall. What sort of person wrote those words? And why? News reports, blogs, podcasts bring us interesting people and situations. Choose any one of them\u2014and write! I\u2019d love to see you looking outside of generic prompts and growing your ability to think, and write, like a writer. Enjoy this adventure! ",
