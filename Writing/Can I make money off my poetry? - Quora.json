            "answer_text": "In fact YES you can! I have seen many people succeed in that. If your poetry are nice, heart touching and engaging, then most likely you will have a great audience. There are several ways. First is if you want to become a writer. Then you must stick to it and write every day. Write a book with all of your poetry, print it out and sell it. Make it as a hard copy, and sell it wherever you can. Upload it on Amazon and put a reasonable price in it. If you can afford it, advertise it as much as possible.  The second way: Open an Instagram or Facebook page and post daily poetry. By reaching a higher engaged audience, and by getting more likes and comments every day, you can start advertising other pages in your Instagram account and earn money from them. This requires a lot of hard work, but is possible. Combine both of the ways together and you shall become very successful. After that you can open a blog and post your writings. The combination of Hard work, talent and marketing is the secret formula to succeeding in this. So make sure you give it a try if you liked the idea. These ways they prove to be efficient but it demands a lot of time and patience. In a long term, you can make money, but you have to stick with it until the end. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is no major Publishing house that takes on new unknown poets. You have to be a brand name, a rock star, or a politician with name recognition\u2026.preferably criminal\u2026and then its not about poetry at all. Like all poets in the past\u2026you get a job \u2026and then you write poetry..or you are rich \u2026like the Earl of Oxford who wrote Shakespeare canon. The best poetry is written by people of leisure (did not work) Like Keats, Milton, Shelly, Earl of Oxford, Sir Phillip Sydney, etc If you try to make money with poetry..it will just become political prose. A blog will not help you, nor the internet. There is a guy here on Quora who posts \u201crough\u201d translations of other people's poetry\u2026and give advice\u2026and says he proudly has 13 million clicks. Take 13 million clicks and 5 bucks and you can get a coffee at Starbucks. I hate it when people say they have likes and clicks on their prose poems. IT DOES NOT MATTER ANYMORE\u2026little short prose blurbs, from clicks on people that read your first line and moved on. poetry is dead in that form. Prose poetry is not a part fo the future of poetry. Thats over. Prose is over. The culture war is over. Prose lost\u2026its passe. And clicks are not power or influence in a capitalistic world. Until you sell your book of poems to a movie produce you are zero influence in this world ANd therefore the poem has to be an epic poem with real characters and real events and a real narrative.

Today's living poets may live on proceedings from a national award but that's only for one year, generally. Most poets today make a living by doing other kinds of writing or teaching. One can earn money for writing poetry if one advertises well or has an agent. But enough money to actually live on, not likely. ",
