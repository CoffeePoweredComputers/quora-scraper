            "answer_text": "If that were true I'd wonder how coaxial helicopters like the Ka-27 were possible.  As you can see the two rotor discs are quite close to each other, much closer than two hovering helicopters could get. Yet it doesn't fall out of the sky. The downwash produced by the rotors is windy and turbulent for sure but it is not enough to negate another helicopter\u2019s flight. ",
