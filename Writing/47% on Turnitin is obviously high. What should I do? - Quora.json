            "answer_text": "Quit focusing on the Turnitin rating. Check your citations and references. If you have cited everything correctly, with a correct accompanying reference then you\u2019re golden. Turnitin is a useful piece of software, for example it\u2019ll highlight phrases that appear in your work that have appeared elsewhere. Take a look at those phrases - have you inadvertantly quoted someone without a citation? If so, fix it before submission. However, good academic writing frequently produces a high Turnitin rating because of: Academic \u201cboilerplate\u201d. Phrases like, \u201cAccording to research by\u2026\u201d will often be flagged because they\u2019re used in many people\u2019s work. In scientific and medical papers often the format for reporting experimental results is highly structured and uniform, and may even be described word for word in the style guide. This isn\u2019t an error, it is correct writing style for that discipline.References. Each reference is always exactly the same at the end of the paper. Turnitin will flag these as being the same in other people\u2019s work. Don\u2019t turn off the reference checking though, because if your references aren\u2019t the same then you may have messed up the referencing format or inadvertently created a \u201cghost citation\u201d (a citation referencing a paper that doesn\u2019t exist). This function is useful.Quotations. Direct quotes (even when enclosed in quotation marks) will often be flagged. Again, this is good. If the quote is being flagged then you\u2019ve quoted it correctly (or at least you aren\u2019t to blame if you quoted it wrong if you\u2019re quoting from them). In the arts and humanities a large portion of your paper may consist of quotations.Either way, don\u2019t panic. Turnitin is not in an of itself an indicator of plagiarism except in \u201cfringe\u201d cases such as getting a rating like 1% (which is suspicious because it means no quotations, non standard academic writing, and generally screams \u201cSomething is wrong here!\u201d) or 99% (which is suspicious because it looks a lot like you just copied someone else\u2019s paper and changed the name at the top). Turnitin is a useful tool in checking your quotations, citations, references, and writing style. It should be used as such. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my assignments received a score of 68% plagiarized report. I knew that the work was my own or the parts were accurately cited per standard research principles. For starters, examine the actual results to see \u201cwhat is plagiarized.\u201d For example, does your paper include a bibliography that was part of the Turnitin rating? That would increase your score. Did you use a lot of quotes or titles in your paper? As those will also increase your score. If you have a number of quotes, as long as you have the quotation marks then that would indicate that you had not plagiarized those sections. Also, see where you supposedly copied from. I was once informed by Turnitin\u2019s report that one of my copied sections was from a student\u2019s paper submitted in Ireland. If you submitted a draft of your paper previously that would also cause a higher score. Is your submission full of common knowledge? I was once dinged for using the phrase \u201cUnited, England, and Russia.\u201d However, if you don\u2019t have any of these types of elements in your paper, you need to see about revising your paper. I\u2019d suggest taking a copy of your paper to either your instructor or if your school has a student services section for providing writing assistance and talk with them. I\u2019d also suggest working with a writing center to learn how to do appropriate paraphrasing, but remember to still cite the paraphrase. Be careful about just changing words to get a lower score, or as I refer to as \u201ctheasarusizing\u201d your paper. For starters, unless you understand the actual words you switch out, you can change the meaning of your work; also it might be considered in the worst case as an attempt to purposely cheat. I\u2019ve had students attempt this and it reads poorly. Also, you can see what this looks like by using google translate when you translate from English to another language and then back to English. Sometimes you get an accurate translation, sometimes you wonder what google was thinking. Also, you need to truly admit if you did copy large parts of the paper, people like to self-deceive themselves. ",
