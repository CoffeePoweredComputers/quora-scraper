Once you write the story, you can, of course, share info that doesn\u2019t contradict canon, but keep your reimaginings either quiet or make an alternate universe series;Do your research. The moment when your story becomes a literature sensation, prepare for fans to scrutinize the story down to the tiniest of details and pick apart the tiniest of plot holes;Never approve derivative works as \u2018canon\u2019 stories if they are as believable as a crappy fanfic;Allow your book series to rest in peace. Once it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Don\u2019t release pandering trivia that nobody asked for just to stay relevant;Respect your fans. If your fans believed a certain fact about your stories and you want to disprove it, then, for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t say stuff like: \u2018I\u2019ve never said that [insert your fact here] is correct/incorrect, etc.\u2019 Do your corrections politely;If you plan to make a website to enrich your universe, then by all means do so. Just make sure that you don\u2019t put articles like \u201815 times someone did something\u2019. Those belong in a fan website. Make your written text easily accessible and completely separate from any update pages and merch sales pages. Allow comments on the site (with moderations, of course. Trolls should be reported and blocked after a few cease and desist warnings). Add interractive elements for your fans to be entertained by, but don\u2019t overdo it.",
