            "answer_text": "Depends on how you want to approach a novel. Most people like starting with a world that\u2019s either familiar to them or created by them. Then, they create the characters. Usually characters with a distinct, relatable personality grabs the readers\u2019 attention. Many writers (and movies) start with or use the hero\u2019s journey structure (Hero's journey - Wikipedia) in some way or another (ie. Harry Potter, The Wizard of Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. ). Of course, there are also anti-hero stories as well, like Marie Lu\u2019s Young Elites series. Just choose what interests you & if you want to publish it, make sure to not make the story too cliche. ",

            "answer_text": "You can always start like what J.R.R Tolkien did. You could create a prologue that is several pages long, summarizing the brief history of the people who going to start with (in the Lord of the Rings\u2019 saga, it started with the Hobbits) and then continue from there. Or you could start with something like the city that the hero/heroin lives in - to showcase the (political and social) situation the hero and/or heroin currently in. Many of the games like Dragon Age, Final Fantasy and so on starts in this sort of approach and since they are fantasy based, maybe you could use them as well. ",
