            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s think of the opening pages of a story as if they are a party. Have you ever been to a party with a friend who insists you spend the entire evening meeting one person after another? \u201cOh, there\u2019s John, you have to meet him,\u201d she says, only pull you away after a minute or two to meet Alicia, and a minute later Brent, and then just as you are getting to know Brent, there\u2019s Eloise, and by the end of the evening, everyone has become a blur. A few days later at coffee, your friend waxes poetic about what a great time the two of you had and she starts quizzing you about the people you met. \u201cDon\u2019t you just love Alicia? Her work is amazing.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d you ask, trying to conjure up an image of Alicia. \u201cWhat does she do?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean what does she do? I introduced you to her so you could talk about her work. The two of you have so much in common!\u201d Don\u2019t be that writer! The one who introduces the reader to everyone in the story within the first fifteen or so pages. Don\u2019t create a big, messy, confusing dinner party at the beginning of your novel that causes the reader to wonder who the characters are and what their roles are in your story. The first fifteen pages should introduce the reader to the main characters, the people we need to get to know to become invested in your story. And in those crucial opening pages we should only meet the characters that are directly impacted by the inciting incident of the book. Otherwise, you are setting your reader up for confusion, frustration, or disappointment. And, don\u2019t be the person who lures us to dinner with the hint of someone we can\u2019t wait to meet joining us and then tell us once we get there they aren\u2019t coming. How does this apply to writing? I recently read a submission that began with a prologue about an elderly couple living quietly in Poland in the midst of World War II. In his prologue, the writer did a brilliant job of situating the reader in time and place and creating a beautiful character sketch of an elderly couple living in the country that had, until that point, avoided the war. Within a few short pages, I fell in love with the couple. I wanted to know what was going to happen to them, but the writer did the unthinkable. He killed them off, just as we were getting to know them. While the author attempted to use the prologue to draw the reader in by showing us the level of brutality embraced by the recurring characters, for me, it was unsuccessful. The other characters in those first fifteen pages were stereotypes or too remote. All I could think about as I read the rest of the submission were the old man and his wife lying dead outside their home. I didn\u2019t want to keep reading. For me, the story was over before it got rolling. A Note on Killing Your DarlingsThere are times when killing off your reader\u2019s favorite character works. Serial TV relies heavily on this device. The immensely popular \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d series is a perfect example. George R.R. Martin spends a good bit of time developing a character, and then just when the audience is fully invested and loves the character, Martin kills them off as a transition to the next big idea or season. BUT, he only uses this option when he knows that the audience has become invested in another character that he has developed to take the place of the character he is killing off.  (Kit Harington as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones \u201cWinter is Coming\u201d) For example, no one would have rooted for Jon Snow as much as they did if he wasn\u2019t the last male Stark, and he wouldn\u2019t be the last male Stark if the writer hadn\u2019t beheaded his father in the first season, or killed Rob off during the Red Wedding in season three. Jon Snow\u2019s character was created to embody all the positive traits of the Starks, and to learn from their mistakes. Jon isn\u2019t trusting like Ned, he isn\u2019t vain or arrogant like Rob, nor does he allow women to distract him from his duty. If you are going to kill off an established character, have someone waiting in the wings to pick up the reader\u2019s interest and loyalty.   (Photo by Huy Phan on Unsplash) Rather, think of your opening pages as an intimate dinner party for two or four or maybe six if you are adept at entertaining and can pull it off. You\u2019ve invited these people to your table because they know things we, the reader, need to know, have perspectives we need to understand, and information to impart that ties directly to the inciting incident. Otherwise, they might as well be a chair or a candlestick, not a character. In many of the opening pages we read, either the characters or their motivations are obscure, leaving us wondering what the story is about. That is bad news for writers. If agents and editors don\u2019t know what your story is about by page fifteen, we pass. The job of the first fifteen pages Your first fifteen pages should: Introduce the main characters in the novel. If the story is primarily about the actions or journey of one character, focus on that character in those first pages. You can give us glimpses of other characters but don\u2019t try to introduce everyone in the first few pages if they are not integral to either the inciting incident or to the overall plot.Include unique details and distinguishing traits for each character you introduce to encourage your reader to begin a relationship with the people in your story.Infuse each character introduced in the first fifteen pages with action, dialogue, and purpose. Remember a character is there for one purpose\u200a\u2014\u200ato advance the story. Period. If a character doesn\u2019t advance the story through dialogue or action, they shouldn\u2019t be in your novel.NEED HELP WITH YOUR BOOK? CLICK HERE!

            "answer_text": "As an aspiring writer, I\u2019ve done a lot of trial and error on what does and doesn\u2019t work, and this is what I\u2019ve discovered until now: You can have multiple main characters (MCs), but start with introducing a few and then move on to the rest when they become important later.Always make the MC(s) the first notable character(s) to be introduced. You can have a short prologue that clearly is far in the past or take a few paragraphs of someone giving a presentation, but make sure that the MC is the first one the reader really gets to know.Make the introduction relate to some defining feature of the character. This can be alone (a person with a bad self-image in front of a mirror) or in relation to another character (the interactions of a serious man with a happy-go-lucky colleague).For groups, determine who is important in the short term and who only becomes important later. I had a group of six and I picked three: two opposites, one of which was the POV, and a third who was important in the next chapter. All members were mentioned, but those three were expanded upon more.Make sure the currently important characters stand out it some way from the rest, but you don\u2019t have to make every important character stand out the first time they\u2019re mentioned. Just remember they didn\u2019t stand out last time.Conversely, avoid putting the spotlight on unimportant characters. If you set up a good synergy between the main character and another character, continue to develop that synergy. Especially when introducing a character through a relationship, ensure that both parties are important or the unimportant party is generic.Repetition can be a helpful tool for introducing a character. If the MC notes the presence of a person often enough, the reader will be primed to the big introduction of the character.Always take into account how much the character stood out the last time they were mentioned and how long ago this was. Character who were only mentioned will require a full reintroduction after a chapter, but characters that have had their \u2018big reveal\u2019 might need none or only a few keywords.",
