            "answer_text": "I echo Kevin\u2019s advice. Research, research, research.Identify funders that are interested in what you want to do.This is time consuming but will lead to success. Persist, persist, persist.Successful grants, especially larger ones, take a lot of time, sometimes several years. Grant funding institutions want you to succeed. They want you to achieve worthy goals in their areas of specialization. Much of their criteria for grants and steps they want to see you take are their way of making certain they achieve their goals of serving their community. Many grant providers will meet with you in person before you apply for a grant or spend time with you on the telephone. Always take advantage of these opportunities.  Many funders want to see you apply several times before they will fund you.Many funders want you to apply for a planning grant (or similar) for a smaller amount to establish a track record with you before fully funding your implementation grant. Many funders will fund grants to help you raise funds. They often recommend individuals and organizations that they will fund that specialize in helping you with fundraising.  Make an effort to learn as much as possible about the grant funding institution as possible, what is their mission, what kind of niche are they seeking to fill, what grants have they actually given, what are they looking for from applicants.   In addition to looking at their web site, look at the web sites of projects they have funded and their partners. Research as much as possible about the board members and staff of the granting institution as possible, what is their background, what are their interests. This will help you tailor your application. Some grant funders will make available examples of successful grant applications; these are excellent models to use. Others have very detailed information about applications that are almost as good.  A good place to research example grant \u2018narratives\u2019 (your story) are on crowd funding sites.  Follow instructions! Make every effort to conform to the grant funding institution\u2019s guidelines. Ask questions for clarity. Follow their examples. ",

            "answer_text": "When you sit down to write a grant, you are trying to put your best foot forward, to convince the granting agency that you are more worthy of receiving their money, and will do a better job managing it and delivering programs, than all the other people submitting proposals. You want your application to look and sound professional, and you want it to stand out from the crowd. The most important first step is to make sure that your proposal actually meets the guidelines set forth in the RFP. Carefully targeted grant writing is more effective, and less work, than a scattershot approach. Most grant proposals fall into a fairly standard format, with specific types of information required in each section. Read the Request for Proposals (or other request documents) carefully, and give them exactly what they ask for. the people who review proposals are looking for information that is accurate and quantifiable, except in places where they ask you to explain your program approach, where it is alright to give them some background on the mission and philosophy of your organization. Assume that they know as much about your target population as you do, Don\u2019t try to fudge figures, and use documentation to back up any claims about the efficacy of the program. When they ask for measurable outcomes, they mean measurable. Things that can be quantified and demonstrated. This can be something as simple as doing a set number of dance performances, or as complex as demonstrating long-term, positive behavior change in drug addicts. There will be places where you can emphasize the uniqueness of your program. Make sure you do that in a way that the reviewers can understand, and don\u2019t gloss over it. Use your spell checker. Have someone else proofread the document. This sounds obvious, but you\u2019d be astonished to see how many applicants don\u2019t follow these basic guidelines. Proposal Writing | Topics | GrantSpace has training programs aimed at new grant writers, or people who want to improve their skills. Among other things, they have free webinars on proposal writing, along with lots of other resources that will help people learn the basics. ",
