            "answer_text": "USEFUL TIPS ON FACING THE INTERVIEW BOARD  What is the purpose of interview and the personality test? What are members of the board of interview looking for when they are having a chat with young hopeful? Obviously, they are there to have a close look at the candidate and to whether he would fit himself into the mould in which he offers himself to be cast. They are there to select persons whose breeding and education have endowed them with the physical and mental qualities, that may be needed in good administrator. In the process they have to weed out those who betray personality traits which may come in the way of their being able to fulfil any of the multifarious roles which a public servant may be called upon to fulfil in the welfare state that is India today.  Failing that lead to Rejection Members of the board have before them the record of the candidate's academic achievements and his performance in the written test. Even so, sometimes it so happens that candidates who are very highly qualified and have done exceptionally well in the written test is rejected. How and why does that happens? What is it that puts off the selectors? Before a candidate goes on to find out how to emerge successful, he must be forewarned about factors which may go against him. Selectors will surely pass over a candidate whose responses betray any of the following types of failings:   1. LACK OF TIDINESS: This can be evident from a candidate\u2019s bearings and clothes. A person with a faulty posture, sloppy bearing, ill-fitting clothes is likely to be  rejected even before the interview has commenced because these  things betray laziness which may also include a lack of mental  alertness and inefficiency in general. 2. CYNICAL APPROACH: A candidate whom the buffetings of life have turned into the sort of  person who is always feeling dissatisfied about one thing or the other and constantly grumbling is destined to fail, because such a person,  wherever he or she happens to be, is likely to spread disaffection. 3. A PESSIMISTIC OUTLOOK: In the same class are person who have a negative outlook on  life and are somehow always fearing the worst. The presence of such person in an office can only help to lower the morale of other people working with him and also inject the virus of gloom in the atmosphere. 4. LACK OF SPIRIT OF CO-OPERATION: Some people are born loners. They just cannot fit into a team because they are incapable of taking their place in a team got together for joint effort. They may not be necessarily selfish but they lack the attitude that makes teamwork possible. Such person may also be rejected.  5. THE OVER-CLEVER TYPE: There are some young people who unfortunately for them try to bluff their way through the interview. This betrays scant regard for truth and lack of personal integrity which is looked upon as a very serious failing. Members are seasoned people and are quick to see through such quite. 6. INABILITY TO STAND UPTO CRITICISM: Then there is bad looser. You point out a mistake he has made, and he has a red face. You criticise something he has said and he begins feeling hot under the collar. Such over sensitivity is a sign of immaturity which brings a big minus point in a personality test. 7. INFLUENCE-PEDDLING: This list of failings which can be the undoing of a candidate in a interview and personality test will be in-completed without including the influence-peddler. He is a man who is given to name- dropping and would not let go the slightest opportunity of boasting about his or his dad\u2019s connections. Such a person is looked upon as selfish. He is usually a potential empire-builder who once he is allowed to get in ,may work to build cliques and thus subvert the sense of unity and co-operation among his subordinates. The selectors are particularly wary of that type also.   How they are weeded out?? It is the business of the interview board to weed out person showing the above mentioned or other negative traits. But how does it manage to do that? That brings us to the technique of interview. many candidates mistakenly believe it to be something in the nature of an inquisition where they expect to be subjected to all sorts of questions with their interlocutors keen on catching them on the wrong foot as often as they can.   This is a very much distorted view. The interview is neither an inquisition, nor a cross-examination. It is basically in the nature of a friendly talk which looks more spontaneous but is punctuated with well-direction, questions, designed to bring out the candidates mental attitudes and way for thinking.   The interviewers can hope to unveil the personality of the candidate only when the latter is at ease. A majority of the candidates approach the board with feelings of trepidation and apprehension. In that state of mind, they come with their guard up. As long as a candidate is on edge, members of the board have little chance of piercing the protective shell into which he recedes as soon as he comes face to face with them. Therefore, their first task is to put him at ease to such an extent that he drops his guard and they can see him for the sort of person he actually is. To be able to do that, they have to be reassuring and even friendly to begin with. But their approach may be quite the reverse in the case of a candidate who looks over-confident and puffed up. In such a case they may even resort to some leg-pulling to bring the candidate down to earth from his high perch. From this, it should be evident that the first thing that the board tries to do to is to make the candidate feel and act natural. What the Board looks for ? Members of the board of interview constitute a group of competent, impartial observers particularly qualified to judge the suitability of a candidate for the particular job for which he is being considered. But the aim of the interview is not judge the candidates professional or academic knowledge or competence that is done through other types of tests. Some of the areas which the interview and personality test are meant to explore are:  1. The General impression which the appearance and bearing of the candidate convey. 2. His mental alertness and grasp. 3. His capacity and ability to think clearly. 4. His powers of judgement.  5. His general social outlook. 6. His ability to anticipate and improve.  Attention young hopefuls\u2026. The candidates will find it helpful to keep these things in view:  1. DRESS: You should be neatly dressed. A flashy or flamboyant outfit is as bad as ill-fitting clothes. It is by no means necessarily that you should be dressed in a lounge suit and necktie. The clothes you wear should be neither shabby nor gaudy and they should be suited to the weather. 2. DEPARTMENT: Be natural. Step forward with confidence, look straight in the direction of the chairman, and do not allow your gaze to wander. You may not wear a toothy grin but your face should be lit up with a smile of pleasurable anticipation. 3. TAKING A SEAT: Do not sit down before you are asked to do so. Sit straight with your hands resting in your lap. Do not place your elbows on the table; and do not cross your legs. If you are not offered a chair immediately, wait for a few seconds and then politely seek permission to be seated. 4. LISTENING CAREFULLY: Sit with your ears and eyes open. Do not start formulating your answer in your mind even before the interviewer has finished speaking. Rather than repartee, what will impress the questioner even more will be the respect you show by being attentive. If you have not clearly understood the question, there is no harm in politely asking for it to be repeated, but be careful. Unless you are attentive, you may do it once too often.  5. PRECISION: While appearing in an interview, you must remember that the interviewers are busy people and time is precious to them. Therefore, make your answer precise. But on that account you need to become monosyllabic. Answer the question adequately and in full. If you would like to have some time to give an answer, ask permission of the questioner, and then stick to the point while making an answer.  6. POLITENESS: While answering a question put to you, always be polite. Even if it is a leading question and you differ with the questioner, express your difference of opinion. Instead of saying, \u201dI do not think so, \u201d you might say \u201cWith your permission I would suggest that we look at is in a another way.\u201d Politeness demands that you should speak clearly. When questions are being thrown at you from many sides, ask permission to be allowed to answer each question facing him. Never interrupt a questioner, and unless the interviewer wants to draw you out on a subject, avoid entering into an argument. 7. MANNERS: Be natural and dignified while talking. It is by no means necessary to begin or end everything you say with \u201cSir\u201d. Obsequiousness lowers you in the esteem of the interviewers and provokes an adverse reaction. It is equally bad to be uppish because it is both rude and offensive. Be quick to admit mistakes you might have made and express your thankfulness for any good thing said about you. Never criticize or find fault with a person who is not present except when he is public figure and it is his public conduct which is being discussed. Source : SSB Group on FB ",

            "answer_text": "I got rejected and recommended from the same board. These were my only 2 attempts, therefore,I feel that I have a upper hand in answering this question. SSB Interview #1 -(rejected for NDA -140th course) from 19 SSB Allahabad It was 30th Jan,2018 when i reported to SCE Allahabad for the SSB interview. Somehow,I felt that I lacked confidence. To be very honest, the environment over there was somehow depressing. It was very cold those days, I just didn\u2019t find myself comfortable over there. I did not open myself up completely. Compared to those who got selected,I did not perform much. In the interview, i got puzzled several times. I got nervous in the rapid fire round and could not answer even a single question properly. On the final Day(conference), I even told the interviewer that the food quality needed to be improved upon when I was questioned. Total 32 of us were screened in and 8 got recommended. I was conference out. I couldn\u2019t make it.:(I was very disappointed that I could not clear despite being one colonel\u2019s son. One can give several excuses of not clearing SSB,isn\u2019t it? Look at me, I blamed the system right away! Could you make out?-The weather wasn\u2019t pleasant,the interviewer was harsh,I felt underconfident by looking at others,I was a fresh comer and so on and on\u2026\u2026.. ************************************************* Meanwhile I secured 23,876 rank in JEE mains and got Computer Science in VIT Chennai.The college was good.I had also cleared NDA(I) 2018 NDA Paper. Clearing written was like a piece of cake for me.The only hurdle left was to clear SSB. Anyways,I was not in the mood of giving SSB again. What if I get rejected again? Damn! Clearing SSB in nothing less than solving a mystery.Nobody knows why he/she got rejected. One has to figure out possible reasons to achieve success. I cleared written as I expected earlier and I was again allotted SCE Allahabad.That same bloody stinky city.Duh! My Dad motivated me a lot.He\u2019s an Ex-NDA (86th course) and explained to me that giving a second attempt won\u2019t cause any harm.I took a flight from Chennai to Delhi.Then boarded the train to Allahabad.The railway station was pathetic.The CHM recognized me that day itself and said \u201cTu toh pehle bhi aaya tha na?\u201d. I was tagged as a \u2018repeater\u2019. SSB Interview #2 -(selected for NDA -141st course) from 19 SSB Allahabad I don\u2019t want to be rejected now.Enough of this sadness.Did I come all this way to get rejected?-NO! I wanted to have my revenge.Fuck these assessors,I don't care.Some attitude was also required . This time I was prepared.I worked hard on current affairs(although I wasn\u2019t asked any question regarding it :) )and well versed with lecturette topics.This time I had to some show attitude.Merely keeping quiet wont help.I tried to open up as much as I could to the extent required.The interview went well.The interviewer asked me one interesting question IO- \u201cIs there anything special about you\u201d? Me- \u201cYes,I think out of the box sometimes\u201d IO - \u201cCan you give me any example to justify ?\u201d Me- Sir,I could solve many math questions in class without using tried and tested methods. IO-\u201dGood,We require such boys in NDA\u201d Overall,I would give 10/10 stars to my interview.I did not stammer anywhere,took some time to think before I answered anything.Kept smiling throughout the interview.This was totally opposite to my previous interview where I was completely pissed of!I was nervous and sweating throughout! The IO wasn\u2019t satisfied although he may seem in a pleasant mood.He might be smiling but I could sense it.He still wasn\u2019t convinced.I later come to know about this in the conference. GTO was also good. Little I could understand that he was interested in how I plan and analyse things in the simplest way possible.Help your group members,stay bold and you have made your way through GTO! Remember there is always one misconception in minds of aspirants.They believe that a lot of attention is given to physique.Dont forget,even the muscular guys run away from battle.They need officers who can command!Can you lead 50 men into ambush in just 22 years of age? That's what is checked. How would you command your men? Hitler was short in height yet he conquered Europe! In the conference I was given one situation that I never expected.I was told to get up from my chair and march till the commandant\u2019s desk and pick up one golden structure.The IO gave me nearly 20 second to figure out what\u2019s it made of.Then he told me to go back to the chair. That golden structure was actually a football trophy. IO-\u201dWhat is it made of?\u201d Me-\u201d It's hollow from inside,Sir..It is made of plastic and it has a wooden base.Moreover,it has a golden polish. IO- \u201cVery well,Almost anyone would believe it is a football trophy and so would you.Yes, it indeed is.Now my question to you is to list 10 uses os this object without using it as a trophy.We don\u2019t have much time so you\u2019d have to reply fast! Can you figure out in 2 minutes in such a heated environment?The question was very unexpected and all the officers were sitting in front of me. Me - Sir,we can use it in drawing room.Since it has a golden polish,it gives a royal look. IO-No!my friend,people generally keep trophies and momentos in drawing room.You are ultimately using it as a trophy. This use of yours won't be counted.Start again. I was totally confused..I was unable to reply anything. IO - What happened?We are running out of time my friend.. He was constantly pressurizing me.I knew this was this nasty trick to irritate candidates. IO- Didn't you say that you think out of the box?What happened now? Use your so called 'out of box' thinking in this situation. I didn't want to get embarassed in front of everyone.I took deep breath and thought for a while. Thought deeply,and came up with many ideas. Me- Sir, I can take a knife and chop of this spherical structure from the trophy.Since it is round and made of plasticI can play table tennis with it. IO - Ohkayy, and? Me- When the ball is chopped of, the remainder will be a hollow structure. It resembles like a pot. This pot can be used as a pen stand and a flower-vase. Moreover, I could pour wine in it and drink from it. IO - Good!anything else? I was blank again..Thought again and came up with another use. Me - Sir ,if I don't chop anything and leave the trophy as it is,I can do something.I can take a map and paste it over that spherical structure .It will resemble a globe. IO -Nice! Although you have listed 5 uses, I am still satisfied. If I give you time you can list 10 uses.But Shaurya,didn't you wonder as to why this trophy was kept on commandant's desk?Anyways,Take time and think in home.You may leave now. I left the conference hall quitely. Viewers, can you figure out as to what an ordinary trophy would be doing on commandant's desk?I leave that to you. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I knew I would be recommended because I did not give any chance to the assessors to figure out my weakness.They surely would have double checked as to why are they selecting me as they had rejected me 6 months back.I made friends and we enjoyed our stay throughout (quite contrary to my first attempt).Fuck that miserable city and the weather,it never bothered me. I secured 394 marks in SSB and got AIR#99 in the final merit list.Currently,I am a second termer in NDA. Unfortunately I cannot use Insta or Facebook there, cellphones aren't allowed. I have joined Bravo squadron- \u201cthe squadron of braves\u201d Bravo squadron has got a glorious past and it's counted as one of elite squadrons in the academy. We have earned 47 banners so it has become our tradition to excel in everything. ParamVir Chakra Awardee -Captain GS Salaria(3/1 Gorkha rifles) who sacrificed his life fighting separatists in Elizabeth ville,Congo,Africa back in 1961 was from Bravo. Ashok Chakra Awardee-2nd Lt. Rakesh Singh(22 Grenadiers) was also from Bravo. 1971 war hero -Cmde SK Gupta,(the only naval officer to be awarded MVC till date) was again from bravo. To sum up we have 1 ParamVir Chakra,1 Ashok Chakra, 13 Mahavir Chakras,16 Kirti chakras,18 Shaurya chakras and 22 Sena medals. 25 years ago,my father was also a part of it. So,I have earned the parental claim.Proud to be a 2nd generation officer! Comments will be appreciated! JAI HIND!    ",

            "answer_text": "GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SSB OVERALL TIPS ENGLISH IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE DEFENSE SERVICES & IS IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY FOR SSB, BUT PROFESSIONAL ADVANCEMENT IN ANY FIELD.GOOD GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, GOOD EXPRESSION, A FRIENDLY & HELPFUL NATURE WILL HELP A CANDIDATE GET SELECTED IN SSB & ELSEWHERE.IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE SPEAKING IN ENGLISH, SPEAK FREELY IN HINDI OR HINGLISH. EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IS THE NEED, NOT ENGLISH LANGUAGE. GENERALLY THE PROBLEM IS LACK OF SELF CONFIDENCE INDUCED BY LACK OF FLUENCY IN ENGLISH. GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR SSB APPROACH TO SSB Group behavior starts as soon as you meet others at the SSB Centre.  Candidates assess each other for their competence, as well as sociability. This process is unrelated to the formal assessment, but influences it. Please go for the SSB with the conviction of being selected, without any self doubts. This will positively affect your personality & influence others accordingly. Do not consider others as rivals, who have to be beaten, for you to be selected. Approach with a philosophy:\u201clet us all perform well, & along with others, I should also get selected\u201d. The usual philosophy prevailing in the world, \u201cI should get selected at the expense of others\u201d is unsuited for selection in SSB. Having good general knowledge, expression & a friendly nature positively impacts your social rating by peers, & will positively impact your chances of selection as well. It will have an impact on the tests as well. E.g In the group, before the tests, you start discussing some current affairs topic. Most of the group will have superficial knowledge, based on TV headlines news or news paper headlines. One or two may have deeper analytical knowledge based on their having read editorials on the topic. Naturally these candidates will be more respected by others. 5 DAYS SSB SCHEDULE DAY 1 (REPORTING DAY) As per the call letter, usually the reporting time is in the afternoon& place is Movement Control Office (MCO), located at the Railway Station. You will not find it difficult as there will be many other candidates who will be scheduled to report on the same day, & you are likely to find some of them. For some entries reporting day and Screening day are same, so please follow your call letters for correct information. In such case reporting time is likely to be early morning, like 0700 hours. On reporting day you are given a detailed brief about the tests & instructions & timings for various things. PIQ (Personal Information Questionnaire) forms are to be filled (similar to the one which I get filled). DAY 2. STAGE 1 TESTING OR SCREENING  Screening is the process designed to select potential candidates, from all those who have reported for the particular entry, for Stage 2 of testing, or complete SSB process. It comprises the following: OFFICER\u2019S INTELLIGENCE RATING (OIR) TEST It is similar to the intelligence tests of reasoning (verbal & non-verbal) given in various competitive examinations preparatory books & magazines. Reasoning ability, as well as speed of reasoning is important. It is advisable to practice these to get a good score. SCREENING TEST PICTURE PERCEPTION & DESCRIPTION TEST (PPDT) Requirement It involves two aspects- first is writing a story, & second is a discussion on the story. You will be shown a black & white, hazy picture for 30 secs. You are required to write some particulars in the available box in the answer sheet, which includes No of Characters, their Age, Sex & Mood. You have to identify the main character & build the story around him/her. It is convenient to name the character (helps in discussion stage). You are required to describe what the scene in the picture depicts (what is going on). You have to visualize & write, what led to the present scene (what happened in the past). You have to foresee the future & write it. (What will happen in the future). The entire story has to be written in about 3 mins & submitted. Tips for Story Writing Avoid Pre-prepared Story. Some coached candidates (generally ACC & SCO entries), come with a misconception that the time is too less to make a story & hence come with a pre-prepared story & fit it there. Often the main character in such stories is narrated as a young man who joins the Defence Services & also gets a decoration! There is nothing in the picture to suggest any of these things. There are several such \u201cpositive\u201d coaching academy type stories which can be easily found out by the assessors. Such stories have an adverse impact on the clearance of the Stage 1 by the subject candidate. Stories Displaying Wrong Interpretation of Positive Thinking. Experience shows that quite a few coached candidates are over enthusiastic about \u201cpositive thinking\u201d & display it in an unnatural manner in their stories.  E.g: In an obviously tragic scene such candidates will state that the mood of the main character is positive. Such stories can be easily found out & have an adverse impact on the clearance of the Stage 1 by the subject candidate. Abide Write a natural & realistic story that comes to your mind on seeing the picture. The moods, etc of characters should be stated as observed. POSITIVE THINKING MEANS THAT EVEN IF THE PICTURE SHOWS SOMETHING ADVERSE, OR TRAGIC, THE CANDIDATE FORESEES THAT IN THE FUTURE THINGS WILL BECOME ALL RIGHT, WITH THE MAIN CHARACTER PLAYING A PROACTIVE PART IN THE SAME. THE MAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE PROACTIVE & DO SOMETHING FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE EXISTING SITUATION. Discussion Requirement Candidates are organized in groups of 14-15 for group discussion. Each candidate is required to narrate his story by turn. After everyone has narrated his/her story the group is required to discuss the same & arrive at a consensus story. The group is required to nominate a leader who has to narrate the story on behalf of the entire group. Tips for Discussion: Narrate your story confidently in a clear voice in about one minute.Remain confident about being selected, remain relaxed & do not feel pressurized to force your views on others, in the fear that others will dominate you.Never look at the assessors while narrating the story, or during the discussion.Listen to the speakers attentively.Be polite, give your ideas & views only, & do not argue with others.IN CASE THE ENTIRE GROUP IS SHOUTING, AS HAPPENS IN SOME REPEATER GROUPS, DO NOT TRY TO OUT SHOUT OTHERS, BUT AWAIT YOUR TURN PATIENTLY.Do not try to dominate the discussion by speaking more. The quality of your views is more important than how much you speak.Do not repeat your views.Help the weak members to talk.If the story of the majority of the group is similar to yours, it is easy to contribute to the discussion.In case your story is different from the entire group, it is sensible to change your views & help the group in forming a consensus story, rather than trying to guide the group towards your perspective.  Results of Screening:  After the completion of PPDT, you will get a break of 2-3 hours. Screening results will be declared after it. Selected candidates are allotted with new chest numbers. Rest of the candidates gets their TA and dropped backed to the railway station. DAY 3 STAGE-2 OF TESTING  PSYCHOLOGY TESTS IN SSB Understanding Psychology Tests in SSB Personality assessment conducted in SSBs is based on the science of Psychology. Psychology is not an absolute science, unlike the physical sciences known to us. It implies that there are not always absolute & definite yes, or no answers to problems, or situations. The battery of psychology tests conducted in SSB is based on Projective techniques.   Projective techniques work on the established fact that when we describe ambiguous stimuli, we actually describe ourselves, & reveal our personalities, the conscious part (of which we are well aware) & even the unconscious part (of which we are unaware)! The unconscious part of the brain is assessed by some as being 9/10 th  part & conscious only 1/10 th  part. In Projective techniques, a person is shown ambiguous stimuli (such as words, situations or pictures) and asked to interpret them in some way. Such stimuli allow relative freedom in projecting one\u2019s own interests and feelings into them, reacting in any way that seems appropriate. Projective techniques are believed to be sensitive to unconscious dimensions of personality. Defense mechanisms, latent impulses, and anxieties can be inferred from data gathered from projective techniques by expert psychologists. Assessment by expert psychologists is an art & not a science. Assessment of an individual is done based on the entire written tests & not piece meal, like separate assessment of WAT, TAT & SRT.  Personality of an individual is one whole, the various inputs help to construct it. HOW DOES IT AFFECT CANDIDATES? PLEASE DO NOT WASTE UNNECESSARY TIME TO PRACTICE ALL THESE TESTS. WORK TO GENUINELY IMPROVE YOUR PERSONALITY, LEAVE THE ASSESSMENT TO THE EXPERTS! Following  Psychology tests are  conducted:   Thematic Apperception Test [TAT]   Word Association Test [WAT]   Situation Reaction Test [SRT]   Self Description Test [SD] TAT   You will be shown 11 black & white pictures in which the last picture is a blank slide. Each picture will come just for 30 seconds and then disappear, after that you will get 4 minutes to write the story based on that picture. After 4 mins another picture will come for 30 seconds and same process will be followed till last slide {blank slide}. The tips for TAT are the same as for the story of PPDT. Go prepared with the story for the blank slide. WAT   You will be shown 60 words back to back; each word will remain on the screen for 15secs. In 15secs you are required to write a sentence which comes to your mind first after reading that word. Likewise you have to write 60 sentences continuously without any pause in between. Tips: It is not possible to go prepared with 60 sentences, as some coached candidates try to do & in fact succeed in writing quite a few such sentences. This does not help, because only the spontaneous response is consistent with the personality of the candidate. The psychologist analyses the complete responses to construct a holistic & consistent personality of the individual. Any prepared response will be inconsistent with the complete battery of answers & hence will get ignored.   SRT You will get a booklet with 60 situations written on it. You are required to write your responses based on those 60 situations. Time allotted will be 30 mins. Tips: Answer spontaneously. The main character in the situations should be a leader, who should try to resolve the problems proactively for the betterment of everyone & not wait for things to happen.   SD You are required to write opinion about you from your parents, friends, teachers & yourself, and things which you would like to develop in the future. Time allotted will be 15 mins. Tips: You should go prepared. Write the truth. Opinions of others, as well as yourself about you are basically a brief about your strong & weak points. The strong points should be more than the weak points. In case the reverse is true, it shows that you have not taken enough action to improve yourself, despite being aware of your weaknesses. OVERALL TIPS FOR PSYCHOLOGY TESTS THINK FAST; WRITE FAST, LEGIBLY & IN CORRECT SEQUENCE. IT IS NOT MANDATORY TO COMPLETE EVERYTHING, BUT THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN COMPLETE EVERYTHING DEFINITELY THINKS FASTER & HAS BETTER MENTAL STAMINA THAN THE ONE WHO DOES NOT. DAYS 4 & 5: GTO TESTS GTO tests are a series of outdoor tests, designed to judge your qualities during group performance. Remember most of the tasks in this series are group tasks. You are required to support the group with the best of your abilities and not to compete with them in any manner. SERIES OF TESTS:   GD: Discussion is on two topics, one is a debatable topic from current affairs & the other is on a social issue. Tips: Are same as for PPDT discussion. GPE: GROUP PLANNING EXERCISE It is an important test in the GTO series. A situation is given to you. It is supported by a map. Invariably a group of persons has to go from one place to another, in a limited time & accomplish an important task. In between problems are confronted which need to be resolved, & in case a problem is unimportant & resolution will prevent  you from accomplishing the main task then it has to be ignored, or resolved to the extent that the main task is not jeopardized. A written, individual, solution has to be submitted. The group has to discuss the plan, arrive at a consensus plan, and nominate a leader to narrate the plan. It is a comprehensive test, which brings out the aspects of logical thinking, ability to convince others with your views, accept ideas from others which are better than yours, or are more acceptable to others. Tips: Concentrate to understand the situation well. Submit a comprehensive & well written plan. Be prepared to accept others\u2019 ideas. Do not try to resolve any intermediary problem which will prevent you from accomplishing the main task.   PGT In Progressive Group Task, the group is required to cross some obstacles with the help of supporting materials like rope, plank, wooden log etc. Some rules are required to be followed during this task. It is a full group activity.   HGT Half Group Task is similar to PGT but the number of group members will be half, so you may get more chance to show your potential.    IOT In Individual Obstacles Task, you are required to attempt 10 obstacles individually; each obstacle consists of some points from 1 to 10. Tips: It appears to be mainly a test of speed & strength, but is not so. Plan the sequence of crossing the obstacles with a view to score maximum marks earliest. If you are in doubt about clearing an obstacle attempt it towards the end. In case you have begun to cross an obstacle, then do not leave it in between, as this displays lack of determination & self confidence. COMMAND TASK   You will be a commander in this task, & are required to cross some obstacles with the help of 2-3 subordinates. You can choose 2-3 candidates from your own group whom you think can help you to clear the obstacles. Tips: Choose subordinates based on competence, rather than friendship. In case you are stuck, ask ideas from subordinates. CT is assigned to each candidate based on his abilities. In case your CT is quite difficult, then be happy, your IQ has been well rated. SNAKE RACE/GROUP OBSTACLE RACE   All group members will be competing with other groups. Members will be holding a snake like rope; they are required to cross certain obstacles with the snake. There are certain rules like all other tasks. It is a kind of race among different groups. Tips: Use your abilities to help the group finish the race fastest. INDIVIDUAL LECTURRETE  Each candidate has to speak for 3 mins on a topic selected by him/her out of 3-4 topics. FGT: FINAL GROUP TASK FGT is similar to PGT. Tips for PGT, HGT, CT & FGT: Initially it will be difficult to understand the use of the helping material in crossing obstacles. Do not worry, keep thinking & observing. Ideas utilized in crossing one obstacle will have relevance in others as well.  After PGT you will have better ideas for later tasks. Each task has more than one solution. Please adhere to instructions. PERSONAL INTERVIEW IN THE AFTERNOON OF DAY 4 OR 5 The Interviewing officer has your Personal Information Questionnaire (PIQ) form, which provides him the base for your interview. He starts talking in a relaxed manner to make you feel comfortable. He then asks you a series of questions to which you are expected to answer in the same sequence. He keeps asking small questions in between. He again asks you a series of questions, to be replied as earlier. Tips: Be relaxed & confident of being selected. Write only truth in the PIQ form, without exaggeration. Listen carefully to the questions, without getting excited. Answer the questions in the sequence asked. Have good knowledge about your favorite subjects, sports, hobbies, etc. If you say that you have read a book, or seen a movie, or TV program, then you should know about it well. Be prepared to explain organization of an event from your hobbies, sports or extra -curricular activities, you have been involved in. DAY 6: CONFERENCE IN SSB In the conference each candidate faces all the SSB assessors together. Decision about selection of candidates is taken in the conference by the assessors.  Each case is discussed in detail to take a deliberate decision. AS REGARDS YOU, IT IS JUST A FORMALITY, AS DECISIONS ARE TAKEN BASED ON TESTS CONDUCTED EARLIER & NOT CONFERENCE. Usually questions about food, experience & stay are asked by the Interviewing Officer. Only short answers are warranted.

            "answer_text": "To be very frank, after my last interview at 3 AFSB Gandhinagar, I realised that there is no point in separately preparing for the interview. I had consulted various serving and retired officers, gone through videos and had done my best to prepare for my interview for my first three attempts, but was conferenced out each time. It was then that I realised that there was no fault in my preparation, but I had multiple shortcomings in my personality which were the main hindrance for me to clear SSB. After I was conferenced out with a badly injured lower back (resulting from a fall from the tiger leap) from 3 AFSB, Gandhinagar on 30 November 2018 (which was coincidentally also my birthday), I realised that 'preparing' just for the SSB made me appear very artificial, be it in my psych tests, GTO tasks or interviews. So instead I worked upon my weaknesses. This included slight changes in my lifestyle. For starters, a fixed routine through the weekdays and weekends. Deciding upon constructive hobbies and actually actively practicing them. Dedicating time to personal fitness and finally, getting a job. Other than that, a few problems that I had been constantly questioned upon, which included my low marks in mathematics and dropping a year after graduation, are some of the things I cannot change, so I decided to take them as my faults and use them as life lessons so I don't repeat similar mistakes in future. Now comes the interesting part. I cleared AFCAT again this year and chose 3 AFSB Gandhinagar once again as my board. The SSB was scheduled on 27th May 2019. After getting screened in, my interview was held on 28th of the same month. Now as a repeating candidate, with an experience of three SSBs, there is a general format that is set in our minds on how the interview will proceed and what kind of questions will be asked. The interview started off quite normally, but before I realised, it turned into an informal discussion about how I had underutilized my resources, wasted opportunities and had turned out to be an average Joe. More surprisingly, the medium of conversation was more in hindi than in english, which further bewildered me. Anyways, I was not happy with my performance in my interview. In the end the IO asked me how did I think my interview went, and I confirmed my feelings to him. But I made sure it did not affect my performance in the GTO the next two days. On the final day, during the conference, I was asked just one question: If not air force, then what is my plan? It lasted for only about 30\u201340 odd seconds before I was thank you'd out of the conference room. Once I was comfortably sitting in the testing hall, waiting for the results, I was 100% sure that I was about to repeat history and continue my streak of getting conferenced out. So I was already planning on how to improve my performance in future SSBs including getting a fully functional ballpoint pen, as I was the one unlucky individual who's brand new pen had stopped working in the middle of the psych test, but somehow i managed to finish the test, scratching through the sheets with barely readable words. I also planned to work on my physical fitness as I did only 2 obstacles in the IO of GTO tasks. And finally (and most importantly), attempt the interviews with an open mind since the main reason I was caught off guard was because the format of this interview was very different than the others. Anyways to my utter shock (yes I was shocked\u2026 not happy, not teary-eyed\u2026 totally shaken to the core), I was recommended on 31st May 2019. I was among the 3 candidates recommended and the only candidate who was recommended for the first time (the other two were previously recommended candidates). What did they like about me, I am clueless, I know I still have a long way to go to develop my personality, but yes, one thing I am proud of, is that I was able to portray my real self in the SSB in all the tests and tasks and did not need to lie since I was able to accept my weaknesses and change them to fit the mould of a trainable cadet in the Indian Armed Forces. TL;DR- Don't 'prepare' for SSB. In fact, do not prepare at all. Just answer this question truthfully and with utmost honesty- Am I worthy to become an officer in the Army/Navy/Air Force? If it's a yes, then you are ready, if it's a no, identify the problems, take help from friends, families, etc. Accept them and work upon them. And once you feel you have a positive reply to this question, then you are ready to face any challenge in the world. Good Luck and Jai Hind. ",

            "answer_text": "Literally Subjective Question/Answer. Let\u2032sfirstunderstandSSB: Stands for Services Selection Board. Every Selection Centre have some* SSBs.e.g. for Selection Centre North, Kapurthala: there are two SSB 31 & 32.What they Want:Amount of Good Quality -(minus) Amount of Bad Quality = Chances of Selection.Procedure:Day-I Stage-I (Screening Test):- Large number of candidates report for selection in SSB. All may not have the desirable qualities to be selected for armed forces so there is no point to go through the stage-II tests. Hence, the need to filter out these candidates on the very first day so that they can return to their home stations without wasting time.[Stage -I] The stage-I test has two distinct parts:-Intelligence Test:- This is a simple test of logic / analytical aptitude based on which an intelligence rating ranging from I to V is awarded to the candidates which is based on the number of total correct answers. It is but obvious that the candidate with a higher intelligence rating will benefit in the entire process of testing including stage-II.Picture Perception and Discussion Test:- You were shown a picture on the screen which you were required to perceive correctly. Time was thereafter given to pen down what you perceived by way of number of characters, their age, their mood, etc as also to write a story relating to the pictures. Your perception needs to be correct in order to do well in this test. This was followed by individual story telling and discussion test. Your power of expression, clarity of language (both grammatical and logical), confidence, participation and ability to accept others' ideas were all important facets of this test. Your body language and attitude during the whole test is also of consequence. What you must do is to remain involved with the test throughout.Result:- Passing of stage-I test is a combination of your intelligence rating, individual story content, method at narration, command over language and overall performance in discussion and complete task. Once the results are announced, relevance of your stage-I performance is no longer there except your intelligence rating which still affects your overall results during the stage-II.Day-II Stage-II:-The stage-II tests comprise of three different techniques, namely the psychological tests, group tasks and personal interview. This shall be elaborated separately. However, it is emphasised that in all the three techniques the assessment is of your personality which is based on 15 OLQs (Officer Like Qualities). The highlights of the three different techniques are as follows.[Stage-II] The Psychological Test:- The psychologist does not interact with you nor does he know you by your physical appearance or attributes. He will assess your personality merely through the inputs which you have given him in the answer sheet. It is a test of your mind. Youranswersarerequiredtobenaturalresponsesandnotpreconceived. In case you have tried to think and modify your natural responses you will run out of time and will not be able to complete the tests. Large gaps in your response will make it difficult for him to assess you. An endeavor has to be made to complete all the SRTs(Situation Reation Test), 60 TATs(Thematic Apperception Test) and the 60 WATs(Word Association Test). Any candidate can achieve proficiency in completing these tests through adequate practice. Various books are available which explain the essentials of these tests and may help you in practicing them before you take on the actual test. You cannot change your personality but you can certainly complete the tests in the given time and be in a better position to be assessed well by the psychologist. What is important is you should be positive in thoughts and your application to the test.Day- III & IV Stage-II GTO Test:- Unlike the psychologist, the GTO is actually interacting with you throughout the tests. Each and every action of yours is observed. It is a test of your body and coordination between your body and mind. Your physical and mental qualities get highlighted in these tests. Project your qualities to the GTO and do not remain a passenger. Come out with work sense, ideas and ensure that others accept them. If they are logical and workable they will be acceptable. While you expect others to accept your ideas you should be willing to accept others ideas as well. You need to remain confident and cheerful throughout the tests and learn to comprehend all instructions and ensure that no rules are violated. Your overall performance in all the GTO tasks brings out your personality. You need to be good in every aspect. Outstandingperformanceinsomeandpoorinothersisnotacceptable.You need to introspect and find out shortcomings which you noticed in your performance. You ought to be physically fit to do well here. Focus on your shortcomings and you will surely be able to come up to the required standards.Day II to IV (in between) [Stage-II] Interview:- The interviewing officer discusses by way of questions and answers the opportunities you had in your life and the positive or otherwise benefit you have derived from them. It is a test of your heart. The interviewing officer is fairly senior and experienced in the armed forces. While he interacts with you he discerns whether you have the qualities required to be an army officer. What you have done till date with regard to your academics, competitive exams, your achievements in extra curricular activities, your interests in life, sports you play, your feelings for your parents, friends, teachers and society at large, your general knowledge and awareness and your physical and mental fortitude are all important facets of his assessment. The interviewing officer understands and gives you more than adequate benefit for shortcomings or mistakes which you may have committed, thus, do not try and hide anything. Thetendencyoflyingormakingfalsepretencesisnegativelyviewedandiseasilydiscernable.Day- V [Stage-II] Conference:- The three assessors have individually carried out their assessment. However, there is no discussion as sharing of facts of assessment between them nor any results of your performance is known to them or anybody else at the beginning of the conference. For the final result on the performance of a candidate all the three assessors and all members of the board must interact as also meet the candidate in person. Thus, we have the final board conference. During this, the individual assessments are discussed and a candidate's plus points and weak qualities are deliberated upon in detail. All aspects of a candidate are analysed to see if he / she has the required qualities to be trained to become a good armed forces officer. Whereas benefit of any doubt with an individual assessor is given to a candidate; during the conference benefit of doubt adequately probed normally is given to the organisation. Also, candidates with higher intelligence rating can get an additional credit as compared to those with lower intelligence rating. When the conference terminates the results are finalized and communicated to the candidate. SuitableadvicebyoneoftheassessorsisrenderedtoallNonRecommendedCandidates.Now Answer of Your Question:- For most of the portion your personality is major player. so, you should see some videos regarding the same, but remember to be natural. if you find something of your frequency then incorporate it otherwise let it go.Practice PPDT, SAT, WAT, TAT by surfing material online.See some GTO mocks available on youtube and put yourself there.learn basic interview etiquette & practice with your partner.as far as time is concerned, it varies person to person & ideal period can be 2 months.rememeber you can not be perfect, you are just supposed to perform well so do some practice accordingly.do not think too much about OLQs, as rarely anyone have all those qualities. just go and give SSB. even you will be surprised by your own performance & result.All the Best!

            "answer_text": "Hello!!!! Everyone, my name is Rutam pimplapure. I dwell from Nagpur, Maharashtra (Orange City).I have cleared SSB 3 times.For TES-42(Army) from 17 SSB Banglore  Merit rank-38th NDA-143(Army) from 19 SSB Allahabad  Merit rank-59th NDA-144(Army) from 17 SSB Banglore (Merit awaited)  I am a medical out candidate.I took coaching for SSB interview from AFPA.Currently I'm pursuing B.tech in Mechanical engineering from Government College of engineering, Amravati. #My hobbies and interests are Reading novels, reading newspaper,Playing badminton.#Note.I am writing this so as to put foreward some learnings that I have got through my experience and journey, preparing for SSB interview. This are my learnings that I thought I should share, I hope that this may help you out in your own journey. Even if you are not preparing for SSB you can give it a read and may find something to learn out of it. service selection board (SSB) interviewPractically SSB interview will be termed as a method of selection of officers into defence forces. It is a 5 day long procedure, comprising of stage 1 (screening test)which comprises (officers intelligence test) OIR tests and (picture perception and discussion test) PP&DT Stage 2 consists of 3 techniques on the basis of which the personality of the individual is tested.That are 1.psychology (manasa) 2. Interview (vacha) 3. GTO (Karama)Ending with a conference.Which tests personality on basis of 15 (officers like quality)OLQs mentioned below.  This may be the practical answer that anyone will give through books..What I advice is rather than appearing this SSB as an examination we must consider it as a test of personality.Because it's not an exam for which you will study 2 months and make it.It's the test of personality which you yourself have developed from the birth, your school life, college life. It is all built up Inside you and SSB is where it all is examined by assessors.You may notice I have written words like vacha manasa and karmana.... They all relate,one in SSB is tested all way through what he writes(manasa), what he speaks(vacha), what he performs(karma). Here I will clear that masking anyone's personality and lies will not help.I'll give you an example.If a person who does not run is asked to write how much he can run... He may write 10kmSame person when asked personally, he says 5 km But when he is asked actually to run the truth comes out.For this you need to be truthful to yourself.If you can't then better learn,If you can then better improve,If you are good at it better excel,But never stop.  credits to ig page imawithlove There are certain things that you must do to prepare for SSB interview.1. Knowing yourself(strengths and weakness)2. Developing a positive aspect 3. Having knowledge of current affairs4. Reading 1. knowing yourself \"If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of hundred battles\" Sun Tzu(the art of war) Knowing yourself is the key to perform well in the SSB interview. As I already mentioned that the personality which you have developed from childhood is going to be tested, so you must self introspect yourself, And know the best that you have developed in all these years, something that you have been good at, or your strengths.  credits to ig page indianarmybratIf you know your strengths, you will better be able to portray it in your psychological tests writing it down in self description.Same way, it will help you in the personal interview, the more you know about your strengths the more you can express.Same way you need to know... Where does your weakness lies, where in all those years, you have lacked somewhere. Knowing your weakness you are halfway to the path of improvement. How you are tackling the weakness is the other half..I'll explain with my exampleAfter I got conf. Out from allahbad in my first attempt, I started self introspecting myself, strengths were not hard to find.What was hard to find were the weaknesses?I thought a lot about them, from childhood2 of my weakness were,  I. I didn't play any sport in school, as our school focused more on academics 2. Being the youngest member of family, I was the one with least responsibility and practical knowledge..This are the things which I thought of myself, everyone has some or the other weakness, No one is perfect. Have courage to admit weakness and wisdom to gradually improve over the weakness. For the first, I started playing badminton after my 12th and developed it as a hobby. Also to maintain fitness I workout for \u00bdhour everyday and try running 5 kms in less than 30 minsFor the second, I started helping out In home,  Started taking some responsibility.Similar way you need to find it for yourself and start improving. It will definitely help.How knowing your weakness can help you?Here is a small example, how you can portray your weakness, in order to put it in front of assessors. Small example 1.Saying, \"we lost.\"And saying \"we lost, but we will work hard and surely win next time.\"The truth that they lost exists in both.But how well you are able to articulate it is when you know what you are, that makes all the difference. 2. Developing a positive aspect \"What really separates people who are habitually upbeat and optimistic from those who are consistently miserable is how circumstances of life are interpreted and processed\" - excerpt from \"the monk who sold his Ferrari\" What optimistic means is the person who finds opportunity In everything.This positive aspect about everything is going to help you through the life not just the SSB.As life has its ups and downs, and your reaction to the circumstances decides the course of your life.Where this part will be useful in SSB is the point. this according to me is the best way to improve your performance in psycology test.Instead of looking for a good story to write, or to practice many stories on various pictures. It is better to stay happy in the life we are in. Better one example is the situation we are in right now, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. After lockdown has been implemented. There are many who have reinforced themselves with new skills at home, those who enjoyed the precious time with there family, focusing on small happy moments that gave them boost to face everyday with energy. When you start enjoying small but valueable moments everyday like the early morning chirping of birds or the sunset that looks beautiful in evening, the drizzles of rain..... This are small, but they have a deep impact on our thinking. And what we think, is what we become.  (Butterfly pic is captured by me) Thoughts have immense power, whenever you come accross a situation try to interpret it in a complete and positive way, in daily life practice this. Now coming to the practical part of psychological tests. What mistake I did and understood later in the part of story writting was,The picture is shown to us for 30 seconds And most of us in frenzy start writing down story the moment picture is shown.Whereas the time 30 second is alloted for observation of picture, what you should do is to try and obeserve carefully everything you can inside that rectangular boundry.And then think of a good theme, keeping in mind all details you have observed. It happens many times that we don't get the idea and writing time starts. Instead of panicking keep thinking for a good theme, and don't start writing unless and untill you get a good theme you can build up a story upon. As soon as a theme strikes your mind, give it a breif past, a descriptive action, and a small outcome of action.The most crucial event being striking of thought, this is the moment on which your further story depends.Being happy, thinking optimistic, and enjoying small moments will help you come accross a good theme, cause that is how our mind works. If there is a negative picture, then apply the rule of mathematics negative\u00d7negative= Positive [+] Siti internet a Verona means that if there are elements of anger, voilence in the story, try to weave the story In such manner that this elements are used on negative elements of society, or to wash away evil.We all know voilence is bad, and yet if it is used to drive away the evil elements (terrorists, naxals, dacoits etc) it is considered for a good cause. Never ever try to copy or write a pre conceived story on the image, try to be as original as you can. 'There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow. From struggle comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.'This is how one deals with negative thoughts. 3. having knowledge of current affairs \"The first, the primary, indeed the cardinal attribute of leadership is professional knowledge and professional competence.Professional knowledge and professional competence have to be acquired by hard work and by constant study.\" - Feild Marshal Sam Manekshaw How the current affairs plays a crucial role in SSB interview?Having the knowledge of current affairs, helps us in 3 fold ways, as current affairs will help the person to have abundance of knowledge relating to current situation, geopolitics, national news and various different schemes and agendas of government.As I have mentioned above that it helps in 3 fold ways as if you only have grip over current affairs.It primarily helps you in lecturetteAs you never know which topic may pop out from the card, being prepared for the worst. Is best.Once you have the knowledge, your half task is done. What you need to understand is to try to structure your thoughts and arrange it in a systematic way, so as it becomes easy for you to perform in the lecturette . If you don't have the knowledge, then you will keep beating around the bush waiting for the time to end. Second, same preparation will be enough for you to face the interview.You will not have to do anything different,The current events in the world,National news, international news if you have understanding, you will be able to answer him undettered. This is the power of knowledge.Third, it will help in GD. Similar way in the GD the knowledge will help you putting the point. Those of you have been to SSB and attended one, will understand, most of the candidates talks of there own opinion & a fish market as they call is created.But the moment someone starts quoting facts, figures, numbers or statistics. Everyone stopsAnd listens to it, this is how current affairs plays its role.But how can one aquire such knowledge.The answer lies in the next aspect . 4.Reading habits\"It's not what you will get out of the books that is so enriching \u2014 it is what the books will get out of you that will ultimately change your life.\"-excerpt from \"the monk who sold his Ferrari\" Reading, you would wonder. what we have been doing form childhood, we all know how to read, but not all are able to understand, interpret and apply what is written and that is what makes the difference.If you have a reading habit, be it anything, other than your academic books, may it be novels, any genre will do. Reading blogs, magazines. That is very good habit and must be cherished.Those who don't have a habit, I really urge you to start reading, start with one page, gradually you will improve. After all journey of thousand miles start with a single step. I challange you to start your journey if you haven't yet started it will be hard for now but it will be worth it.  Credits to ig page indianarmybrat To prepare for SSB I will advise making newspaper a ritual. Along with books for preparation of SSB interview like \"ssb interview the complete guide\" by cdr NK Natrajan.It has detailed explanation of many topics that would come handy for improving your knowledge, for GD as well as lecturette.I would like to have your complete attention to what am going to tell next it will definitely help you to improve your reading..Before reading anything, be it newspaper article, a novel, magazine, an event in history, or anything. Think for a while for the purpose of reading.Why are you reading it for and what you expect to learn once you have finished reading.Once you have decided the purpose.And we will here talk about purpose of preparing for the SSB interview.Whatever you are reading, try \"reading it with intent\" to understand it. It means read it in such a way that once your reading is completed, you must be able to summarise the article in one third of its actual length. It is like getting a gist of the article breifly after you have read it.If you are reading newspaper, you must read as if this are the topics that the interviewing officer is going to ask you, i.e focus on details like facts, figures,names of appointments, the acronyms used in the articles and try to remember them. Reading of newspaper also has ways, there is no need to waste time reading useless articles. Whenever reading newspaper we must read editorials and ideas page. Along with national and international news. Always check for the writer, try to read unbiased articles, different opinions and make your own view on the topic or issue, based on all this reading. It would really be helpful. As soon as you are able to implement this, it will add up to your knowledge and will be helpful to you for performing in the SSB as well as the real life too.  Credits to ig page psych.opinion I hope this would have helped you gain some knowledge. You all have it in you!!!!!!!!  I hope that you grab the opportunity with the preparation........ ALL THE BEST!!!!!! JAI HIND!!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is all about your personality .No need to go for coaching if you are a fresher. Just follow these simple tips\u2026 Read a lot  Get a good knowledge of all the things going in the world. You can start with a newspaper. You want to become a GRADE \u2018A\u2019 officer in GOI, you must be aware about the world and your surroundings. Must read about the force you want to join. The more you know, the better your impression will be. Your knowledge is your arsenal, you can not go short of it. Start forming opinions  The SSB is not interested in your knowledge, they are more interested in what do you think? You must have your own opinion. Not the copied ones. Your own, original and practical. Creativity is the key  This will go through out your SSB. Leader is the one who is creative and can change the status quo to make things better. This is the crux of entire SSB. Good fitness  Certainly not this level of fitness. But you have to be fit. It tells a lot about you and your approach towards the service you want to join. You will be running miles with load on your shoulders in academy you can\u2019t let everyone think that this guy is not serious. First impression can make or break your game ladies and gentlemen. Communication Skills  Remember. English is a language and communication is a skill. You can not give leads if you are not good at communicating with others. It is said to be good at English which is a fact but one must be good at expressing his thoughts as well. Practice  Try public speaking, go on YouTube to get knowledge about the entire procedure. One must go prepared before the SSB. GD, lecturette, GPE, WAT, TAT, SRT, SD can easily be mastered with some practice. Reason  Ask yourself. Why do you want to join forces. Just to impress ladies, your parent want you to do so, to earn good money\u2026. why? If you don\u2019t have a genuine answer, probably it is too early to prepare for this dream. ",

            "answer_text": "Please don't giggle in front of the interviewer when he/she asks you you some questions like How many times do you masturbate a week ? What is the size of your dick ? When and how did you loose your virginity ? How long do you last in bed ? Who is your favourite pornstar ? See, there cannot be any right or wrong answer for above questions, these are just to check your presence of mind\u2026 Shocking thing was that my personal interview was conducted by two officers, one male and other female.(usually this doesent happen) Never lie to IO, but you can hide your weaknesses from him/her. Work on your weaknesses. I personally was asked in 2AFSB that was there a moment in your life when you entered a room and found your parents quiet and staring at you. Most Shocking Question Asked During SSB Interview. Do you have girlfriend/boyfriend?What do you like in your girlfriend/boyfriend?Do you have physical relationship with your girlfriend/boyfriend?What was the reason of your breakup with girlfriend/boyfriend?Why don\u2019t you have a girlfriend/boyfriend?Have you ever liked any girl/boy?What do you hate the most in your Father/Mother/Bother/Sister?Do you watch adult movies?Who is your favorite porn star?Why don\u2019t you watch adult movies?Do you smoke/drink?Why do you smoke/drink when you know it is bad for your health?Why don\u2019t you smoke when your friends smoke and drink?What do you hate in your friend?You are not fit for defence, what will you do now?Why didn\u2019t you try for SSB after 12th through NDA?Why are you not working anywhere?How are you surviving without a job?What do you hate about your current job?What do you hate in yourself?Why have you not prepared for SSB?Do you think you have officers like qualities?What do you think the top most qualities an officer should have?Q) Why do you want to join Defense Forces? A) Now you may tell the real reason because definitely a defense aspirant has a solid reason behind joining the defense forces, that reason may be patriotism, love for aero planes, ships, guns, craze for uniform, wish for an adventurous life or any other. Now one thing to be noted here is that boys, except for those giving interview for an entry after 10+2, should not say things like \u2018Sir it was my childhood dream\u2019 or \u2018I always wanted to do this only\u2019, otherwise IO might ask you that dude where were you after class 12th? Q) What if you do not get recommended this time? A) You have to sweetly and simply say that \u2018Sir I\u2019ll try next time again\u2019. Now he may counter you by saying that if you do not make into defense then what? Here you have to show your chipku-pana for defense, you have to say that sir I\u2019ll work very hard and make it, or I have not thought anything as yet except defense. Q) Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?(And for the obvious answer No-Why you do not have) A) Well this is your call guys & girls but if you say yes for this then be ready for a lot of counter questions and more counter questions IO asks regarding your personal life more you are likely to reveal yourself and I believe down the line we are not perfect. So to avoid any mishap simply say NO, if he asks why then you can say that I have not yet felt anything like this for anybody yet. Q) What is your belief of marriage? (Love/Arranged) A) Please don\u2019t act smart (actually foolish) by giving a kiddish reply that \u2018I don\u2019t believe in marriage\u2019 or \u2018I have not yet thought about it\u2019. IO expects you to be grown up at this age (Graduation people) . You can say that you believe in both kinds of marriages but the person you are getting married to should be acceptable to everybody in your family. Hence in case of Love marriage your parents should agree to that guy/girl & in case of arrange marriage you should agree. Q) Do you drink/booze? A) Aha now that\u2019s a catchy one, for boys especially if you are going for UES or anything above college level then IO knows that most of you would have done at least once. So say the truth, if you do then tell that yes sir I have done it once or twice and if you don\u2019t then tell I don\u2019t. For girls, well you can say the truth as well there is no discrimination. Whatever you say be ready for counter questions if you are saying yes or sometimes etc. Saying a NO saves you of unnecessary questions Q) Why did you fail in previous SSB attempt (for repeaters)? A) Tell the truth what you feel, don\u2019t blame the SSB that I did good and they didn\u2019t take me or I don\u2019t know, this gives a negative impression about you. You can say that I was not prepared well Sir in (say a particular thing) like psychological part. You can add up by saying that but Sir I have prepared well this time. Q) Did you do any special preparation for SSB? A) Of course you did! So tell him that yes sir I prepared for SSB from various sources like reading books on current affairs, reading newspapers, taking tips from websites especially dedicated for SSB like SSBCrack. In short you have to make him feel that you have worked very hard for your SSB. Bottom-line: You have to keep in mind that IO sitting in front of you is much more smarter than you perhaps that is why he sitting there. Also IO is fairly senior officer who has got kids of almost of your age, he knows what and how you think! You have got to be cautious about being over friendly with the IO, they are trained to smile and be polite so that you may speak as much as you can. But remember he is not your friend and thus you don\u2019t have to treat him like that, at the end of the day he is responsible whether you make it or not, hence you have to very formal, polite and control your tongue. Hope this helps\u2026 Do not forget to upvote. GOOD LUCK out there\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The important thing to understand before going to SSB is Why you want to join armed forces? I know it sounds very clich\u00e9d, but trust me if u know the answer to this question very well, u will start going into that zone and frame of mind which will help you to take things and tasks given at SSB centre with utmost sincerity. I was conferenced out at the first attempt and managed to get recommended in my second attempt through CDSE entry for Air force. I dont know what exactly worked in my favour this time, but i can tell u what all things i did differently or how i approached differently this time. I had just checked my speed if i am able to do the Psych tests in time, rest i didnt prepare for the Psych or learned some stories or even decided the broad framework like i did during my last time. My responses were natural, i can say very natural even if my response to some questions is showing cowardness from one's point of view but for me it was practical response then I had written that only. I read this time my appointment with a psychologist book during my journey to SSB, it helped me too, to refrain from committing mistakes which everyone will do. You can surely give it a sincere reading.During the description part of self, i was having idea of what to write and i jotted down few points for each para in a very broad manner. I gave it a thought when we were given time of 2 hours to relax after documentation on first day. I gave examples this time to support my arguments which i wrote in self-description.Don't try to stress on i should match the qualities in all the Psych tests, just be natural and calm but yeah sincere regarding the tests, your qualities will naturally be in sync in all the tests. Don't try to be casual, i had written usually the first thing which came to my mind, but i ensured that i am making sense and not writing anything for the sake of writing.I read a lot, so that also helped me with the writing part and you can say language. So you can try reading a lot maybe newspapers. I usually read 2 or 3 newspapers and books, a lot of them. So it helps i know. You can give it a shot.Regarding interviews its better to know all possible answers to the questions which they can ask. Its said interview preparation is best done in the center itself as other people will tell you what is the nature of the questions being asked, but its better to prepare as u might be the first one too.So prepare about basic details about yours. Think critically about every aspect and follow up questions that might occur. Say if u say i like this person as friend, then question why i like him, what is the quality i want to emulate which is in him or her, when that person has shown that quality etc. Go like this for every relation, your brother, mother, sister, father, friend, teacher etc. Your personal part will be taken care of by this exerciseComing down to the other aspect of your interview, you should be again clear very much why i want to join armed forces and that should be reflected in your motivation to join it. Everyone knows what is asked in the interviews if u r serious enough with ur answers and have done the homework right for all possible questions, u will succeed. You just have to talk to yourself more rather going any classes or so. Talk to Yourself more and more.My interviewer admitted himself in the end that he is quite convinced with my motivation to join armed forces.You should be blatantly very honest with every aspect, for example, I mentioned after quitting my last job I am currently unemployed also, so that is also one of the reasons to join it. I mentioned how my gf motivated me to join it. So better be honest, u will have different confidence there.But keep in mind, while being honest, do not make it informal as it is equally a formal interview like other professions, The IO makes you comfortable, but it doesn't mean u start sitting on his lap. Moreover, if u r highly motivated to join it, u won't be automatically doing that stuff.I was physically also in good shape this time, from my previous attempt. So it helped me in IO.During GD and GPE, i was very calm and was having knowledge of the topics thrown to us, so i spoke less but i made sense. Be confident during those times, have a discussion with others, let other people speak also and listen to their points and carry forward the discussions.Another important thing is your rapport with your group. Your group should take you and your goals in life and efforts to clear this seriously. From the second day u will be able to make out who is serious for the goal and who is not. So try that your grp takes u seriously, even if it requires u to act serious act till the time of GTO.Rest enjoy your stay during the SSB, but during the tasks, u shd be damn serious like no one else is there. Remove the fear before going there, and stop thinking at the day 1 itself that whether I will be selected or not. It will hamper ur performance, u will anyways get the feeling if u r getting in or not after 2 or 3 days. So better give 100% to the tasks, and make friends and enjoy with everyone but never lose focus and allow things to get out of sight.In the end, I can say that I was mentally tough and took this as a challenge too after I got conferenced out during my first attempt. I would totally agree with the saying fear is the figment of imagination, and Mental conditioning is the most important thing.So give it a shot with utmost sincerity and try to be honest with urself at all times, following ur duties, time table, tests preparation, staying positive. I hope u will succeed too ASAP.",

            "answer_text": "According to me, you need a lot of introspection before you appear for an SSB interview. You need to thoroughly analyze the 15 OLQs required for the selection. You should be in a position to identify the OLQs in which you lack and you should be willing to work towards imbibing them in you. You should be practicing these OLQs in your day to day life. Having said that, let us now understand the stage wise preparations which you will need to get recommended. Stage 1. Screening: Clearing the screening round is of utmost importance. Solve questions like the ones generally asked in the OIR test. The likes of these questions are easily available on the internet. Websites like indiabix.com may come in handy. Speed and accuracy is the key here. Also, work on your public speaking skills and group interactions. Group discussions are an important aspect of the screening process. If you are intimidated by the atmosphere and the idea of narrating your story in an open forum, then you must follow a simple trick. Stand in front of a mirror and speak on any topic loudly. Hear your own voice and practice the art. I am sure your confidence will definitely improve. Stage 2: Let us divide this in three aspects:a.\tThe Psychology Tests: Here you need to practice writing under time pressure. For TAT, try to write stories in under 4 minutes. Come up with original ideas. Do not mug up the stories you read or listen. Include past (what led to the situation), present (what is the picture showing) and future (what is the outcome / conclusion of the story) aspects of the story. For WAT, try and make short, assertive and factual sentences. This will help you in writing down the sentence in under 15 seconds. For the SRTs make sure that you analyze the situation clearly and then write a short, but complete solution to the problem. Time is against you in this task. For SD, make sure you know yourself really well. In addition to this, you should also know the opinions of your teachers, parents, friends and co-workers / boss about you. You should be able to write about your dreams (where you see yourself in the next 5 years), your weaknesses and your plan of action to overcome it. Remember that SD is the place where you first talk to the officers of the selection board.b.\tThe GTO Tasks: There is not really much to prepare with respect to the GTO tasks. A good level of fitness is a desired. You must be able to comfortably run for 2.5 km without getting tired and do some athletics with a good core and arm strength. This will go a long way in ensuring that you have an injury free selection process. However, it is important to note that fitness is not the sole criteria to get recommended.c.\tThe Personal Interview and Conference: A good awareness about all the recent happenings in India and the world at large will come in handy because then you will be in a position to form your opinions on these issues and talk about them with a sound knowledge. You must also be able to answer technical questions from your field of graduation for which numerous revisions are suggested. All of this preparation will help you in the tasks which you will have to complete during the course of the selection process. Your recommendation depends on it. I hope this helps. May the forces be with you. :) Good Luck !! ",

            "answer_text": "Preparing for SSB is nothing but changing or developing ones personality which best suits to become an armed force officer and develop the qualities which they possess or require to posses. The qualities are popularly known as officer like qaulities (OLQ's) . Let's see how preparation looks like. Answer goes a bit lengthy And I assume that reader has minimum 6 months of time to prepare for SSB from scratch. I will explain in step wise. I recommend all the aspirants to make a preparation journal, something like a note book in which you record every information about SSB . After making this book search about the SSB procedure and various tasks and tests involved. Total SSB marks (900marks) and there distribution.At the time of collecting information you will come across a very popular term called OLQ's. There are 15 OLQ devided into 4 factors which DRDO recommend the candidates should posses to clear the SSB. Understand each qaulities in-depth.For further clarification I recommend all of you to watch AFOSOP videos posted by col. Ganesh babu which are available on YouTube and are the best source for SSB preparation. I never come across such SSB videos because he clears every doubt about ssb and who Explains very briefly that SSB is not a knowledge based selection it is a personality based selection. Another video tutorial I found effective was dr.natarajan\u2019s SSB videos but which cost 2300\u20b9 on Amazon you can buy one if you can afford. He gives a realistic feeling of SSB tasks by actually conducting them in videos.By this time you will have every information about ssb. The next step is to find where you are now and where you want to be, by your performance and self assessment. Remember understanding yourself is the first step to prepare for SSB .Now you have to list out the OLQ in which you are good and OLQ in which you lag. For example the GTO task \u2018lecturette\u2019 reveals the power of expression which involves the good communication skills and content you speaks. now it is your job to find such things in all tasks of SSB.Remember, to recommend in SSB you have to get recommendation by all three assesment techniques which are psychological, interview, and GTO tests hence make sure you prepare eqauly for all of them.Prepare for a small topic every day related to social issues, general knowledge, etc as they want you to have an average knowledge about what's is happening around. Read news paper every day and have your own perspective about every issues. Don't forget to know every thing about the organisation you want to join.Involve in volunteer work in your college . Organize events and participate in every extracurricular activities. Be social and an extravert . Deliver seminars in your college if you get a chance. These will help you to improve your leadership qualities in a easy way.Read self help books to find tools for personality change and apply them in real life. Some books which help you are.Monk who sold his ferrariHow to win friends and influence people.Many lives many masters.Tuesdays with Morrie .Seven habits of highly effective peopleAlchemistThe road less travelled.The art of war by sun Tzu.Leadership wisdom by Robin Sharma .India's wars by Arjun Subramaniam which helps to know the organisation you wanted to join. It is indian military history from 1947 to 1971.These are strictly not the only books. I just mentioned the books which I read and found useful. You can go beyond this list by searching about the type of book you want to read. 10. Prepare your own set of principles to live on and it is nothing but your life style. Never cross them. 11. Be punctual and hit gym to remain fit. Running daily helps to build stamina. Concentrate on your health issues and cure them because SSB medical is eqauly important. 12. Now coming to target oriented approach here are the tips. Prepare your PIQ now only and update it on time base. Download a PIQ form to see what it contains.For OIR which has two booklets series (one verbal and other non verbal ) see following topics and prepare in advance. Refer Agarwal book of verbal and non verbal reasoning. Don't read TAT stories of other sources. TAT stories are meant to be yours so see a random picture in news paper or just convert your surrounding itself as a picture and write a story based on your perspective and rectify the same on time bases. Prepare a blank slide story of your own from your real life cases.Create your own SRT and respond to it honestly first and then rectify it later on time bases.To prepare for WAT train your mind to write observational statements not factual or suggestive as they don't carry any assesment wieghtage.For SD prepare in advance by asking your friends and parents .For GTO lecturette practicing infront of mirror does not help you hence deliver a seminar whenever you get a chance.For PGT,HGT,FGT,CT i suggest you to imagine a different variety of obstacles and then make a solution by using the helping materials. A thorough understanding of cantilever concept will help you through here. Remember here GTO is looking for the candidate who is giving ideas not the candidate who is executing them.For group discussion topics you are required to have a good general knowledge and have your own perspectives about social issues.Improve your langauge skills by talking in English every day now onwards.For interview list out the possible questions you think he would ask and prepare for it in advance and write them in your preparation journal to update them. Remember your interview is driven by your PIQ so be careful . You can decide your own questions. Be honest always.Remember it is never too late to start preparation but i suggest you to have a hard work of 6 months.Always imagine the way you want to project and behave yourself in SSB and inculcate them now itself ..or at least fake it till you make it and then attend SSB because in SSB if you fake you will be caught. \u2026thank you all the best..feel free to comment. ..U..

            "answer_text": "Please don\u2019t rush to grab \u2018The Hindu\u2019 for Current affairs or R.S Agarwal for OIR, instead understand the process first. The best way to understand it is to consider yourself in the role of assessors. ROLE 1: You are the Psychologist reading TAT WAT SRT \u2026 You have already seen thousands of candidates beating the pulp out of the burglars, saving the poor villagers & getting a national award for bravery or Getting back from stranded forest looking the direction of Sun/ Moon.TAT,WAT SRT etc is to see how the normal people react in some real life situations . The last thing they want to see is some superhero stuff or the cliched ideal responses. Think what you actually did the last time, when you saw an accident & what you wrote for the same SRT. Train yourself for closing this gapROLE 2: Interviewing Officer IO already know, marks of an average candidate will be decreasing from school to College level.To make up for this, some candidates will creates clubs & societies out of thin air & gave themselves the role of President or Secretary. IO will make you comfortable with his smile & with open ended questions, he will let your imagination take you to places. Soon you can see yourself organizing festivals or inter college tournaments, Guiding your juniors & becoming darling of teachers. Poor you didn\u2019t knew, Devil was in the Details. After setting up you nicely, he will begin the grilling. With each question you will be pushed to the edge & before long, you could see yourself contradicting with your earlier responses. By now IO knew, he had the candidate & you can figure out his smile saying F*** you. IO tests for genuine candidates who wont get carried away or who will own up for his past life.Its okay if you don\u2019t had any roles or achievements to showcase in the past. Many recommended candidates don\u2019t have.If you feel bad about leaving those two lines in the PIQ blank, then start involving in some activity which you can fill up there- Train yourself for itLast thing one should do is to bluff at the face of IO.ROLE 3: You are the GTO - PGT is going on. From the word go, you see 3,4 guys rushing to get hold of the helping materials.Somebody will take hold of the Load & will never let it go,come what may.The one who couldn\u2019t get anything shouts \u201dLets use the plank to bridge the first structure\u201d without even looking the structure.In the race against each other, none have taken a minute, to look at the obstacle & think about a plan.You could see a third guy climbing onto the structure where already two people are sittingIt is complete chaos & nothing is moving forward.The entire purpose of PGT is to test how well one can work as part of a team and if required lead them. Please note only if required. But candidates,for impressing the GTO with their exceptional problem solving skills or leadership quality, have forgot the basic quality for what they are tested for in Group Tasks. GTO will prefer a candidate, who instead of rushing, will take some time to devise a plan and still be happy to help others, get on the structure and execute their ideas. Those who jumping into the structure will eventually get stuck and you can often see this guy giving his ideas for them to execute. Most of you have heard GTO suggesting \u201cIf somebody have a better idea, let them come forward\u201d for seeing this guy in action. Just think what you have done in your last GTO tasks and train yourself accordingly.SSB is neither Marvel studios nor are they recruiting superheros into Avengers for End war. SSB wants average candidate with humility & willing to Pick up Brass.  #Happy SSB ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is a Test of both your mental faculties and your physicals, it is also beyond it. It wants to test your team work and team spirit, your leadership qualities and your potential for becoming an Officer. You should have the endurance to stretch beyond limits, win willingness of your group and be honest and straight in your dealings with people. Don\u2019t lie,don\u2019t showoff and think before you speak. It is not how much you speak but what you speak. Communication is as important as your thoughts. Some important points to keep in mind,while preparing to face SSB are :- - Talk to someone who has faced SSB recently. He can be immense help in guiding you. To build-up your confidence, you need to know the procedure and method of Interview or what to expect and when. - Go through some books on the subject, to get a feel. It will give you exposure on the types of questions. You don\u2019t have to learn the answers. The answers are either within you. - Coaching can only help you to familiarise with the Tests. I would not personally recommend it. SSB is looking for in you - what you are, not what someone has drilled into you. Coaching sometimes creates a conflict between your real self and the tutored. - Update yourself on General Knowledge and General Awareness of important happenings around the world and the country. - Build up your stamina by regular jogs ( they are not looking for your six packs). - Be truthful in your Interview (don\u2019t waffle or hide ,they will catch you, without you coming to know). - Be positive in your outlook and remember all Group Tasks are to see your team spirit, leadership of a group and decision making. - Remember, the aim of SSB is to find out if you have the qualities to be a good officer or have the potential to develop into one. Some Tips The first Test is a screening test. You have to pass it to get into the main SSB Tests. It is called the Picture Perception & Description Test (PP&DT). Failures, are sent back the same day. PP&DT - In this Test, a picture is shown to you for a few seconds. You have to make a story and write it down. Your story must include what has happened, what is happening and what happened next. Write your own story, in first person, as if you were present there. What you saw and what was your reaction and contribution. The outcome of the story must lead to positive result. It must be your original story and not what you read in a book or was told to you during coaching. Candidates will be distributed into groups. Each candidate will be given 30 sec to describe the story and then the discussion on it. Each batch has to present their story. On passing of this Test, you will go for your documentation and briefing by the staff. Intelligence Test - You will be required to appear in an Intelligence test consists of two question papers. Each set consists of 50 questions. Candidates will be given 30 minutes for answering one question paper set. So overall, you will have to answer 100 questions in one hour duration.  Group Testing Officer (GTO) tests you for your team work, quick decision making and leadership qualities. Interviewing Officer will try and assess you as an individual and find out if there are any conflicts, in what you have projected in other Tests. Thus, the aim of SSB is to look for those qualities in you, which can help you in developing into a good officer. Therefore, if you undergo coaching in an Institute, then let it be restricted up to an exposure of what to expect in SSB. Don\u2019t try to reproduce it in the SSB Tests. It is likely to conflict with your own personality. Be your own self. ",

            "answer_text": "1. It always leaves a good impression if an aspiring officer is aware of what is happening in India and across the globe. You need not be an expert in current affairs. But you must know in detail about 5-6 most important topics going around in newspapers and news channels. So, start reading any of the national English daily newspaper and start watching English news channel. Make it a habit. 2. Try to keep yourself in good physical shape. Again, you need not be marathon runner or a gymnast. You just need to be physically fit. Spend 45 mins daily in playing a sport (football, badminton, tennis, hockey, squash, basketball, volleyball), or go for jogging/swimming, you can also be at the gym or you can do anything else that helps you achieve this. Make it a daily habit. Dance/Zumba classes is also an option that many female candidates have adopted. 3. Turnout is the next aspect. Prepare 2-3 pairs of smart formals for yourself along with a matching tie. Nice black formal shoes as well. Be well groomed (smart haircut, no shabby nails, no beards etc.). It should be clear to everyone at the SSB that you have come prepared and you are giving the right respect to the occasion. Specially during the screening test and during the interview, you must look like an officer. Even your turnout for the group testing must be neat and clean. 4. Buy an SSB guide, download some SSB apps, read SSB blogs (quora answers as well) and talk to people who have already been there. Get a hang of what are you are going to be put through. It helps in mental conditioning. Practice writing as many stories, as many sentences, reactions etc. Try and do it as per time limits. A story in 4 mins, a sentence in 15 secs and a situation reaction in 30 secs. Apps and SSB guide would help here. Write 2 stories, 15 sentences and 15 reactions everyday. Before going for the SSB, you should have written 30 stories, 200 sentences and 200 reactions at the bare minimum. Remember- They are not looking for script writers or authors. It is just to check your thought process. Keep it simple. Don\u2019t try and flatter people with your vocab. Make small and clear sentences. Handwriting plays an important part. Give proper space between words, proper commas and full stops, it must be clear and easily readable. Handwriting reflects on the clarity you have in terms of thought process. It may not be beautiful, but it has to be neat and clean. 5. Think about answers to these 6 basic questions: \u00b7 Why do you want to join Army/Navy/Airforce? \u00b7 What are your strengths and weaknesses? What are you doing to improve on your weaknesses? \u00b7 What would you do if you are not recommended? Why were you not recommended last time (in case applicable)? \u00b7 What is your daily routine? What is your routine on a Sunday/holiday? \u00b7 What are your responsibilities towards your family on a daily basis? \u00b7 What are your hobbies and interests? How do you get time for them? You must know quite a bit about your hobbies and interests. ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is a way of life, its all about us. By meaning \u2018preparation for SSB\u2019, it merely means, how do we utilize all the Officer Like Qualities (OLQs), the moment we utilize those qualities. During my preparation, I had a time of an year for preparation. Here is how I did it, along with some modifications that I learned there too. Start of by waking up at 0430\u20130500 hrs. Go for a run, preferably achieve the standard 2.4km in 10mins. This is not compulsory, but it gives enough confidence to negotiate all obstacles during GTO tasks. In real life, you will have stamina, mental toughness many times more than most others. It will keep you fit, active. You could wear any formals with finesse because of great physique.When you get up, prepare the bed. Wash your clothes on your own. Have a routine of things that you are going to do today.Study your academic syllabus, whichever degree you are pursuing sincerely. Basic Knowledge is checked, and knowledge is always appreciated.Watch news daily in the morning. News that has some national and international importance. Know what is happening in your state too.Wherever you go, or plan, always be on time!Restrict your own social media access, it distracts mind.Family - Family is your team since childhood. Live as a team lives. Be willing to help / assist them whenever possible. Analyze all aspects such as, good times, bad times when they supported, how did you help them how do you spend time wuth with them etc. Remember ever moment, qualities, details of your parents, siblings, if not already know.Friends/Colleagues - Spend quality time with them. Remember every good experiences with them. Help them when they need it. Remember their help when they did. Both is asked at SSBs. Remember past experiences with all. Analyze their qualities according to you. Optimize accordingly for Colleagues.Teachers/ Boss- Have you known about \u201cGuru shishya\u201d culture, you are the shishya, accordingly behave like that with a Guru. Submit things in time. No unfair means in exam, helping other students. Optimize accordingly for Boss.If you are a student, your sincerity will be measured by your marks, study diligently. If you are working, do things, take challenges, achieve standards.Whenever in a problem in real life, solve it yourself. In daily life apply common logic, will come handy in GTO.Whenever talking to someone, talk cheerfully, maintain eye contact and correct posture. Make other person feel good about them. Not senseless praise, just making sure everything is cheerful while in interaction. Practice speaking on any topic, like a lecturer. Will come handy in IO, GD, Lecturettes.Participate in Group activities, be it organizing an event, execution, or any post. Take responsibility and accept the outcomes.If you have multiple tasks, in a problem, prioritize and solve everything.Play games, atleast one indoor, one outdoor. Play team games in full spirit. There is win/lose in game. Just play with spirit. And know everything related to those games. E.g. - Football - weight/dimensions of ball, dimensions of field, clubs, winners, fifa, la liga, India's rank in world, what challenges, favorite player, why favorite, etc, everything. This entire thing is beneficial for GTO & IO.Have some productive hobbies, they are meant to make us feel happy, and skilfully better than yesterday. Again, know everything about it.Observe and question daily life things. Like if you are a mechanical engineer, you have a bike, know what is the engine, what grade oil is used etc.Whatever you do, do it with dedication.Help others whenever possible. Be kind like say thank you to one who opened door for you while visiting the Vodafone store or anything.Remember good times, bad times, how did you behave,what you learnt. Everything related to own personality.Keep an open, free, positive mindset. See good out of every bad situations, solve problems. Have a good mindset. Feed good things to your mind, no negative news, influence or anything. We become what we feed to mind.Have a healthy lifestyle, eat healthy, sleep on time.Practice writing Psychology tests. Many sites online have relevant materials.Before doing anything in life ask yourself - \u201cWhy?\u201d. Very important.Keep a track of your expenses, know how much ypu spend, save on what, where, how etc.I remember just these for now, will add more if I remember.  So you see, not only in SSB, it will make us a great individual in real life too, one who is fit, mentally tought, varieties to talk to, easy to talj to, spend good time, dependable and what not! All the best, keep the josh high! :) ",

            "answer_text": "As per the statistics of last year(2016), there were approximately 5000 candidates who got selected for the SSB interview and to my surprise, there were only 200 who excel the howling success.

After looking at these terrible statistics, one can easily get a clue of the difficulty level of SSB interview and as a matter of fact, there is no such sure shot way to crack it. There are merely 1 in 2000 who get their name in the final merit list. Who are those 1% aspirants? What actually they do? Which kind of strategy actually they follow? Let me tell you. They are just normal fellows but what makes them stand out of the crowd is their strategy. They have enthusiasm to do their best, but at the same time, they know how to tackle failures. And most of all, they are well aware of each and every little step in NDA SSB interview and thus, get the best of success. As i have already said, there is no sure shot way to crack SSB interview but if you know its pattern, then you will surely increase your chances of success. Yes, They follow a particular pattern.

Lets just understand that pattern which should be the very first step of your training for SSB Interview. Introductory Question - to make you feel comfortableOnce you enter in the interview room, interview officer will ask you one of those basic questions which you are asked everywhere from your childhood. Your name, your family, your friends, your place, etc. and all you are expected to do at that moment is to stay original.

Like, if you are a good sportsman then they are expecting you to show good team spirit and sportsman strategies. More than your knowledge, they want to examine your confidence in that field.The moment you understand the pattern of SSB interview, it will become easier to stand the test of time. But, understanding the pattern will be no use until you know how to tackle the interview. However, it should be own strategy, but still i am giving you some tips which you must consider while preparing for SSB interview.  Above are some basic tips. Apart from them, you need to take care of confidence on your abilities, knowledge, and experience, even to appear in the SSB interview. Your confidence is what which matters the most. What you think of yourself is much more important than what others think of yourself. So, never underestimate your strength. Confidence is contagious, spread it with positivity. Along with it, explore your Interpersonal and communication skills, self analyse your skills, goals, accomplishments, achievements, special interests and hobbies which are very much essential to leave a good impact on the interview officer. Make sense of every positive and negative aspect of your personality. Last but the most important. Try to analyse your real motive. I mean, ultimately you want to become an officer. Is not it? So, why not to act like one, right from the very moment. Start inheriting Officer Like Qualities. It will help you a lot in the interview. COMMON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS Pattern of the SSB interview is almost same and so are the questions. The style of asking questions may vary but you must admit the fact, that there are some common questions which are always asked in the SSB interview. Why do you want to join the defence Forces? Why you have only applied for Army? Don\u2019t you like Navy and Air force? Do you have a girlfriend? Tell me your 3 weaknesses and 1 strength? What you do you think about the place you come from? What do you think 3 best qualities of your father? Why should i select you? Who is your best friend and why do you like him? I am not providing you the answers to these questions as i consider it as totally illogical. You should have your own strategy to deal with them. They may have more than one replies but one thing is sure that you have to answer these questions with a positive attitude. When they ask you about weaknesses or something in negative, it is expected to find positivity in that too. Neither, appreciate anything beyond limits nor to keep on criticizing. SSB Schedule  If analyse in depth, whole SSB procedure of 5 days can be categorized in two catgories, Psychology tests and group tasks. # Psychology TestsOfficer Intelligence Rating Test, Thematic Perception Description Test, Picture Perception description Test, Word Association Test, all are there to test your mental ability, intelligence and other aptitudes. Your writing skills and communication skills are also tested in this section. Take care of each and every answer as the level of your mind\u2019s positivity, fertility and optimism will be reflected through this test. Meanwhile, psychology tests is your chance to show your officer like qualities. # Group TasksGroup discussion, Group Planning, Progressive Group Task, Individual Obstacle Task, Group Obstacle Race are included in Group tasks where you have to perform different tasks with the members allotted in your group.

Your team spirit, confidence and mental ability will be check here. Take balanced diet and work on your physical fitness.

            "answer_text": "If you want to prepare SSB for free - I will suggest you to watch AFOSOP video tutorials in YouTube so that you will be able to know what is seen in a candidate.SSB is a test of personality. Total 15 OLQs is seen in a candidate and candidates are tested on these OLQs. Atleast you must be aware of these OLQs.You can purchase some good books like SSB Psychological Testing book by Sir J.B.Mall , and a book on SSB by Commander N.K. Natrajan.Test yourself on these book because there are some example of TAT , WAT , SRT etc but don't learn them.Find the OLQs in which you are lagging behind.Try to improve the OLQ in which you are lagging behind by day to day activities in which these OLQs can be brushed up.Interview is the only part in SSB which you can prepare before SSB. Today most of the candidates are not recommended just because of -Not having good English communication skill.Coached Response.Not having basic awareness . This will also affect you communication part because only if one has good knowledge then only he will be able to communicate well.8. For GT part you must be physically fit and active. Since it is group task so you should be able to adjust well in a group. You should neither be dominant nor be shy. Behave like a normal boy. Active in response and a true gentleman. You can also purchase SSB video tutorials by Commander N.K. Natrajan to have an idea of the activities you have to perform in SSB. One more thing I want to address here that Stage I process is very important in SSB. You have to perform above average to get recommended in stage I . Prepare well for Verbal and Non verbal test. Picture Narration and Discussion is very important because you will be able to take further test then you must be recommended in stage I test and you will stay for 4 further days in SSB. You can improve you personality by - Reading English news paper daily.Doing some sort of physical activity daily.Having good diet.Having good knowledge of current national and international news.Having own perspective and interpretation of current events .Good Sleep.You can also take help from the Officers in Armed forces or Retired Officers. Blogs of Col. DJS Chahal is is also helpful. He writes blogs on olivegreen site. Nehru sir has also written blogs you can find it on Google. After reading so much candidate should be able to retain his spontaneity he should not start memorising all things. Then for sure he will be recommended. Good luck for you coming SSB. ",

            "answer_text": "When I attended my SSB interview (Indian Navy) , the presiding officer (whose name will not be revealed) addressed a gathering of about 60 young men and said something I will never forget:- \"We have no quotas here gentlemen, you are not competing for a given no. of seats, we are looking for a specific set of qualities and abilities, if all of you demonstrate such qualities, we will be happy to take in all of you, on the other hand, if none of you meet the requirements of this profession, none of you will be selected. Its happened before, it will probably happen again. Good luck\"  We had three or four CW (commission worthy) candidates, all of them already serving in the forces, none of them cleared the pre-screening. We had Sainik School types at the height of fitness and confidence, and convent educated guys who probably spoke better English than Richard Attenborough, they did not get selected. At the end of the selection process the original group of  sixty had been whittled down to six. We later came to know that no one had been selected from the two batches preceding us and the one that came after us. Understand this clearly, the Indian Armed Forces are the one of the last truly secular institutions left in this nation of ours.  Work on your communication skills, learn to love taking on responsibility, hard work and delivering results on time, to take charge of any given situation and sharpen your observational and problem solving skills. The SSB looks for individuals who are alert, on their toes, focused and HAPPY about themselves. If you have a weakness, be it physical, or psychological, the SSB will find them, many of the men and women serving on the selection board have been in the Officer Corps since before you or I were born. try to deceive them and you WILL be cut down to size.  The SSB does not care if your father was an admiral or a village grocer, whether you were educated at Mayo or in municipal school, if the qualities outlined above shine in you, you will get through. If they don't, you won't.  Its really that simple. Good luck. ",

Now I don't know how much time you have for preparing but as much time you have , you must use it.  There are a few steps those were taken by me as a SSB candidate .  some stories written by my friends .    Not clear in vision but below one clear.   This is my suggestion for everyone  I joined best coaching ( due to privacy name can't write) so that I could understand the exact means of SSB INTERVIEW .During the fifteen days of coaching I went through a many Group Discussions so that I could get rid of the evil named hesitation and Hypertension.These fifteen days took away me from my introvert nature and made barefaced not rustic.I started the practicing 2\u20133 PPDT and TAT stories least a day and after days I used to write 10\u201312 such stories and used to analyse them.I used to practise 2\u20133 lectures in a day infront of the mirror.I use to go through and still continue THE HINDU newspaper daily and science reporter magazine .I practiced every single day of reading my favourite books like : the vision 2020, the wings of and the time management in loud voice to improve communication skills.These steps encouraged me to get confidential.I have some written PPDT and TAT stories which I want to share with you but unfortunately it is showing error in picture uploading.It is not complete \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026still reaming\u2026\u2026\u2026. I will share with you complete experience of 2 times SSB INTERVIEWs.I appeared for my SSB INTERVIEW for CDS 2/2016 SSB AT AFSB ALLAHABAD on 11 Dec 2016 and I was screen out .I noted down all my mistakes those were like: timbering of voice, not making eye contact, and most important lack of the confidence and many others.Again I took exam of CDS 1/2017 and AFCAT 1/2017 unfortunately I couldn't make CDS but luckily AFCAT.NOW I CHOSE MY AFSB CENTRE AFSB 1 DEHRADUN ON 11 JUNE 2017.I went through all notes and through the same process especially I worked on deficiencies and ESPECIALLY ON COMMUNICATION SKILLS . I watched English movies with English subtitles and help me a lot of.I presented my as gentleman and went through REASONING TEST , PPDT AND GROUP DISCUSSION and I made it then.There was no one whom to share happiness as I was confident to be recommended but unfortunately became conference out.There was a pain in but but smile on face as an recommended flying officer.I appeared to CDS 2/2017 and AFCAT 2/2017 unfortunately could not make CDS But AFCAT.The same centre 1 AFSB ON 05 DEC 2017 AND result was conference out.today on 25 March 2018 was my exam of AFCAT and I am dam sure to make.Let's come to point \u2026if you really love mother and motherland , I would like to say please appear to SSB atleast once .Not forcefully but if like and think whatever I shared with you is useful please leave comments /suggestions.",

            "answer_text": "The Service Selection Board is based on a very effective psychological approach. It is completely scientific and hence requires a candidate to be completely honest to himself. Despite several rumours, there are only two things a candidate needs to work on to get recommended. Be worthy of uniform.Do not fake your behaviours/ answers/actions in the SSB.The second point is self explanatory. You will be putting yourself in jeaopardy if you lie or fake about your personality in the SSB. It will more often than not come back to bite you. How to be worthy of the uniform? I am going to mention a few hobbies ad activities you can pick up 12\u201316 months prior to your SSB. Altering your personality trait takes time and it cannot happen overnight through some coaching centre. Make a list of your strengths and weaknesses. Put it up on your study table and constantly be aware of it. Work on a few of your weaknesses. Accept that no one is perfect and everyone has flaws.Start reading books if you do not. Books change the perception of a mind. Pick up autobiographies, non fiction, war memoirs or anything else you are interested in. Always be reading a book.Pick up a hobby. A hobby defines a man of substance. It can be anything that you are interested in.Start reading the newspaper. A major problem with candidates is that they have never touched a newspaper in their life. A newspaper is still worth it when it comes to current affairs and opinions.Start respecting people around you, do not indulge in name calling, bullying and other activities on grounds of religions, caste or place.Take up more responsibilities at your home.Start playing a sport if you do not or just start running. The idea is to sweat and to keep yourself in shape.Learn about International relations, specially around our subcontinent. It is quite interesting as well.Start valuing your self worth, often candidates have been found to have lack of confidence and yet end up portraying over confidence.Understand that only when all your three aspects, \u201cTalking, Thinking, Doing\u201d are in sync you will be recommended. Of course, you have to be worthy as well.And remember, please do not join coaching classes. It is a waste of your time and money. All of them are interested only in financial gains. ",

            "answer_text": "The most important advice that I would like to give is that although every test is made to appear like a 'competitive examination', it is not necessarily so.  The SSBs are testing you for your 'Officer Like Qualities'.  The main things here are your abilities to obey orders, take independent decisions, explain the logic behind the decisions that you have taken, the confidence with which you 'attack' each problem etc.,   To exaggerate what they (the people in the board) are looking for, I will even say that you don't have to solve all problems that are posed to you but whatever you have solved, should be done in a logical manner.  I don't mean to imply that you can really give up some tests without reason but, giving up something does not mean that you get disqualified.  I was selected by the first AFSB where I appeared for tests (year 1980) and when I went there, I had no idea about what the tests were going to be like.  In the physical tests where I was given a chance to go through those ten obstacles (each having different marks depending on the perceived difficulty level) in a limited time, I chose to go through them in a sequence ignoring what mark each one carried.  While going through \"Tarzon Jump\", I slipped and the skin on my right palm was partially peeled off -- I was bleeding from the side of the palm.  I went through one more obstacle after that.  In the next one which was a wall, I jumped up and caught the top but, could not heave myself up to clear above it.  There was one more obstacle left --- I mean I had totally cleared eight obstacles and two were left.  And, I had some time left still.  I just walked off direct to the GTO and showed him my bleeding hand --- I was directed to the medical assistance room where treatment was given for that injury.  In spite of the fact that I did not complete that portion, I was selected!!!! In short, they are not counting your points for individual tests but, giving you an overall assessment based on the way you go about solving the problem. Even during the interview, please note that they expect you to say \"I don't know sir\" or probably \"I can't do that sir\" at some stage.  None of the situations that they present before you have a single \"standard answer\".  Each individual can give his own view (or, a different solution) for the same problem.  Based on the answer you give, the grilling continues deeper and deeper till you give up or probably, the officer asking the questions is stuck for any further arguments.  Please do not hesitate to say \"I don't know\" when you are really stuck.  At the same time, don't be too quick to come out with that answer because then, you would be projecting yourself as an idiot.  Never try to bluff your way through because if you do that, they will be able to find out from your further answers.  If that happens, you can rest assured that you will NOT be recommended. ",

            "answer_text": "We all know about all those personality development tips and SSB hacks etc. and there are many answers, blogs, YouTube videos and websites dedicated to them. I won\u2019t add another answer about the same things that have already been talked about. Here are some preparations that I think that many candidates do not do but should do (not necessarily in order) : Shave : Sounds obvious but I have seen many candidates appearing for the interview without shaving. It shows your casual approach and means that you are not serious about your interview. Many get screened out because of this. Also, make sure you get a proper hair cut. All those funky fashionable hairstyles are not allowed there.Pack whatever is required : Sounds obvious again but many candidates forget to bring basic things like soap, shaving kit, pen etc. Some candidates even forget to bring important things like GTO dress, shoes, tie etc. Please make sure that you pack everything that you need to pack so that you do not have to depend on others.Prepare documents in advanced : Many candidates face trouble on the first day itself because they do not bring the required documents. When you get your call letter, prepare your documents on that day itself. Make sure you have atleast 5\u20136 copies of each document as well. You can only get recommended if you are allowed to give SSB and you are allowed to give SSB only when your documents are verified.Have some basic knowledge about the armed forces : Sounds obvious again but I have seen many candidates who have no idea about the forces and some don\u2019t even know why they are here. Please do not be that person! Learn about how the defence forces work, learn about the different regiments, divisions etc.Work on your fitness : Though it is not necessary but being in good shape makes you more confident. More confidence means better communication skills. Better communication skills means you perform better in PPDT, GD, Lecturrette and Interview. Not only that, being in good shape makes you look more confident. Your overall body language would be more positive and full of confidence. All this can increase your chances of getting selected. Also, no one likes to have a fat overweight group member in tasks like FGT, PGT, Command task, Group Race etc.Hope this helps. Good Luck for your SSB! ",

            "answer_text": "Hello there, Firstly an introduction about myself:A mechanical engineer graduate from Mumbai. Shortlisted in SSBs after clearing NDA, CDS and AFCAT exams. 6 attempts: 4 Conferenced out, 2 Screened out I\u2019m typing a few key points I had followed while preparing for my SSBs. Self Introspection is the key to get a recommendation. The very reason for you to be toiling hard for 5 days should be more than just love for uniform, aircraft or tankers. Figure out what you are, what have you done in the past and what do you want to become.A solid reason to recommend you to be one among the coveted cadet. It may be because of your family background otherwise your zeal towards armed forces. In short, you should have a story.Mental toughness to endure long hours of testing irrespective of the weather. Day 1 at AFSB starts at 6.00 am and lasts as long as 11.00 pm which is also the most crucial day when they test your psychometry.General awareness of both local and global happenings which will add merit to your points during group discussion and Lecturette. There will be a handsome number of GA questions in PI too.Ability to collectively work as a team in GTO tasks and giving respect to each and every idea from the fellow candidate however absurd might that be. This will test your leadership skills.Not getting carried away by the leniency of the Interviewing Officer in PI as this is their way of getting the slightest mistake you might have done. Just think about his rank and don\u2019t fumble.Finally, your physical strength. This is not essential but which GTO officer hates a well-built cadet.The list goes on but this is what I felt can take you leaps ahead if you sort all of these. Hope my response helped you. Jai Hind.

            "answer_text": "My answer is only to train for SSB. I believe the most part of it is to be aware of what is being assessed. I do not endorse any shortcuts ! (Many have already shared their tips for succeeding SSB, so I skip that part). I really like the framing of question. One can crack SSB only with little training , not my preparing. Before going into the tips for cracking, let me justify the whole process of SSB interview. SSB is definitely one of the toughest selection procedure. For the record, the rejection ration of SSB is even higher than that of Civils exam ! SSB selection procedure is test the \u2018personality\u2019 of the candidate. Personality of a person is primarily because of his \u2018states\u2019 of mind. There are broadly 3 states of mind which the personality reflects. Subconscious state of mind .Semi-subconscious state of mind.Conscious state of mind .All these state of minds gets unfolded in different tasks which are designed in SSB. 1.Subconscious state of mind . What ever and how ever you may try, you can never change this state of mind. Its even good not to ! Psychology tests are primarily to test this aspect of you. There are many who try to prepare WAT, TAT etc etc before hand and write in the SSB. You can (and should) definitely improve your english and writing skills. You should be able to \u2018clearly\u2019 imprint the idea you generate on the paper. But trying to learn \u2018how they have to written\u2019 is a wrong thing to do ! [This is my personal opinion.If you are trying to impersonate and fake your psychology in the test, for the most part you will be spotted and rejected. Even if you make through the selection, for you and the force,both might get effected in a bad way ! This is our country. Lets put our best and showcase \u2018ourselves\u2019. If we are not suitable for the force , let the suitable get selected . If you are really patriotic, join some other form of working service for our country. ] In the description test, just have an idea of what people think of you. Try to cover the most important (which you feel are) first , and then write the rest. Sometimes, you might really find hard to write long paragraphs. So keep practicing of writing. You should be genuine in the entire selection process. What you write in Psychology test might be read by your interviewing officer. Just to see you are genuine or not ! 2. Semi-Subconscious state of mind : Primarily Personal interviews showcase this aspect. You have to be aware of your own life. You have to be clear in what you say. Each and every word of it ! Just go through the editorials of a week before and know the current happenings in the world. your hobbies (which you will mention in OIR) should be really your hobbies ! What I mean is if your hobby is \u2018to play cricket\u2019, know the basics of cricket and the happenings in that. Personal interviews are always the best way to put your personality. You should not think too much on what has been asked. Lets say, if your interviewer asks you \u201cWhich is your favorite color?\u201d Don\u2019t go for a big lecture on the concepts of colors ! Some of you might have read somewhere that humans and some other animals have color conflict. What is red for us is blue for some other animal. Just say the color name ! Semi-subconsciously you will be digging your memory and speaking it out. After some time, the process just goes spontaneously. 3. Conscious State of mind : GTO ! There is nothing to explain here. Group planning demands you to stay in the present. I was very weak in Individual Obstacles. Once my palm even went burnt off ! In the later SSBs, I was very comfortable with this ! I made my hands very strong. Especially palms. When you are attempting the rope obstacles , makes sure that you are holding it too tightly. If you know that your fist is not powerful , here is the tool.

Have a positive attitude and try and develop OFFICER LIKE QUALITIES(OLQs). Your behavioral aspects are reflected in every test that you undergo at the SSB. For Screening stage, you can appear for the Officer\u2019s Intelligence Rating test by having a good logical, reasoning and language skill. Practicing model questions will help you. For the second part, that is the PPDT, practice with sample pictures, and try and improve your imagination. It will also help you in identifying the speed of writing you\u2019d require. For the GD that follows, practice presenting your story in front of the mirror. It will help you overcome the stage fright as well as improve your speaking skills in English. Try and hold mock GDs with your friends. Focus on your manners and conduct, and the way you help in directing the GD including all the members. For the Psychological tests(WAT, TAT, SRT, Self description), the best preparation is observation and practice. Observing your surroundings would help you in deriving very ingenious responses in WAT and SRT. It will show who you are as an individual. Be original. Don\u2019t try to mug up the responses from practice tests and produce it there. For TAT, practice with various pictures, and let your imagination flow free. For WAT, TAT and SRT, try and improve on your responses. It will lead you to getting better at it each time. For Self description, have an idea of who you are, and how you are seen, in perspective of your parents, teachers and friends, besides yourself. For group tasks, for GD and lecturette, follow the practice as stated for the gd in PPDT. Be updated. Read newspapers. For the rest, do exercises to keep you in shape. The aim is to remain calm and collected, and to think logically. When part of the team, always think for the team, not for yourself. For the interview, remember the facts that you presented in the PIQ. Answer to sample questions, listen to your answers and improve on your answers, so that when a similar question pops up for the real one, you know how to answer it. Give a straight answer to questions. Be aware of the details of your family members, your locality, the places you grew up. Never bluff. It will eventually lead to your doom. Besides these, focus on improving yourselves as a responsible citizen of our country. Remember, preparation for SSB is not just meant for the 5 day test that you may undergo. See it as an opportunity to mould yourself into a better version of yourself. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Considering you meant \u201cHow can I prepare for the SSB interview?\u201d You can't 'prepare' for the SSB interview. You can practice. You won't know what the Interviewing Officer might ask. If you have some friends who have received a SSB call letter, then you guys can do mock interviews. Ask basic questions like: \u201cTell me about yourself. Your interests, your hobbies, what fascinates you in life, your source of motivation for joining the Defence Forces.\u201d \u201cTell me about your academic life. Your friends at school, your teachers, whom you like , who motivated you the most, who didn't, your relationship with your teachers, your pranks at school.\u201d \u201cTell me about your social life, your Facebook friends, your girlfriends/ boyfriends, your breakups.\u201d \u201cOkay suppose you face a major problem in your life. Who do you approach first and why?\u201d \u201cIf I ever get the chance to meet your friends, which two qualities would they state about you as your weakness?\u201d Trust me the list is infinitely long. Remember, everything you've done in life must have had an intention and a motive. You need to find out that. For example, You had joined NCC in your school life.You must know why you had joined it. You can say, because you wanted to have a glimpse of a military training. Just make sure you give examples for whatever you say there, like: \u201cSir, I was a very obedient and a sincere boy at school who always obeyed to his teachers.\u201d Prove it now. You can say, \u201cSir, my class teacher made me the class monitor several times in school, and I always did my homework.\u201d (Which reflects the above stated qualities) Don't try to show off by saying something which you never did. Don't crack a filmy dialogue. The Interviewing Officer (IO) might smile at your dialogue, but you won't be able to smile on the Conference Day :) Giving examples to whatever you say would make the statement sound more genuine. The IO won't feel that you are bluffing. Giving examples will actually generate more interest in the IO to hear more from you. That's what you need. Once that happens, Congo! You are selected! If you've played many pranks at school, mention it openly. Don't try to hide any thing from him. He has interviewed thousands of candidates like you. Treat him like a friend, who is elder to you in age. Keep smiling when you answer his questions. Maintain a proper body language while answering. Remember. You will be judged for a single rub you make on the tip of your nose. Be careful.  Maintain eye contact with the IO. This willake you look more focused. Try not using your hands too much. Its fine occasionally. He will try his best to create stress in your mind by sounding rude at times. At that moment he is just checking how you react on facing pressure from someone senior. So you can gather information about what all you have done in life. You must have the basic knowledge of the sports you've played. You are entitled to know some General Knowledge and News. Practice and discuss among your friends. Talk in English as much as possible, among your friends or with your parents. Improve your communication skills and body language. Exercising helps in improving body language, and boosts confidence. Start it today. Relax and all the best! -ASK Image courtesy : Google Images ",

            "answer_text": "Well , here I am trying to give my point of view about each and every test being conducted at the ssb\u2019s based on my experience with 2. I will make it clear that it is just my own point of view, nothing much. I am not trying to be BABA or give guidance. I might be wrong with certain perceptions and corrections are healthily welcomed!! So avoid judging the content from an assessor\u2019s point of view.  Well first thing I made clear was, to be an officer. Be like one. Behave like one. (Not in the sense of being someone else. But a person who Stands up for things)Starting off with the screening process.  OIR : Extremely important. I have heard people saying that OIR isn\u2019t taken into consideration and all. But these marks you score are there on each and every paper which is utilized to judge. Right from PIQ to the main mark sheet\u2019s (being used by Army Boards). All of them carry these marks.  It gives a slight idea of the level of intelligence of candidate. Practice with normal verbal non-verbal books and past questions of CAT paper or RS AGARWAL. Always try to score good in these. Best thing one can do to make it fast is not to waste time on questions you cannot solve instantaneously.  PPDT : Writing : Usually the pictures being shown are hazy(AFSB) . This just brings more versatility in the level of stories being written by a candidate. Chose problems in and around the society and build up something on it. Its just a matter of imagination. The more we relate to the things around us. The easier it becomes to write a story. I see people bringing army officers into the scene and making it complex. I would prefer adhering to a common citizen. Unnecessarily bringing the army in between (when no one in uniform is shown)  and thinking that this might impress the assessor is a myth.Narration : Usually they don\u2019t give that one minute, but when they give us time. They are least bothered in knowing how happy you are after being given the opportunity to speak , your parents name and such typical bullshit (no offense but such formalities just kill ones time and chances). Prefer avoiding hand gestures, shows lack of confidence over words and own speech. Just start with the characters and story thereon. Crisp and clear. Make sure that you are properly conveying my thoughts when made to sit in group of X people. Ample opportunity is provided to narrate and one should make sure you utilize every shit out of it. I never tried to get into the fish market. Believe me. If your story carries sense then you will not have to work much hard to make it the common story of group. Though we couldn\u2019t conclude I was happy that my point of view was considered by the group and was glad that I avoided the fish market( that helps a lot).    Psych : Though being a very deep process I would stick to some basic things I adopted. Practice is the key if you know what type of sentences are to be made. I will not give any examples in this case. One fact we should have in mind while dealing with psych is that ,the person demands our point of view. Just making sentences won\u2019t help. People say that I attempted everything in psych, Without knowing the quality of sentences and responses given. Number will not matter (unless it is below a certain threshold of minimum requirement). Every word given to us is to know our point of view or to say stimulus regarding that. I made sure that what I write expresses what I think about that very matter or subject given to me. In WAT , Including the word doesn\u2019t matter. Write whatever related comes to your mind when you see the word.In TAT ,I adopted the same approach as PPDT. Made a story around a problem and solved it. But I made sure that m not killing anyone or brining unwanted negativity into the pic when it is not even shown. Never award yourselves with anything. Be a selfless man who takes up responsibilities and has a positive outlook. SRT : These people out there give us the most negative situation they could image but I kept in mind that I am not supposed to look at it with even a quite sense of negativity. Every situation given in the booklet points towards a certain OLQ. Well that would be too complex to decode for a normal aspirant. Do not behave like a coward and take up the job to solve the problems. In case of any ambiguous situation, responding in a positive way instead of taking mind to the negative side is a better option. SD : I wrote what came to my mind. But make sure you prepare it before hand. They don\u2019t give much time to sit and think then write.Thanks to the people around me, I am blessed with the best buddies anyone could have had and their exists very less of negativity in my life. A healthy criticism with lots of fun. Yes. Our day to day life impacts a lot on what we write out here in these responses. Instead of trying to give artificial responses. If someone tries  to make their day to day life more productive and surround themselves with aspiring minds. M sure they will end up making a positive impact over the psychologist. So instead of wasting time over memorizing stuff. Make sure your day to day activities are productive. That sounds too philosophical but believe me friends. It aint hard. Channelize your energy and things will fall at the perfect places for you.  GTO :    SELFLESS ATTITUDE  There is a reason we are put into a team. Everything , every way of testing has a reason behind it. I see many people becoming too selfish with their approach and try to dominate the group . I had one thing in mind. Something that I learnt from Band of Brothers. A leader doesn\u2019t lead his troops from the front. He stays behind the troops and pushes the whole troops company forward. Make sure that you don\u2019t have a dominant approach. But also don\u2019t get vanished among the group. Your  presence should be felt with your ideas and not with your physical being. I see people snatching balli and fatta from each other and trying to always stay ahead. It never helps. What helps is that your ideas are pushing the group forward or not. I was lucky that each and every member I had in my group was so good . No one dominated no one contradicted. Remember, contradicting is sensible only when you are speaking facts. When you are speaking ideas, No one is wrong, no one is right. Just the ideas are better.But when you speak, make sure that what you speak is sense and has an impact over the people you are talking to, others are able to understand what is in your mind. That\u2019s it. Even in the GPE . No harm if you  did not conclude. Keep calm in GPE and listen to ideas. Don\u2019t be dominant. Their will be people who will show desperation and domination. Don\u2019t worry. Such chaps help you get noticed. Because they ruin their own chances by such unhealthy habits.  IO (My experience) : Totally personal with a crisp of GK and your Subject concern. Expose yourself only to a certain limit that gives the other person an idea about you. Some get too casual. At times it helps, at times it doesn\u2019t . There is a lot of uncertainty when it comes to exposing yourself . I have very less idea about it. I just made sure that the IO has a good idea about the person I am .  I just made sure I was able to defend certain things like marks and all. Rest I had no grey areas . So Interview went smooth.  My first answer to the IO\u2019 s First question was \u201cDON\u2019T KNOW SIR\u201d. So don\u2019t hesitate the same in case of ambiguity. Don\u2019t opt for bluffing. Rest the Process is totally uncertain. Unexpected heads can stand up after the conference and some expected ones stay behind. Just make sure that each time you leave that place you are better person and an inspired soul who looks ahead for nothing but improvement. There are no hard and fast rules. Just make sure your day to day life is productive and good. Everything will fall at their place.  Always remember. You had make it 80 % when you dreamt of being a soldier.  Rest 20% is sheer hardwork and luck .   make sure you enjoy your stay and make memories.Thanks to my group mates Chandan , Mungee, Atul, Prashant, KP reddy,Pupu, Mithun.  More than anything else I remember the wonderful company of these people I had around. Kudos to the aspirants. You are no normal souls. \u201c Its not about the end , Its about the journey\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I cleared the SSB in my first attempt for the post of Observer (Indian Navy) at 12 SSB. Although I wasn\u2019t expecting to be recommended, I did learn a lot. Be enthusiastic - whether you are recommended or not, the SSB is going to be fun. You will have time to visit the city, make new friends and apply yourself in new and imaginative ways. You will work with a team to reach the end of an obstacle course with nothing but a pole and a rope. You will race against teams and plan against invasions. You will conclude, with your team, the solution to India\u2019s many problems. Add to this adventure the wondeful staff at SSB. All of this surely made me leave my competitive tips and tricks at the gate, and instead I was filled with motivation to get through to the next day of adventure. Enthusiastic and motivated candidates are also the life of the group being selected, which shows naturally in tasks.Be determined - To think up of a solution on your feet is no small task. Many of us fail to do so. However, this is an important quality that is assessed in SSB via group tasks. Try your very best. Work with your team, measure distances with your resources, ask the GTO/ IO again and again, know the strengths of your team members (such as the lightest person can easily cross a crude drawbridge) and use it appropriately. In group discussions, be consistent and add to the group via your ideas. Sometimes, if you do not have anything to add to the group, you may act as a timekeeper by reminding the group the time left, you may encourage the shy ones to speak up, and even conclude the gd if you pay enough attention. Even if you fail to do so, when you go back to your barracks make sure you know what went wrong and what could be done to get a solution. At the end of the day, make sure your presence counted.Identify the good in you - the SSB is a leadership test and many of us are told to act as leaders to crack SSB. Please don\u2019t do so. Simply identify the good qualities in you and apply them IF you have the opportunity to do so. If you do not get an opportunity, then do not show off unnecessarily.Please do note that this is YOU identifying your own qualities. Make it personal and accurate. Don\u2019t say general and common qualities such as : hardworking, sincere etc; Unless of course you can back it up with a personal story and/or do show these qualities in real life.It happens quite often that people wrongly identify some qualities as \u201cgood\u201d. For example, a recommended friend of mine had identified herself to be a good orator. However, she would cut everyone else in any group discussion. Luckily, she noticed her bad habit of cutting down people masquerading as good oratory skills and didn\u2019t do so in the further rounds. This brings me to my next point.Be willing to change - over the course of 5 days you shall adapt to the routine and discipline of the SSB. You shall also learn a lot about yourself. On the conference day the officers expect you to share what you have learnt. A candidate that has learned from his mistakes and has changed for the better has a very good chance of being recommended. One can do so by self analysis.Lastly, be honest. If you are asked a tough question where you feel that lying will be a better way out, just stop and think to yourself for a minute. Ask yourself why you would prefer to lie. Is it the competition? Is it because you failed to do something? When you have the answer, tell the officer the truth as well as the reason above. Leave the rest to the officer to judge. As it is, SSB assessors are trained to spot lies. In fact, it is likely that the assessors know you better than you know yourself.A few funny stories from my ssb: A recommended candidate\u2019s answer to \u201cwhat is your best quality?\u201d was that she could eat lots of chicken in a short timeA candidate\u2019s answer to \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have a girfriend?\u201d was a prompt \u201csir, if you say so I will make one now\u201dThe uncountable times candidates have fallen over (in a tom and jerry kind of way) on obstacle courses.",

I did these things: Deactivated my account from facebook because I noticed that I'm wasting too much time on it so i decided to stop using it.Preparation for psychological testStarted preparing for psychological test. I used to prepare from the practice sessions from youtube and then i checked my answers and do improve myself. This was for TAT, WAT and SRT. For the self description i used to write it one the paper and then again same thing just read it many times to find out mistakes and this also helped me to make my SD original. 3. Preparation for interview: I took my notebook and started writing down every question which I thought IO can ask me. Then after writing the questions I started to think of the appropriate answers. And also practice by sitting in front of mirror to speak confidently. I also practiced for being natural to my answers. 4. Preparation for GTO: For GD I read about current topics from quora and for lecture I practiced on different topics in front of mirror. For other GTO tasks I prepared from youtube by seeing videos for group tasks. To do these things I used to prepare for my interview for about 20 minutes daily and after that I used to prepare for my lecture in front of mirror. And for reading anytime when I'm free amd for psychological test I used to do it in morning. So that's how I practiced. Just prepare properly and give your best\u2026 Success awaits you ;) All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "#1 - Be yourself. And this is all they want from your side.Try to fake something and you are gone. Do what you feel like doing, write what you think, speak as you generally speak. Game can be easily yours.#2 - SSB is never a competition. Don't ever get yourself into competing with fellow aspirants. Don't copy them. Don't bully them. And do not extra ordinarily try to be the leader of all. But be friends with everyone. Work as a team. Even if people are not worthy, don't be like them. Try to come up as a true soldier in physical tasks. You won't be able to do each and everything but the temperament and dedication to try your best must be there. #3 - Go out in the city during the stay. They ask you what did you do in the free time. #4 - In personal interview, be as frank and cheerful as possible. Talk to them as if you are talking to a very good friend. Answer to their questions in details. Just speak out everything. Even about your nasty deeds, if you have done some, but again in a positive way. #5 - About stories in TAT, be logical, and creative. And they don't see beauty of expression. They are not recruiting writers. They want good ideas and action-packed, goal-focussed stories from you. And if, the three officers say the same thing about you, about your OLQs, or they do not find you a fake, in other words, you are almost in. :)  #6 - Cover up some recent and general issues. They would like to know your opinions about things, not mere facts and figures. And as opinions have no measure, just present yours along with proper logic and in a healthy way. May be that's all I have to tell. I loved those 5 days of my life. For any specific query, follow up in comments. Will try and help you. ",

            "answer_text": "The selection process at the SSB requires ordinary people \u2018like you and me\u2019, who, when the need arises, can perform extra-ordinary feats.  Armed forces are the ONLY profession where we lead our men undo death........ We live by chance, love by choice, and kill by profession. Hence, the forces require officers who display unparallel mettle, quick wit, soldierly demeanour, dogged determination and intense social intelligence that clearly sets them apart from their fellow humans. The SSB process is a very dynamic evaluation of your \u201cprojected personality\u201d and \u201cgroup effectiveness.\u201d Hence, the preparation for the same, unlike any other academic exam, requires an ongoing effort. Please go through the under mentioned \u201cTen Commandments\u201d that I have written from my experience. Please try to incorporate these in your day to day life so that you can mould yourself to be the person that the SSB is looking for: 1. Consciously decide to follow a strict daily routine to bring about discipline in your lifestyle. The routine must include physical exercising, grooming & looking after your personal hygiene. Also, ensure that you take out time to improve your awareness level by keeping abreast with the current topics of common interest happening in your sphere. Being well-informed and well-spoken creates a visible halo of confidence around you. Always remember that \u201cknowledge is the clay that truly casts your personality\u201d. 2. Develop a habit of judicious time management so that you can be more productive on a daily basis. You must understand the importance of prioritising your daily schedule, so that the things that, \u201c \u2018must\u2019 be done, \u2018should\u2019 be done and \u2018could\u2019 be done\u201d, in your routine are clearly defined in your mind. 3. Think ahead and have a good foresight to anticipate and prepare yourself appropriately for the forthcoming events rather than getting surprised. This exercise will also help in a major way to reduce stress in your life. 4. Improve your focus by being more observant of whatever is going on around your immediate sphere of activities, some of these interesting activities and experiences can actually become valuable inputs for your psychology tests, like TAT, SRT and SD. 5. Learn to be happy, warm and \u2018live in abundance\u2019 so that you charm others around you. Be sensitive to others and respect their space.Be a lot more interactive and participate in healthy discussion on issues of common interest rather than discussing people. Remember; \u201cSmall minds discuss people, average minds discuss events, great minds discuss ideas and greatest minds act in silence\u201d. 6. Do some creative writing everyday to improve your expression and flow of thoughts. Perhaps you could pen down interesting events or memories from your past or perhaps even start \u2018diary writing\u2019. This exercise will help you improve your flow of thoughts and expression while participating in interactive activities and writing your psychological tests. 7. Identify, short term (up to 5-7 weeks), medium term (6-8 months) and long term (5-7 years) realistic goals for yourself that are within your capacity. Prepare a well thought through action plan and work relentlessly to achieve them. 8. Develop a habit of never leaving anything half-way. Make considered commitments and then ensure you live up to them. 9. Make a conscious effort to interact on a daily basis with your parent, elders and siblings. Learn to live in harmony with your ambient environment, be patient, loving, caring and respectful. The blessings of elders are the foundation on which the very edifice of your life exists. 10. Spare some time daily to introspect upon the day gone by, so that you can strive to continuously improve upon your thoughts and actions so as to become a more accomplished person. The qualities desired of a \u2018potential officer\u2019 by the SSB, called the OLQs, are not some mysterious traits that God has given only to a selected few. These are qualities that every responsible citizen and self respecting human being possesses........you only need to polish some of these latent qualities that are lying dormant in you through conscientious effort by following the above stated \u201cTen Commandments\u201d. Finally, clearing the SSB will just be a by-product of your efforts to improve your overall projected personality. So, realign your basic approach towards preparation for SSB...........believe-me, it is much less complex than what some people have made it to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Greetings Mam. It appears that you have to go to SSB and want to prepare for it. First of all I would like to say that, SSB is the test of one\u2019s personality. You can;t change your personality for this interview. Your real self will ultimately come out in SSB, however you can enhance yourself. Regarding training for SSB, it depends whether you have considerable time left or in a haste, whatever may be your case but there are some things that you can do to prepare for SSB 1.Please visit SSBcrack.com, it\u2019s the best SSB preparation website(I use it too!) 2.Read newspaper daily and be abreast with current affairs( I prefer Hindu and The Indian Express) 3.Purchase a good SSB book and follow the procedure,practice tests like WAT,SRT,TAT etc (Arihant/SSBcrack) 4.Improve your communication skills, speak up in formal occasions, give lectures and if you don\u2019t have that kind of atmosphere just prepare a talk for yourself. 5.Enhance your behavior, try to inculcate the Officer Like Qualities or the OLQ\u2019s. 6. Be proactive and Self Introspect. (It\u2019s easier said than done!) 7. Try to overcome your shortcomings and conquer them slowly. 8.Practice verbal and Non-Verbal Intelligence test.(Required for Stage I in SSB) 9. Improve your body language by any way you find effective and please have a lot of SELF-CONFIDENCE.(That\u2019s the most important virtue) 10. In the end the most important point for SSB. Never ever Lie in SSB, so start to extract that from your life from now onward so that by the time you give SSB you don\u2019t say anything but the Truth. Having said all that, I myself am appearing for SSB for the first time in a few months.(NDA II 2016) I hope it helps. JAI HIND. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok, I would suggest you a few of the tips which I followed for 1 month before my SSB. 1- Followed a disciplined life 2- Used to run 2.4km everyday in the evening. 3-Watched motivational videos with insightful thoughts. 4-Was regular to a few of the self help books. Robin Sharma and Shiv Khera were my favourite then. 5-Used to communicate with people with the same level of motivation. In my case it was my uncle who was equally enthusiastic about me attending the interview. 6-Practiced regularly about my interview and Screening test. 7 Used to think positively about everything. 8- Watched Times Now programme Newshour by Arnab, but today I would suggest you to watch BBC or CNN. Refrain from watching any populist news channel. 9-was regular to 3 news papers. THE HINDU, HINDUSTAN TIMES, DELHI TIMES. Skip political or biased perspectives. I never read about Modi or Rahul Gandhi, the two hotshots then. Refrained from talking about any individual, but the underlying reason and cause of the issues. 10- Dreamt, Talked and Spoke as if I was going to clinch the moon. And I did that.  This is me in Allahabad PVR during the interview. So, I enjoyed a lot during the interview as well. I was recommended, featuring in the merit list at 214th rank. ",

            "answer_text": "1 KNOW SSB\u2019S TESTS AND PROCEDURES INSIDE OUT Try to learn more about the procedures that you\u2019ll face once you reach there. There will be a series of tests conducted across several days. Make sure that you get proper knowledge about the time-table. Learn more details about the various tests you\u2019ll face. Initially, there will be a screening test. Those who manage to clear the screening test and group discussion round are then supposed to stay at the SSB centre for the next 5-6 days. Over these 5-6 days, various tests and interviews will be conducted by the board. Personal Interview is also held during this phase. Apart from PI, some other tests are also held. Some of those tests are- SRT, WAT, Progressive Group Task, Final Group Task, Command Task, Physical Testand Conference round. These tests will come one after another from the second day onward. Though the CHM will inform you about the timing and dates regarding these tests, it is always better to do one\u2019s homework and be prepared to face them anytime! Know what tests like WAT (Word Association Test), SRT (Situation Reaction Test) etc are all about. Know when you\u2019ll face such tests, what these tests are all about etc. This is the most important tip. 2 AFTER FOLLOWING TIP NO 1, DO GOOD PRACTICE AND FORM TEST-WISE PREPARATION HABITS Okay, I hope that you\u2019ll follow tip 1 religiously. After doing that, make sure that you go on a quality \u2018practice session\u2019. Knowing these tests closer is key part, but practicing them is even more better. Study materials are available in abundance. You may go for \u2018coaching classes\u2019, buy CDS and NDA preparation books or get study material online! Whatever source you choose, make sure that you practice well. It is very important to prepare for each test/stage involved in the SSB Interview. Each test has its own unique nature. Forming test-wise preparation habits will definitely be of help. SRT, WAT and similar written tests can be dealt with by practicing from study material available in the market. Going through question sets will help you get a grip, when it comes to such tests. But it is difficult to prepare for Group Tasks, PI, Physical Test round and Conference round merely by referring books and study material. When it comes to Group Task, one must have confidence, clear thinking, analytical skills, decision making skills and good communication skills to perform well! Developing those traits will definitely help one out! Being physically fit and agile will help during the Physical test stage. There\u2019s a set of fixed obstacles, when it comes to this round. Having knowledge about these obstacles and training keeping them in mind will help you during the actual test. Time saving tactics can be used during this stage and bonus marks can be obtained by one! PI is a tricky affair. One must be very confident, prepared and honest, when it comes to this stage. Adequate importance must be given to dressing and appearance, sitting posture, physical gestures and eye contact. Don\u2019t get too nervous, try to stay calm and answer the interviewer\u2019s questions honestly. Keep answers to the point. Honesty is the best policy. Filling up the PIQ form honestly and correctly will ensure that you won\u2019t face \u2018tricky situations\u2019 during the interview. During the PI, interviewer will look for key traits like OLQs, confidence, decision making skills, analytic skills, general awareness and aptitude. 3 DON\u2019T IGNORE CURRENT AFFAIRS This is what many candidates ignore. They\u2019ll practice for all those tests, but leave behind Current Affairs. Having good general awareness and knowledge of current affairs is an added advantage! Many times, during the personal interview stage, questions related to current affairs will be posed by the interviewer. Make sure that you go through NEWS Papers, NEWS headlines etc daily. Also referring magazines like Pratiyogita Darpanand sites like Jagran Josh will help you. 4 SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD HAVE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT- All SSB interviews emphasize on some common topics. These common topics are- India, Indian Politics, History of India, India and its current affairs, Armed Forces in Indiaetc. Questions about these topics are almost always asked during personal interviews, group discussion etc. Make sure that you read and study these topics extensively. Preparing and keeping your own \u2018notes\u2019 will help. With the use of internet, you may get all the necessary knowledge for free! 5 BRUSH UP YOUR TECHNICAL/ ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE Doing so will come handy during the personal interview. Many times, interviewers go for such technical questions. If you are a 12th standardpassed/appearing student, the interviewer may ask questions related to your studies. For example, I was asked this question- \u2018What is Bernoulli\u2019s equation?\u2019. If you are an engineering graduate, then prepare for similar questions related to your branch. So, brushing up your knowledge is essential. 6 KNOW YOUR NATIVE STATE/TOWN BETTER Having good, detailed knowledge about your home state or town is good. Questions related to them are often asked during personal interview. Before the personal interview, candidates are asked to fill a PIQ (Personal Information Questionnaire). Details like state, town etc of the candidate must be filled. So, it is obvious that the interviewer will pose some questions related to them. Collect information related to current affairs, historical significance, population, language, governmental organizations, notable personalities etc of your state/town. 7 BE AWARE OF THE TOUGH CLIMATE; PRACTICE TIME MANAGEMENT ACCORDINGLY Usually, the interviews are held at time, when the climate is extreme. For example, consider the SSB interview held at Allahabad in January. At that time, the place would be too cold. It is essential to know the climatic conditions early on and practice accordingly. In January cold, at Allahabad, you won\u2019t be able to write fast because of \u2018cold and frozen\u2019 hands!  And let me remind you that \u2018writing fast\u2019 is necessary to do well in tests like WAT, TAT, SRT etc. So, writing practice, keeping the climate in mind often helps. Take time to form some \u2018time management\u2019 strategies. 8 BE HONEST, SIMPLE AND \u2018BE YOURSELF\u2019 Having these traits will help you greatly during personal interview and the whole SSB thing. Be honest while filling out PIQ form. Don\u2019t brag about things you never did! Bragging and lying will come back to haunt you during interview! Don\u2019t try to act smart. Be your normal self. Acting like somebody else will do more harm than good. 9 CULTIVATE CONFIDENCE, IMPROVE ORATORY SKILLS This is something you definitely should do. Building confidence will certainly help you perform well in personal interview, group discussion, group task etc. Having good oratory skills will also help during group discussion, group task etc. Invest some time daily cultivating these qualities in yourself. You\u2019ll be amazed by the return it\u2019ll give! 10 MAINTAIN GOOD PHYSICAL FITNESS Okay, let\u2019s not ignore this aspect. There is a whole \u2018obstacles round\u2019, where your physical prowess will be put to test! So, maintain a basic level of fitness and physique. Exercise regularly, eat well, eat good food. The obstacle course is a real \u2018bonus round\u2019. You can score high score if you\u2019re in good shape and have good fitness level. These are the top 10 tips that I wanted to share with you guys. I believe that religiously practicing and implementing these tips will help you crack SSB interview! While you appear for it, treat others like your friends, enjoy your stay there and give it your best shot! You\u2019ll learn a lotduring your stay there. ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is a test of personality and so no amount of cramming answer for psychology test or copying someone else personality is going to help you. You need to build your own personality and personality is developed by bringing changes in your day to day life. The most important thing to clear SSB is to know yourself inside out. Strengths, weakness, likes, dislikes, everything there is about you! Being yourself is important. Trying to show-off or giving false details when asked is not at all appreciated. The officers are experienced assessors and know the difference between a genuine gentleman and a show-off. Bluffing or giving vague replies is a big NO! I would also suggest knowing the testing procedure and what the tests are designed to check. Also a sound knowledge of the organisation is required (Army, Navy, or Air Force). Also pick up a sport (preferably a team one) to build co-ordination and team spirit in you and get healthy at the same time. Now coming to Your Question I will advice you to focus on your Fitness, English, General Awareness and most importantly become a doer, observer and a social person in addition to it do following things. Fitness: Make yourself physically very fit. Run as much as you can and also join gym if you have time and money for it.English:Speak to yourself in English, Speak with your friend in English and watch English news channelsWrite diary on daily basis to remove spelling mistakes and to propel your observing skillsLogical Reasoning: Practice logical reasoning from books.News Paper: Read newspaper on daily basis.GK: Have good knowledge about India and India\u2019s relations with neighboring countries and major world powers.Sports: Participate in sports as much as you can to a level that you are able to represent school/college team in at least one sport.Extra-curricular Activities: Actively participate in extra-curricular activities and organizing events in school/college.Main Subjects : Have sufficient knowledge of your main subjects that you have studied till now.At last become a good human being and help others as much as you can.Thanks for reading.

            "answer_text": "hello there, It very important for a candidate that they should know a) The basic procedure of how SSB is conducted. b) what to write in TAT pictures, WAT words,SRT situations and SD. c)What should they answer in personal interview, about themselves ,there weakness , strength etc. Example: If the story you writing in TAT test doesnt have any theme or problem or an effective solution and these same traits is not getting reflected in each 12 TAT pictures then it shows lack of creativity, it shows that candidate do not have any aim etc etc. These are just brief overview i am giving. In personal interview, candidate trying to show themselves as a sportsperson but they havent played a single game in their school or college time , then this shows that candidate is hiding and not loyal. This is just 1 example. Normally interview conducts for 40\u201345 min and which is enough for a fairly experienced officer to know that where candidate is lying or hiding. Thats why, it becomes very important for a candidate to prepare well before appearing for the SSB. Now, SSB preparation is not 1 day process or you will be ready by just reading any book. Its a testing of candidate personality, thought,speech etc. These things are psychological traits which only comes when candidate changes their daily routines accordingly. Many candidates are appearing for 15 or more attempts and still not able to make it. why? Because they are making a wrong self assessment of themselves.So, it becomes very important for a candidate to take guidance from an expert. We prepare candidate for psychological test + personal interview.(GTO optional) Candidate do not have to go anywhere,do not have to pay huge money. All assessment and preparing candidate for SSB will be done by Col Pradeep Walia(Ex Interviewing Officer, Bangalore). Fees is 1/10 th of what candidate pay to coaching institutes and is totally refundable if after whole process ,candidate is not satisfied. we prepare you psychologically ,not by theory. for more information , you can contact us at +918112285826.

            "answer_text": "SSB has certain aspects that is in control of individual and some in control of the selection board. Training is a big word to use, i would rather settle for preparing!! If you aim for the academies you must be given your 100% for your name to be in the merit list. But for your name to come in merit list you must score very good at SSB. This is also not just enough, medicals is a big uncertainty and need to be cleared. height and weight check.No Flat feet.Others..For all this to happen, you must get recommended!!! And you get recommended by SSB board based on your PSYCh test, GTO tasks and interview. have clear state of mind and be calm at all timesInterview officer will be very friendly , so just answer to point and don\u2019t play around. What questions were you asked during your SSB interview?PIQ form is most difficult to fill; I would suggest to review all your achievements, extra/co-curricular activities,positions of responsibility.Self description; Know about yourself from the point of view of parents/friends/teachers.Try seeing GTO tasks on YouTube which will give you some idea.Prepare for lecturette - speak slow, confidence, good content , lucid and must appeal .Everyone gives suggestions before interview , just do what you want & don\u2019t mind them.Go around the city after testing periodCURRENT AFFAIRS IS IMPORTANT Current Affairs - Target SSB InterviewStill Screening in is a issue; candidates can do their best and hope ! You will surely see some names totally unexpected to be screened in. follow website for Picture perceptionTech Mahindra pictures perception story writing with answers | Q4Interview.com Do a lot of non verbal and verbal tests\u2014 remember you need to score good in intelligence tests.Narration: You need to narrate your story. Keep it simple, clear and show some liveliness in your narration. tips ; Take a topic and practice in front of mirror or just record your narration in mobile or practice with friendsGroup Discussion : This is usually fish market for repeaters!Just try getting involved and produce two valuable points to the discussion.Listen carefully at everyone's story- it will later help you in supporting and contradicting thoughts.Never look towards the officers during GD and maintain eye contact with other candidates.In the end it\u2019s just a test of personality. All the Best!! ",

Accept your mistakes committed in your teen age.Look straight and keep eye contact with all the Board members. Don't look down. Be simple and genuine. They want to know the real you.Hope it helps. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is something which test you holistically. There are some traits which are important to keep in mind. SSB is very different from all other selection procedures as they select one among 100 in SSB though different tests. Few important things which they test are Confidence ( at all levels , GTO through tasks, Psychologists through SRT n WAT, Interview through Qs.Courage ( Physical n mental)Positive attitude for weaker section ( Required to deal with subordinates in service as an officer)Quick decisions through different tests.Capability to work under pressureThese are the things which are tested through all tests and must be recommended by all three assessors for recommendation to be cleared. Any doubt in any trait is tested/confirmed in conference through various Qs. Now about your Q on how to prepare on daily basis\u2026 Devote your time on developing of these qualities rather than giving individual focus on IO, GTO or Psy\u2026. Prepare your PIQ and get it evaluated from someone as this will be the base for your interview . For ex if you write football as your hobby \u2026..he may ask you why India is not in top 50 teams of world\u2026like that.For every Ground Testing \u2026.. certain OLQs are tested in each test \u2026.prepare at least 3 or 4 OLQ for each tasks and you should show these in each test\u2026most Imp, GTO should notice you\u2026For almost all Psych tests this is not mandatory to complete all papers ..for ex if 60 words are given in WAT\u2026its important to write positive sentences rather than focusing on completing max Qs. If you attempt only 40 with better ans ,you will go through \u2026.You should learn art of persuasion ,,, it is very important \u2026.. you must thank each individual in front of assessor and thank assessor too after each test\u2026..you should use your communication skills to make good friends at SSB which helps in various tasks indirectly \u2026.You should praise defence forces for whatever reason \u2026as you are going to join the same \u2026.it must be felt by all assessors that you are dedicated to join the same \u2026I remember one candidate who was also outstanding but he gave civil services preference over defence in interview n conference \u2026obviously he was not selected due to lack of interest towards defence.All the best \u2026\u2026 Enjoy you training ( The most imp part of service career.) u can mail me specific queries if any on amanchoudhary005@gmail.com ",

            "answer_text": "I got recommended from 12 SSB Bangalore for Indian Navy, to crack SSB you need to prepare yourself mentally and physically. All SSB's look for officer like qualities (OLQ) in an individual, and if the candidate displays them to SSB he's through. The OLQs are Effective Intelligence.Reasoning Ability.Power of Expression.Self Confidence.Determination.Organizing Ability.Initiative.Courage.Cooperation.Sense of Responsibility.Stamina.Group Influencing Ability.Liveliness.Social Adaptability.Speed of DecisionApart from these, they also check if you are up to date about the current affairs of India and the world. At times during interview they also check your presence of mind Eg- My friend got recommended for army, for him during the interview they asked, \u201cHow can you prove to me that this room is the shape of a square without measuring it\u201d for this he answered by saying \u201c Tiles in this room are square, so if the no of tiles in this room fit exactly we can say that room is the shape of square\u201d and he got recommended. So these are some things which you need to keep in mind if you want to clear SSB. ",

            "answer_text": "I feel that the asking person wants to join the armed forces, my brief answer will certainly help. After 7 attempts, I was recommended. My strategy was this, There are 15 olq's, one can find it in internet. And the details of SSB are also available there, so get the sample TAT, SAT, WAT's, and answer them accordingly. PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW OTHERS ANSWER S. Get a sample piq paper too. Fill it. Now, think about the psychology paper, you might have done something which is not expected from a cadet (provided wrong/ bad response). Correct them. If you are satisfied, follow those answers in everyday life. Suppose, you see a beggar in the station and he/she is famished, very cold have literally nothing to wear against the cold. You wrote in the SRT that, you give him some clothes you have, some food and money ( this is what I did). Follow that in real life. You will see, that all your SRT, WAT, TAT will go well. Even you don't have to mug the answer for interview or psych test. You attitude towards life will improve which will be reflected in the selection process. Don't give an excuse. Give priority to proper tasking so you don't have to regret in future. Once an officer said to me, that forces want cadets having a good balance between heart, guts and intelligence\u2026 follow that. Always have a good reason, why to join army/navy/air force. You need proper enthusiasm for that. Follow war heroes stories. What can I say more.. Good luck. Make your nation proud. Jai Hind. Please make any other appropriate suggestions, we all will be grateful to that. Thanks in advance. ",

            "answer_text": "I will share my own experience which finally helped me to get recommend from 21SSB Bhopal in the very first attempt. 1 .Always remember it is never too late to start a new thing . When I was a junior cadet in my school , I was weak in English communication and always had stage fear but one day my father told me about its importance in SSB(my father could not clear his ssb twice when he was in Sainik School Rewa).This motivation helped me to participate in stage activities and challenge myself and finally now I have an upper hand . So,first thing is work on ur communication part and it will show how confident you are in ssb. 2.Always get yourself aware about the happenings of the world ( read newspaper ,practice extempore on different topics). 3.Practice story making ,sentence formation from different words,(start diary entry and write down important events of your life becz in TAT,WAT you can easily write your own experience which is realistic within given time.I mean writing down any imaginary story will be unrealistic sometimes and will take more time unlike your own life story . 3. For interview,you must know everything about yourself(like hobby, achievements,etc).so for that take a print out of a sample of PIQ form and fill it and make out what all questions could be asked becz the interviewer has your PIQ placed on his table and he ask everything based on what you have written in your PIQ. 4.Now for the practice of interview you can take help of any friend or teacher to take your interview.How? Firstly fill the PIQ and give that to your interviewer and tell him to ask questions based on it ,and do it seriously (I too had done the same and trust me you will see great improvement in your presentation and confidence). 5.For GTO task ,trust me it is not a big deal until and unless you keep your mind open ( obstacles are very simple) and remember the colour rules and don't break those while performing task.The GTO only looks how confident you are, your contribution to the group(work for your group and be a good leader ),be full with Josh. 6.lastly few things you must keep in mind in ur ssb : Be confident and optimistic ( think that you will make it through ssb ( I mean it seriously)) Learn from your mistakes and focus on upcoming event(don't worry about what has happened) For above point ,I will tell u my own experience about interview where I couldn't answer few questions,I felt tensed but one of my group mate told me very simple but exact thing that 'jo ho gya wo ho gya aage ke task pe dhyan de aur uspe focus kar'.This simply helped me a lot . Be truthful,have good dressing sense ,talk confidently. Maintain the Josh in every task ,be a good listener to be a good leader,then only ur companion will pay attention to u back. And You must enjoy your 5 golden days ,make friends as much u can make ,and just keep the momentum. All the best and rock the show. ",

You must have honest answers regarding your own life.Be confident about yourself. Don't fear during any test. Just think you can do everything thrown at you.Get to know about other candidates during the stay. Make friends.Never lie during PI. But that doesn't mean you will say what you are not asked.Don't be too frank to IO. Just answer honesty to question asked.Keep your mind fresh and open before appearing for psychological test.Never boast about yourself during the entire stay.Stay hygienic. Eat accordingly. Daily baths are very important :pLastly,Its all about how you do in those 5 days. All the best. ",

Going by your sentence, I'd like to point that you cannot train yourself for SSB Interview. You can only develop your personality, as there are no fixed standards. SSB is not a 100m race which you need to complete in 10 or 12 seconds, or whatever your target might be. SSB is going out and being your best everyday. It is about giving your 100 percent to everything that you do, and accepting the ones you don't. It is about having enough faith in self to be able to know your strengths and weaknesses and taking steps towards working on them. The best way to prepare for SSB is acquiring knowledge. And by knowledge, I don't mean merely general awareness. Know yourself well, know the SSB process well, know the place you belong to well, know the people you live with well and also, know the factors that affect all these things. Once you begin with acquiring knowledge of these things, start working on yourself. Evolve daily. At the end of the day, make a brief outline of your day and see which areas you lacked in and in which you did exceptionally well. Set your own standards. It is always good to know the experiences of others but don't let it wash away your originality. That is the biggest concern, if any, for SSB. ",

            "answer_text": "The SSB interview is a crucial hurdle which candidates have to clear during the selection process. Showcasing a confident personality, ready with and presence of mind is a prerequisite for clearing the interview. It is very essential that the candidates work on developing certain qualities which will help them to showcase themselves in the best possible manner at the interview. Here are the TOP 7 TIPS which Candidates can follow to bring out the Brighter Side of their Personalities at the SSB Interview. Self Analysis: A good way of analyzing one\u2019s own self is by maintaining a diary. Candidates can keep a record of their feelings, their objectives and ambitions. Setting certain deadlines for achievement is also a good idea. They can then keep track of their achievements from time to time.Socializing: One of the primary qualities which the IO looks for in a candidate at the SSB Interview is his ability to socialize and adapt to various social circumstances. Hence, all candidates should try and enhance their ability to socialise and deal with different kinds of situations.SWOT Analysis: The SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis is something which all SSB Interview candidates should do. Although a complete analysis could take quite some time; doing it is totally worth it. Candidates can get a clear picture about their strength areas and their weaknesses. They can make further improvements based on the results.Develop good speaking and listening skills: Having a good command over English is very essential for SSB Interview candidates. Good English speaking skills surely help candidates fetch brownie points at the interview. It enables candidates to communicate their thoughts effectively. Reading newspapers, books and engaging in English conversation can prove very helpful.Being a good listener is also very important. Hence, candidates should listen carefully and be more attentive and alert. Have a positive attitude: Candidates should maintain a positive attitude throughout. Even if they fail, they should be optimistic, learn from their mistakes and try not to repeat them the next time.Compete with your own self: Developing the zeal to compete with one\u2019s own self is very important. Instead of trying to outdo others, one wise thing to do is to compete with one\u2019s own self and bring about a positive change within. Candidates can set standards for improvement and try their best to achieve them. In this way they will be constantly bettering themselves and success will surely be theirs.Johari analysis: This analysis is based on the Johari window which has four quadrants. Each of the quadrants stands for a particular group of qualities. These qualities are the ones known to one\u2019s own self, known to others, unknown to one\u2019s own self and unknown to others. Candidates can ask others to evaluate them and they can get to know about these qualities. This analysis becomes very helpful for the self-description test.These tips to bring about self-improvement will surely help candidates in preparing themselves for the SSB interview. A positive change in their personalities will enable them to face the interview with greater confidence and they will definitely be successful. ",

            "answer_text": "There is nothing like - Conference out or Screened out It is always - recommended or not recommended. Simple!!If you don\u2019t get recommended, don\u2019t use other adjectives to fool yourself. Now coming to the preparations. SSB mainly constitutes of 4 parts:Screening: This part covers a candidate\u2019s basic intelligence to ensure that he/she will understand the process ahead and will be able to attempt the tests ahead. If you don\u2019t go through it, one of the major shortcomings is - IQ levels. So, for this section work on IQ levels, presentability and presence of mind. The balance 3 parts are the core area of SSB and aim at seeing if the candidate has necessary OLQs (Officer-like qualities) or is malleable enough to imbibe them. Psychological tests-GTO-Interview collectively check your adaptability and OLQ levels, by a theoretical and practical display and eventually allow you to fill the gaps in the personal interaction. If you notice - the psychological tests are very fast paced which do not allow you to bluff and write things that come very naturally to you. Here there are no marks for attempting as many things as you could, but missing out on some parts will leave gaps in the understanding of the assessor. In simple mathematical terms, if you were to attempt 50 questions and you did 2 wrong and similarly you did 2 wrong out of 30 questions, it appears that in both cases you had 2 mistakes, but the percentage mistake in 2/30 is higher than 2/50 (there is no right or wrong in SSB though). So try and attempt as many as possible in Psychological tests, so that you have more opportunities for sharing different facets of your personality. GTO, although appears outdoors and in sports attire, is not at all physically gruelling activity. It firstly validates what you have told in psychological tests and also gives you an opportunity to practically display things like - leadership, teamwork and initiative, which you have used in multitude during your psychological tests. You are sure to get caught here. It is also to check your demeanour when you have to do public speaking, discussions and present complicated ideas. Your impromptu thinking, general awareness of various issues and above all - conveying ideas in the most uncomplicated way will really work well for you. It again validates the SRT in psychological tests, where you would have displayed how much of an uncomplicated and quick thinker you are. Some outdoor tasks definitely check your physical ability and ability to react to pressure situations. (In my first SSB I hurt myself badly in Tiger leap and could not do any of the further tasks- yet got recommended. It is not the only criteria) The interview allows a more experienced assessor to see you in-person, check on your confidence and body language. However, it also allows you to talk about the things that you might have missed out in other tests due to various reasons. This section has the most human input in your success, GTO and Psychological tests have a more rigid assessment structure. If you have read till here, you would have understood that SSB allows you to WRITE, DISPLAY, SPEAK (monologue, dialogue and discuss) and then assesses you. Reading all the above, you can make your strategy for preparing yourself. There is no set formula for succeeding, but one thing you should be sure of - is yourself. Be truthful to yourself and show yourself the way you are. ",

            "answer_text": "First understand the fact that SSB is analysation of your personality. It's not like that you have to prepare for a specific test. Some months ago, I was also finding the answer of such questions but after giving SSB and withdrawing it ( I was screened in, but I withdrawn), I have a good lesson, how to face it ! If you have ever noticed (not just that you \u2018know') the pattern of SSB tests (you can find it anywhere), then you should understand that, they do not select a man, who is perfectionist in every task, rather they prefer a man who has similarity in his \u2018\u092e\u0928\u0938\u093e \u0935\u093e\u091a\u093e \u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0923\u093e\u2019 that means you must have similarities in whatever you think ,whatever you speak & whatever you do ! You need to be honest on that. The biggest myth about SSB Preparation is that, candidates think like \u201c Ok, I am good at PPDT, but bad at WAT so I should prepare for WAT\u201d Or \u201cI am doing good at GTO task, but I am facing problem in Lecturettes, I should join a teacher for that\u201d And many more\u2026 These thoughts and preparation method is just like \u201cYou have a tree, whose leaves are good but stem is not OK, so you think to operate stem, so that it could be better\u201d Is this the practical way, what you do ?? No..! In such case, you will take care of the roots. You will water it on time, put fertilizers and will prepare best for Roots to grow..Because it will ultimately help in enriching whole plant !! That's the same way\u2026you have to enrich yourself by growing roots inside you ! Fill the pockets of your mind with the coins of positiveness, confidence, knowledge & Optimism. Do not try to prepare for a specific task. But you should know, what to do ? How to do..will come from inside and never forget the Mantra given above & you will definitely rock your SSB. ",

Tips to prepare for SSB Exam Reach a day before: Prepare yourself for a five-day schedule of the SSB. You need to reach a day before the first day, when you will be briefed on details of the next five days, code of conduct to be maintained, etc. Be confident: Maintain a confident and positive frame of mind and believe in your capabilities. After all, you've come this far from among thousands of candidates. First day: On the first day of the schedule, basic intelligence and verbal and non-verbal reasoning skills are evaluated. You are asked to see a picture of thirty seconds duration and describe it in a story form. Later, group discussions are held in batches to select the most suitable story. To do well in this section, go through the last few years' question papers to get an idea. Solve papers of different aptitude tests. Get involved in GDs and debates whenever you get time. These will improve your verbal and non-verbal skills. Practice writing & analyzing: Practice writing about anything you see, for instance, the boy playing in the park or the girl on a school bus. Write small stories and monitor your timing. The story should include seven parameters such as sex, mood, age, character, past, present and future of a situation that the character of your story is in. Analyse the story. Things to keep in mind for the GD session: Do not look at the officers while narrating your story and just after completing it.Proper body language should be maintained.Do not argue in the GD; allow others to speak, including the weaker ones.Wait for the right time to put in the strong points of the story that you have written.Try to be actively present in the discussion so that the officers notice you.Second Day: The second day is considered very important. Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT), Word Association Test (WAT), Situation Reaction Test (SRT) and Self Description are undertaken, all of which are part of psychological process. These are all general psychology tests that demand your extensive attention and concentration. Self-description: Prepare for it beforehand.

            "answer_text": "I've written an answer to this earlier, so simply copy-pasting it here. Before I begin, I just want you to realize that The SSB stands for  Service Selection Board. Nowhere do they mention that it is a  competitive exam (or an exam, for that matter).  The best way, in  my opinion, to prepare for The SSB is to understand yourself as much as  you can. Find out all your positives and negatives and try working on  the latter.  Be as true to yourself as you can. Don't fool  yourself with false or undeserving praise. At the same time, if you've  done something good, remember that.  As far as the tests are concerned, I bought the SSB by Arihant which  is an inexpensive book explaining everything there is. Just read that  book and watch Lakshya and Border and perhaps Saving Private Ryan and  your preparation is done.  Also, if you're not confident in  speakin, especially public speaking, take up as many debates and GDs as  you can. Interact with as many people on as many topics as you can. Not only will this prepare you for the SSB , it'll also make your life a whole lot more interesting. (I actually went a whole month without playing FIFA! )I found that most tests involve interaction and you really make or break your SSB Here!   I  only have the experience of an SSB, so I'm probably not the best person  to answer this, yet, this is what most people I had asked before my SSB  had suggested I do.  Good Luck though :) ",

TOP 6 JOB INTERVIEW SECRETS: =>1. Tell Your Story You must sell your product, which is yourself, to land the job. Be prepared to tell the interviewer why he should hire you. Some interviewers might not ask you directly to explain why you are the best candidate for the job. Whether you are asked, be sure to fit in a response during the conversation. Be confident and concise in explaining why you believe you should be hired and what you will do the best job possible. Include your qualifications in your sales pitch.

Employers want to like you as a person Since they already think you have the skills, and they want to hire you, what are most employers looking for in an interview? Frankly, they want to know if they like you and if you\u2019re going to fit in with the team. Once they hire you, you become someone they will have to see and speak to every day at work. They often end up spending more time with you than they do with their family or friends. So likeability really matters. This is why coming up with clich\u00e9d answers to standard questions won\u2019t work. If you say that your biggest flaw is that you\u2019re a \u2018perfectionist workaholic,\u2019 the interviewer won\u2019t learn anything about the real you, and may be annoyed by your lack of sincerity.

Search for former employees. In LinkedIn you can search for past employees and may also find the person who held the job before. Here you will find a rich source of insights, and information regarding the position, the manager, and the corporate culture. Regarding the request, the best way to ask for information is to use something like the following: \u201cI found you on LinkedIn and noticed that your background includes working at ABC. I am interviewing there and wondered if you could answer just a few questions as a random act of kindness. I promise not to take much of your time and thank you in advance.\u201d You can also search your college alumni database to see if anyone worked there. A fellow \u201calum\u201d is generally more likely to respond to your request than someone with whom you have nothing in common =>4. Structure Your Answer: Most people think of a job interview as a passive experience. The interviewer asks questions, you answer them. Answer them well and confidently and you\u2019ve got a job. Something like that. Instead, think of the interview as a chance for a guided conversation you run on the subject you want to talk about: how you\u2019re going to make a difference to this new organization. Have five points to make and be prepared to give both a quick answer and a longer answer on each of the five points. The longer answers are for follow up questions and comments. =>5. Ask Questions Do not leave the interview without ensuring that you know all that you want to know about the position. Once the interview is over, your chance to have important questions answered has ended. Asking questions also can show that you are interested in the job. Be specific with your questions. Ask about the company and the industry. Avoid asking personal questions of the interviewer and avoid asking questions pertaining to politics, religion and the like. Related post: 12 secrets to make $10k from YouTube channel: YTtricks365.blogspot. com =>6. Use the thank you email to your advantage. If you did fumble something or let nerves get the better of you in part of the interview, the follow-up note can help you clarify a bungled point. If you\u2019re better in writing than chatting in person, a coherent and charming thank you note can help shore up the final impression. ",

Now coming to your question, there is no exact way to clear SSB ( I prefer calling it \u2018getting recommended\u2019). It is a personality test and not a knowledge based interview and for the same reason you cannot mould yourself in a matter of days or months to become fit for the forces. If u really desire to be an army officer, improve yourself as an individual, everyday. Ofcourse there are certain things that should be kept in mind while attending SSB. These are a few of them- 1- Be brutally honest 2- Be crisp no beating around the bush 3- Participate with logic and do not just speak (especially in GD & GPE) for the sake of speaking. 4- In psychology tests, put down your thoughts without worrying what the assessor will make out of it. 5- Do not try to dominate. SSB is not relative, it is absolute. In a nut shell, BE YOURSELF!!!! Good luck :) ",

Many have clear without practicing but you would be at higher end.  *during personal interview, carefully listen questions asked because many time when they ask about you they  ask multiple questions and answers them in same sequence they are asked.  *if you don't know something say directly \"sorry sir I don't know\"  Please do not try to bullf.  *during command task if you are taken as helper, do not give conflicting advice to your commander.  *in group task be with group and speak out loud your ideas and try to do it also, remember in group task many get demoralized because they haven't done anything or given any idea but this is not the end perform better at command task things will be taken as granted.  *during command task choose no. Of subordinate carefully.   Note : personally SSB is really a great experience enjoy with your friends go for visiting city and market with friend. ",

            "answer_text": "This question is very very difficult to answer. The reason why i say so, is because I came across a person few months ago who was, like everyone else, preparing hard for SSB. He was with me in my board. Had prepared topics of general knowledge and current affairs astoundingly well. His command over the English language and communication skills were just perfect. He was well read and a gentleman in every sense of the word. To top it all, he was well buit and in amazing shape. He could easily give the best models a run for their money. We had no doubts that he will get recommended. That he easily did. On the basis of physical appearance also, he was more fit than I have ever looked in my life (and mind you, I did clear my medicals easily)!We already called him a US marine for his physical appearance. But in Special medical Board after the recommendation he was declared unfit and given a TR for high BP and a heart problem. We all thought it is a mistake and he will clear easily in the AMB.But Appeal Medical Board brought further shocks. His ECG revealed he had  a congenital problem in his heart. It would never interfare in then normal life functions. He could lead a very healthy life easily. But he was unfit for Army. Given a PR. World came crashing down. Not just for him but for us as well. The above is not a story but a true incident. I do not want to demotivate anyone. It is just a reality check. Do your best to prepare for SSB. But the strongest of individuals make sure that they are prepared for the worst as well. Preparing for SSB is not a herculean task. Heck, it is not difficult at all. You could pick up any SSB book from the market and that is all the guidance you would need. But inculcating the OLQs is some task. One must understand it well and learn it. ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is all about personality which includes both physical and mental fitness. Physical fitness can be kept as second priority because it is not tested to that level. Now, talking about the preparation, if you want to be an officer you got to behave like an officer. There are many things which can be done.  You can start with communication skills. An officer is a really good orator. His speaking skills are above par. An officer looks confident when he speaks. These things make communication skills very important. Try to convey your thoughts in english as much as you can. This will automatically help you in developing confidence. Most of us very comfortable in speaking hindi or our mother tongue, this is because people around us talk in this language. Same goes with english, until you start conversing in this language you won't improve. Writing answers on Quora will also help.  Next thing is awareness. An officer is very well aware of his surroundings. When I was going for my first SSB, I met a retired IAF officer. I asked him the same question as to how I can really gain knowledge about a particular topic. To which he replied that read newspaper daily. I will explain the further conversation with an example. Suppose the news was about ISIS. Now, you read that this terrorist organisation has done something. Next step is to know about this organisation, how it developed, how it can affect the whole world, what is its history. Basically, a detailed analysis. Many of us don't have so much time. So, you can simply read the headline, that will also help. There are few good apps on play store such as Jagran Josh.  Physical fitness can be improved by doing some basic exercises or if you are playing sport regularly then that will also help. You can try skipping rope, playing badminton or basketball. These sports are not too much time taking and will give you amazing results.  Read, read and read. Read about anything you find. Make great use of Quora. When I started preparing for SSB, I was introduced to Quora by my friend, and trust me it has helped me a lot. I had no idea about the Kashmir issue but today I can confidently narrate the whole history of Kashmir to anyone. Not just about this, but whatever field you like you can reqd about it.  One of the most important things is honesty. Be honest to yourself. Try to inculcate all these things in your daily routine. Be honest when you talk to your parents, be honest when you confess your mistakes. In the long run this will help you a lot.  There are 4 basic things required to crack SSB. Confidence, honesty, knowledge and will power. If you look at the tests conducted, you will observe that these 4 qualities are what they are looking for. Be confident and honest to accept if you don't know any answer. Be confident when you speak to anyone. Have enough knowledge to make your presence felt during any discussion anywhere, not just SSB. And last but not the least. Will power. Never ever give up. There will be times when you will lack motivation, you might even doubt your ability but that is when you have to be strong and believe that one day, I am gonna earn that uniform. Hope this helps. Best of luck. ",

The most important thing to note is - \u201cIf the four circles of what you ARE, what you THINK, what you DO/WRITE, and what you DO THERE\u2026 SUPERIMPOSE you will definitely be recommended by them.\u201d(Somebody else\u2019 words but really worked and helped me):-) INTERVIEW Specials points: 1) Do not FLAUNT, Please Please don\u2019t do it. 2) What you say you must Justify it, like if I say I went on a trek so I have to answer the situation which will be poured upon me after that by the interviewee. 3) Don\u2019t fumble because he\u2019s not asking you about someone else he\u2019s asking you about yourself (i.e. no one else know more about you except yourself ) so you should and must be confident about you and your manipulations. 4) Don\u2019t let any of your single task\u2019s performance pessimist your mind, like you didn\u2019t perform well in PGT or in SRT or let anything don\u2019t just boggle around it overcome it because SSB judges your all round performance so be confident even about you failures and be ready to accept them. 5) The last and the most important one is Be Crisp and sharp in your talks. Talk like an officer, walk like an officer, but be a good human, a humble one and you will make it. All the best!! JAI HIND!! JAI BHARAT!! Comments are welcomed\u2026\u2026. ",

I have cleared my SSB for 10+2 B.tech and NDA in my first and second attempt respectively. Never have eye contact with the examiner during the group discussion.It is not necessary to talk more during group discussion to get selected.Getting selected as a member of helper team during command task is not a great advantage.Wearing a light coloured shirt keeps your body cool and helps enhance thinking.Never use the word \u201cvery\u201d. It means no scope for improvement. i.e. very hard etc.You won't get selected if you talk frankly and openly about yourself during the interview like Raju Rastogi in 3 Idiots. You only have to show the interviewing officer how much it is required to get selected .Talking slowly is better than stumbling during interview .Tell the truth if you don't know something during the interview. I couldn't answer any of the technical questions asked during my second SSB for NDA. I answered that \u201cI am not aware I will find out \u201c. I accepted during conference that I did not do interview to my capability.Never fight with team mates. They are an important factor for your selection. He friendly during and after testing . Don't forget to enjoy in the dorm .The most important of all.. concentrate on the test rather than judging people during the discussion. It'll help you perform better without pressure.These are some tips out of my own experience. There are many advices out there. Do give heed to these points. Hope you understood!!! Cheers! ! ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is not an exam like others which can be qualify in one go but, it is five day long process in which which candidates are tested in every manner. Passion and dedication are two important factors that are necessary for any candidate to clear SSB. Time management and work hard are necessary. Firstly, candidate need to understand OLQs(Officers\u2019 Like Qualities), how important it is be in a candidate.Secondly, Screening of a candidate is based on 2 phases, one is Officer Intelligence Ratting Test (OIRT) test and Picture Perception and Discussion Test (PPDT). So, for Screening in, candidate must need to prepare for OIRT and PPDT. For OIRT start practicing for basis Aptitude, Verbal and Non-Verbal reasoning (100 questions in a day) and for PPDT make habit of writing, start observing things and make a habit of writing on that, cause it will definitely help candidate for PPDT and TAT (Thematic Apperception Test, Commonly known as Picture Story writing) also.Third, Candidate must know about himself, his week and strong points, it will help in Self Description Test.Fourth, prepare Current affairs, it will be helpful in Personal interview and Lecturette . Start practicing for lecturette in front of your family and friends (daily 4 to 5 topics).Fifth, for Obstacles phase, do some physical exercise like wall climbing, rope climbing, running. It will not only help candidate during Obstacles task but also it keeps candidate fit and fine.Improve General awareness, Vocabulary.You don\u2019t need to follow any specific book SSB, all you can do is follow some books for Vocabulary and GK.Read newspaper.Make writing habit.Write effectively and impressively.Prepare yourself under the allotted time duration.Be precise with your words.Think positive.Be relax and confident.And most important, be natural and be yourself.This is all from my side. Hope, it will help :) All the Best! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all you have to know what are all the tests conducted by SSB. For know about the SSB tests just search in google or buy a book. It is only useful for know about the instructions. It is not a study material. OLQ-Officer Like Qualities. Here I attached some olq. It is very important to get recommend. Try to live with OLQ. Officer Like Qualities. Effective Intelligence.Reasoning Ability.Power of Expression.Self Confidence.Determination.Organizing Ability.Initiative.Courage.Cooperation.Sense of Responsibility.Stamina.Group Influencing Ability.Liveliness.Social Adaptability.Speed of DecisionBe informed- learn about the procedure of ssb and talk to some recommended candidates. Practice- Now,practice for the tests one by one like Intelligence tests(verbal and non verbal),TAT,WAT,SRT,SD etc. Fitness and GTO- Work on your fitness.Run daily and learn to work as a group. Try to find answer to situations while having a calm mind. Interview-For the interview,be informed,learn about current affairs,be truthful,prepare your answers beforehand so that you can answer any counter questions if asked. Be confident and don\u2019t give up if the officer puts you in pressure. That means he likes you and if you get this right,you will be selected as well.Finally, remember that it is more important to do well in all three tests in order to get selected. you have to go to SSB and want to prepare for it. First of all I would like to say that, SSB is the test of one\u2019s personality. You can;t change your personality for this interview. Your real self will ultimately come out in SSB, however you can enhance yourself.Regarding training for SSB, it depends whether you have considerable time left or in a haste, whatever may be your case but there are some things that you can do to prepare for SSB 1.Please visit SSBcrack.com, it\u2019s the best SSB preparation website(I use it too!) 2.Read newspaper daily and be abreast with current affairs( I prefer Hindu and The Indian Express) 3.Purchase a good SSB book and follow the procedure,practice tests like WAT,SRT,TAT etc (Arihant/SSBcrack) 4.Improve your communication skills, speak up in formal occasions, give lectures and if you don\u2019t have that kind of atmosphere just prepare a talk for yourself. 5.Enhance your behavior, try to inculcate the Officer Like Qualities or the OLQ\u2019s. 6. Be proactive and Self Introspect. (It\u2019s easier said than done!) 7. Try to overcome your shortcomings and conquer them slowly. 8.Practice verbal and Non-Verbal Intelligence test.(Required for Stage I in SSB) 9. Improve your body language by any way you find effective and please have a lot of SELF-CONFIDENCE.(That\u2019s the most important virtue) 10. In the end the most important point for SSB. Never ever Lie in SSB, so start to extract that from your life from now onward so that by the time you give SSB you don\u2019t say anything but the Truth. Coaching can never ensure your SSB recommendation. Rather the recommendation resides in your own hands. Your personal behavior and mentality are what all they need and to show it, you need to analyze yourself and be what you are. Cramping and burdening yourself with unfavorable mediums can make you more obsess and will turn you down. ",

In ssb assessors look for 15 OLQs in you. So, note down those 15 OLQs and try to self introspect to know that which quality you have in you most and least and work on them accordingly. Get an opinion about yourself from Parents, friends, teachers. As this will help you to prepare for self description test of psychology and to know the level of OLQs as well. But your self introspection is more important.NEVER FAKE AT ANY POINT IN LIFE.  DON'T LOOSE REAL YOU. BE YOURSELF. Improve your personality as an army officer by your day to day activities.",

A dash of liveliness is what helps you keep in a good mood always in the ssbHave a sense of responsibility.. If you do a mistake owe it up..don't deny it.Be normal...don't try to show off..you will be comfortable and confident when you are just being you..Be determined about your ideas and goals that is have some confidence in self and be cooperative with othersTake initiative and express your ideas powerfully..

These are the acronyms which I feel I worked upon in real world and got recommended from Eastern Selection center, Allahabad (34 SSB) in one attempt. Apart from that you can work on 15 OLQs that are the base of SSB process and must be fulfilled. In addition you must be thoughful about using rope, plank and solid cylinder. Passing these 4 days will judge your leadership, selfnessness, calmness, team play. A lot more stuff can be found on internet but a coaching I feel is very much important if taken seriously. My funda was, If you serious about Defense make it counted in one attempt. I prefer Balnoi Academy in janakpuri I myself took coaching from there. It's not necessary, depends upon individual's choice. Many candidates clear SSB without coaching. So depends upon you. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay first let me tell you about what SSB is. It is set up by the Ministry of Defense. They undertake the SSB Interview to evaluate prospective candidates for recruitment in the Army, Navy and Air Force. Candidates are assessed based on intelligence, personality, compatibility and potential. Unmarried graduates who clear the Combined Defense Services Examination conducted by the UPSC are selected for the SSB Interview. The five-day personality and intelligence test schedule is as under: Day 1: Basic Intelligence TestDay 2: Psychological TestDay 3 & Day 4: The Group Testing Officers ActivitiesDay 5: ConferenceA Personal Interview (PI) can be taken on any day between Day2 & Day4 days. Many people might suggest you to go for self study. But I won\u2019t. You will be needing training to improve your awareness, social graces, confidence and dynamism, to carry all information given by the training academy as useful tips at the back of your mind for application using own intelligence during the SSB. A training academy will be conducting interactive sessions to promote self confidence and public speaking skills,. They will give feedback to improve basic social graces, explain fundamentals of various tests and tasks, and give feedback for correcting the undesirable biases of thinking. Well , I have heard about Siegwald Academy which is situated in Kolkata. One of the trusted defense career training academy in India. They have their own outdoor facility. They have the largest team of officers who are Ex SSB Presidents, GTO\u2019s, and Psychologists from Army, Air Force, and Navy. The best part is that apart from the SSB preparation, you can also learn from the experience of successful students and contact them personally! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. To crack the SSB interview the most important thing you need is a book on SSB. A book which describes every test in detail. You will find such books in Amazon. Then you need practice especially in psychological evaluation. You need to be able to write all the questions in the given time. Next you need to know the real reason for so many tests. The basis of the SSB interview is that the kind of person that you show yourself to be in the psych test must be the same kind of person who you show during GTO. When you show in psychological evaluation that you are an extrovert but in GTO you turn out to be an introvert then you are clearly trying to cheat the assessors. This virtue is not sought after. That's why people say that you should be yourself in SSB. There is no set personality type required in the army. They don't want people who are already brave and strong. Then such guys don't need to be trained and they will instead question the training. It doesn't matter if you are a scared person. The training will turn you into a lion. The army just wants honest people who will work hard. If you can show such virtues you will be able to crack every SSB you go to. ",

For this, improve your imagination, writing and communication skills. For psychology and interview, you need to know about yourself very very well. You would need a lot of introspection, invest time in knowing about yourself , what you are, what you want to be, how you face situations, how you feel about people around you etc. Also, read newspaper daily and know thoroughly about what's happening in the world. For group tasks, it is all about practical ideas, spontaneity , team work which you cannot build in a month or so , it requires time and is generally hard wired inside you. So, polish your personality and all the best for SSB. ",

Try to gather information regarding your stream of education, the sports and hobbies you indulge and your interests. This will help you to be confident while speaking. Next, spend time reading the newspaper or magazines such as India Today or Outlook on a regular basis as this will help in not only strengthening your language but also your general knowledge. Watch documentaries by National Geographic or Discovery; this will improve your understanding of presentation. Watching debates will also help in building speaking and reasoning ability. All this together will help in getting yourself prepared for the SSB interview. Most importantly, above all of this, remember to be honest to your true self and confident. DO NOT falsify anything about yourself or anything that you may not know about. Stay calm and honest and present yourself with confidence. ",

I\u2019ve seen my friends take coaching from reputed coaching centers and learn about everything from the tasks , obstacles ,interviews and WAT & TAT and so on. But once you go through the process of SSB you realize that the Army doesn't need people who are already well trained but people who can be trained and molded. Ive seen physically strong candidates towering over 6ft getting rejected and super lanky dudes gettin through. Not that you shouldnt go for coaching or prep but the most important thing to note is and work on are the OLQ or Officer Like Qualities. YOU CANNOT TRAIN FOR THESE QUALITIES IN A DAY . Or even a month , you must bring them into your daily life. Your Psychological tests are very very important. Pay heed to them and you wont have any trouble during the SSB interviews. But also maintain the idea in your mind that Board of Selectors dont really tell you why or give a reason for your non selection. So self assesment is crucial. More than anything just show your keeness and ability to them , they're humans after all (though cold af) but they know a deserving candidate when they see one ",

There is this one question that you have to answer yourself honestly and you had to be really honest.\"Do you have it in you ?\"It is this one question that pops up every where in your interview.They are several books on HOW to clear the SSB. Before that ask yourself ask WHY ? Once you make up your mind on that the rest is pretty straight forward. 1. Know yourself and prepare yourself accordingly.2.Get some books and know the basics.3.Don't worry about physical fitness, just get in good shape.5.Go there and give your best.Don't worry about the result and be a team man.

            "answer_text": "Some Common Mistakes To Avoid During SSB Interview Apostrophe: the utilization of apostrophe may be a minefield for many . Words like \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d are most vulnerable to mistakes. Similarly, when a word ends in \u201cs\u201d, will you set an \u201c\u2019s\u201d or not? These are mistakes which require careful correction by an expert. During your training at the simplest SSB institute in Kolkata, Siegwald Academy, stress is placed on such small details in order that your knowledge and usage is ideal . Contractions: In using English, we frequently use contractions like \u201cthey\u2019re\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d. But how different are they from \u201ctheir\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d? You have to understand the proper usage in order that you write them correctly also as pronounce them the right way. In this case, the former are both contractions of \u201cthey are\u201d and \u201cyou are\u201d while the latter are possessive cases. Word Meanings: There are some words, like \u201caffect\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d, which are close in meaning and pronunciation but not quite the same. The distinction makes all the difference. While \u201caffect\u201d may be a verb, \u201ceffect\u201d may be a noun. There is subtle difference in meaning also , not just use. You have to be particular about these details, just like the difference between the words \u201clook\u201d, \u201csee\u201d and \u201cwatch\u201d. Prepositions: the sole section of grammar where you would like to memorize instead of understand, some prepositions are often quite tricky! Observe the difference between \u201cinto\u201d and \u201cin to\u201d, or between the prepositions \u201csince\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d. Professional English teachers at SSB training institutes like Siegwald Academy will guide you to use the language properly and properly . By learning correct English for SSB, you've got better chances of cracking the written and interviews. ",

            "answer_text": "Your interview will go good , if you have well introspected yourself, if you have developed good communication and presentation skills. The interviewer over there, is interested in your speech i.e how you think and express your views. I know many, who even have the best ideology about a subject, but aren't good at expression, and also many who don't know much, but present whatever they know, pleasently. Here are few things you can inhibit in your daily life. Inspire yourself to aspire.You must never lack confidance, one must see a living lion inside you.don't underestimate yourself. The i/o will try to surpress you, regarding your views. Be fearless,and bold.Start talking to everyone in your vicinity.Never lack confidance in initiatings the talk. Be it your school principal,or your near home uncle, start communicating with her in any sensible topic. Also, in my opinion, a person will never stammer, if he knows the subject. Read, know about things going on over the world. If you are curious about things, u ought to know it. Gain knowledge, spread knowledge. Since, the mode of language in ssb is english only, u must start speaking english. Talk your mother in english, your friends in english. I know it's embarrising, if you aren't used to. But you have to implement. Hoping for your best. Jay hind \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 ",

Well, How to prepare for the interview procedure, i\u2019ll write down a few suggestions: Get to know all the events of SSB very well with right approach. Events like Screening, WAT, TAT, SRT, SD, GTO tasks, Interview(personality test), conference.Start mirror speaking so as to increase your fluency in expressing your ideas. It will help you in all the discussion events.Practice story writing, it will help you in screening and TAT.Develop a habit of reading newspapers to stay updated with national & international events.Go for exercises to increase stamina to tackle with outdoor Ground Tasks.Start interacting with your friends and discuss with them some topics to get ease in talking in a group.Get to know more & more about the forces. In your case focus more on Navy.Now, for all this you can do it all by yourself or you can take some professional guidance. But maintain your originality. Some the last advices would be: Draw a strict and efficient schedule for your weekdays and weekends and follow it by your heart.Worship whatever you prepare and do.Remember, hard work leads to success.",

            "answer_text": "There is no master tip to clear SSB, however remember at the end of the day it's a job interview combined with a battery of psychological tests to evaluate your personality ( To suit leadership requirements of a combat leader) . You should know how tests are conducted ( If you are a repeater) obviously you know) Carry out introspection of your earlier experiences and practice to improve your earlier shortcomings. Keep fit, read newspapers and be generally aware of what's happening around you, follow important events, national and international and with like minded friends discuss. As for psychological tests practice writing with a view to complete and give out maximum responses. You can do that only if you write your first impressions, if you make up your responses it takes time resulting in lower responses from your side. Be friendly with all in the group, be helpful, ( You will gain from sharing and discussing). Do have adequate knowledge of the service you intend to join Army, Navy or Airforce . In today's age information is on your fingertips so you would come across very poorly if you don't have basic knowledge during your group discussions or your interviews. All the best ",

Then now go on once you have mastered these.. 1.FOCUS ON PHYSCOLOGY PART: For this I can suggest you to buy a book called CRACKING THE CODE OF PHYSCOLOGY available on amazon(suggested by a recommended candidate). PRACTICE SRT WAT TAT on regular basis. 2.THEN COMING TO GTO.. Watch Gto videos from YouTube. And I prefer you to buy a book written by CDR NK NATRAJAN 3.

Simple points to clear this can be Be yourselfA good leader is one who never exaggerates his achievements and one who doesn't feel bad for his losses.Be confident (a solid preparation gives you more confident)Have a smile.BE NUDE BEFORE THREE ACCESSORS THEY WILL DRESS YOU WITH THE UNIFORM.

            "answer_text": "Hello, Steps for Preparing for SSBs depends from person to person. I have attempted 4 SSBs till day and reached till conference twice. How you need to prepare depends on you and to decide that one needs to understand the testing & evaluation process very clearly. Preparing day wise is best methodology in my understanding. Day 1: It deals with Screening process in two parts: Part 1 : OIR(Officer Intelligence Test) Test 1: Verbal It consists of 45 question to be done in 22 minutes. Questions consists of basic Mathematics and English. You need to be excellent in Elementary level of both the subjects to solve it efficiently and there is no negative marking. Test 2: Non Verbal This also consists of same number of questions to solved in 19 minutes. Questions consists of patterns and series. You need to very quick and analytical in solving the puzzles. Its fun and similar to solving puzzles but time runs very fast and you might feel like playing under pressure. Break of 15\u201330 minutes is given depending on Center and batch size. Part 2 : PP&DT (Picture Perception and Descripition Test) In this a Picture is shown to you for 30 seconds and time period of 4 minutes is given to write down the story as per your imagination. One is free to write anything. For this imagination should be wide open and writing speed must be around 30 words per minute. Then comes the description part in which 1 minute is given to every candidate to narrate his/her own story and after that 20 minutes is collectively given to discuss the same and conclude the picture. Tips for same ; Don\u2019t try to put up only your story.Focus on getting the conclusion.Don\u2019 be too low or too highControl hand gesture and tone of voiceAvoid creating Fish MarketDon\u2019t directly cut the others point.Don\u2019 Manipulate the story written and story narrated, be true to your imaginationTry to speak at-least 3\u20134 times in discussion.Now Its done for day one. Hope for the best. Day 2: Psychology Day You will definitely feel like its your board exam. You will writing for almost 4 hours without considerable break. This is again divided into 4 parts. All are designed in such a way to manipulate your brain. Be conscious and open to your thinking. You need to be very fast in writing down your thoughts and mind should be very quick in striking the thoughts. Don\u2019t look here and there because that might demotivate you. Part 1 : TAT This exactly the same what you did in picture perception with similar timing structure but this time pictures are more clear and you will writing 12 stories back to back. 11 pictures are shown to you and 1 blank to imagine the picture and story on your own. Definitely all the story will have same theme based on your mind and brain. Don\u2019t try to manipulate your thoughts. Keep practice of writing stories and imagination. I have seen people writing predefined stories irrespective of picture displayed. Trust me this never helps as assessors easily figures that out. Part :2 WAT This is similar to above and also completely different, in-place of picture displayed for 30 seconds a word is displayed for 5 seconds and 10 seconds are given to write a thought that strikes your brain, preferably in a form of sentence. NOTE : This is not a Sentence making Test, Be true to your thoughts. For reference it is like a game in movie \u201c Zindagi Na Milegi Dudara\u201d Part 3: SRT This is similar to the part of game \u201cTruth, Dare, Stare and Situation\u201d In this test a booklet is given to you with 60 situations and time of 30 minutes. You need ti be very quick decision maker here as well as very fast writer. Nothing to worry as situations are easy but you might find that tough in that situation. Don\u2019t fake your answers to show yourself what you are not as they will surely figure that oit in upcoming days. Part 4: SD The Most easy one Self Description. Throwing back to you primary school days, you are suppose to write an essay on My Self. But there is slight change in level. You have cover 5 prospective in this, you will describing your self from point of view of your : ParentsTeacher/ EmployerFriends / ColleagueYour SelfWhat you want to be?And for this you have 15 minutes. You can predefine and prepare for this part. Well again This day is done. Coming to Day 3 & 4 : I will like to go quickly through this, It consists of GT and PI GT : Group Task, As the test are over, task starts, you will be divided in groups of 8 to 10. Tasks are as follows and all needs team spirit and coordination GPE Group Planning Exercise : Whole group collectively have to solve a puzzle.GD Group Discussion : Advises are same as above but now group size is smaller try to speak as much points you can, Don\u2019t facts and numbers without any strong references. Have a healthy discussion. There will be two GDs. For 1 Topic has to be mutually chosen and in another topic is given to you. Prepare well with general knowledge, current affairs and public Speaking.PGT. HGT, CT, Snake Race, IO, FGT are some of Ground Tasks. Be physically fit and have good stamina. This all few simple set of rules which will be explained by GTO, listen to them carefully.Lectureate : This is simple as the word, you have to pick a card, choose a topic out of four, prepare for 3 minutes given to you and speak for three minutes in front of your group mates. Topics will be from Science, GK and Current Affairs. You are judged on basis of your topic chosen as that clearly describes your interest, style of delivery which describes your leadership quality and content which describes your knowledge.Then comes the one of most important i.e. PI Personal Interview. Generally it is conducted by IO(Interviewing Officer), Vice- President or President of that Board. Be well dressed, if in formals ( I am saying this because Sometimes you have to appear it in your GT Dress). Be little Self Conscious and walk straight with energy. Questions are very simple as well as very tricky. Don\u2019t even think of bluffing or else interviewer can put you to vertigo. You will be asked about yourself, your family, financial status, schooling, higher education, problems faced by you and how you handled the same, few personal questions, questions from your educational background, you routine on holidays and normal days, your interests and hobbies, your likes and dislikes, your attachments, your friends and in nut-shell all about yourself along with your knowledge in current affairs and general knowledge. You will be asked questions in comprehensive manner, don\u2019t miss any single detail asked, try to remember all what you are asked. He might show no interest in listening you just to distract you but don\u2019t fall in trap. Answer all questions genuinely. Prepare for the Question like \u201c What and How you prepared for SSB?\u201d Answer to this will show the things you rely on for important things in like! Keep smile Up and Fill Free to drink Water if Required. You might be asked about the stay facility, food and city, avoid criticizing though liked it or not. Remember the names of your roommates because that is all interviewers ask most of the time. That\u2019s All ! Now Relax and Wait for Conference. You have given your best and in conference all the assessors will discuss and conclude about your recommendation. You will be called and asked about your stay and food and might be about one or two questions that you might have not been able to answer during interview. And you will be wished ALL THE BEST FOR FUTURE. From above you can analyse what all you need to work-on on yourself and prepare for SSB. Don\u2019t fake it or blunder. Be genuine and real to yourself. It is well said be psychologist in one of my experience \u201cINTROSPECTION IS THE BEST PREPARATION FOR SSB. If you find this helpful and need any further help feel free to contact me. ALL THE VERY BEST FOR PREPARATIONS AND UPCOMING SSB. ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is not an exam for which you need to prepare yourself. It's just the phase which checks inner you. Who is really inside you. Is there any similarity between inner and outer you? Things like this are checked through series of stage testing. For this you need to introspect yourself. You should be aware of your qualities. These qualities need time to get developed. It takes year to get moulded with these qualities. It's better to start today. Everyone has a mask which they wear infront of a society and the SSB staff is trained to tear out that mask. You should work on your qualities. If you already possess some of those qualities than don't work on others quality just refine those. You should prepare for verbal and non verbal series as they are the major reason for screening out than GD. 1 day of SSB requires these. On the other days you only need your qualities and moderate knowledge in General Awareness. Well i haven't faced any SSB but trust me the above mentioned information is the sum-up of various experiences. Good luck ",

You should begin with having a proper daily routine, you should have the capability to set your priorities, you should read good literature, you must indulge yourself into some sports or cultural activities. Keep yourself busy. Coming to psychology part, you should really feel WAT ,SRT questions from the heart. Not some random sentence or reaction, you should write the reaction which is realistic and for WAT, a sentence that defines the inner you. Read current issues and be confident for public speaking because half of your GTO is based on this and it will help you for Interview. Thats all I can suggest ! ",

But according to me more than GK, GA( General awareness ) is more important.. So start asking yourself about your ownself, your likes and dislikes, do you really know about those things completely.. for eg: The Shawshank redemption is one of my favorite movie but I didn't knew the meaning of redemption. Isn't it funny I didn't knew the meaning of my favorite movie. So try to ask as many questions as possible. It will help you increase your GENERAL AWARENESS a lot, and it will help in SSB for sure.. This is basically what I did before my SSB apart from writing psychological tests\u2026 ALL THE BEST for SSB\u2026 ",

Secondly, u can prepare for TAT, WAT by observing the images and words respectively in the newspaper, e.g if u find an image of road accident or child labour u can construct a positive story out of it, Thirdly ur awareness level will improve which will help u in yr interview. Other than newspaper you should develop the habit of knowing about the services u hv opted for, I used to read about Air force so much thar even in my dreams I used to find myself airborne most of the time trying my hand on different jets.Anyways if u r passionate enough god will help u find ur way but mind you unless u put in ur efforts even almighty won't co operate.

Know yourself, in and out, Literally - covers your interview. 7. If repeater, then introspect. Correct your mistakes. ",

AFTER CLEARING THE WRITTEN WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE TO APPEAR FOR THE TOUGHEST INTERVIEW IN INDIA ONE SHOULD BE PREPARED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY TO GET THROUGH EACH TEST. FIRSTLY YOU SHOULD REMEMBER THE 15 OLQ\u2019S (OFFICERS LIKE QUALITIES) THAT SET\u2019S THE STANDARD FOR A CANDIDATES TO BE TESTED . THESE OFFICERS LIKE QUALITIES ARE GENERALLY CATEGORISED IN 4 FACTORS 1: RELATED TO YOUR MIND 2:RELATED TO YOUR HEART 3:RELATED TO YOUR LIMBS 4: DYNAMICS i.e COURAGE , STAMINA AND DETERMINATION If tomorrow you have a algebra test you will study algebra similarly Ssb is all about the QLQ\u2019S . Try to implement these qualities in your everyday life. Then only you could project your true self in front of the assessors. Also speaking in English and that too confidently is necessary . So improve your spoken English. Try to read English newspapers aloud,watch English debates on news channels like Lok sabha, and most importantly think in English in this way you would be confident when you are actually there in the Ssb . Lastly know yourself better. Find your strength and weakness . Work on your strength and improve your weakness and always speak the truth. There is no room for Lies in the armed forces. Don't change yourself but improve Yourself. Let us make the future now with hardwork and let us make our dreams tomorrow's reality Good luck. ",

Note that these websites can only make you aware about the SSB process, and the only person that can help you to get recommended is you. So stop searching for the answers in the outside world and take a look inside. SSBs are looking for Officer like qualities (OLQs) in a candidate. An officer does not depends upon others for answers, he goes ahead and finds them. So a good idea for you might be to take a look at the OLQs and cultivate them inside yourself. If you have some of the OLQs, then the others can be developed, given some time and effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Six days can prove to be a great turning point for you, your career and your dreams. However to succeed in these six days, you need to prepare in a systematic and regular manner. The question is how many days before your SSB you should start your preparation, and how many days are enough. The answer is that it depends on you, your efforts and your abilities. Nonetheless, extra preparations have never caused a hard. It is a common go-to line between students that if we\u2019ll study from long before, we\u2019ll forget it by the time the exams come. SSB is an exam for personality, and you need to work on your personality before anything. Let us see how you can prepare for SSB in thirty days: Initial 3 Days Know what all it takes: If you know your enemy well, you have won the war already. This is true for exams too, only that there is no enemy and no killing. If you know what all is going to come in SSB, what all is there is the tests, then you can obviously prepare well for it. So devote these days to know the SSB. Read all what you can to understand what all is there in each test. What is the pattern, what is the syllabus? Start your fitness regime: Start mild jogging and stamina building exercises. Getting into shape takes time. You\u2019ll need a lot of stamina and strength for the long duration of tests in SSB. Also the Ground Tasks require a decent fitness level. Next 7 Days: Start with GA: You have start working on your General Awareness. Start reading the newspaper, make notes regarding important points. Collect information on probable topics of GD and lecturette. Read as much as you can. Self-Awareness: Write down everything you need to know about yourself and your near ones. This includes your positives, negatives, achievements. Basically an introspection of your personality. Your hobbies, interests and information related to that. Information related to your friends, family and their likes dislikes, and your likes and dislikes in them. Time yourself: Start with the PPT\u2019s available for TAT, WAT and SRT. They come with an automatic timer. You can time yourself to perform in certain duration as required in the SSB. Every Psychological test in SSB is time bound, and that is their way of creating pressure on you. You need to practice to think fast at the spur of the moment. Write your SDT as well. Public Speaking: Start practicing lecturette, this will not only help in lecturette but in every task that requires public speaking.  The following Days: Read about the Forces: Gather basic and important information related to the Armed Force you have applied for. This will include information like commands, Chief of staff, recent procurements and ranks etc. Continue with what all you have been doing, such as practicing for psychological tests, lecturette, interview etc. See what all documents you\u2019ll need for SSB. Make sure you have them. You can anytime refer to various articles available on our website regarding any help with any test. For any queries post your questions in the comment box below. Keep calm and give your best! Jai hind ",

You should be fairly Intelligent, be resourceful, able to Organise routine issues and express clearly. You should be rule abiding,responsible and considerate towards others. In addition , you should have faith in your abilities, decide early and motivate others around you to your line of thinking.You should be enduring, capable of taking calculated risks to achieve your objective. You should be generally aware of what is happening in the world and in your country, with good knowledge of Geography and History. Mind you, a Defence Officer is required to lead his/her men at War and there are no runners up in War.  ",

Previously I did not have a single clue about the selection process( I just knew it was 5 day interview..thats all:-)) I just started a week before and was able to crack the Screening. Here are some tips: Always remember: SSB is not a competitive test. They want a good soldier: they care very little about your technical knowledge. So be cool.I think this video tutorial is very vital and covers almost everything in SSB:SSB PREPARATION: SSB PREPARATION - YouTubeMake sure that you at least say some 2\u20133 points in group discussion. And be patient while others say their stories.Wherever you go inside the premises maintain discipline. Each and every thing about you will be noted( and it is very easy for them to identitfy you as you will be always wearing your chest numbers)There are many tutorials availabe in YouTube. I think thats sufficient.All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "SSB is all about 15 officers like qualities.  Its a five day long procedure to check whether you possess them or not. The best way for any defence aspirant is to understand these qualities and then introspect whether these qualities are possesed by them or not. Make your SORT analysis S- strengths, O- opportunities, R- responsibility, T- threats, Classify yourself into these and then make a proper plan because if you are failing to plan you are planning to fail. Now next step is to understand the entire 5 day process thoroughly, then think about yourself as an assessor. Point out different test and tasks in the entire process and mention the olq which is tested there, for example initiative is tested mostly in GTO where if you are the first person to speak in group discussions or first person to lead in PGT or HGT with valid suggestion s and solutions you will automatically get green signal in this olq. It will get easier for repeaters to make such observations and perform accordingly next time. Freshers require proper guidance or coaching ( not necessary ) . Finally it's a test of your trainablity, if they find you good enough in all these 4 Factors (15 olqs ) you are through it.

Buy a Arihant\u2019s SSB book, understand the whole procedure.Talk to your friends who have been to SSB, their experience will help.I would strongly suggest you to watch AFOSOP video tutorial series on youtube. It actually proved to be very helpful for me. And if you are a repeater, even then, try to improve things yourself. And if you still feel that you need professional help,chose a coaching WISELY. At the end, I would say SSB is a personality based test, that means if you have it in you, you will be picked up by them.Just be yourself, enjoy your stay there. Hope it helps. Jai Hind. ",

Speak less but speak effective. Basic rule for any GD. Practice more of SRT, WAT, TAT. Pen down SDT and remember it for the rest of your life. Make sure you add OLQs in the same indirectly. For e.g., rather writing that you are a good decision maker, write - your parents ask or take advise before taking any major family decisions. Read good article on technologies, policies, etc. Stay updated on day to day happenings. Do remember to polish your hobbies. If you are trekking freak then how you will prove the same...either you should have vast knowledge about trekking or certifications or both. All the best! ",

The basic tests are General Aptitude and a few written exams along with physical tests and group tasks. To the best of my knowledge all these are to test the personality and to determine the general thought process and team skills which helps in painting an overall picture of the candidate. So my basic advice would be to concentrate on improving your vocabulary and speaking skills and along with your general knowledge. The most important part to clear the interview is to be informed as much as you can. It may range from sports and politics to the working of an engine. Be informed and be confident. ",
