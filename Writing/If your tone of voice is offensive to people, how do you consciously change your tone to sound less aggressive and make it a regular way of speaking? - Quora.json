            "answer_text": "This is a very simple, yet difficult kind of question to answer\u2026 because it covers a few things going on potentially that may define \u201coffensive\u201d as different things to different people. So i\u2019ll give an honest try at answering it. Lets first look at \u201coffensive\u201d\u2026.. Some people just have a certain type of voice or accent that can flat out be irritating just to hear them speak period\u2026.. to some. Descriptions might range from squeaky, whiny, raspy, etc. In that particular instance? I don\u2019t think adjusting ones attitude in how they speak would even make a difference. Now another way a person can sound \u201coffensive\u201d is as if they are hard of hearing and are constantly telling when they speak and they don\u2019t even realize it, or in a conversation they seem to miss reciprocal cues that allow mutual, effective two way communication and constantly seem to talk over the other person.. which may come off as rude and inconsiderate but it\u2019s actually due to a hearing impairment. Furthermore, another way someone may be deemed offensive is because of no home training\u2026 no manners\u2026 just an outright disrespectful attitude where a person talks aggressively to anyone\u2026 with no filter, no throttle for common sense\u2026. technically speaking an \u201casshole\u201d that doesn\u2019t know that they are a \u201casshole.\u201d Now this \u201casshole\u201d\u2026 can be fixed with an education in class and manners. \u201cHow to be respectful to others 101.\u201d Because some people were never raised properly in the concept being respectful to other people. That\u2019s a fixable ignorance with proper awareness and education. As in one should be more aware of noticing their impact and engagement upon others\u2026. some people are simply just not good communicators or easy to talk to for the above reasons and more. Notwithstanding, if it isn\u2019t a physical impairment or a mental impairment\u2026. then it\u2019s just a matter of re-educating oneself under the guidance of some constructive criticism. For an example \u2026 it\u2019s not just enough to tell some one \u201cHey you\u2019re an asshole!\u201d But rather say .. \u201cHey, you know many people might think of you as an asshole whenever you say that like that and here\u2019s the reason why\u2026\u2026\u201d Far too often people are the way that they are and are completely clueless about it. This is what good friends\u2026. and good PR training is for. In short I came from an environment in truth where a person could literally lose their life\u2026\u2026 simply by coming out of their mouth\u2026. disrespectfully\u2026.I mean that seriously\u2026\u2026.. or at the least you can find plenty of YOUTUBE videos right now where a person comes out of their mouth disrespectfully.. and the next thing that happens is their getting knocked out or worse. So at all times\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s best to be as respectful as you can to everyone. Respect should\u2026. often beget respect. Our tone of voice, in \u201chow\u201c we say something\u2026\u2026. is just as if not more important\u2026. than \u201cwhat\u201c we say to each other. To address anyone\u2026. unnecessarily with an aggressive tone\u2026. puts them on guard\u2026.. they will feel attacked or feel like an act of intimidation is upon them\u2026 and they will respond differently often not in a respectable manner in return. So much of this can be an adjustment in attitude. Re-educating oneself with a genuine desire to communicate effectively. Being open to constructive criticism. Making the necessary adjustments to better learn how to communicate effectively. Many people will be mad at one person\u2026. and then be angry with how they speak to everyone else\u2026.. hurting the innocent. That\u2019s not wise to do. So it\u2019s about compartmentalizing engagements\u2026 leave problems at work at work\u2026.. leave problems at home\u2026 at home. Make the necessary adjustment to get at what is making one angry? What are you upset about? Must you take that attitude out on everybody else except the person that made you angry? it gets complicated but the awareness is necessary.. nobody fixes anything until they can see it\u2019s broken. I hope that you may find this information useful\u2026 (seriously not trying to be an asshole here\u2026. :) LM Blair ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a very good question. Loads of ideas here. I\u2019ll try to add something different. It is a tricky thing, because people do vary, and what works with someone may not work for another. It sounds like a good dissertation subject. :) I suppose that the trick is to solve the problem and still be \u201cyou\u201d. I\u2019ve been \u201cthat person\u201d myself. For example, if I feel that I\u2019m not being listened to, my speech gets more vehement, less pleasant, and faster, even though my usual sound is a moderate tempo and easy-going. Following that thought, do you find that this happens in particular situations, such as emotionally charged situations? Or does it happen during everyday speech? As a side note, one very unfortunate thing is that women are held to a different standard than men in such situations, especially business situations. When some man is stern and commanding in sound, that\u2019s viewed as authoritative. When a woman does that, she\u2019s labeled with nasty names. That\u2019s our wonderful screwball society at work. Not much we can do about that until society catches up, I guess. Apart from that\u2026. It sounds like people have told you that they don\u2019t like your tone of voice. I imagine that was quite unpleasant to hear. If that\u2019s the case, and it\u2019s not too fraught, maybe you could ask them what they didn\u2019t like. Also, maybe you have a trusted friend who will give you honest feedback. Another thought is to record your voice and listen to it. Does it sound good to you? To generalize a bit, as a city person, your cadence may be considerably faster than a rural person, who may find it disturbing, rightly or wrongly. It could be louder, too, as somebody amongst loads of people on a daily basis may need to project their voice to simply be heard. If it seems like that\u2019s happening, slowing down a tad may be an interesting experiment, and trying lower volume. Different groups of people, whether by ethnicity, culture, region, nationality, etc., may have different ideas about offensiveness and politeness in speech. When one is amongst different types of people, different speaking strategies can be used, and I do this sometimes. Maybe other ideas could be tried. If it\u2019s an emotional situation, counting to ten before a response could help, as well as taking a nice deep breath. I forget to do this myself, and sometimes it shows. On that same subject, a random idea (that might be bunk) would be to breathe deeply when talking, sort of getting a relaxed yoga-like feeling to it. Here\u2019s a thought - if most people think you sound fine, maybe the rest of them should just get a bleeping life. :) Good luck! It\u2019s not fun when people find us offensive! ",
