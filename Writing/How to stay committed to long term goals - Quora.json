            "answer_text": "Essentially: Make sure you remind yourself of the effect of your work along the way and make your journey the goal. Take, for example, the goal that you want to help build 100,000 homes for people who cannot afford to purchase homes themselves. As soon as you create this goal forget it and focus on each home you build. Focus on the family that gets to live there, the happiness this will bring them and the overall effect this has on both your own emotions and what it does to the world. But do not look at the 100,000 homes. That goal was an excuse to start going on this journey!  I mean, if, by the end of your life, you only built 50,000 homes, would it really matter? What about 10,000 homes? What about 1? If you can just give one family a home to live in, wouldn\u2019t that already mean something? It\u2019s that part of your goal that you want to connect to and not the end goal. Regardless of your goal you want to commit to the small, individual aspect and keep reminding yourself of what it does. Every day think about that family that gets to live in the house you\u2019ve built and think about what you have done already, and then only look at the very next house you are building right now. Look at the step in front of you, always, and remind yourself every day that every step you take matters. ",

            "answer_text": "I see some of my fellow Quora-citizens have already tried answering your question, and there\u2019s not much I can add. I\u2019ve been trying to specialize in \u2018\u2019life coaching\u2019\u2019 over the past couple of months, and this is a question that seems to be asked a lot. Here\u2019s my take on it! The only surefire way to stay committed to long-term goals is to not set long-term goals at all. \u2018\u2019What? You are kidding me right?\u2019\u2019 No, I am not! While it\u2019s okay to envision what you want in the future and set that as a goal, that should not be your only one though. The key is to decide what you want in the future and set small short-term goals to achieve that! Short-term goals are easier to achieve and therefore will give you more satisfaction than working towards a long-term goal and achieving that in 5 year. The more satisfaction you have, the easier it will be to stay committed! Imagine, when you want to lose 20KGs of weight, you will be pissed off if you haven\u2019t achieved that goal after 3 months. In contrast, when you say you\u2019d like to lose 1KG every month, and you crush that goal again and again, it\u2019s easier for you to keep going. And at one point, you\u2019ll also have lost the 20KGs. A marathon consists of thousands of little steps! ",
