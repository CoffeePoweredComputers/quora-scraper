            "answer_text": "Most professors don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re showing up for class. There is no checklist, nobody is reading out an attendance card, it\u2019s not any kind of required school you\u2019ve been in. You\u2019re paying for it, anyhow. If you want to use the service you\u2019re paying for, that\u2019s ultimately up to you. In my third year of mathematics, I was in upper division Linear Algebra with Ken Ribet. It\u2019s normal to be taught by top notch mathematicians at Berkeley. That class had about 100\u2013200 students in it. It\u2019s likely that this wasn\u2019t the only class that Ribet taught. It wasn\u2019t a room. The place looked like this.  I\u2019m fairly certain this is a picture of the exact auditorium the class was taught in. The only person that anybody recognized when absent was a student who I regarded as a genius. This student would consistently correct Ribet on his board. Ribet is a world renowned mathematician, credited for paving the way towards Andrew Wile\u2019s proof of Fermat\u2019s last theorem. If this student was missing, anybody would know. The room would be quiet and the faces would all look the same. For the most part, the students in these classes were studious, quiet, and hardworkers. They didn\u2019t ask questions and mainly listened in on the lectures. In fact, anybody could simply walk in and audit the classes. On several occasions, I would notice people around 50\u201360 years old who were not students sitting in and taking notes. The professors didn\u2019t care. If you were there to learn, awesome. If you were there to ask questions or correct mistakes, awesome. If you didn\u2019t want to attend, the curve is stated on the syllabus and your grade is composed of one half midterm and one half final. This was the upper division course, too. There was a differential equations course, the last course you take in your lower division line-up. That course had something like 500 students in it. If you didn\u2019t show up the entire semester, nobody would know. The only important thing for those classes was that your student ID was on the midterm, homework, and final.  One addendum: For most courses with a lot of students, the class gets split up into additional discussion sections. These are additional classes you take with the teacher\u2019s assistants, or graduate students, who teach you the material in depth. These classes tend to be smaller and far more helpful than any lecture. If you didn\u2019t attend one of those, the TA would probably notice. In fact, I would argue that it is absolutely essential to attend your discussion sections while the lecture could be viewed as supplemental. I hold this view because Berkeley, like any elite college, has a lot of professors that are busy with research or out doing activities you would expect out of a Nobel laureate. It\u2019s not uncommon for a professor to backseat their students while pursuing research. ",

            "answer_text": "I am appalled by Robert Smith\u2019s answer especially the statement that lower tier universities care but higher tier schools do and should not. My concern goes back to what we know about adult learning. Much has been written about this and I have summarized elsewhere on Quora. The core is that adults learn best when they are a) working on issues of relevance and importance to them, b) actively involved, and c) in discussions that challenge their assumptions (VABEs) about the way the world is or should be. I taught at the Harvard Business School and the Darden School at University of Virginia. We used cases and \u201ctechnical notes\u201d (summaries of current and relevant theories, not just one theoretical approach). Field cases put real business (or medical or technical or military\u2014in use at Quantico) problems in front of students without implying a \u201cright\u201d answer \u2014 for many issues none exists. Coming to class ahead of time, having read and analyzed the case and theory for the class (often 3 or more a day), and participating actively in the debate with from 20\u2013100 peers who have also read the material is central to the case method approach. Coming to class late interrupts the developing focus and energy in the room. Not coming at all hurts the absentee AND the other 99 because they miss out on your perspective, experience and analysis. Further, every case class is a leadership laboratory for each student as they try to persuade their classmates (forget the instructor whom you\u2019ll never see after this year). One watches what works and doesn\u2019t work in terms of influencing your peers\u2014and essential skill in the world. (For more see my book, Teaching Management published by Cambridge University Press.) Instructors who lecture to or embellish a book or assigned reading are adding virtually nothing to the learning of the students, learn very little about what the students are getting or not getting, ignore the education, work experience and personalities of the people in the room, teach students not to read the material since it\u2019s \u201ccovered\u201d in class, and miss out on assessing one of the most important student insights, how to influence in a group. Clearly, I am not a fan of lectures\u2014I\u2019ve sat through my share of them at Stanford, BYU, and Harvard. A skilled case instructor will pick cases that match the students and the topics at hand, pick technical notes and chapters that inform on current theoretical views, assume that students can and will read the material, insist that students come on time and prepared, ask carefully crafted questions that stimulate discussion, call on people who don\u2019t volunteer, spread the opportunities to speak across the room, make appropriate notes and diagrams on chalkboards, flip charts, etc. for the visual learners, use and move seamlessly among various channels of communication like video clips, overheads, PowerPoints (sparingly), use poignant role plays as implied by student comments, manage time, manage energy, include humor, avoid any disruption to the flow of the discussion, encourage near end class reflection and insight making, and grade/assess the participation of all students after each class. Class participation comprised 50% of our grading systems. So, the very highest tier schools who develop learning systems that recognize what we know about adult learning will demand attendance, preparation, and participation\u2014because the combination of all of that accelerates the learning of everyone in the room. We very successfully used case method in all ten disciplines\u2014accounting, economics, decision analysis, finance, marketing, operations, ethics, leadership and organizational behavior, strategy and communications. In my experience over 40 years involved in worldwide academics, it\u2019s the schools that rely primarily on lecture method, whatever tier one sees them in, that don\u2019t care. ",

            "answer_text": "I am qualified to answer this, because I am a professor at an Ivy League university. No, I dont care. Indeed, students that can succeed without hand-holding are commendable. But the answer for the entire higher-education system is more complicated. However, I try to 'package' what I teach with my own lessons from life and consulting. To give something the books can not give. Moreover, I think (hope) the way I have put together my disciple(s) is unique - and will save my students years trying to do it for themselves\u2026just like I wish my professors would have done with/for me. This being said, many lower ranked universities - those letting in less intellectually curious and more sheepskin seeking \u2014 need to require professors to care. Attendance represents a crucial signal when deciding if a student is keen but less able. In practice, most professors I know will grade students that try hard more easily. I personally think that results (comprehension and demonstrated ability to use the material) beats signs of trying hard (like attendance). But not all professors have the luxury of grading only on results/grades. I should also highlight the useful role that feedback from students plays in the way we teach (and sometimes even think)! If students do not attend, we can not know if our 'pitch' is good. Namely, are explanations clear and helpful? Are there alternative ways of thinking about a theory or precedent? Only direct feedback can help. As an aside, I should note that my students must attend 'class.' We teach here mainly by one-to-one tutorial. Reading their weekly essays is the only way we can assess students (though their degree results are often largely dictated by government administered exams run outside our sphere of influence). There are apocraphal stories of students never attending lectures and blowing off tutorials, and still getting a first-class or 2:1 degree. So to summarize, it should not matter. It does matter in many places. And it must matter when student participation detemines their grade/result. END ",

These days, in-class attendance is supplemented by online classroom environments and recordings of lectures, so if one is hit by the proverbial bus and can\u2019t attend, you can always engage your class and tutors online. It won\u2019t be an adequate substitute for attendance and engagement for every kind of class, though. As for whether Professors might care if students don\u2019t attend, I\u2019ll leave you with a story I heard from the late 80s, from an Australian university where students had taken to setting up those old micro-cassette recorders to record the lectures they couldn\u2019t stay for. As the weeks rolled by, in a particular lecture hall, at this particular Australian uni, the lecturer (the hero of our story), noticed that the numbers of orphan tape recorders on tables was growing. It got to the point where he was essentially lecturing a room full of cassette recorders set up to record his voice.  So, the following week, as students entered to set up their recording devices on each table, he pulled out his own cassette device, and pressing PLAY, departed the lecture hall. :) ",

So I\u2019ve been privy to to what a lot of professors said. (And left unsaid.) For the most part, the answer seems to be yes \u2014 assuming they care about the teaching aspect of their job. (You might, unfortunately, encounter some faculty members who only care about their research, or who are so burned out they don\u2019t care about anything.) They prepare for their classes and stand up there giving their lectures for a reason, after all. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re sticklers for attendance, however. In the case of large lecture classes \u2014 which I suspect you\u2019re primarily asking about \u2014 trying to do that kind of record-keeping would be impractical. And the general attitude I encountered was that college students were considered adults, and if they missed classes they could deal with the consequences (if any) on their own. ",

            "answer_text": "Do professors in college care if you show up to class? Some do, some don\u2019t. Some professors believe college students are young adults and have the right to choose. I kinda believe that to a point, but also know a bit about teaching and learning too. For a lot of good reasons, I did a fair number of group exercises in class, including how to form, lead, problem solve, and communicate in groups. Most people in organizations work in groups, so these are important skills. They are also highly valued by employers. If you think those are not important and worth going to class for, just browse around Quora, and check out all the bitter complaints about stupid bosses (can\u2019t lead) horrid co-corkers (can\u2019t communicate) nasty companies ( can\u2019t plan or problem solve.) I also attached a participation grade to these group exercises. Although it was possible to earn a B, it was not possible to earn an A in my class without participating in the class exercises. Some people had to skip class for work or for family reasons. I understand that and worked with those students so they could earn an A. Reading the book and passing the exam is not thinking or learning, it is rote memorization. I could write a simple software program or maybe train a monkey to do that. Although I always treated my students with respect and kindness, I find it hard to respect the behavior of someone dumb enough to pay all that money and get into that kind of debt, and not get every scrap of learning possible out of a class and a professor. It\u2019s also possible to take online degrees from some very fine schools for those who need more flexibility in scheduling courses. Some of these provide fully accredited degrees. ",

            "answer_text": "I certainly do, but, when teaching large 100+ classes, some professors won\u2019t and realistically, can\u2019t care about attendance. Attendance isn\u2019t some kind of vote on how much you like the prof or the material. Attendance \u2014when backed up by being prepared (having done the assigned readings, problems, homework, lab work\u2014and when accompanied by baying careful attention, taking good notes, and, if possible, asking questions about anything you don\u2019t understand does more than help you master the material. It helps the professor \u201cread\u201d the level of preparedness, background learning, etc. of the class in general and alter the lectures to fill knowledge gaps that are important if studenta are going to grasp the material. Most professors take great care in planning out their syllabi: presenting the right amount of material each day, making lectures relevant to students who have a variety of learning styles. Your questions and comments are how I judge, each day, what I need to do to \u201creach everyone.\u201d In smaller classes (say, 40 or fewer students) discussion is vital to helping students go beyond learning material \u2014learning the facts\u2014you also need to develop skills: of reasoning, of writing, of explaining. You learn them by doing them with a coach-me-and with feedback from your peers\u2014other students. So, yeah, I do care whether you attend, but if you\u2019re sleeping or texting throughout class you are attending but not attentively. Your understanding, your test scores, your grade for the course will all suffer for that. Don\u2019t cut corners by cutting class. You\u2019re only cheating yourself. ",

Add to the yawn fact the total terror factor that many had on day one of AC 101 and you have a recipe for not wanting to show up. I took the classes with the non-DP/Accounting majors. I cared that you showed up in that I created material that I believed made these subjects a lot more interesting. If you wanted that business degree at RBI, you had to get past these two classes. You could take them from me, the one time entertainer, or my hard nosed colleagues. I was able to show almost everyone who put in their time that neither subject required that you be a math whiz, science genius, programmer or anything close to. All the same, I wasn\u2019t going to chase you around campus, call you at home or send you mail if you didn\u2019t attend. (No email back then.) I and my colleagues tried to relate what we taught to what you\u2019d encounter on the job. Part of that is that many bosses don\u2019t care, in the sense of \u201ccaring about you as a human,\u201d if you don\u2019t show up for work. They care about their budget, about having to hire again and that sort of thing. Much like when I was in a band, I cared that you liked what I played and that I put on a show that was worthy of your money. Along those lines, I always did my best to do my part. But hey, if you don't like Jazz-influenced blues or Accounting or just don\u2019t like to get up in the morning \u2026 so be it. ",

Yes, if you show interest and helps the class by asking questions that could help the entire class - there are many who do have questions, but seem afraid to ask - and a student who is not afraid to ask will actually help everyone. Yes, when you show a desire to learn that can be infectious actually - and will actually stimulate the instructor to do better and expand the boundaries (I know it did for me). No - if you are disruptive - if you come to class, open your laptop and start playing solitaire (I have actually seen this and asked the student to leave). No, if you answer your cell phone and talk when the class is in session. If you do not show up for class but then barge into the professor\u2019s office asking questions, seek help - you better be prepared to be asked to leave. Those that do not bother coming to class should not expect to be helped outside of class - unless ofcourse there were good reasons for you to have missed class. If you do not show up for class, do poorly in the exams and expect to get a passing grade - forget it. ",

They are fully grown adults. In my opinion, college students can and should have the choice to come or not to lectures. This is their education. Some students work better by themselves on the course material by themselves at home, and I respect that. Now I\u2019m trying to make the class as interesting and as useful for them as possible, so that they actually do want to come to lectures and tutorials. This is good for me because it forces me to keep my classes up to date, using feedback from students whenever I can. I think classes should work as an exchange, not a one-way knowledge transfer. Note that in Germany and other northern European countries, non-tenured professors used to be paid directly by the students in return for their lecturing. I\u2019m sure these lectures must have been very good ! For those students who do not like my droning or class style, I make my class material fully accessible online and try foster online after-class exchanges. This does not always work very well by the way. Many students seem only interested in their grades. ",

This isn\u2019t high school anymore, you are responsible for your own time management and asking your professor on following up on anything you missed if you had to be absent for one class. Most professors usually post their PowerPoint presentations, announcements for upcoming assignments or exams, and your grades on your Blackboard. You can also send emails to your classmates through Blackboard too, handy for doing group projects. You can pick class at a time that suits you. Morning person, you can pick 8:00 am classes. Night owl, you pick afternoon or evening classes. You get that level of flexibility in college/university. That is what makes college so much better compared to how monotonous high school was. More freedom and individuality along with having more like-minded people is why people prefer college/university over high school. ",

When students do not show up for class, then the problems show up on their papers. I usually do a combination of editing on their papers and a critique that i do orally, using software. It takes about 15 minutes to an hour per paper. If students do not show up for class and then turn in a paper, I find that I am constantly having to go over things on the paper that we covered in class. It slows my time way, way down, it takes away from students who were in class, and it almost always results in a much lower grade. I have heard almost every excuse in the book why students do not show up. One even said, \u201cWell, I was playing basketball.\u201d Fine . . . if you are on scholarship or playing in the NBA.

So in that case, it\u2019s probably all on your shoulders to show up or not. But when the class is small enough for the professor to learn each student\u2019s name, then the professor will definitely care if you show up for class. A big piece of the puzzle here is how the professor decides to teach the class and how that professor decides to grade student performance. If the whole thing is lecture with long exams on the material covered, then as long as you can access the material that was covered in the lecture and you can reproduce it on an exam you could likely pass the class without ever showing up. But if the professor likes to hold discussions and grades students based on their interactions with the course material during those discussions . . . you better be there in the front row. ",

No one likes that message; do not expect a bouquet of roses and a warm letter of recommendation from that professor. If there is a reason for your absence, such as illness, tell the professor about it. If there is some reason why you can\u2019t learn well in that class, also tell the professor. If you are not interested in the subject, drop the class. I don\u2019t see much point in spending four years of your life and a ton of money for college, not going to class. I acknowledge that sometimes a student and a professor don\u2019t mesh, and the student decides to learn the subject from books or from someone else. That may work out, but it should be a rare situation. Generally even if you don\u2019t like the professor you will learn more by going to class than not going. ",

However, I\u2019ll never forget just how much the professors at the NSET department cared about the students\u2019 tracks. Burnout was a common ailment among my colleagues back then. About once a month, some of my professors would email me discussing attendance. I had great attendance records during the first two years, but when Junior year rolled around, my attendance slipped. My professors immediately noticed and brought it to my attention. A lot of my professors taught me for multiple semesters. My advisor was also my professor for Developmental Biology, Immunology, and Cellular Biology, so she took extra care for me and her students. She was stellar and made the best with what she had available. When my grades took a nosedive, she was legitimately upset. She was very passionate to see each and every one of her students succeed, and it touched me to this day. Ultimately, I did in fact drop out, but it was of my own volition. It was required for professors to take attendance at the university since our classes only had 30\u201340 or so people. I think it encouraged the students to go beyond and have great attendance records, but you were allotted 10 missed classes per semester before your grade was irreparably affected. Still, I believe this system was effective for our needs. I\u2019ve sat in a few seminars at Pitt and CMU, and some of them had entire theaters of people. No way in hell to keep track of all those students! It\u2019s a common trope to paint universities simply as a money-grab scheme and full of propaganda, but sweeping generalizations like these are blatant injustice. There\u2019s a lot of good people in higher education who want nothing but the best for you \u2014 you\u2019ll know it when you see it. These kinds of professors inspire students to strive for greatness. Of course, don\u2019t expect your hand to be held. There\u2019s only so much the staff can offer you. You still have to do the work in order to succeed! ",

You had to get there early in the first week as all the seats filled and they closed the doors when it got very crowded. Well over 2000 enrolled in the course and only one class time was available! Thus extreme overcrowding. If late you could not get in. After a week, it was obvious from his lecturing in programming, he did not know what he was talking about. They hired him as a full professor as he designed many a mainframe. The trouble was, he did not know how to program in the languages he was supposed to to each.(I am not even sure he knew how to program at all!) He wrote simple programs on the board and explained how they worked. The trouble was, when we tried them, they never ever worked! It was so bad one student in our year, who did know how to program, denied him access to the mainframe. Any person who tried to log him in also lost access. The upshot, over half the academic staff lost access to the mainframe. They had to shut down the mainframe. Wipe the memory and reconfigure the hard drive. Not one of the lecturers knew how to overcome a simple program. We had three test and you needed to get over 60 in each test to pass. One student got just over 50 in the first test. Another student scrapped a 51 in the third test. Nobody got over 40 in the second test. He was that bad. After 2 weeks we went from standing home only with locked doors to seats available. By the half year mark we dropped below 40% attendance and by late in the second semester there were less than a dozen students. It was reported that some lectures in the final month had no attendance! No roll was taken as it was unthought of that this could happen in a large subject! As every person failed first year, the following year, only those who failed second year were in the second year course. Enrollment in the first year course dropped below 1000. The problem was it was near impossible to get anybody with the skills to teach programming to work for the pay the universities were paying in Australia. My wife\u2019s cousin was first in his year in computing at Cambridge. His starting salary was 300 000 pounds a year or roughly $600 000 plus stock options in the finance sector. A full professor was paid about $120 000 a year in Australia the year he graduated in England. I hate to think what the top MIT and Harvard students would get! This is a reason why many subjects don\u2019t take rolls. It can lead to embarrassing situations like this! ",

            "answer_text": "Lots do, lots don\u2019t, and lots are ambivalent about it. Sort of a Venn Diagram of care. The same can be said about student sincerity on attending class. From my experience, attendance and final grade are correlative, not causative. In other words, attendance is not necessarily tied to success or failure in learning. In my mind, counting attendance is more of a CYA proposition than a valid factor in teaching success. I say this because in higher education there is so little effort put into making professors learn how to be better teachers. Many professors simply waste the student\u2019s time, yet there they are taking attendance each class. In many ways, it is the focusing on the grade based on non-knowledge material that disturbs me, and rewarding a student for good attendance is one such problem. Attendance is also a factor in the traditional roll of the inert student. Students come up through a system that makes learning an observational function rather than an active one. Yes, I'm sure every Jr high and high school teacher out there uses active learning methods and they all teach students the ubiquitous \u201ccritical thinking\u201d skills. Yet, somehow a substantial number of these students can\u2019t actually perform those skills when they show up to college. Instead, they have all learned that the grade, not the knowledge, is the important issue. They also learn how to scam the teacher out of \u201cextra credit\u201d and \u201cattendance points,\u201d which are used to boost a grade above that which actually measures knowledge and ability. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. In general faculty like attendance. It shows students are engaged. Heavy attendance suggests there will be a livelier dsicussion.At many schools, attendance may be required. At my school for example, missing four weeks in a row means you will be dropped. this follows a policy we negotiated with our accreditor.In general, higher attendance correlates to higher grades.That said, Many students especially grad students may have conflicts with other key activities (e.g., conference travel). If that happens and the student makes up missing work, smart professors will be cool.The better the student, the more they can achieve on their own. If a student is getting their work done, the professor may not be worried about a student missing classes.Some students may have already made alternate arrangements. This is common for students on competitive teams with travel commitments. don\u2019t be surprised if a student on a team has already sat down for hours and done their work with a tutor.TLDR: usually attendance improves performance and the class experience, but smart professors know when to make exceptions.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been a long time since I was in college, but back in the early 80s my professors didn\u2019t even take role. The problem was that you just couldn\u2019t pass the exams if you didn\u2019t show up, and often the only two grades for the entire course were the midterm and the final. Talk about pressure. Some universities have attendance requirements\u2014like you can only miss four classes and still get credit. Some professors have graduate assistants you take roll for them. In general, I don\u2019t think professors care if you show up or not and if you pass or not, particularly in those huge lecture classes. Unlike your high school teachers, they\u2019re not going to hunt you down and ask you what\u2019s wrong and how they can help. You\u2019re a big kid now. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. We prepare our lectures with great care. When I taught, my lectures would give an overview based on my insights and experience that the students could find nowhere else. Also, I would get immediate feedback from the students in two ways: 1) I could see if they were paying attention to what I was saying, or if they were bored or restless, and 2) They could ask questions. You might not know this, but even in an auditorium that held 100 students, I could look out and see each person. I also scheduled lab exercises and homework each week, and assigned an individual project, in which each student had to develop a unique questionnaire on a topic that interested him or her. I mentored each student individually at several stages of their projects. I did have 3 TA\u2019s to help out with the labs, and yes, the students were expected to show up to both the lectures and the labs each week. By the way, the individual projects meant they had to do that work themselves, and could not copy someone else\u2019s answers, because each project was different. What if the class is a special seminar or small discussion section in a larger class? You have an even greater obligation to show up and participate. Such sections are designed to help you learn, from the TA and from your fellow students. So, I have a question for you. Why wouldn\u2019t you show up for class? If you are not interested, perhaps college is not the right place for you right now. Why not take a job now to gain experience in a field you might wish to work in later, or volunteer in a developing country to see all that you have now, all that you take for granted, from a different perspective? You might even join a program in which you teach students yourself, to gain another view of what your professors are trying to impart to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Some do and some don\u2019t. Virtually everyone has heard about those students who go to class the first day and then are not seen again until the final. Of course, in some reality but mostly in modern legends, these students all have perfect GPAs, all manage to earn their degrees without ever cracking a book nor ever attending a class. As I said, that is mostly in modern legend. But, as said in the first line of this answer, some profs would almost you prefer that you not show up. Others not only want you to show up but make class attendance a part of your grade with the caveat that if you miss X number of classes, you will fail. College professors are actual human beings that vary widely. Some need an audience to sit like eager pups and lap up the words that spill forth from their mouths as if they were spewing some divine elixir. They need the audience. Others are simply so passionate about their field and are simply busting to share all they know and find others equally enamored. They cannot stand the idea of someone not knowing all there is to know about whatever. Others are in it for the money, managed to get the degrees and then started teaching college because it seemed like an easy gig. they really don\u2019t care unless the university has given value to your class attendance. Generally, your class syllabus will outline attendance requirements. Word to the wise: If your syllabus does not say, don\u2019t ask. Show up as much as you can. ",

I try to ameliorate this by assigning a lot of (graded) homework but the correlation still persists. I only take attendance the first few weeks and only for the purpose of learning my students' names. If a student that misses classes performs poorly in a test I will have a conversation with him/her to see what the problems are and give advice. The students that show up in class and perform poorly don't need any promoting to seek advice: they show up in my office, worried or outraged and I can do something about this. I don't care about attendance as long as it does not affect my students' performance. ",

If \u201cI\u201d didn\u2019t show up for class, for example, the professor might care because I tried to get to know them. Not showing up to class could signal that there is some problem in my life that is preventing me from attending, and professors I was closer to might worry about that. But it\u2019s kind of a self-fulfilling prophesy. If you aren\u2019t showing up for class and your professor can\u2019t pick you out of a crowd, they won\u2019t care because they don\u2019t know you. You are just another seat in their class. But I suspect that if you didn\u2019t care enough about their class to show up, I think they would care even less. You have made a choice as an adult or near-adult. If you don\u2019t care about showing up, why should they? ",

There was a teacher who taught us 3 consecutive semesters and by that time he knew about top 3, front and back benchers and the chamchas. But there was one person he ignored. The middle bencher who scored 4th rank in class. One day I forgot to mark my attendance and when I told him about it his reaction was  And it wasn't just him most of teacher didn't know about me. But eventually they got to know about me because I used to solve alot of questions and hide them and they checked & remembered my name.

Some professors are very well aware of who is there and who isn't, especially if they don't have 100 or more students in their classes.

I do not care in that I think my lecture or class discussion is just one tool at your disposal (along with course readings, assignments, research papers, supplemental videos and class materials, databases, etc.). I have no ego invested in you being present. I care in the case of universities that require me to take attendance, because I have to submit attendance reports. I do not care because you are adults. You can make your own choices. And you can suffer the natural consequences - like the fact that students who do not show up to class regularly do more poorly on exams and in their writing than those who are present and engaged. I care because I know that if you are not in class, and you do not read the syllabus, and you do not check in on Blackboard or Brightspace or whatever we are using, you will suddenly face a crisis at the end of the semester and email me lengthy complaints about why your C+ (which really should have been a low D) ought to have been an A-.

There was also a notable correlation between attendance and performance on assessments and projects. My college teaching experience was limited to teaching teacher certification courses in psychology and classroom management. You also had to read the assigned educational research articles, as classroom discussions quickly established if you'd done the reading or not. Like many college-level instructors, I did not take attendance after the first few weeks, but did grade the daily work completed in class. It was pretty easy to pass my courses. All you had to do was show up, do the reading, participate in the classroom discussions, and say something reasonably cogent during the discussions. Yet, some people were not able to do those simple tasks. ",

And, you the first, should want to attend class. It\u2019s kind of how the process is meant to work. Some professors may have become jaded and cynical and don\u2019t care much; but I suspect (hope!) those professors are in the distinct minority. Viewed differently, this question is like asking a store owner: do you care if anyone comes into your store and buys your products? The answer should obviously be a resounding yes! For either full-time faculty or adjunct/part-time faculty, they are loosely equivalent to the vendor\u2014in this case peddling knowledge. Viewed this way, of course they want you to attend class. Even after years of teaching, I hope they have enough love of their topics and love of the process of informing inquisitive minds as to be motivated to teach. And any motivated teacher worth their salt wants motivated students to engage with. So, fair question, but after my verbose wandering, hopefully you can see that from your professors\u2019 points of view, you should definitely go to class. I hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Full disclaimer: I am not a college professor. However, as someone who has taken four years worth of college courses, I think I can give perhaps a teensy amount of insight. For the vast majority of my classes, attendance was mandatory. Professors ensured this through the use of iClickers, daily in-class assignments, pop quizzes, and so on. Of course, this may be something particular to my major, but from anecdotal feedback I have learned that it is this way in many other majors (and universities around my area) as well. One important thing to note is that not all of my classes were taught by professors. Some were taught by lecturers, and all of my labs were taught pretty much exclusively by teaching assistants. Variation existed between different instructors as well; not all professors (or lecturers or TAs) will care. For the most part, professors who did not make attendance obligatory still cared whether or not students showed up. They noticed, and some of them would call us out on it during and after class. By the end of the semester, the instructor often knew which faces (if not names) were usually present, if the class had 50 or fewer people in it (i.e. if it was not a class that took place in a lecture hall). So in my experience, most professors do care, even if attendance isn\u2019t mandatory. ",

You'll care if you don't show up when your grade reflects that you are behind on the work and lack understanding of the material. Bad habits start early, better to ask yourself why am I wasting my or my parent's money on college and not showing up to class. You will end up on academic probation by making cutting classes a habit. Look at it like this. Your education is your job, how long will your boss wait until he/she fires you for chronic absenteeism?

The professor wouldn\u2019t care if you: Never showed up for classNever completed assignmentsNever took exams.You would earn an F for the course and fail. It\u2019s that simple. At universities like Tech, students are weeded out. Some will tell you that you graduate from that university by attrition\u2026 Universities like this make it understood that it is the student\u2019s responsibility to get themselves to class, to study without being told, to do that which is necessary without being led by the hand. Other universities are more compassionate. Where a school like Tech weeds students out, other universities try to retain students. And professors there often actually pay attention to attendance. Personally, I believe professors should never have to worry about: Taking attendanceAssigning homeworkGiving quizzesGiving reading assignments or worksheetsIf you want to learn the subject, then show up to class, listen to the lecture, take notes, and then go study. How long should you study? Until you understand the material. What do you study? Everything and anything you can that helps you learn the material. THAT should be the choice and responsibility of the student. ",

In a large class, the instructor can\u2019t tell if you show up or not, but in a small class, it\u2019s obvious. If the class has less than 15 students, please show up for every meeting that you can. These are the best classes and student participation makes them that way. Small classes can include a lot of interaction that make for a better education. There are a lot of other factors that determine whether the instructor cares, not the least being his or her personality, but class size is one major factor. ",

Large lecture sections with published source material and notes isolate students from instructors. But participants in small classes at senior levels where you know your prof tend to be quite involving, and there is much to miss. Professors are working for a living; good attendance (and good reviews) supports gaining tenure. Writing and researching compete with classroom instruction for a tenured professor\u2019s time; his attention to students\u2019 attendance can flag. After all, a student is primarily responsible for what happens to him at college; you want to skip lectures? OK. ",

I really don\u2019t understand why anyone would pay to attend a class and then just not go. If the class is irrelevant, you can drop it. You can even drop without losing money by doing it within a certain period of time (albeit short) or you can drop later without grade consequence.

Classes are small, usually 3 to 5 students, and 10 at most. Hence, when a student did not show up, there is a glaring absence in the class. My method of teaching is to have the students read the required material and showcase their knowledge by lecturing and sharing with fellow students their understanding of the material. My job as a professor is to extend and help integrate the material from books, research papers, and students\u2019 input and ideas. I do understand it is different from undergraduates where intro classes could have several hundred students, and the professors could only know handfuls of students. Hence, attendance may be up to the student or the TA who is in charge of attendance. When I was an undergraduate in an ethics class, I had a professor who at the very first class noted students are pre-occupied with grades. He announced that everyone would get an A in the class, and the students just need to pay attention to understanding the material and not the grade. In the next class, almost nobody showed up. This professor learned his lesson and reversed his decision of giving everyone an A. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. This is a question at the nexus of two important, but opposite concepts for what is good for students. On the one hand, I don\u2019t care. A big part of going to college is taking responsibility and learning to do your best job to complete assignments. That\u2019s what employers want. So I shouldn\u2019t have to take attendance. Students should act as adults. Students should come to class to do their best job of learning. But they don\u2019t\u2026 So on the other hand, many studies show that students who don\u2019t come to class don\u2019t learn nearly as much and do poorly with their grades. So I must take attendance and count it as part of the grade. The difference is often that between having 75\u201380% attendance (with a penalty for not attending) to 25\u201330% attendance. I can\u2019t in good conscience let my students damage their prospects by demonstrating that they are not adult enough to be responsible. So I must treat them like children. ",

Your tuition was paid for already so the school has your money. So it\u2019s totally up to you to do the right thing or not. I understood why the professors said that. It\u2019s college and not high school. There were no letters home or parent conferences. You were an adult and it was up to you to pass or fail, attend or not. My daughter teaches in college. Part of her job is to log in class attendance. Many 101 classes require that you attend 80% of the time. These classes give you an automatic passing grade if you attend each but did no work. If you did work you get a better grade. My daughter asked about the attendance requirements and she was told that many students receive scholarships or tuition assistance money. Many require that the student attend class. In today\u2019s computer age, it\u2019s easy to log in who attends and who doesn\u2019t. It is understandable that if your tuition has been covered, the agency that pays it would like to know you didn\u2019t waste it. ",

In my current position (a regional public university), I care and require my students to send me an e-mail if they are going to be absent. I care as most important part of the learning process is the class interactions. If you miss a class, that will affect other students. When I was teaching at a SLAC, I was even more strict as my classes were small and even missing two students meant I had to change my lecture plan. Moreover, our advising was very hands-on, so I even cared if one of my advisees missed any class even if it was taught by another professor. At another institution, I was teaching a service course (i.e. +150 students) and really did not care who was there or wasn\u2019t. I mean, I wasn\u2019t even sure how many students I had.

For most professors the interaction with students is one of the most important things in their lives. They understand that some absences are to be expected; that\u2019s why there are usually a number of allowed absences. But ordinarily a lot of what you learn does depend on how the material is presented. And one of the most important things you may learn is what that particular professor thinks about the material. Because most subjects are not simple and clearcut. There is usually a subjective element. If the professor is interested, ideally passionate, about the subject, you are coming into contact with a point of view. That\u2019s what makes a subject come alive. ",

There\u2019s no point in enrolling in a class if you don\u2019t have the time or inclination to master the material. And at today\u2019s tuition prices, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.

I also prepared my lessons so that students would enjoy participating in lectures. My method of teaching involved asking questions at critical moments to provoke thinking. My knowledge is that students are more likely to fail if they do not attend lectures. I also felt that if the students are not attending my lectures than my lectures must be boring and uninteresting. For these reasons, I cared if the students showed up and participated in my lectures. For me, it was not just a question of showing up, it was also a question of active participation or sitting at the back of the class, on the last row, nearest the door. ",

Classes should be places where you engage with the material as well as with your professors and the other students, raise good questions that others may not have thought about - and therefore contribute to your own education as well as that of the rest of the class. Did I care if every student was in attendance at every class? No. And I never took attendance. But I noticed whether every student was engaged or not.

In a few American colleges, a small number of cuts may result in a student's being failed in a course; this is the way it was during my first two years at college. Draconian. That system in now quite rare\u2014probably to the relief of almost all professors; they have better things to do than waste time calling roll every meeting. Even today, however, if a student fails to attend a very small seminar, say Ancient Greek, the professor will definitely care, as that absence could reduce the quality of the class for the other students. Few colleges can afford to offer undergraduate classes for 3\u201310 students, but, if you are taking such a course, you\u2019d best show up or have a good excuse.

Another thing I learned was that each class that a student missed resulted in an approximately 10% lower grade on the next exam. Moreover, students who missed five or more classes nearly always failed the class. I shared these results with my students on the first day of class and, for those absent on the first day, in the syllabus. I was required to take attendance, so I gave a short quiz at a random point during the class on each day that there was not an exam. That helped with improving attendance. ",
