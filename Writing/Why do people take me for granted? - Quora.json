            "answer_text": "From a person who's suffered from this dillema for years, I can point out a few of the reasons I believe fanned the flames of it; 1. Always being helpful. Though it's a good thing helping others in need, too much of it can lead people to believe that you'd always be there no matter what and you'll be the first person they'll think of when they're stuck in a situation. Once they're used to it, they'll mostly forget about the troubles you go through for them or what it took you to do whatever they wanted you to, hence after a period of time they start taking you for granted. Helping is good, but sometimes you gotta let them learn how to help themselves. You're not always gonna be there, are you? 2. Not voicing out your own opinion/Faking your opinion in order to please people or just not to hurt them. Your choices, your opinions are different from most and you have to acknowledge and cherish this fact. You were born with an individual persona and you have the right to state your likes and dislikes. At times, we don't present our original feelings or try to fake them in order to impress someone or save them from the truth. Sometimes it's ok but if you keep doing that, people will tend to forget about your own outlook and enforce their own perceptions on you regardless of how it makes you feel. Don't be afraid to introduce your individual personality.  3. Giving in to a situation/Apologising when it's not your fault. A lot of times we just want to save ourselves of the needless drama that a fight can create. Be it in order to avoid such fights or be it because we love that person, many times we end up apologising even when it's not our fault. No, it's not ok. Fabricating the truth is never an option. If you give in today, you will only be expected to give in the next time as well regardless of what the issue is leading to people taking you for granted. If you believe it's not your fault, peacefully try and explain your situation while also acknowledging their mindset. Even if nothing works out, at least it will be established that you didn't take the fall for it and neither will you do it again for something that wasn't your mistake. 4. Suppressing your emotions. If you're hurt by something, why be quite about it? Why not let them know it didn't feel right? By all non-violent and non-hurtful means you must express your true emotions whatever it might be. Being taken for granted is just another way of saying that people know how you would react to a certain situation always. Consider this, you're silently walking down a street and this homeless guy with a lost mind throws a stone at you. It hurt you, but who would want to argue with a lost case? You let this continue for a few days and now you have successfully let that guy believe that he can fill in the void of your emotions and that he can carry on pleasing himself. Rather than letting things be, you must work out a solution to it and only then will people know that you're not indifferent to their actions and that you're a firm believer of Newton's third law of motion.

            "answer_text": "Because you allow them to! People take you at your own valuation, so you need to be able to like and respect yourself. Then you will be able to say \"no\" and command respect for yourself. A good way to do this is by using the \"broken record\" method. I learned this many years ago and have used it occasionally to good effect. Say someone asks you to lend them your car. You need it yourself at that time, so instead of giving in and changing your own arrangements, you say:  \"Flossie, I'd love to lend you my car, but I need to visit my mother this afternoon.\" Flossie: \"Oh, but I have to go shopping and my car's getting fixed and I need to have yours!\" You: \"Yes, I know your car's broken down, Floss, but I need to visit my mother this afternoon.\" Flossie: \"Oh don't be so mean! You can see your mother tomorrow. Please please, let me use your car! I have to go to town.\" You: \"Yes, I understand that you want to go to town, but I need to see my mother this afternoon.\" After that, you walk out of the room or wherever and finish the conversation leaving Flossie to bully someone else. Kindly but implacably you refuse Flossie the use of the car. Without weakening, you are polite but firm - and stick to it!  So you make your own needs known and do a bit of - in the nicest possible way - \"demanding\" on your own account. If these people persist, avoid them! They're not \"into\" you. ",
