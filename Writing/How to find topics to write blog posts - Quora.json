            "answer_text": "Start with a niche in my opinion is the best way to find unique content.  One of my strategy to find topics are by monitoring the social media and Q&A sites.   Every time someone is asking a question in one of these sites is an opportunity for you to write a post about it. For example you can setup a 'listening post' at the followings: 1. Twitter search for a particular keyword or hashtags. e.g. 'Web Development'.2. Stackoverflow.  You must be familiar with this site.3. Quora topics.  I find Quora a good source for post topics. If you find in Google that a specific topic has been written,  don't get discourage.  You can still write the same topic, but in your own style!  Maybe in more details, maybe with more example.  I have written posts that has the same topic with other blogs, but mine comes at the top of Google search for the keyword :) Alternatively you do a curation post, which include links to those written posts about a particular topic.  You know a list post. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it all depends if you actually want traffic to your content or not.  You stated that you want to strengthen your portfolio and image as a skilled web developer, so I'd advise you to go with an \"SEO-in-mind\" approach. Research some javascript and web dev keywords (informational keywords). See which ones you can rank for in Google and focus on those, try finding longtail keywords that have low competition and high search volume, something like \"how to write a javascript function to check browser details\". I don't know the details of that longtail keyword but I'm sure it gets a decent amount of search volume. HOWEVER, if you're not interested in being found on Google for search queries, I'd suggest you write about what you really enjoy and like, it will make the writing a lot easier and enjoyable. It doesn't matter if it's been covered already (as you're most probably not even going to rank for the saturated queries.) ",
