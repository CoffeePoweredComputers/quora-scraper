            "answer_text": "There is no easy answer to this question, for a few reasons. Technical writers are typically \"back office\" workers; readers and the general public don't know who they are. They often work in teams. If the writers are identified in their publications, often the whole team is named, so you won't know who wrote what. There is no overall ranking for technical writers. There are ways to determine who stands out among their peers, but each of them has drawbacks. Some people have written well-received books about the profession, or have published important research. A few names that come to mind are Karen Schriver, Ginny Redish, Jonathan Price, and JoAnn Hackos. But someone who writes such books probably no longer actually works as a tech writer day to day. People who do such work as their regular job may write for Intercom, the member magazine for the Society for Technical Communication (STC). But it is hard to obtain the magazine unless you are an STC member. And if you did, you would need to read and evaluate the articles yourself: there is no \"best\" list. STC holds local technical communication competitions, and the best entries are entered into an annual competition at the international level. A list of winners of that competition would include some excellent writers. The authors of those entries are identified by name. But the winners are chosen based on a single submission, something the submitter thought was their best work. You won't know about the rest of the person's, or the team's, output. And there are more criteria than simply the quality of the writing. Finally, STC has an honorary rank, Fellow, that is given to a tiny percentage of Society members. You can look up their names. The Society calls these people \"the stars of our profession.\" But again, this is not really about who is the best tech writer in the world. For one thing, only Society members who are already Associate Fellows are eligible, and the candidates are self-selected: they need to apply. The honor recognizes longevity in the profession, and contributions to the profession and/or STC. It indirectly recognizes skill: you don't become so successful in the field without outstanding communication skills. But it is also not just about writing. STC includes editors, artists, managers, web designers, and other people whose work falls under the broad category of \"technical communication.\" EDIT IN 2019: Part of this answer is no longer true. STC has stopped holding the annual international technical communication competition. There are still some local competitions, though. ",

Ugur has been multitasking for a while in the techcomm community: he has been consistently updating his blog, doing public speaking, answering questions on technical writing on Quora, has put up several online courses and even has a techcomm YouTube channel. Ugur Akinci is many things and a blogger is one of them. His content is always on point and we highly recommend you check it out! Tom JohnsonHere comes another big name in technical communication - Tom Johnson. His blog on technical writing trends and innovations is huge in the community of technical writers and it has been for a long time. Many bloggers are trying themselves in different roles and Tom Johnson is no exception: he has been into podcasts since forever which feels like a nice addition to the blog. Larry KunzA techcomm specialists with 40 years of experience in help authoring. Larry Kunz is also teaching product management in the Technical Communication certificate program at Duke University. Larry is one of the tech writers who witnessed the evolution of technical communication and he speaks about that on his blog, too. Younger technical writers sure have a lot to learn from this expert. Larry Kunz writes about style guides, gives professional advice to fellow writers, and, at times, his blog gets quite personal - he gives his perspective on many things that are happening worldwide.
