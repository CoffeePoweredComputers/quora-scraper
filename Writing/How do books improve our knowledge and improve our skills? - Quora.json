            "answer_text": "Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, once answered this in an interview when asked about the keys to his success. Pointing to a stack of books he said, \u201cRead 500 pages like this every day. That's how knowledge works, it builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it.\u201d That's still the best answer I've found. Knowledge builds up over time when you read. Now how does that translate into skills? That requires acting on your knowledge, practicing what you've learned. If all you ever do is read but do not act on the knowledge, you might know a lot, but your abilities are unlikely to significantly improve. You can read about martial arts all you want for example, but until you practice it you will not be able to master it. It's the same with virtually any subject. ",
