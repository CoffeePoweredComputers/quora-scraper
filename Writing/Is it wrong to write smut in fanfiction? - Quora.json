            "answer_text": "Not necessarily\u2026everyone already mentioned tagging/rating properly, so I won\u2019t go into that. There are, in my experience, only two times where it\u2019s wrong to write smut in fanfiction: After a rape sceneWithout contextThe first, I think, is pretty self-explanatory, but it happens constantly in fanfiction. Sometimes you find it in original stories, as well, if they are younger and a little less mature in their writing. For whatever reason, though, writers will make a character go through a rape scene and then almost the very next day will want to have wild sex with the other character that \u201csaved\u201d them. I really don\u2019t understand this. Why even put the rape scene in if all you want to do is write PWP? It\u2019s very weird. The other one is a little more murky. What I mean by \u201cwithout context\u201d is that they\u2019ll have characters who are established as hating each other, they might have an exchange of insults, but one of them will be thinking, \u201cOh, they\u2019re just so sexy, I can\u2019t help myself!\u201d and - BAM - they\u2019re having sex all of a sudden without any real context as to how that happened. Again, I get wanting to write smut scenes, but at least give the tiniest of backstories for why this person suddenly doesn\u2019t hate this person\u2019s guts or twist it into \u201cI hate them because they\u2019re hot\u201d at the very least. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing really wrong with smut. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. I have no issue with smut, with sex and with out and out porn. It\u2019s a free world, baby - live like you wanna live. What I do have an issue with is if you write it then don\u2019t tag it and you don\u2019t give it the correct rating. ESPECIALLY if you write it in what are generally considered \u201cchildren\u2019s\u201d fandoms or \u201cteen fandoms\u201d. Narnia, Harry Potter, Mario, Twilight, Green Gables, Little Women - these are all fandoms where children and young teens regularly read and write stories. And where they generally get their first start at writing stories. So if you are going to write stories in these fandoms you must - MUST - tag them properly and rate them properly. On Archive of our Own you rate them M or E and tag them with \u201cSex\u201d or the like. You make sure that an eight year old reading Green Gables does not come across a scene of Anne and Diana doing the fo-fo-nasty with a bunch of toys. Deadpool, Fifty Shades and so on - these are not fandoms children should be reading. (I am not saying they don\u2019t read them, I am just saying they are not really suitable for kids :)) So I can understand writers being a little more lax, and if a child wanders into the fandom, I can kind of see the writer not being wholly to blame. But yeah - I have no problem with smut, as long as it is properly labelled and tagged and rated. ",
