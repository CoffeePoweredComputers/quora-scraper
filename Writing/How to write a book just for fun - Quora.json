            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t know where to start because you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d for fun. Authors do not write only for fun. Because that isn\u2019t enough. If you don\u2019t have other, more pressing, reasons to write, your book is not likely to be interesting. The easiest reason to start with is \u201cto entertain.\u201d This isn\u2019t, in my experience, a strong reason, but it can lead you to make choices about what does or does not happen in your book; and how things happen; and how you tell the reader what happens. These choices create an interesting experience for the reader. So if you can think of no other reason to write, begin by setting yourself the task of entertaining at least one person other than yourself. You will soon discover that writing with this in mind is a lot more fun that writing just for fun. Right up at the other end of the scale of reasons, is \u201cto rant.\u201d Writers who are driven by a desire to rail against the injustices of the World and the unfairness of an uncaring universe are the writers who produce the most powerful work, who are the most strongly motivated, who (often but not always) write the fastest and who (usually but not always) finish their books. If you are motivated by righteous anger (the best kind, speaking as a writing teacher and appreciator) then it is more difficult to please readers. But if you can write a book with the intent to rant, but you can disguise it as entertainment, then you can join the ranks of the most celebrated and successful authors of all time (what, you want some names? Dickens - furious, Twain - snarky, Pratchett - a semi-active supervolcano of rage). ",

            "answer_text": "Chances are, if you\u2019re wanting to write a book, it\u2019s not going to be \u201cjust\u201d for fun. You probably have a passion for writing, and think it would be something that you\u2019d enjoy doing pretty much every day for a while. But it takes more than just wanting to write a book to write a book. For one, you\u2019ve got to have at least something resembling an idea of the story you want to tell (assuming you\u2019re writing fiction). Do you have characters? A plot? Some kind of defining event? If you have no idea what you want to write about, no characters, no plot or anything like that, it\u2019s no wonder you don\u2019t know where to start. To come up with a plot/characters, etc, try scribbling some notes down in a notebook and let your brain wander in all kinds of different directions. Even for me, someone who just writes in a plot as I go, taking notes has helped organize my plot and characters into something that makes actual linear sense. Ideas and stories are literally all around you, because every single person has a story to tell. The options are endless. In fiction, you don\u2019t have to follow the rules of the real world, you can create your own, or bend some of the rules of the real world (but maybe not gravity) to suit your own needs. If you look around you, you\u2019ll see all kinds of opportunities to bring an idea to light. ",
