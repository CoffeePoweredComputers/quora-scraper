            "answer_text": "I\u2019m trying to figure out what this question is actually meaning to ask. What possible interpretation of the question could lead someone to say that it can\u2019t have curse words in it? I\u2019m at a loss here. \u201cIs it physically impossible to write a poem with a curse word in it?\u201dOf course not. Here, I\u2019ll try one right now: The morning sun will not come out today. The songbird falls to silence in his nest. No more will children run outside to play, And butterflies grow weary with unrest. The fruits, once bountiful, die on their vines; As every surface covers up with frost. The emptiness inside me underlines Unnumbered glories, withered now, and lost. You may well ask what causes all to freeze, Where once the flames of passion brightly burned. If you will listen to my mournful pleas, Then I would like to ask you, in my turn: With all I\u2019ve done to shine within her eye, What does she see in that dumb fucking guy? Yep, I managed to come up with one. So clearly there isn\u2019t anything physically impossible about writing a poem with a curse word in it. \u201cIs something with curse words in it not poetry by definition?\u201dI suppose if you have a highly idiosyncratic personal definition of poetry that excludes anything \u201cindecent\u201d or \u201cimproper\u201d, then maybe. But know that your highly idiosyncratic personal definition is highly idiosyncratic, and also personal. It\u2019s not the definition the rest of us are going by, and you can\u2019t meaningfully ask a question if you don\u2019t agree with other speakers of the language about what the words you\u2019re talking about mean. \u201cIs it immoral to write a poem with curse words in it?\u201dThis question would be addressing an \u201cought\u201d rather than an \u201cis\u201d, and would still come down to personal taste. If you find profanity shocking and are automatically upset by hearing it, then you certainly won\u2019t appreciate a poem like the one I wrote above and may think that it was wrong of me to write it. But, once again, this is very personal; words do not contain the power to shock in and of themselves. It is societies that imbue such words with power, and that is always in flux. Words that were once seriously offensive get diluted and end up sounding silly (\u201cgadzooks\u201d is short for \u201cGod\u2019s hooks\u201d, a reference to the crucifixion of Jesus, and was once a dire blasphemy), while other words that were once perfectly innocuous and mundane can end up becoming too shocking to say in polite company (\u201cshit\u201d was once the normal Anglo-Saxon word for excrement). As you travel the English-speaking world, there are words that are highly offensive in one place and not another (in the UK, \u201cfag\u201d is a completely normal, everyday word for a cigarette, while in the US that same noise is a vile, hateful anti-homosexual slur). And even within the same place, some words are offensive in certain contexts and completely innocent in others (no one cares if you say \u201ccock your gun\u201d or \u201cas the cock crows\u201d, but many, many people will care if you say \u201cthat makes my cock hard\u201d). Words do not have the power to shock outside the context of the time, place, and manner in which they are used. The most you could say is that it\u2019s immoral to use words that are considered curse words right here and now, though you\u2019d have to acknowledge that the logical conclusion to that is that utterances, even poems, can be immoral in one time and place and not in another without changing a single syllable. And even then, that\u2019s down to personal opinion and not an objective rule. If someone isn\u2019t offended by curse words, then they\u2019re not likely to think a poem like the one I wrote above is immoral and conclude that it shouldn\u2019t (or \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d) be done. So, then: Can poems have curse words in them? Yes, I\u2019d say so. For any interpretation of the question I can think of, the answer would have to be that they can. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone\u2019s going to quote Philip Larkin\u2019s \u2018This Be The Verse\u2019. Personally, I prefer a much greater and deeper poem by a much greater and deeper poet: \u2018v.\u2019, a longish 1985 poem by the English poet Tony Harrison (1937-still with us.) Harrison wrote the poem after discovering that his parents\u2019 gravestone in Leeds Cemetery had been vandalised by football hooligans. He wrote the poem to sort out his complex feelings as the child of working-class parents who\u2019d been lucky enough to get a classical education, first at grammar school and then at Leeds University. It begins in a stately, partly conversational mode influenced by Harrison\u2019s classical models (he\u2019s translated a lot of work from Greek and Latin), and slowly gets more salty as Harrison moves on to everyday Leeds speech and graffit: Next millennium you'll have to search quite hardto find my slab behind the family dead,butcher, publican, and baker, now me, bardadding poetry to their beef, beer and bread. With Byron three graves on I'll not go shortof company, and Wordsworth's opposite.That's two peers already, of a sort,and we'll all be thrown together if the pit, whose galleries once ran beneath this plot,causes the distinguished dead to dropinto the rabblement of bone and rot,shored slack, crushed shale, smashed prop. Wordsworth built church organs, Byron tannedluggage cowhide in the age of steam,and knew their place of rest before the landcaves in on the lowest worked-out seam. This graveyard on the brink of Beeston Hill'sthe place I may well rest if there's a spotunder the rose roots and the daffodilsby which dad dignified the family plot. If buried ashes saw then I'd surveythe places I learned Latin, and learned Greek,and left, the ground where Leeds United playbut disappoint their fans week after week, which makes them lose their sense of self-esteemand taking a short cut home through these graves herethey reassert the glory of their teamby spraying words on tombstones, pissed on beer. This graveyard stands above a worked-out pit.Subsidence makes the obelisks all list.One leaning left's marked FUCK, one right's marked SHITsprayed by some peeved supporter who was pissed. But as Harrison develops his first theme, which is what he calls \u2018all the versuses of life\u2019, he then introduces as a counter-voice the voice of the young hooligan who vandalised the gravestone, and this is what made the poem such a sensation when a short film of Harrison was broadcast on British TV in the 80s, because the language of the youth could peel the paint from a door, and soon Harrison starts getting riled enough to drop into the same register himself: What is it that these crude words are revealing?What is it that this aggro act implies?Giving the dead their xenophobic feelingor just a cri-de-coeur because man dies? So what's a cri-de-coeur, cunt? Can't you speakthe language that yer mam spoke. Think of 'er!Can yer only get yer tongue round fucking Greek?Go and fuck yourself with cri-de-coeur! 'She didn't talk like you do for a start!'I shouted, turning where I thought the voice had been.She didn't understand yer fucking 'art'!She thought yer fucking poetry obscene! I wish on this skin's words deep aspirations,first the prayer for my parents I can't make,then a call to Britain and to all nationsmade in the name of love for peace's sake. Aspirations, cunt! Folk on t'fucking dole'ave got about as much scope to aspireabove the shit they're dumped in, cunt, as coalaspires to be chucked on t'fucking fire. 'OK, forget the aspirations. Look, I knowUnited's losing gets you fans incensedand how far the HARP inside you makes you gobut all these Vs: against! against! against! Ah'll tell yer then what really riles a bloke.It's reading on their graves the jobs they did \u2013Butcher, publican and baker. Me, I'll croakdoing t'same nowt ah do now as a kid. 'ard birth ah wor, mi mam says, almost killed 'er.Death after life on t'dole won't seem as 'ard!Look at this cunt, Wordsworth, organ builder,This fucking 'aberdasher Appleyard! If mi mam's up there, don't want to meet 'erlistening to me list mi dirty deeds,and 'ave to pipe up to St fucking Peterah've been on t'dole all mi life in fucking Leeds! Then t'Alleluias stick in t'angels' gobs.When dole-wallahs fuck off to the voidWhat'll t'mason carve up for their jobs?The cunts who lieth 'ere wor unemployed? This lot worked at one job all life through.Byron, 'Tanner', 'Lieth 'ere interred'.They'll chisel fucking poet when they do youand that, yer cunt, 's a crude four-letter word. 'Listen, cunt!' I said, 'before you start your jeeringthe reason why I want this in a book's to give ungrateful cunts like you a hearing!'A book, yer stupid cunt, 's not worth a fuck! 'The only reason why I write this poem at allon yobs like you who do the dirt on death's to give some higher meaning to your scrawl.'Don't fucking bother, cunt! Don't waste your breath! 'You piss-artist skinhead cunt, you wouldn't knowand it doesn't fucking matter if you do,the skin and poet united fucking Rimbaudbut the autre that je est is fucking you.' The argument between Harrison and the youth, which makes up the meat of the poem, is one of the toughest and most moving reckonings I know of a poet confronting the idea that his own work is essentially a waste of time. And when the climax comes, it\u2019s both touching and chilling: Don't talk to me of fucking representingthe class yer were born into any more.Yer going to get 'urt and start resentingit's not poetry we need in this class war. Yer've given yerself toffee, cunt. Who needsyer fucking poufy words. Ah write mi own.Ah've got mi work on show all ovver Leedslike this UNITED 'ere on some sod's stone. 'OK!' (thinking I had him trapped) 'OK!''If you're so proud of it, then sign your namewhen next you're full of HARP and armed with spray,next time you take this short cut from the game.' He took the can, contemptuous, unhurriedand cleared the nozzle and prepared to signthe UNITED sprayed where mam and dad were buried.He aerosolled his name. And it was mine.  That\u2019s not the end of the poem, either. But \u2018v.\u2019, in its scorching way, is one of the greatest post-war English poems, treating in the most direct and unflinching manner the divisions in British society created by class, wealth and education. As well as being a magnificent poem just for its elegance and laconic precision. Plus, it makes Philip Larkin look like a wuss. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course. Some of the oldest poems in existence have swear words. Witness Catullus 16, a poem that\u2019s over 2000 years old. It begins thus: Pedicabo ego vos et irrumabo,Aureli pathice et cinaede Furi,qui me ex versiculis meis putastis,quod sunt molliculi, parum pudicum. Wikipedia gives the following translation: I will sodomize and face-fuck you,bottom Aurelius and catamite Furius,you who think, because my poemsare sensitive, that I have no shame. I know enough Latin and enough about this poem to confirm that Wikipedia\u2019s translation is reasonably accurate. In fact, if anything, \u201csodomize\u201d might be too polite a term. It\u2019s not just Latin, though. The first attested use of the word \u201cfuck\u201d appears in the 1503 Scots poem \u201cBrash of Wowing\u201d, by William Dunbar: As with the glaikis he overgane.Yit be his feiris he wald haue fukkit:\u201cYe brek my hairt, my bony ane.\u201d Translated to modern English, this becomes: As with desire he was overcome.Yet be his behavior, he would have fucked her:\u201cYou break my heart, my bonny one.\u201d (This translation is from the book Word Drops: A Sprinkling of Linguistic Curiosities.) So, as you can see, profanity in poetry is quite old indeed. ",

Roughly: you have so big a cock and so big a nose, you can smell the pointy end when you're excited. Spanish writer Francisco de Quevedo wrote one of the funniest sonnets ever written (according to me, at least). Puto es el hombre que de putas f\u00eda,y puto el que sus gustos apetece;puto es el estipendio que se ofreceen pago de su puta compa\u00f1\u00eda. Puto es el gusto, y puta la alegr\u00edaque el rato putaril nos encarece;y yo dir\u00e9 que es puto a quien pareceque no sois puta vos, se\u00f1ora m\u00eda. Roughly: a man who likes sluts is a slut, the money he pays for their slut company is a slut, his taste and his pleasure are sluts, and I will say that anyone who thinks you are not a slut is a slut, my lady.
