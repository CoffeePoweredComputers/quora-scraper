            "answer_text": "Think of your tablet as a computer first and foremost. Now, work out what you\u2019ll need to accomplish in order to write an entire book. Research.Organizing your research materials.Viewing your research materials.ideation.Organizing your ideation.Writing.Reading what you\u2019ve written.Manipulating what you\u2019ve written.Analyzing your text.Redrafting.Collaborating with an editor.Find apps that run on your particular tablet that are good for the tasks mentioned above. Things like OneNote and Evernote run on pretty much any tablet, and can be used for organizing material. Find some sort of outlining tool or mindmapping app for you to do your ideation on. Find a decent word processor app to do your writing, analysis, and redrafting on. Maybe Google Docs will do the trick. Maybe something else. Doesn\u2019t matter what it is, as long as you can do what you need to do in the app. Lastly, get yourself an external keyboard and mouse, and something that will let you prop the tablet into a comfortable reading and writing position on your desk. Be ergonomically-minded. Writing is a beast. Expect sessions to last anywhere between an hour and three hours. Take frequent breaks. If your setup isn\u2019t ergnomically viable, you\u2019ll soon be in too much pain to write anything, and you\u2019ll rue the day your started your book. Remember the motto that writing is rewriting. But also remember that rewriting comes AFTER writing, not DURING writing. Do not edit until you\u2019re finished your first draft. I finished my novel by following the advice of a writer called Donna Levin. Her book, GET THAT NOVEL STARTED! (AND KEEP IT GOING \u2019TIL YOU FINISH), advised me to sit down for no fewer than 10 minutes EVERY day, including Sundays, and write during those sessions. It works. (Some days, you\u2019ll write for ten minutes. Other days, you\u2019ll burn three hours without even realizing it.) A book is ready to be read by someone other than yourself only after AT LEAST the third draft, preferably the fifth. Redrafting is very very very fricking hard. Harder than writing the first draft. Be prepared for this. Good luck with your book! ",

            "answer_text": "Heya thanks for the A2A. BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD! Seriously, that's how I did it. (Okay, I didn\u2019t finish anything, but I did a lot of work on one). I didn\u2019t have a laptop for 4 or 5 years? A long time and I didn\u2019t feel like I needed one. I had a tablet and a Bluetooth keyboard. Google Docs didn\u2019t cope so well on tablets back then, so I downloaded an app called \u2018writer\u2019 and used that instead. I actually found writing on a tablet much easier too, there was less to distract me, and it was easily transportable. I could crack it open and work on my stories when and where ever, and I often did. In fact, I recently brought a new tablet, because of how much more convenient it is to carry around and bring out whenever. Waiting for coffee? Do some writing, on a bus? break out the tablet. I used to hide it under the bench at work, so when it was quiet I could work on my stories. (It happened often). So how do you write an entire book on a tablet? Get yourself a keyboard - unless you like typing on a screen, then you don\u2019t need one. Then find yourself a writing platform. I like google docs because it autosaves, and to the cloud, so as long as I have an internet connection I can access my work anywhere. (When my tablet died I lost a fair amount of work that I hadn\u2019t transferred across to google docs). I also liked using Writer, because it also autosaved - I learnt from past mistakes that I need autosave. Then, my favourite advice - you just write. Easiest advice to give, hardest advice to follow. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "My experience is working on an iPhone (a somewhat smaller view area). But it is part of a system. I consider the laptop the \u201chome\u201d and the serious work is done there. The Scrivener file is shared between machines via Dropbox. What works on the phone? Taking notes on the go. (Sometimes I have an idea while on a walk and I use speech-to-text to put it into the notes file.) Reviewing work to date. Not editing; just re-reading to remember how it feels and where I left off. First draft of new scenes. I like to take the phone to a cafe. For that, a Bluetooth keyboard is mandatory. You lose too much screen space and your typing speed goes down far too much. Oddities in the MacOS means I have to go back and fix things like capitalization in dialog but working in a public place keeps me going. What doesn\u2019t work? Well, access to notes is poor. I like to have multiple notes files and reference images and although I can put the important ones inline it isn\u2019t as good as having them on a split screen or a keystroke away. Serious edits. Anything that involves shifting/replacing/saving blocks of text is a chore on a touch screen. Planning. Although I can certainly type ideas into a text file, I block out plots and settings and action scenes and all sorts or other things with scratch paper, index cards, and also software tools like Scrivener\u2019s Corkboard. I\u2019ve tried out a couple of outliner and charting tools as well and they have helped although they haven\u2019t been integrated into my process yet. Research. Multiple tabs, one-click access to browser history, ability to smoothly read index and search pdfs, and of course a large display for images and maps\u2026yeah, priceless. The thing to remember most of all is it takes most of us a 2\u20134 hour session to crank out from 500 to 1,000 words. So whatever machine you write on, you will be sitting in front of it for a bare minimum of 200 hours, realistically over 600. Whatever perceived advantage in portability there may be in the tablet, that kind of work sounds to me a lot more like at a proper desk in a comfy chair with a nice pair of headphones. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the short answer is, you turn it on and start typing. It is a device. You can write a book on a desktop computer, on a laptop, on a tablet, a phone, or on paper with a typewriter or pen or pencil. The means of putting words down is irrelevant. Many believe that using a pen is the only way. Personally I think an Astrohaus Freewrite and Apple iMac are better for me personally, but it\u2019s all a matter of personal choice. I would ask why you would want to use a tablet, because it\u2019s not the best device. The screen is not ideal (depending on the make and model); typing on a screen will be a slow and uncomfortable process too. If you are determined to use a tablet, my advice would be to use one that can take advantage of a bluetooth keyboard, and invest in the best keyboard you can afford. You need something that you can use comfortably. Also make sure you get a good stand for the tablet, so that it\u2019s at a good angle for you without intrusive reflections. However, I would seriously consider buying something like a Freewrite if you can. It would be a vastly better investment than a tablet if you are serious about writing. Best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "First, find out what bluetooth is. Next, obtain a bluetooth keyboard, bluetooth version 4 is good today. (I have a Logitech k480 and like it,) Take the keyboard home and figure out where the bluetooth hookup is on your phone. Start in \u201csettings\u201d and read down until you find it. Set the switch to on. Set the keyboard switch to on. Set the select switch to 1. On my keyboard there are three selections, so one can run your phone, another your iPad, etc. Start typing on the keyboard until you see characters on your tablet. If you don\u2019t see characters after a bit, check switch settings, switch on is indicated by red sometimes, but on my k480 is on when switch is set to green\u2014also an led goes on. Now you should be set up. Now you type for 2000 hours and when that grueling feat is complete, you have a novel. It\u2019s good to have pads and paper for planning and a tape recorder for when your fingers get raw and bloody and swear at you. You can talk into a digital recorder about as big as your thumb, transfer the audio files to your computer, then convert talk to type. That gives you capability to record anywhere, and believe me, you can pile up a lot of pages that way. You can also use the recorder to record scenes you want to use in your book, like outside and inside for a robbery\u2014stuff like that. ",

I wouldn\u2019t choose to do this, personally - too cramped and my eyesight is not what it was. I can\u2019t even type these days without my fingers (just written fibgers) hitting the wrong keys on a standard 15 (!5) inch screen laptop keyboard, let alone a tablet. Texting can be complete nonsense, without being able to blame predictive text. So, you may be young and dexterous with 20/20 vision, in which (whihc) case, writing a masterpiece on a tablet will be straightforward. It would definitely not be for me, though. ",

If you\u2019re going to type it, consider investing in a bluetooth keyboard. This is all under the impression that you\u2019re still doing this in a personal location. If you\u2019re using the tablet on a bus then I\u2019d still recommend Google Doc\u2019s, and either talk real quietly into a headset w-microphone combo or swipe it out, even if it is slower. ",

Considerations should be how comfortable it will be to write an entire book on a tablet. For example, writing a 80k-100k novel on a tablet may not be ideal (although a writer could probably write on any device). And if you want to write a non-fiction book, with graphic images, a tablet may not be ideal. And another consideration is where you want to publish: traditional or self-publish. You would ideally need to have the final manuscript in Word (or InDesign). Or perhaps you want to create an epub. Hope that helps. ",

EZ PDF enables all the edits I used to do with pen on a printed copy, but legibly, without wasting paper, and with the ability to quickly copy back to Word, usually making additional edits at the time. I open the last saved Word doc version and the PDF side by side and select the text to copy and insert. EZ PDF saves the edits made, including blocks of several paragraphs, although I rarely attempt more than a single page because typing on a tablet is, as others have noted, tedious and slow. But for the kinds of edits I used to do with pen on printed copy, this method works comfortably for me. ",
