            "answer_text": "An introduction should sum up the idea of your entire essay, paper, or story. It\u2019s telling the reader what it\u2019s going to be a about. So, you don\u2019t want a boring introduction, because people will get bored of it, and not want to read your story. The introduction needs to be able to clearly state what your paper is going to be about in a non-bland fashion. So maybe start with a situation or something that triggers a cause and effect to draw the reader in. Then state your topic sentences for the following body paragraphs. The introduction could be the cause, and the body can be the effect. Hope that helped. ",
