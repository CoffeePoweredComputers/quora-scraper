            "answer_text": "The question has been asked and uses the English language. You have a potential audience of a few billion people. That didn\u2019t stop me from uploading poems to the poemhunter poetry website. It merely challenges me to write new poetry to meet that demand for more poetry. Readers and reciters prefer poetry that flows well to poetry that doesn\u2019t quite work. So it\u2019s why I prefer the rhyming style and a structured verse style of 8 syllables then 6 then 8 then 6. This is the common metre hymn style pattern that helped me to recognise phrases that worked for 8 syllables suitable for titles and for first lines, too. Such phrases come unbidden and I merely follow these writing prompts to get to the first line and then it\u2019s a sudden switch to the Writing Zone or the Try Write Zone as I like to think of it. : If writing about yourself, then it is expected to be some true event or personal belief or private thoughts being made available to the public. Even so, many poets write for themselves and refuse to share\u2026 the little meanies that they are! I hope that you will upload poetry to the poemhunter website. I add a free photo image underneath my new poem thanks to websites like unsplash, pixabay and gratisography as well as others, found when searching for free stock images using the pinterest website search feature\u2026 My free e-book poetry collection has over 2,800 poems already. I like finding and installing fonts to test which ones work to inspire me to write. Some do, some don\u2019t. Finding lovely ones like the LORA font can help poets to write and see how beautiful the text looks. The myfonts website recently emailed me about getting some free fonts. I got those and visited the website, registered there and searched for free fonts offered in the available font groups. I got about 50 font files yesterday and tested these out with a recent poem. I like several of the fonts I tested. I save the files using WORDPAD rather than some complex word processor. I save the text as RTF files such as: a-poem-about-writing-poems-cambria-bolditalic16.rtf : I\u2019m replying here using the Chrome web browser and the Grammarly add-on as this is currently getting the text checked. GET THE TEXT CHECKED! So queries are underlined in red and these point out suggestions or corrections to me. So even here, I can write a poem on-the-spot\u2026 Notice the title and the first line make 8 syllables yet again! : WRITE A POEM ABOUT YOURSELF!:Write a poem about yourself\u2026 the person that is you\u2026Why leave your words upon the shelf?

            "answer_text": "All lyric poems, you might say, are about the self \u2014 not directly maybe, but the things (\u201cno ideas but in things\u201d), the handling of things, conclusions drawn from things, tone, rhythm, line-breaks, all reflect in some way the self. How could they not? Only you would make those decisions. (If you make the same decisions others might make, that says something, too.) I don\u2019t mean to suggest making a conscious correlation between things in the world and elements of your self, as in allegory (e.g., the rabbit equals jumpiness, the swan, grace), just that you write what you\u2019re prompted to write, go where impulse leads (and revise at a later date). The poem can\u2019t help but be intimately about yourself. even if you never appear. In other words, the self needn\u2019t be the conscious subject of the poem for the poem to be about the self. In fact, be wary of subjects. That\u2019s one way, I think, people find their way. ",
