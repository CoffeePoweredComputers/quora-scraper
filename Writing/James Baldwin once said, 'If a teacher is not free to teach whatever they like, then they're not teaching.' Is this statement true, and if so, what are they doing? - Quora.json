            "answer_text": "Teachers ARE free to teach whatever they like! But, the world, as it exists, is not a free-flowing interplay of spontaneous freedom, and the skills and practices that most students do (or should) desire to learn require a degree of discipline. In fact, this is how academia is organized - a series of differing (sometimes overlapping) disciplines. I am a strong advocate of academic freedom; however, I am also a strong advocate of discipline, and in this case, my particular discipline (historical study). I feel I have the right to teach \u201cwhatever\u201d I want - within, that is, the confines of the topic of history. It would be unfair to my students to waste a bunch of class time talking about cell dynamics of a plant organism, because I am not a microbiology teacher and my students are not sitting in a microbiology class. To do something like that would betray my discipline. In this regard, teachers ARE free to teach whatever they like - if I really want to do lessons on microbiology, I am free to commit myself to studying the discipline of science and offering to teach a science course if demand exists for that course (or, if it doesn\u2019t, teaching lessons informally online - through Quora, maybe!) But, when I work at school, I am paid to impart the content and skills of my discipline to my students. Anything I do that conflicts with that mission is at best a waste of time and at worst harmful to my students\u2019 character and skill development. So, in short, I agree with James Baldwin, but that doesn\u2019t mean teachers should be encouraged to \u201cdo whatever feels right\u201d in their classroom. We should be encouraged to impart the love of mastery of one\u2019s discipline to the students, and should have a great deal of flexibility in doing so; indeed, if we do not have mastery of discipline as the goal and flexibility as the means, we cannot teach.

            "answer_text": "No, of course not. It is a damn silly statement, but one of those slogans used by the Left to promote whatever the speaker wants to promote, most likely what a Black History professor told us in class,\"It doesn't matter if is true, only if it promotes the cause.\" A person may say anything, right or wrong, but a teacher is committed to teaching what is true. Also, to be practical, a teacher is employed to teach. No school district is going to long employ a high school biology teacher who spends his days teaching basket-weaving while his students lose an entire year's instruction in biology. A teacher who imparts what is untrue is a liar and a thief; he is unworthy of the title of teacher. Baldwin is a race poet; his idea about teaching is of no consequence. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Baldwin\u2019s quotation to a certain extent. If one is not teaching in his/her chosen field, then the passion is probably absent. On the other hand, there are times when a grammar rule just has to be taught. While it may not be necessarily fun, it is necessary for enlightenment. If I could just teach without parameters, I would teach love for reading, but I understand that writing goes so well with reading, so I teach writing as I work on reading. If we all were allowed to only do what we wanted, would our students really be \u201ceducated\u201d? Part of the reason for attending school is to have a broad introduction to the world in preparation for being one of its citizens. We have to keep that in mind as we develop curriculum. ",

Kids are showing up with all kind of nutty ideas in their heads, good nutty or bad nutty depending on where you are. Ditto teachers. Can you really have them babbling their own private convictions? Probably nowhere in history is that true. I'll bet that if we all think back, we'll realize that every teacher we had was walking a thin line, carefully suppressing little salvos, little warnings, little witticisms, little maxims, little insults, etc..
