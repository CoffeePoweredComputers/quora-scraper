            "answer_text": "Let me try to explain why the story is in question. I\u2019m not interested in repeating potential fabricated libels, but I did make part of my career on journalistic safety and ethics. disclaimer \u2014 no one is without bias. Not a single voter, journalist, or politician. With that out of the way\u2026 We tend to forget that Trump was impeached for extorting the president of Ukraine to research dirt on Hunter Biden. But Hunter Biden is not the untrained gadabout that the right wing press often portrays him as: Biden, a trained lawyer, had served on the board of a U.S. company and had also formed an investment firm with fellow Yale graduates Archer and Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former U.S. Senator John Kerry. According to four sources close to the company, Biden regularly attended Burisma\u2019s twice annual board meetings \u2013 all of which were held outside of Ukraine. A source close to the company said Biden took part in strategic conversations and shared his opinions and experience. In between board meetings, \u201cthere were constant calls, dialogue, sharing of advice, consideration of different options,\u201d the source said. \u201cExpansion to other markets was also discussed,\u201d the source added. Another source close to Burisma said Biden assisted with analysis of oil and gas assets the company was considering buying abroad, though a deal didn\u2019t go through. The company was considering possible acquisitions in Europe, Kazakhstan and the United States, the source and another person close to Burisma said. Slideshow ( 7 images ) Both sources said that around the time Biden was appointed, Burisma was also looking to secure a financing deal with foreign investment funds, including one in the United States. Biden helped to find lawyers to work on this process, before it broke down due to the start of the war in east Ukraine, one of those two sources said. What Hunter Biden did on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma - Reuters That same article notes that no one in the prior two administrations in Ukraine found Biden liable for any impropriety. Maybe they were slack? After all, his father was censuring them for not being tough on corruption. But somehow people seem to think that Biden was censuring them for corruption at the same time he presumably would have known this could land his kid in the courts. Makes sense, right? But after the impeachment, it became an issue of honor (so to speak) to destroy Hunter Biden in the court of public opinion, to confirm Trump\u2019s actions. So Guiliani presented the NY Post with files, allegedly taken from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, that showed he was a schnook. As a former mayor of NY, I\u2019m sure he had favors to pull in \u2014 so despite having nothing but hearsay on the provenance of the files, someone at the Post passed it for publication. Speaking as a journalist, there is no journalistic ethical justification for this. In the case of user-generated content: What do I know about the actual origin of this content? Can I verify the source?Are there copyright or legal issues around using the content?Have I ensured that all the information can be used and that the conditions for use are clear, for instance through Creative Commons Licence?Am I confident that there have been no reality offering alterations (eg Photoshop) used?In the case of sourcing breaking news: Before I report or retweet a development reported elsewhere, how confident am I in its accuracy?Would I potentially cause harm if I reported something before it is established at 100% certainty? Is there potential harm in not reporting it?Have I been careful to question first-hand accounts that can be inaccurate and manipulative, emotional or shaped by faulty memory and limited perspective?Have I triangulated the information with other credible sources?Have I acknowledged that the material I am using can be copied, distributed, and displayed, including derivative works based on it, and have I given credit to the original author and source?Ethical Ground Rules for Handling Sources - Ethical Journalism Network And much of the NY Post staff agreed: The New York Post\u2019s front-page article about Hunter Biden on Wednesday was written mostly by a staff reporter who refused to put his name on it, two Post employees said. Bruce Golding, a reporter at the Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid since 2007, did not allow his byline to be used because he had concerns over the article\u2019s credibility, the two Post employees said, speaking on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Coming late in a heated presidential campaign, the article suggested that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had used his position to enrich his son Hunter when he was vice president. The Post based the story on photos and documents the paper said it had taken from the hard drive of a laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden. Many Post staff members questioned whether the paper had done enough to verify the authenticity of the hard drive\u2019s contents, said five people with knowledge of the tabloid\u2019s inner workings. Staff members also had concerns about the reliability of its sources and its timing, the people said. New York Post Published Hunter Biden Report Amid Newsroom Doubts Also: President Trump\u2019s allies have long promoted claims of corruption about Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son Hunter in a bid to damage Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. The accusations intensified in recent days when some of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, provided material for a New York Post article detailing some of the allegations. The Post reported that the F.B.I. had seized a computer that purportedly belonged to Hunter Biden. The Biden campaign has rejected the accusations. Many questions remain about the origins of the allegations themselves, the laptop and what, if anything, agents are investigating. What We Know and Don\u2019t About Hunter Biden and a Laptop This sort of forensics by the FBI can yield preliminary results nearly immediately. But the FBI seizing the laptop means that no private forensics types can examine it \u2014 it will likely be unavailable for verification until after election day. This sort of maneuver is called an October Surprise. October surprise - Wikipedia It is not unique to Republicans. Assuming that the allegations are false \u2014 they don\u2019t pass the smell test to this retired journalist/opposition researcher \u2014 it\u2019s a \u201chail Mary\u201d bid to discourage Biden voters. It is unlikely to drive anyone to vote for Trump who wasn\u2019t already. But it says bad things about the NY Post that the story can\u2019t be verified by any third party, or by computer forensics. I would never have published it. It\u2019s a tarnish on the paper\u2019s credibility even if it turns out to be true. ",

            "answer_text": "Without bias, can someone explain what the NY Post article about Biden is about? The original article was verifiably sourced at both the FBI and the computer repair shop where Joe Biden\u2019s boy took a personal computer to be repaired and then forgot it. The repair shop could document efforts to reach the Biden boy, who never responded. At some point based in law, the computer became the property of the repair shop. The repair shop obviously knew what material was on the hard drive, and knew that material was potential evidence in any number of legal matters involving high level political figures including Joe Biden and other Biden family members. The repair shop called the FBI to come pick up the computer. The repair shop owner having observed how Comey et al had compromised the FBI made at least one copy of the hard drive for the purpose of protecting the repair shop if something came up later. After nearly a year waiting for something from the FBI, the repair shop owner took a copy of the hard drive to the NY Post which had the resources to flush out the FBI for sitting on the computer for nearly a year. There is no rational question the computer was the property of Hunter Biden nor is there any rational question that some thousands of the emails have been verified as true copies or originals by people proved to have been in the email chains. Because the information from the Biden boy\u2019s computer is damaging to Joe Biden establishment media has refused to cover to story, and megalomniac media has actively and forcefully suppressed the story, banning organizations and individuals from honest discussions of the story on their web systems, While it is not proved at this time, it could be the Biden boy \u201cparked\u201d the computer at the repair shop. Why I write that is the FBI, specifically Director Wray, indicated there are subpoenas for at least one of the Biden boy\u2019s computers. Whether a subpoena was issued for this computer is not clear at this time, but it is clear that the Biden boy was being investigated by the FBI for money laundering at the time the computer was placed at the repair shop. The FBI has since confirmed the Biden boy\u2019s computer is evidence in an international money laundering scheme being investigated by the FBI and presumably by Interpol and perhaps some other national police forces. The evidence published to date by US media indicates Joe Biden is personally involved and may be \u201cthe big guy\u201d raking cash from other Bidens for work procured though Biden\u2019s political influence.
