            "answer_text": "Think. You should sit back and let your imagination run wild. You should imagine what you want the story to be like. There are many ways to gather ideas for a story, be it inspiration from your life, the world around you, or the works of other film makers but it is important you think outside the box and try to bring something new to the world. Try your best to come up with an idea that you and others would enjoy, ensuring that is worth all the effort writing the script will entail. Decision. You have to make a decision and decide what kind of story you want to write. If the plot to the movie is given to you already then build upon that. Build. You have to construct the story from scratch. If you want ideas then you should read a few books that have to do with the plot of the movie. This will give you an idea of what to write. Possibly the most important aspect of this step is ensuring that the frame of your story has no big conflicting story points or plot holes in it (unless put there intentionally *a dangerous move probably left to the professionals but if it works out, go right ahead*). This simple self criticism could save you hours if not days of hard work in the future trying to rework the tale so that it all makes sense later on when there are already details built upon the faults. Draft. You should write out a draft for the story. You should review this yourself and decide if it is what you wanted. If it is not what you wanted then write another rough draft is what you wanted. If it is not what you wanted then write another rough draft.|}} ",

            "answer_text": "To some extent, the process for writing a story is different each time. In the introduction to American Gods, Neil Gaiman quotes Gene Wolfe, who told him, \u201cYou never learn how to write a novel. You only learn to write the novel you\u2019re on.\u201d ***This is true for short stories as well*** You never learn how to write a short story. You only learn to write the story you\u2019re on.  From Writer's Relief staff: Every story has a beginning, middle, and end. But the secret to successfully getting a short story published is to add something special to your storytelling mix\u2026something that captures the attention of editors and readers alike. While there are no hard and fast rules for creating a great short story, here are a few industry secrets that will help your writing stand out: Identify The Heart Of Your Story. Explore your motivations, determine what you want your story to do, then stick to your core message. Considering that the most marketable short stories tend to be 3,500 words or less, you\u2019ll need to make every sentence count. If you over-stuff your plot by including too many distractions, your story will feel overloaded and underdeveloped. See Things Differently. Experiment with your short story\u2019s POV. A unique, unexpected voice can provide the most compelling, focused experience of the central story. Just be careful that you don\u2019t inadvertently give the story to a nonessential character. Narrating the story line through a character who\u2019s not central to the action is a common mistake many new authors make, often with confusing or convoluted results. Opposites Attract. Elements that work against your character\u2019s central desire will keep the reader intrigued and prevent your story from getting stuck. You can also try approaching your core idea from an unusual direction. Dialogue, setting, and characterization are all areas that will benefit from an unexpected twist. Craft A Strong Title. This can be one of the most difficult\u2014but one of the most important\u2014parts of writing your story. How do you find inspiration for a great title? Have friends read your story and note which words or phrases strike them or stand out. These excerpts from your text just might hold the perfect title. Try to stay away from one- or two-word titles, which can seem to editors as taking the easy way out. Shorter Is Sweeter. Resist the urge to go on and on. With a shorter short story, you will have more markets available to you and thus a better chance of getting published. Here at Writer\u2019s Relief, our submission strategists and clients have noticed that editors consistently prefer short stories that are under 3,500 words over longer ones. Use these simple tips to polish your prose and assess any potential short story shortcomings. With these insider guidelines, you can increase the odds of your short story being selected for the pages of a literary journal. That\u2019s the best ending any author could devise\u2014or even better, a great beginning to your future success! Hope this will help you.Good bye, have a good day! ",
