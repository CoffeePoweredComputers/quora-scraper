            "answer_text": "First I really appreciate your idea. It reminds of the a book named Charing Cross Road . Actually nowadays few people would like to write actual physical letters.I think mixed reasons result in that. Hmm,then back to your question. There're many means you can find a Chinese speaking pen pal. As others mentioned,the easiest way is through Internet. More than six hundred millions people are using WeChat including nearly one hundred million foreigners. So you could try to make some friends here first. Another popular App is Weibo that's a sort of thing like Facebook or Twitter. After finding a Chinese friend,then you can ask him/her whether he/she would like to be your pen pal. However , actual physical letters mean it would takes quite a period of time to corespond. Because international mail really really takes a long time and it's a bit expensive. Finally wish you could find a Chinese speaking pen pal as soon as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm an International Student leaning 2+2 Program at University of Michigan. In fact, It's not hard to find a pen pal from China. Because many students want to improve their English, and talking to a native speaker is one of the best ways. Some high school classmates of mine are asking me to find one for them, actually. So, again, it\u2019s not hard to find one. However, probably it won't be easy to find one that has same interests as you, find one who you really want to talk to and make friends with, instead of just using it as a way of learning another language. In order to find a good pen pal, you would better know why do you want one, and What kind of one do you want. What's more, it may take time to transfer the letter, having a good topic to discuss becoming even more important. I'm a Freshman learning in the college, I'm also improving my English. Please forgive me, If there's some mistakes, and you are very welcomed to correct it. Wish this answer is helpful to you. Good Luck! ",

You are also more likely to want to engage in the conversation when the person on the other end is aesthetically pleasing. HelloTalk is also good. It's made for that kind of thing and the membership is cheap. ",
