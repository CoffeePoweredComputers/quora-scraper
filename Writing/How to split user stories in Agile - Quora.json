            "answer_text": "Split by capabilities offered This is the most obvious way to split a large feature. Look at the different capabilities being offered and split each one into its own story. For example, the capabilities \u201csort and search\u201d may each be its own story. Splitting further, each way of sorting or searching may be its own story. Split by user roles Administrators interact with a system differently from normal users. Teachers interact with instructional software differently from students. By defining the different roles in your system, you can split features and stories to address the unique needs of each role. Split by user personas Even in the same role, different people interact with software in different ways. A power user wants lots of keyboard shortcuts. A casual user may want a lot of intuitive, hold-your-hand forms of help. Handicapped users may need very different ways of interacting with the system, even though they are doing the same tasks as other users. Split by target device You can\u2019t assume that users are interacting with your system using a standard computer. Various smartphones and IoT devices need to be considered in your stories. Splitting stories by device provides a more natural experience for your users.

            "answer_text": "to answer differently, split using goals, objectives and key results. Here is why: The main artifact produced after a Sprint is the Product Increment. In It we will find a potentially shipable version of the Product. this is usually a combination of user stories delivered in a Sprint. The product increments is of value when it achieves a business goal, for example improve login time to under 1 second. the user stories delivered around this can varies in their tactics, so splitting the user story to achieve a goal can add real value here. Consider this: you got 3 stories to improve login time. the first way to split them would be by functionality or component as that is simpler. However, no user story will validate it achieved the goal, unless the split made clear the original goal to achieve. So this is meant to compliment other answers with keeping the link clear on what common goal are we aiming for when splitting stories ",
