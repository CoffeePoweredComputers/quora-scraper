            "answer_text": "As others have said it depends on the individual. Personally, I can do about 1,000 words an hour: so five hours. But probably more like six, as I wouldn\u2019t be able to sustain quality for a non-stop 5 hours. It also depends on the topic. Academic essays, where every citation must be properly referenced, the language must be academic and grammatically perfect and the point of each paragraph must be crystal clear, will take much longer - say a whole day\u2019s worth of writing for a 1,000 word essay. A story where everything is made up and research is minimal, or something that the writer has personal experience of, will both be much quicker to write. Hope that helps :) ",
