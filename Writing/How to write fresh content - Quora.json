            "answer_text": "Well, there are endless tools you can choice for content generating but not all of them would meet the level of efficiency that you might be looking for. You can try Spinner Chief which is not only a good content generator, but also an awesome article spinner. It can not only generate hundreds of new articles in minutes for you, but also in one click it can rewrite articles to a very high level of human readability and uniqueness because it uses The Best Natural Language Analysis and Artificial Intelligence techniques to understand your articles in the same way as Google does. We know that you want more from your spinner so Spinner Chief 5 uses a new, unique, organic approach to spinning, one that grows with your needs. Spinner Chief 5's new method actually gets better the more it is used. No other spinner has it - it's the new, exclusive Statistical Replacement Technology (SRT). It works in a radical new way by selecting the statistically most appropriate synonym for any word or phrase. SRT works in a similar way to Google Translate - you may have noticed Google Translate is getting better over time with more accurate translations. This is because as the web grows, the sample size for Google Translate's database increases, and so becomes statistically more likely to use the correct wording when it translates. Spinner Chief 5 works in a similar way by polling its huge Cloud Thesaurus for the statistically best synonym. As the Cloud Thesaurus grows, so Spinner Chief 5 gets better and better at synonym replacement. Remember - it's exclusive, don't expect to see this kind of technology anywhere else. ONLY with Spinner Chief! ",

That's how you know that yours is unique. So I guess it's obvious that you're unable to produce anything unique until you study your industry thoroughly enough. Here's your action plan: 1. Research your industry. Read a lot. Go as deep as you possibly can. You can do this by simply using Google. 2. Study the top performers of your industry. What are the most popular (most shared) articles. Why people are sharing them so eagerly? You can use the tool called BuzzSumo 3. Write your own piece and make sure it is different from any other article you've read on the topic. Make sure you're offering your own perspective and your own thoughts on the matter. and here's the super advanced step 4. Do something that no one else did before you. Get some results and write about that. This would be super unique, because you're sharing your personal experience.

Like if I'm blogging for a lifestyle publication and these days I'm wondering what to wear in such cold weather without looking like a slouch, I'll write that exactly - 7 tips to look hot in chilly weather, or something on those lines.If I'm writing on topics I stumble upon only at work like Investment Banking in India, decision Optimisation using business analytics, etc. I'll first shortlist the topics and run them on Google Keyword Planner in Google Adwords. For each topic, I will get 3\u20134 keywords, which I will then run on BuzzSumo to see what articles are hot and then I'll do my research. Then I'll create a content strategy with the data gathered so far, and with this method, I should have content ideas to last me around a month or so, even when I'm writing 3\u20134 days a week.This is my way. Hope it helps you :) ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Fresh content\u2019 is a relative term, and its definition varies from content to content. In order to start writing content in the first place, you need to define your need. There are different types of content, and each one of them has to be written differently. For example, if your content is for commercial purposes, the \u2018freshness\u2019 of your content should have a generic structure of information. If you\u2019re creating content for engagement, the freshness of your content depends on your usage of latest keywords and referential metadata. If your content is for your personal blogs, then your content will be considered fresh if you write about things which people will understand and relate to the most. The main factor to be considered for writing fresh content is that you need to have ample research about the topic you\u2019re writing about. Read a few blogs/ articles on that topic first, and try to explain your perspective in a fresh way. ",
