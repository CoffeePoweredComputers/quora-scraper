            "answer_text": "We\u2019ve all been there. You click open an email, and there\u2019s a long block of text that stretches beyond where you can see. Your first reaction is to close the window and flag the email for later. Much later. Email can be a useful communication tool, but not everyone uses it well. Below are 5 steps to follow in order to draft an email that readers will open, read and understand. 1. Maintain your credibility Present yourself as the trusted professional you are. Be polite: say please and thank you as appropriateKeep a professional tone: avoid slang, exclamation marks, and smiley facesUse a suitable greeting and opening, but avoid insincere small talkInclude a suitable sign-off that fits the tone of the emailKeep your email signature simple and short: limit images and avoid cursive fontsDon\u2019t use too many high importance flags2. Present your email thoughtfully Give the right amount of information in the right way so that your reader is able to read your message easily, and wants to. Place your key message and call to action near the top so it\u2019s the first thing your reader seesOrganize the rest of the information from most to least importantLimit the number of issues covered in the email to increase the chance of a responseWrite briefly and stick to the point: try to keep to 150 words or lessUse short, everyday words instead of jargon and difficult wordsAvoid acronyms and terms your reader won\u2019t understandKeep sentences short3. Help your reader scan We don\u2019t read content onscreen word for word. In fact, most of us scan a web page in an F-shaped pattern. Use layout and formatting to guide your reader through the email and to your key points. Put your key message and call to action at the topFor a longer email with a lot of details, use headingsWrite in easy-to-read chunks: use short paragraphs and lists with bullets or numbersDon\u2019t use too much bold; if you emphasize too many words, you end up emphasizing nothingAvoid all caps, huge fonts and random colours; these slow the reader down4. Write your subject line last Your subject line could determine whether your reader opens your email. Make it count. Write the subject line after drafting your messageUse action verbs so the reader knows what you want doneBe specific and descriptive so the reader knows right away what the message is aboutAppeal to the reader\u2019s needs: ask yourself what will make the reader care about your emailAvoid starting a sentence in the subject line and finishing it in the bodyKeep your subject line under 50 characters or 6 to 8 words, so the whole line will show in the inbox previewKeep in mind that some smartphones show only 33 to 44 characters for the subject line5. Review and revise Imagine that everyone in the company will read your message. Emails are quick to create, but leave a lasting impression. Review your work now to save time and get results later. Use the spell-check feature to reduce errorsRead the message backwards to check for errors that a spell-checker won\u2019t catch, like homonyms and usage errorsCheck that your key message is perfectly clear, without typos, wordy phrases, or anything that can be misunderstoodCheck that all names and titles are correctMake sure you have attached any important files or included any necessary links.More - 5 tips to improve your email-writing skills ",
