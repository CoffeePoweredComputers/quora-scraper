            "answer_text": "I would love to know what happened to the Sodder children. The Sodders were an Italian-American family living in West Virginia. George (born Giorgio Soddu) and Jennie (nee Cipriani) Sodder had 10 children. The oldest was born in 1923, the youngest in 1943. On Christmas Eve, 1945, Jennie was awakened by a telephone call at 12:30 am. She answered and told the femaile caller that she had the wrong number, and noticed that the lights in the living room were still on and the curtains were undrawn. One of her teenage daughters was asleep on the sofa, and she assumed the other children, who had stayed up past bedtime playing with their Christmas toys, had gone to bed in the attic. She closed the curtains and turned out the lights, and went back to bed. At 1 am, she was awakened again by something hitting the roof of the house with a loud bang. She heard nothing more, so fell back asleep, only to wake up about half an hour later to the smell of smoke. There was a fire in George\u2019s office, so she woke George, and he woke up the older boys. The parents and four of the children escaped the fire, but no one could go back in for the other children as the fire had spread to the stairs and going up to the attic bedroom was impossible. Attempts to cal the fire department were unsuccessful because the house telephone was no longer working. Jennie ran to a neighbor\u2019s to use their phone, but it also didn\u2019t work. A passing driver saw the fire and tried to call the fire department, but either the phone didn\u2019t work, or he couldn\u2019t get through to the operator. Adding to the coincidences, George\u2019s ladder was missing from its usual spot, and neither of his truck would start despite working fine the day before. The six survivors could do nothing but watch the fire consume the house. The fire department arrived on the scene later that morning, going over the remains of the house. According to some reports, the fire chief told the remaining Sodders there were no bones found among the debris. Other sources say that a few bones and internal organs were found, but that the family was not notified. An inquest a few days after the fire ruled it an accident caused by faulty wiring, however, the family\u2019s Christmas lights had stayed on during the early part of the fire, leaving the family with doubts. Also, the family was informed that the telephone wire hadn\u2019t burned; it had been cut. One witness, a bus driver passing through the town the night of the fire, claimed he had seen people \u2018throwing balls of fire\u2019 at the house. The family came to believe that the fire had been an act of arson. The Sodder family became convinced that their five children had not only survived the fire, but that they had been abducted. The Sodders printed up flyers with photos of their children on them. They erected two billboards, and offered a reward for information. They were still following leads on the children in the 1960s, when they received a photograph of a man aged about 30, the age one of their sons would have been, that bore a strong likeness to him. It was postmarked Kentucky, but had no return address. George passed away in 1969. The rest of the family - except one son who believed they needed to move on with their lives - continued the search. After George\u2019s death, Jennie wore mourning until her own death in 1989. At that time, the children decided to take down the remaining billboard. As of 2015, only one of the children is left alive, the youngest. She has said that the fire is her earliest memory. What happened to the five missing Sodder children? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s famous to the people of my hometown, Tyrone Pennsylvania. Kathy Shea. Kathleen Ann Shea of Tyrone, PA, who was 6 years old when she disappeared on March 18, 1965. She was last seen traveling north between 15th and 16th streets, walking from her home to Adams Elementary School\u2014about four blocks away. Kathy was last seen splashing in rain puddles on her way to school, according to a 2010 story in the Altoona Mirror. Along the way, the story says, a crossing guard helped her across 15th Street, and she spoke to a woman who was watching from her North Avenue home to make sure her own daughter reached the school safely. Hours passed before anyone realized Kathy was missing. The kindergarten teacher thought Kathy was out sick, and her mother thought she was at school, according to the Mirror. What makes Kathy's case disturbing is that it happened in a small, central Pennsylvania town, a place where people felt safe. According to The Doe Network website, talk of Kathy still generates a lot of interest in the area around Tyrone. Despite the best efforts of local and state police, no trace of Kathy has ever been found. Law enforcement officials checked out many leads, all with negative results. Her disappearance is considered a non-family abduction. At the time of her disappearance, Kathy was only 3 feet 11 inches tall and weighed just 47 pounds. She is described as having blue eyes and brown hair. Kathy was last seen wearing a brown hat, beige coat with a fur collar, red gloves, red-knit sweater, brown jumper, red tights and yellow boots with black soles. She would be 61 years old today. Her parents, Mary Alice and James Shea, never gave up hope before their deaths in 1997 and 2006, respectively. ",
