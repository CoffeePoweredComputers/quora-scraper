            "answer_text": "The more you know about a subject, the closer you get to realising how much more there is to learn. It\u2019s similar to the phenomenon of Mount Stupid; as you start learning about a subject, you are more likely to talk to people about it. Once you reach a certain critical point of understanding, you are less and less likely to want to talk about it because you realise how much there is you don\u2019t know \u2014 that everything you\u2019re saying could be wrong.  In your case, it could simply be that you\u2019ve learned so much over the last six years that you are now more able to notice the problems in your current writing. You\u2019ve learned enough that you\u2019re starting to realise that you still have a long way to go before you master the craft. In other words, it could just be a perceptual thing. It could also be that you now have a good idea of what \u2018good\u2019 writing entails, so you are unfairly restricting yourself in trying to keep to all those \u201crules\u201d you\u2019ve discovered. When you didn\u2019t know those rules, you weren\u2019t so restricted \u2014 you suffered a lot less from analysis paralysis. You might be writing about things you don\u2019t care as much about now as you used to be. Passion is important for quality. If you write as a professional, your writing may now be stifled by harsh deadlines. Speed, quality, accuracy; in professional writing, you only ever get to pick two of those at any one time. You may have lost your author\u2019s voice. That\u2019s happened to me more than once. You could even have just gotten lazy with your writing, and failing to edit and proof and redraft as you should. There are 1001 different possibilities really. ",

It happens to the best of us. I took AP English in my last year of high school, and I learned a lot more about writing through that course, but my creative writing temporarily suffered due to the fact that I\u2019d been overexposed to stuffy, antiquated literature. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that kind of literature, of course, but that style of writing is outdated for creative writing today. The thing about writing is that you can\u2019t apply absolutely everything you\u2019ve learned about it all at once - some of the advice is just bad, some of it is good, and a lot of it just contradicts other pieces of advice when you put it all together. Follow some of the rules, but don\u2019t overthink it and follow all of them. ",
