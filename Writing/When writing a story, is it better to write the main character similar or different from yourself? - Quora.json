            "answer_text": "When writing a story, is it better to write the main character similar or different from yourself? I think it depends on how new you are at writing. If you don\u2019t have a lot of experience, writing a protagonist who is fairly similar to you makes it easy to get inside her head. You can imagine what she\u2019d do in a given circumstance, as it would be much like what you would do. As you gain experience, you should try writing protagonists who are different from you, just for the practice. You\u2019ll learn to get into the heads of different kinds of people, and learn how to write people who are different from you realistically, rather than as caricatures. At this point in my own writing, I find some characters are very similar to myself, and some are very different. Either way, I focus on the character and the story, and rarely worry anymore how similar or different a character is from myself. Ultimately, you should try to write the right character for the story. Some will be like you, others won\u2019t. Some, you won\u2019t even like.  For more, read Quill and Ink ",

            "answer_text": "I think whether or not you model your character directly after yourself, your character is going to reflect your experiences and insights about life. They say, \u201cWrite what you know.\u201d I disagree with that. If you don\u2019t know something, learn it; then you will know it. However, whatever comes out of your imagination only comes from your experiences, dreams, hopes, pains, joys, passions, obsessions. You can write a character who obviously has your looks and personality, etc., or you can create a character that is different from you. It doesn\u2019t matter just as long as you create a character that is psychologically complex and is somehow someone your readers can relate to. Even negative characters should have some vulnerability to them that your readers can relate to which will keep them from being simple matinee villains. When it comes to writing characters, complexity is the spice of life. Though your characters should be well drawn, it is good to sometimes have them do something that is outside of their normal character which reveals their complexity and human frailties. I am working on a book right now in which three of the characters are based on different aspects of my life. I developed them as having struggles which came from my subconscious. I can relate strongly to the three of them in different ways. Even though they look different from me, their personalities are different from mine, each of them is a part of me. So, they are like me but not like me at the same time. ",
