            "answer_text": "Studying grammar makes you a better editor because you are aware of the applicable rules,you care about accuracy, andyou can discuss grammar with other people when you have questions. You write well only if you edit well. Descriptive grammar is more useful to readers than the prescriptive (rule based) sort, in my opinion.  A descriptive grammar book is harder to use.  The terminology is unfamiliar, certainly.  However, it can teach you aspects of your language of which you were previously unaware. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing is a language skill, while grammar is a language system.You can be a very fluent writer without advanced grammatical knowledge. Grammatical knowledge will make one a more accurate writer. In language learning, the Central European Framework for Reference provides a six-division scale in which you can rate speakers of a foreign language. The scales are A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2. The A stages are a very basic level. The B stages are an intermediate level.C1 level shows an advanced command over the language while C2 shows a proficient command over the language.The higher on the scale you move, the more important 'accuracy' becomes.
