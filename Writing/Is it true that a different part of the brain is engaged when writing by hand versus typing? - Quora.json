            "answer_text": "Is the Pen Mightier Than the Keyboard? February 1, 2018  Is the pen really mightier than the keyboard? According to current research the answer is a resounding yes! Many experts argue that it is no longer necessary to teach cursive in the classroom. Why put pen to paper when we can simply click letters on a keyboard to write, reports, essays and documents? While many states support this philosophy, educators are taking a step back as they realize the importance of writing and the essential role it plays in learning. Researchers studying this connection have found ample evidence that supports the essential role cursive plays in academic performance. For example, did you know that writing helps you to remember what you are learning? Unlike typing, writing requires us to focus to a greater degree, and this in turn helps us learn at a \u201cdeeper\u201d level. The physical act of writing, stimulates cells in the base of our brain known as the Reticular Activating System (RAS). The RAS filters information and brings our attention to the forefront, helping us to focus on what we are doing. This part of the brain is not activated to the same degree when we type. Put another way, writing changes the way our brain processes information! For young children learning to read, this is significant. There is a direct link between reading and writing. Writing \u201cworks\u201d a part of the brain that typing does not. Think of your brain as a muscle. If you lift weights your muscle grows. Writing is a \u201cweight\u201d that can increase a student\u2019s memory, understanding and application of new material! Did you know that the MClass assessment has a writing component that is linked to reading? Your child is tested on their ability to read AND write on grade level. According to a survey by the State Board of Education 62% of North Carolina\u2019s elementary schools say they\u2019re providing cursive instruction at least on a monthly basis. Even assuming a rate of 100%, is it enough? Would you be impressed if 100% of students received reading instruction just once a month? When learning a new skill whether it\u2019s riding a bike, or learning how to write, consistency and daily practice is not only important, but essential. In a 2012 study at Indiana University, psychologist Karin James tested five-year-old children who did not yet know how to read or write by asking them to reproduce a letter or shape in one of three ways: typed onto a computer, drawn onto a blank sheet, or traced over a dotted outline. When the children were drawing freehand, an MRI scan during the test showed activation across areas of the brain associated in adults with reading and writing. The other two methods showed no such activation. (www.guardian.com) With the demands placed on teachers, finding time to make this a part of the curriculum is easier said than done. Give your child a head start by teaching this skill at home. If you\u2019re not sure where to begin, teach your child how to write their name. Keep writing lessons short, and use lots of positive reinforcement. *Flex Your Child's Reading Muscles! ",

            "answer_text": "It isn't so much that a DIFFERENT part of the brain is engaged, but MORE of the brain is engaged. When writing by hand (unlike when typing), your reticular activating system is aroused. This causes more focus on what you are doing. Furthermore, writing by hand requires the connection of letters by use of the brain and motor functions. This causes even more of your cognitive abilities to be activated. Copywriters who offer courses on writing will often attest that writing by hand stimulates their creativity, but this may be purely subjective. Writing by hand, however, will also aid in memory retention. Because of the multiple senses engaged, and also the activation of the reticular formation, you are much more likely to remember words you write. ",
