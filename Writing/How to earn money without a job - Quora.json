            "answer_text": "12 Ways to Make Money Without a Job 1. Sell or Rent Your Stuff Secondhand, or \u201cused\u201d/\u201dunique\u201d items are all the rage these days. Go through your house or apartment for anything you just don\u2019t need or use anymore and sell it on eBay or Amazon or Gumtree. Then look at your space itself. If you have an extra room, or you\u2019re planning to go on vacation, consider renting out some or all of your space on Airbnb. If you live in a busy city, you could even rent out your parking space. 2. Fill Out Surveys It is actually possible to earn money by filling out online surveys. Compensation will vary, and might not ever be substantial, but lumping a bunch of these jobs together can add up. Start with a platform like http://MySurvey.net, which pays in gift cards. Look to other platforms if you prefer to be paid in cash. 3. Ghost Shop Love shopping and being critical? Trying to find defects and keeping a keen eye out for details? Start applying on MysteryShopping.com if this appeals to you. Your reports after visiting shops, restaurants, hotels, etc. will be used to grade employees\u2019 performance\u2014and, hopefully, will improve future shoppers\u2019 experiences. 4. Publish on Kindle You don\u2019t need to go the traditional publishing route to sell your books and earn money for your writing. Use Amazon\u2019s Kindle platform to self-publish ebooks you\u2019ve written. The sky\u2019s the limit. 5. Sell Stock Photos Ever try to use a stock photo and realize you have to pay a (sometimes hefty) fee? Get yourself set up with a site like Shutterstock, load your photos, and get paid when people use them. It\u2019s possible to make a decent salary this way, even to break six figures! 6. Invest (Legally) in Pot Now that marijuana is legal in certain states, there are opportunities for you to do a bit of long-game gambling, if you\u2019re so inclined and can afford the risk. Cash in on the craze by investing in marijuana-related stocks. 7. Buy Bitcoin Use sites like CoinBase and buy a small amount to start. The biggest gains in Bitcoin may be gone, but you can monitor how your investment grows, then keep your eyes out for the next hottest cryptocurrency and get in on the ground floor. 8. Sell Books Use a site like BookScouter to see what the highest market rate might be for any given book\u2014either your old paperback, or some bargain book you picked up in a used bookstore. Then sell it online for as much of a profit as the market will allow. 9. Participate in Mock Trials Lawyers often need to test their cases out to get a sense of how they\u2019ll go in court. Get paid to be part of a mock jury on sites like eJury or Online Verdict. 10. Design Shirts T-shirt design is, rather surprisingly, a bit of an emerging industry on the internet. Use different sites like Threadless, DesignbyHumans, or TeeSpring to make your designs. The company will set you a price and a sales goal, and the company will pay you, depending on how you do and how many shirts you sell. If you have the chops to drive up sales without alienating all of your friends, this could be a great gig for you. 11. Betatest or Review Software Ever wonder how companies work out the kinks and bugs in their software? Ever wonder who gets paid for this kind of work? Well, it could be you. Go to SoftwareJudge or Utest or Erli Bird, and get started. You can easily make $10 per hour or more doing what might actually be fun work. 12. Donate Your Eggs or Sperm This one isn\u2019t for the faint of heart or health, but it is perhaps one of the most lucrative options. If you\u2019re selected for sperm donation, you can make up to $40 per donation. Eggs are much more complicated (and painful) to harvest, and require a significant physical commitment. But you could make anywhere from $3-$200,000 per donation, depending on your location and the quality of your eggs. ",

            "answer_text": "10 Awesome Ways to Make Money Without a Job Do you think you need a \u201cjob\u201d to make money? What if you can\u2019t find a job? The fact is, the job market we rely on to make that money is not looking that great. A struggling economy has lead to a severe lack of jobs. Although the job market as a whole is doing much better \u2013 we went from an unemployment rateof 9.5% in 2007 to just under 5% in 2017 \u2013 there are still tens of thousands of us who can\u2019t get a job. People who enjoyed relative security throughout their lives now find themselves in a tough spot where they can\u2019t even afford to pay their monthly bills. It doesn\u2019t look much better for the people who are just getting into the workforce (students, high school drop outs, college grads, etc) either. But somehow, many of the same people manage to stay afloat without a traditional job. Sure, some are digging into their savings. Some have friends and family to support them. But there are also many who are actually making a living without a 9 to 5 job. Most of the opportunities these folks are using to make a living from wouldn\u2019t even exist without the internet and what it has made possible \u2013 like the sharing economy. There is money to be made, even if you don\u2019t have a job. For some, it won\u2019t quite match their old salary and what they used to make, or are still making at their day job. For others, the money they make could be way more than what they could have ever dreamed of. But the question is\u2026 Can YOU make enough money to pay your bills without a job? The answer depends on many factors. But if we are asking whether it\u2019s actually possible or not, the answer is a definite YES. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are making a comfortable living online \u2013 eCommerce site owners, Bloggers, Freelancers, Affiliate Marketers, Entrepreneurs\u2026. Obviously, not everyone is going to be able to make a living, nor is everyone trying to. For a lot of people, the goal is to make a little extra money. The good news is that no matter which group you belong to, there are many opportunities for you to try. Now the amount of money you can make on the internet (or with opportunities that are available as a direct result of the internet) is only limited by what you can do, how familiar you are with doing it, and whether or not you\u2019re comfortable promoting yourself and what you do. For example, there are bloggers who are making 7 figures, so you can imagine that the bar is set quite high in terms of what is possible. On the flip side, there are people working on the internet who are making a few dollars a day. There are also tons of people in between, making a few hundred dollars a month. Disparities in income are the same on the internet as they are in real life \u2013 it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand. A quick reminder Before we begin, please remember that we made this list with a wide variety of people in mind. It is incredibly unlikely that every option on this list will be a good fit for you. That\u2019s why we compiled a very large list so everyone can find a few options that may interest them. Feel free to try as many of these opportunities as you like. But don\u2019t spread yourself too thin. Pick a few and put all your efforts behind them so you can get results. Don\u2019t get bugged down with the shiny object syndrome. That is one reason why so many people fail to make money online. They keep jumping from one thing to another without ever giving one 100%. They then conclude that this is all a myth and that making money online nothing but scam. Earning money without a job on the internet We are going to list over 60 ways that you can make money without a traditional job. We are going to start with online opportunities, then we\u2019ll cover options for making money without a job, offline. 1- Take online surveys Taking surveys for money is bay far the best way for most people to make a little side income in their free time. It doesn\u2019t require any experience or investment. It\u2019s totally free to join any legit survey site. These sites conduct online surveys on behalf of companies and manufacturers who use the feedback you provide to improve or develop new products. In return for your time and input, you are rewarded with cash, gift cards, and other prizes. It\u2019s not unheard of to make a few hundred dollars a month with surveys. The way to do that is by joining a few dozen legit panels so you can have access to a lot of paid survey opportunities. If you only want cash, there are survey sites that pay cash (via PayPal.) Sites to use: OpinionOutpostSurveySavvySurveySpotValued Opinions2- Get cash from Class Action Lawsuits Yes, you can get free money from the hundreds and thousands of class action lawsuits that are brought on companies every year. But how do you find these lawsuits, and what if you don\u2019t even have a proof that you have used the said company\u2019s product or service which qualifies you for the settlement? Good news is that there are sites out there dedicated to listing all the class action lawsuits that are still open. And the better news is that many of these cases don\u2019t require a proof of purchase. For example, if you have ever drank RedBull, you get up to $15 through a class action lawsuit brought on the company because of their slogan \u201cRedBull Gives You Wings\u201d. Sites to use: ClassActionRebates.comEnergyDrinkSettlement.com3- Sell old books I have personally done this many times. The beauty of this method is that most of us already have lots of books that we no longer need or use. Selling them can be a great sources of extra income. And if you want to take a step further, you could hit your local thrift shops, buy used books for pennies, then sell them for $5, $10, and even up to $100 or more depending on the book. What makes this process even easier is the existence of sites and apps like BookScouter. Simply install their app, then scan any book\u2019s ISBN with it, you will instantly be given the highest prices you can sell that book for online. BookScouter searches over 40 buy-back-book sites to find you the highest price. Sites to use: BookScouterCash4Books4- Get paid to test websites User testing is a real thing! In order to test the functionality and user-friendliness of their website, many businesses pay people to simply visit their site and test the various functionalities of it. Of course finding clients on your own is almost impossible, which is why sites like Usertesting are there. You can sign up for free, then whenever they have a new site to be tested, you will be notified. You visit the said site, then report back with your experience. The pay differs from site to site, but Usertesting pays $10 flat for every site review you complete. Sites to use: Usertesting.comStartUpLiftTryMYUI5- Participate in mock trials There are websites that conduct mock trials on behalf of their clients, which are mostly lawyers. These lawyers want to know how their case might go when they are in the actual courtroom facing the judge and the jury. So, to get a sense for it, and adjust their strategy accordingly, they use mock trial sites to present their case in front of an online jury. You can get paid to become a jury in such trials. Sites to use: eJuryOnlineVerdict.comTrial Juries6- Start a blog For those of you who don\u2019t know, blogging is when you write for your own website, usually posting articles, recipes, reviews, or commentary (with the website itself being the \u201cblog.\u201d) Think of it like writing articles for a newspaper that you\u2019re the sole proprietor of. Believe it or not, blogging is actually a very strong opportunity for making money, as we mentioned up above regarding the top bloggers. In the past, the primary obstacle for hosting a blog would have been obtaining a domain to host the blog, but now there are platforms dedicated solely to blogging, like WordPress, which make it easier than ever to get into the game and start a money-making blog in no time. Blogging is a great investment in terms of time and money because an article you wrote for 4 hours will be up and available for viewing for as long as your site lives. Furthermore, it requires essentially no money to keep going but has the potential to make you plenty of money. There is too much to say about blogging to fit into this article, but if you like the sound of it, definitely do some searches and read up on it. Even if you\u2019re not comfortable with the idea of running a blog, you can still get paid to write for someone else\u2019s. Sites to use: WordPress.comBlogger.comTumblrNote: These are free blagging platforms that allow you to build a site quickly and for free. Start with these, get a feel for how this whole blogging thing works, then you can move on and buy your own domain name and hosting. At that point, I would suggest you build your blog using WordPress (this is the .org version of it which is for self-hosted sites). 7- Be an affiliate marketer If you\u2019re not familiar with affiliate marketing, it means that you\u2019ll advertise something in return for a commission on the sales. This is essentially a sales job that can be done by the introverted and the extroverted alike, since it doesn\u2019t require that you actually interface with people on a personal basis. Affiliate marketing is usually a way that people prefer to advertise their product because it feels more organic, and people are more likely to purchase something that they don\u2019t feel has been explicitly advertised to them. Affiliate marketing is usually tied to blogging, as a blog is an ideal place to do something like write a review of a product and provide a link to the product at the end. Some affiliate marketers are paid simply to drive traffic and don\u2019t need to make sales, but as a rule of thumb, you should be trying to drive sales in the least \u201cadvertisey\u201d way possible.

A variety of people will be wanting assistance for whatever they do, whether they write research articles or run an online business, and that\u2019s where you come in as a virtual assistant. You should expect to be doing administrative work as a virtual assistant, so be prepared to employ skills like email response, data entry, examination of facts and organization of information. It\u2019s as simple as being, well, of assistance to your employer, but you\u2019ll almost definitely need some customer service skills. Keep that in mind if you\u2019d prefer a more \u201cback of the house\u201d position. Sites to use: ZirtualVirtualAssistantJobs.comVirtualAssistants.com9- Telecommute Despite the fancy name, telecommuting is as simple as it comes. A telecommuter is simply someone who does what would be done in a normal office job, but they do it from home. It can be in a variety of industries, advertising or administration or anything else. What jobs can be done via telecommuting are more about what companies are offering telecommuting jobs than about what can be done at a distance. In the internet age, virtually every job can be done from home. Whether you\u2019re coding software, coming up with advertising, if you\u2019re an artist or a writer or a manager, it can likely be done from home. Even board meetings can be done via communications software like Skype. Do a quick Google search for Telecommuting jobs and you\u2019re sure to find some websites that will help you get going. Sites to use: FlexJobsVirtualVocationsForbes list of 100 companies offering telecommuting jobs10- Design and sell shirts Personally, I still can\u2019t believe how easy this option is. There are a wealth of websites that are dedicated to t-shirt design, which is an emerging internet industry. Here\u2019s how it works\u2026 First, you sign up for the site (which is always free.) Then you can use their design interface to design a T-shirt. It\u2019ll have a variety of options, like choosing the cut of the shirt (crew, women\u2019s, v-neck, etc,) choosing a font, font size, font color, shirt color. You can usually take images from your computer and put them on the shirt, and you can usually design a front and a back for the shirt. Different companies have different limitations for what you can and can\u2019t do. Either way, when you\u2019re finished designing the shirt you\u2019ll set a sales goal and a sales price, both of which will affect how much the company will pay you per shirt sold. Then you go out, and advertise the shirt and try to get people to buy it. If you reach your sales goal, the shirts will be printed, distributed, and you will be paid for your work. It costs NOTHING to design the shirts; the companies make enough money from the sales to pay you for the work and still keep a tidy profit. The only obstacle is the actual advertising and sales. Past that, it\u2019s all profit for little work. So, if you\u2019ve got the skills to drive purchases and advertise in an unobtrusive way, you should seriously check this out.
