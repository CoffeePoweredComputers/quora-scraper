            "answer_text": "This is a difficult one, as different outlets pay wildly different rates. Your best bet is to either discreetly ask someone else you know who might have worked for the same outlet, to quote a ballpark figure you'd be happy with -- or to just swallow your pride and ask what they're willing to pay! Go for a flat rate, though. I don't know of anywhere that pays by the word any more, since the Internet isn't print and there's no real requirement for anything to be above/below a certain length, besides readability and attention span. For comparison's sake, I recently wrote a 1,500 word review of Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward for Gamespot, and that paid $150. ",
