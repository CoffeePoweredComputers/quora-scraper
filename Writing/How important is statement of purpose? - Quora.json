            "answer_text": "Statement Of Purpose: Most Critical Element Of Your Application  The SOP is your chance to impress the admission committee by presenting your profile through an essay. The committee wants to see whether you take an interest in letting them know how much you want to study at their university. Discuss the past incidents that have influenced your career path in a specific domain wherein you aspire to grow by joining a course/college. The undergraduate essay need not have any idea of what will come after college. Rather, the focus is on showing how the candidate has explored their world and interests and how they relate to people and form their opinions. Put yourself in an admission officer's shoes. From among thousands of applications, you have to choose the fraction of students that will comprise next year's class. A mix of interesting, confident and enthusiastic people who will make the class a stimulating place. Academic achievements and good test scores are important. But in an era where the majority of applicants have good academic records, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between individuals and decide who gets the offer of admission. ",
