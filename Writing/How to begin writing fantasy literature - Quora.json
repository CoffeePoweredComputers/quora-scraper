            "answer_text": "Come up with a question. \u201cWhat if elves were really volcano demons?\u201d Then, think up a premise based on that. This isn\u2019t the plot, just the setup. \u201cThe supposedly noble elves, long thought extinct, were never actually gone. They\u2019ve just been in stasis for the last thousand years as the planet\u2019s core cooled. The other races, including their eternal enemies, the shadow wraiths, have forgotten they were ever real, or that magic really existed, once. Because the elves fought the feared wraiths, the modern legends paint elves as noble, solitary creatures, but really, they only fought over the right to rule the mortal world\u2014and unlike wraiths, they fought in packs.\u201d Okay, now think of situation within that setting. \u201cBut when a comet strikes the planet, nearly destroying all civilization, the core warms, and volcanoes around the world erupt all at once, adding to the devastation. Because of that, one elf, among the youngest and weakest of her kind, awakens to a devastated world she no longer recognizes.\u201d Now, decide on a setup and her starting goal. \u201cThe young elf is attacked by a starving survivor, lost in the mountains, but it\u2019s the first sign of intelligent life the Elf has seen since awakening. She uses her magic to look like the survivor she had to kill, in order to infiltrate the community\u2014perhaps the last such community on the planet. She seeks companionship, as elves instinctively need a pack, but also looks for a way too awaken more of her kind.\u201d Paint the stakes, now. \u201cIf she succeeds in awakening her kind, they will use their magic rituals to revive the whole world\u2014but only so they can rule it with an iron fist, forevermore. If she fails, being immortal, she faces eternity with none of her kind for company. Worse, if the apocalypse kills the last of the mortals, she could face that eternity alone.\u201d From this, a possible story angle is that her pack instinct impresses on the survivors she\u2019s with, and now she questions whether to revive the other elves because they\u2019ll enslave her new pack. Yet, if she doesn\u2019t awaken the elves, the aftermath of the comet might wipe out the few remaining survivor groups. End by deciding the end. Does she decide her pack is better off slaves than dead, and awaken the elves? Does she decide slavery is worse than death, and lets them perish in the apocalypse though it will mean eternity alone? Does she find a way to awaken the elves and restore the land, but without her new pack being enslaved? Up to you. Once you have this basic, rough concept written down, creating your actual plot becomes easier. Just a paragraph for each, or even just one sentence: I like to start by choosing the inciting incident, climax, and midpoint (where she moves from being reactive to proactive).Then, decide how to get from opening scene to inciting incident (now a much smaller, more manageable challenge).Likewise with how to get from the climax to the end.Then, you only have to flesh out how to move from that inciting incident to the midpoint, and midpoint to climax.Now you have a minimally fleshed-out yet complete story idea. You can either move on to outlining it, or just start writing by the seat of your pants. Expect many details to change, as you write and new ideas hit you, but knowing the broad story idea and where it\u2019s going make writing those first few paragraphs far less intimidating :) Alternatively, just Google \u201cfantasy plot generator,\u201d click it, and start writing whatever comes to mind. That might not be great prose, but could inspire you to start that novel you\u2019re avoiding writing. TL;DR - Read some books on how to write up story ideas, pick one, and follow its instructions. An example of such a process is detailed above. Or, just start writing whatever comes to mind, and soon, an idea for a novel might fall out. ",

            "answer_text": "You start writing by reading - the two activities are hopelessly entwined. What fantasy stories have you read so far? At least ten novels or short stories? Start there, anywhere from Grandaddy Tolkien's epic plus to J.K. Rowling and George R. R. Martin. No cheating and watching the movies instead\u2026that is, unless you want to write movies. Novels and screenplays are entirely different animals. If you like the obvious stuff, start to go off the beaten track a little. The more widely you read, the more material you'll have to write with. At some point, you'll start to play the What-If game. What if I combined this kind of character with that kind of story? What if dragons ran the world and fought fire-breathing humans instead? What if my grandfather, who watches wrestling all day and drools when he talks, is secretly a powerful wizard? That kind of stuff becomes the premise of a story. You build the characters, you build a world with rules you cannot violate (even magic has rules), and then you get to work writing, every day, until the story exists, edited and formatted, in real words on real pages that other people can read. That is your journey, beginning to middle. Marketing is the next part, but that's a whole other question for another day. ",
