            "answer_text": "The two previous answers are both correct in stating that writing that directly influences a business\u2019s profit margin could potentially be profitable for the writer too. But\u2026 it is difficult to persuade a business owner that your writing will do that, unless you can provide evidence of having done it in the past. Content marketing is a vast and broad field, and can be very lucrative. But the content you write still needs to be high quality if you want to win a reputation as a writer worth a high fee. This means taking a journalistic approach to your writing, editing and re-editing before submitting, providing corrections and other value-added tasks that the client will appreciate. In general, anything related to business, including business journalism, tends to be better paid than other topics. This is due to the reasons mentioned above - business publishers are businesses themselves, who also are able to charge higher fees to their clients. But it\u2019s also a supply-and-demand issue. Business writing can be rather dry and technical (it doesn\u2019t have to be, if you\u2019re a good writer, but it can be \u2026 lots of numbers, data to shred etc). So many freelance writers look for the glamorous topics first - eg travel writing. Who wouldn\u2019t want to get paid to go to Bali for a week and write about it? But for that precise reason travel writing is hugely competitive, and the fees on average are much lower. Then again, being the go-to person in your field is also a winning strategy, which is why selecting a niche and becoming an expert in that niche can also be a good ploy. This story was shared widely recently - a celebrity interviewer sharing how she earns US$4 a word for her writing. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "FOUR MOST LUCRATIVE FREELANCE WRITING NICHES Technical writingDepending on the technical topic you are writing about, you can make a great deal of money from this niche. The disadvantage is that you already have to be very specialised and extremely knowledgeable about a particular topic, such as the engineering and mechanics behind a certain part. Technical writing pays a high rate per word or per page due to this. Documentary WritingI do YouTube script-writing full-time, but it is very difficult to become \u201crich\u201d from this profession. Instead, you can break into the documentary and TV industry and find a position writing the scripts behind many popular documentary shows. However, the difficulty of finding a documentary job persuades many writers not to pursue it, including myself. GhostwritingIn most cases, ghostwriting is the most lucrative freelance writing niche, but only if you ghostwrite books in particular. The average rate per word for book ghostwriting goes from about 50 cents per word to 3 dollars per word. That is a lot, if you didn\u2019t realise. You can easily make fifty thousand dollars on a single book, and if you can complete that within six months, which certainly is possible, then you are in a great position. JournalismAlthough breaking into a successful journalism career takes a lot of devotion and time, it is possible and many journalists make six or seven figures per year. However, journalism is similar to documentary writing in that the effort required to \u201cmake it\u201d usually dissuades writers from going down that route. Stay silver-spoken, Josh ",
