            "answer_text": "The following info applies to the UK/ Europe, so apologies if you\u2019re not based here. I have also made the assumption that the EIA assessment report you refer to is the Environmental Statement, which has specific legal status. The level of detail required to meet the requirements of the Town and Country Planning (EIA) Regulation 2017/ EIA Directive really depends on the scale of the project, however to be legally compliant and stand up to the rigours of review by the Local Planning Authority, statutory bodies (Environment Agency, NRW etc), Barrister etc, an Environmental Statement must include at least: (a)a description of the proposed development comprising information on the site, design, size and other relevant features of the development; (b)a description of the likely significant effects of the proposed development on the environment (i.e. on air quality, ecology, archaeology, noise, water ect) (c)a description of any features of the proposed development, or measures envisaged in order to avoid, prevent or reduce and, if possible, offset likely significant adverse effects on the environment; (d)a description of the reasonable alternatives studied by the developer, which are relevant to the proposed development and its specific characteristics, and an indication of the main reasons for the option chosen, taking into account the effects of the development on the environment; (e)a non-technical summary of the information referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d); and (f)any additional information specified relevant to the specific characteristics of the particular development or type of development and to the environmental features likely to be significantly affected. An environmental statement must; (a) be based on the most recent scoping opinion or direction issued (so far as the proposed development remains materially the same as the proposed development which was subject to that opinion or direction); (b)include the information reasonably required for reaching a reasoned conclusion on the significant effects of the development on the environment, taking into account current knowledge and methods of assessment; and (c)be prepared, taking into account the results of any relevant UK environmental assessment, which are reasonably available to the person preparing the environmental statement, with a view to avoiding duplication of assessment. In order to ensure the completeness and quality of the environmental statement; (a)the developer must ensure that the environmental statement is prepared by competent experts; and (b)the environmental statement must be accompanied by a statement from the developer outlining the relevant expertise or qualifications of such experts. The important thing is that it is prepared by competent experts, therefore if you are not, you need to find someone who is (environmental consultant, planner, ecologist etc). If not, the environmental statement is not really worth the paper it\u2019s written on and will not stand up to rigorous cross-examination. If you\u2019d like more specific help, please get in touch and provide more details on the project in question. Hope this hasn\u2019t just confused you further! ",

            "answer_text": "EIA is a process which has identified steps.Its outcomes should be included in the report with certain structure and content that we call it EIA report.The content of EIA report should be followed as it is recognized by international or european legislation (however it may differ a bit in a very few countries ).The purpose of the structuralization of EIA report is to maintain accessability to respective documentation and to deliver those outcomes and findings in clear format. It should reflect baseline data on existing ecological condition, give the results on evaluation of environmental and health impacts of planned economic activity, assess best options and conclude on mitigation measures upon the impacts. We can speak a lot about EIA.However,I would recommend you to get familiar with respective guidelines to understand the whole aim of this report.Because, it is relevant to see it not as paper based work,but real analtical and beneficial source for developers on their decision making process.So,as a giudline begin with the UNEP guideline. It was developed by my favorit researcher Barry Sadler too.His publications are also reliable sources.Hope it will help you ",
