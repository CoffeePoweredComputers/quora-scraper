            "answer_text": "I belong to two poetry websites, and on one of these, the answer to your question is really \u201cNo!\u201d although there are many who do, but their work is mostly self published, meaning that they have to meet all publishing costs. I would suggest that you look at all of the poetry sites that you can, as many of these will publish your poems, but not as a book. This gives you confidence in your own ability as a poet, and you will at least see your work \u201cout there\u201d ",
