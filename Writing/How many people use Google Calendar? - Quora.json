            "answer_text": "Google Calendar is a little different than some of the other calendar applications that I have tried. It is basically a Master Calendar with a bunch of individual calendars aggregated in one place. You can have a separate calendar for personal, business, holidays and anything else that seems necessary to you. One of the primary features that I like about Google Calendar is that you can customize the color of each individual calendar so that you can easily see what you have happening at any point in time on your Master Calendar. I have a blue calendar for everything related to business, a red calendar for anything personal, a purple calendar for holidays, a gold calendar for birthdays and even a pink calendar that tells me the phase of the moon. All of these calendars show up in one place, each color-coded so I can easily see what\u2019s going on. Another nice feature is that you can turn on or off individual calendars. If I am focusing just on work tasks, I can turn off my other calendars so that only my work events show up. ",
