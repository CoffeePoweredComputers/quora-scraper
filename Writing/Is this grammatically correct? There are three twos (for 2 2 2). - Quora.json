            "answer_text": "Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands. However as the context isn\u2019t clear from the sentence, it\u2019s natural if we\u2019re a little concerned about whether this would be the usual way to express your meaning in that context. As Ms Iyer correctly says, if this is part of a telephone number or an address or any kind, it is essential to be clear. However no native speaker would say \u201cThe numerical digit \u20182\u2019 is repeated thrice\u201d. Although correct, it\u2019s terribly long-winded and over-formal.If the number is, for example, 01673 222 7345, I would say \u2018oh one six seven three, triple two, seven three four five\u2019. If questioned I\u2019d say \u201cYes, there are three twos; two two two.\u201d On the other hand if you were writing your sentence, it would be clearer if you wrote \u201cThere are three 2s\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThere are three number twos\u201d would be more clear linguistically. However, our language is beautiful in that there are many ways to convey the same thought. What truly matters in this instance is whether or not your audience comprehends the message as you intend it to be understood. If your question concerned the use of an apostrophe for the plural of two, that rule is generally only true if the plural of a numeral or of a letter are used (e.g. 2\u2019s, E's). One common saying that creates some confusion to this rule is \u201cTwo's a couple, Three's a crowd\u201d, but the reason for this is the 's serve as contractions in place of \u201ctwo is\u201d and \u201cthree is\u201d.

It used to be advised for a time to use an apostrophe with all plurals of numbers and letters. The advice did not hold up against logic, however, and now most authorities advise simply adding s except where confusion might result, as in \u201cHow many as are in the following sentence.\u201d As a young reader, I was puzzled for a while with the phrase \u201ccount by twos\" in Land of Oz, a UK publication from the 20s, to give you some historical data.

However, it is more about sounding \u201cClear\u201d than about being grammatically correct when sharing contact information like Telephone numbers, Bank Account details and Email IDs. These are highly Sensitive, Critical and Confidential information. So one should not give room for any confusion while giving and getting these details. It is ideal to say, \u201cThe Numerical digit \u201c2\u201d is repeated thrice\u201dPerfect Intonation (Giving appropriate space while talking) Say it as, \u201c The telephone No. is \u201c415- 2 2 2 - 6713\u201dIf the recipient confirms back asking, \u201cIs it 222?\u201d Say, \u201cYes! 2 comes 3 times in succession as 2 2 2\u201d NOTE the space given between each 2.
