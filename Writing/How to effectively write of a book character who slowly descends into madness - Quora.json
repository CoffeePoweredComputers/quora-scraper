            "answer_text": "My main character has a mother who went insane, and now she finally is too (due to emotional stress and trauma, and well\u2026 genetics). I find that it is very hard since I personally have no experience with insane people, but I found that researching mental illnesses, making notes and observations (the similarities of mental illnesses and mentally ill people), and watching court trials for insane (like psychopaths, X-maniacs, abusers) people helps a lot! If you are writing 1st person, make obvious things seem bizarre or vice versa; if you are writing 3rd person, mention the little flit and flutter of their smile, the insane flame in their gaze, the overly happy edge in their laugh, and their vocabulary and sentence structure or what they say. Make their actions sporadic, emotional, random, dangerous, etc, etc. Depending what caused their madness, what I said above will be a safe and effective way, but if your character went mad through trauma, a mental illness (schizophrenia, any other psychotic disorder, so on), etc then research those kinds of things. Research is key! And depending on whether you want them to be a psychopath insane or the Joker insane will also alter your researching. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "The most common approach is everything starts out with small steps and snowballs out of control. The reason why this is so common to the point of being its own trope or cliche is that mirrors real life all too well. People don\u2019t wake up raging alcoholics or junkies, just like a lot of white collar Bernie Madoffs didn\u2019t wake up one morning and say, \u201cToday, I\u2019m going to start swindling everyone out of billions!\u201d So, with a character who descends into madness, let\u2019s put together our recipe. Define the madness. Was the person born with it or do they suffer certain events that push them over the edge?Find some of the \u201cquirky\u201d eccentric traits that start out harmless at first but becomes more profane to the character\u2019s life. A common example of this is people who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorders. They start out small, but then it starts to get worse. Look at hoarding disorders. A guy who saw the move Trolls and now buys troll dolls all the time.Create a likely traumatic event that serves as a trigger to push the character onto a more dangerous path. The character\u2019s mother dies. She was there to help him keep with this counseling sessions. Now, there\u2019s no one to help the character to stay in counseling. He hears the voices again. And they are telling him this time, he should kill\u2026 Another example is the character is fired and turns to alcohol or drugs in order to cope with the depression\u2026and drown out the voices.At some point, make the character\u2019s behaviors problematic not only for himself, but to others. The guy can\u2019t hold a job and his daughter is now a ward of the state. He buys troll dolls with every dollar he gets and has them just tossed in every corner of his house. He doesn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019s eaten a good meal. He hears voices telling him to kill\u2026but he remembers his mother, what did make him do? Oh yeah, counseling. He doesn\u2019t need it anymore. He\u2019s just fine, but his old boss is going to pay. Oh yeah, that fucking bastard is going to pay in blood\u2026but not until he\u2019s watched his family go first\u2026So yeah, kind of like that\u2026 ",

He had an Al-Anon meeting planned, a Christening of a baby planned, and a Batchelor\u2019s party planned all on the very same day. He had everything planned but he continued to have terrible headaches. The night arrived, he had taken medicine for his headache but he felt very weird. How could he be in 3 places at one time? He needed an assistant but he wanted to make all of the money that he could alone! He sent the Female Strippers to the Christening of the Baby, Alcohol to the Al-Anon Meeting, and Baby Decorations and a Priest to the Batchelor\u2019s Party! Once everyone started calling him as to what terrible mistakes he had made, he decided to attend the Christening, he walked in butt naked and joined the Strippers there as the Strippers were playing a Michael Jackson song, Billie Jean Is Not My Son and Matt was doing a nude moon walk! Everyone could see that he was acting bizarre and erractic and that something was off with him, they called the police, and an ambulance, as Matt was being placed on the gurney , he began hollering and screaming about how he did not get a chance to finish performing his naked moon walk! Matt was locked up for several years with a debilitating psychosis. Even being behind locked doors you could still hear him shouting that he had not finished with his dance, the moon walk, Morning, Noon and Night! He had totally descended into a state of madness, and he would be locked up in the state hospital for the duration of his life.. Poor Matt\u2026 He never finished doing the nude moon walk\u2026\u2026 Author Dia Stone ",

            "answer_text": "My addition to the above answers would be that even though reading about the subject is good, remember that mental illness works different for different people. In other words: You have freedom to experiment, use it wisely. Furthermore, writing from experience might be one of the best methods for writing. Even if you haven't experienced anything of the sort, it's possible. Everyone has thoughts that someone else would perceive as weird. I would even go as far as stating that everyone has the seeds in him to descend into madness, often - fortunately \u2014 it doesn't come much to the surface. So my advice is: think of your weirdest thoughts; explore them, work them out; stretch them, so you reach thoughts that you've never explored before. Make a choice between those that are most interesting and that you want to share with the world (as you\u2019re writing fiction, it's not YOUR thoughts, but your character's thoughts). ",

            "answer_text": "The answer depends on how you are portraying that character. If you are using first person point of view and are showing the world through that character\u2019s eyes, then you gradually describe the world and the people in it as if the world and everyone in it is changing and the character is having more and more trouble adapting because it\u2019s not that character\u2019s fault, it\u2019s the world that\u2019s gone mad. Because that\u2019s usually the way people with mental illnesses see themselves and the world. They are right, the world is wrong. If you are writing from third person point of view, it\u2019s a little more difficult because you must show how that character sees the world changing until the entire world has gone mad and he/she is the only sane person. So it\u2019s all a matter of description. Normal versus abnormal. Sane versus insane. But all the time remember that the person losing their mind doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s happening, just thinks that everyone and everything else is going wrong. At least that\u2019s the case with almost all mental illness so it\u2019s most likely the way a reader would expect to see it happening in a story. ",

Don\u2019t fashion your character\u2019s ailments or life exactly after those in the book or movie. Just treat the book or movie content as data. Depending on who wrote the book or movie, they may have included information about illnesses and psychiatric disorders which you could also further explore. Medical books about various illness may also provide interesting information.

My first piece of advice would be to look at how other authors have handled the same issue (for instance, in the horror genre, looking at the works of HP Lovecraft and Stephen King would be a good pointer) Secondly blur the lines between reality and delusion in stages \u2026 so at the start of the story you would be writing reality with just the seeds of the madness to come, while by the end the insanity will consume most of the reality the character sees. Lastly you need to have a clear view of what effects the creeping madness is going to have on the character, and how you want it to progress \u2026 and what effects the changes are going to have on the world around him (both the real world and the one the character perceives). I apologise that I couldn\u2019t give more specific advice, but I hope the answer helps in some form. ",
