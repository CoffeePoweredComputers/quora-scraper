            "answer_text": " If you\u2019re going to die anyway and you can kill yourself at any time, why throw away what life you have? I mean, you\u2019re only going to experience this thing once and then you\u2019re going to fall into the darkness and never be heard from again. There\u2019ll be plenty of time for death later. Why rush it? You can kill yourself tomorrow. Mayo Clinic research found that after a failed suicide attempt, the odds of someone desiring to commit suicide again, decrease dramatically: After a Suicide Attempt, the Risk of Another Try I\u2019m not saying what you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t real. Quite the opposite; what you\u2019re feeling is very real. But you\u2019re feeling is emotion. It\u2019s your brain being a bully to you when it\u2019s supposed to be helping you. I think somewhere between the first thought of suicide and the actual act, most people realize they don\u2019t want to die but they also don\u2019t want to continue living the way they are. So, they find some deep hidden strength to confront their demons/life problems and change them by any means necessary. Even now, you wouldn\u2019t be asking this question if you wanted to die; You\u2019d just go do it. Like I said earlier, you can kill yourself any time. You can do it in a straightjacket, in a car, even under the most powerful sedatives in the world and not a single person can stop you \u2014 if you\u2019re meticulous enough. But you can\u2019t choose to live any time you want. Once you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re dead. You can\u2019t revive yourself in an ambulance or in a boat or in anything. Someone else has to do that for you. I\u2019m not trying to tell you what to do \u2014 you do you. If you think suicide is going to solve all your problems, go for it. But it would appear \u2014 from this question \u2014 that like everyone else, you\u2019re wired to want to survive. Good for you! You\u2019ve gotta find that fire though which says you\u2019re going to live by any means necessary and hold onto it. Skip the whole self-doubting phase. Just decide: This is my life and I\u2019m going to live it how I want. I\u2019m going to think things through and accomplish what I want. Live for today; You can kill yourself tomorrow. Go get some help and stop trying to find it from people on the Internet who know nothing of your situation. In this climate, therapists may not be affordable but support groups are on every corner. They lurk in churches, covens, secularist societies, philosophy buildings, etc. Anywhere where the falling angel meets the rising ape, you\u2019ll find a group of people looking to push past their life\u2019s problems.

            "answer_text": "Call an ambulance. That would be the best lst thing. You can always write the note later or even not have to worry about it. There is hope. Trust me I know!
