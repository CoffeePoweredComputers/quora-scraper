            "answer_text": "I'm not 100% sure about your question but I'll give it a shot. What is wrong with Philips Exeter Academy? I went to Exeter from \u201898-\u201801. I can't be sure about what is wrong there now, but I can talk about when I was there. Some of it might be the same, some might be different now. Exeter is a very good school. One thing that is wrong with Exeter is that Exeter *knows* it is a very good school. The Exeter I knew didn't examine itself closely to find out where it's strengths really were, where it's weaknesses were, and how it could improve. It was a great school so it would just continue to do what it had done before. For example, Exeter selects from the best and brightest students leaving middle schools all over the world. Exeter is very proud of itself when those students graduate from Exeter 4 years later as some of the best and brightest high school seniors in the world. Exeter fails/failed to answer [actually, fails to even ask] the question: \u201cAre these seniors the best and brightest seniors in the world because they went *here* for high school, or because they were already the best and brightest middle schoolers and they would've stayed more or less the best and brightest no matter which high school they went to?\u201d It is worth mentioning that I very much liked being a student at Exeter. I had very good relationships with the other students and with the adults on campus. It is important to keep in mind that private schools are businesses. I don't mean this as an intrinsically negative thing. Keeping it in mind though helps make certain things less surprising. When a regular kid broke the rules and got expelled, we'd be sad that we wouldn't get to see our friend anymore. When a rich kid (rich even for Exeter) broke the rules and got expelled, no one was surprised when a few weeks later that kid would be back on campus because some \u201cnew evidence\u201d (or whatever) came to light and proved they were innocent. Exeter got a lot of its money from alumni donations - even more than what they'd get in tuitions each year. So Exeter has to keep parents happy so they'll keep paying college-level tuition; they have to keep alumni happy thinking good things about the school so that they will keep donating; and, they have to keep the students happy enough that the students don't transfer out or get themselves kicked out and thereby stop paying tuition. All in all it means that the administration is incentivized to do as little boat rocking as possible: keep the school image looking good; smooth things over; sweep things under the rug; put a spotlight on star students in sports, academics, and arts; if a rich dad is making angry waves because their druggie 16 year old got kicked out then let the kid back in if that's what it'll take to get things on an even keel again. Maybe it's different now. I don't know your child (or you) so I can't say whether you should or shouldn't send your child to Exeter. Also, there's a lot of good stuff about Exeter, but you asked me for bad stuff so that's what I gave you. That said, I'd send my own kid to Exeter. I'd tell him though that he can always talk to me about anything and that if there are problems, I will have his back with administration, and I will bring those problems to the parent association, and I will bring those problems to the alumni association, and we'll see if that's enough wave-making to avoid getting swept under some rug. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it\u2019s not Phillips Academy Andover, for one. Maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with it. (Big Blue all the way! lol) Jokes aside, I\u2019m going to add an answer that isn\u2019t so much about Phillips Exeter Academy. Judging from the article you\u2019ve posted in conjunction to your question, it seems like you\u2019re asking about sexual abuse rather than the actual school itself. I don\u2019t know why so many staffers were accused of sexual harassment. However, you should take into consideration the fact that there are a dozen people who have been accused over a number of decades, who have come and gone from the institution, who have come into the light after and/or during the #metoo movement. I\u2019m not saying that having had so many people who have done this is a good thing; rather, considering the issues of the patriarchy and the stigmatization of rape victims, this has probably happened many times over and at many institutions across the board, whether it be that of education, business, politics, sports, what have you. Yeah, it\u2019s pretty fucking awful. However, it\u2019s not an issue that is limited to Phillips Exeter Academy. Perhaps the reason why there appears to be a higher number of people who have harassed students and peers is due to a higher stress environment, but it could have honestly just been the luck of the draw. People aren\u2019t hired as rapists and abusers; they are hired based on their credentials, and typically that is tied to privilege of education, wealth, and especially in the past, gender. Did Exeter handle it well at the time? Considering that it seems as though most institutions did not handle sexual abuse cases seriously even up to five years ago, and still fail to handle sexual abuse cases seriously even today, probably not. The fact that it has been addressed at all, believe it or not, is considered progressive. So I don\u2019t think you should limit your viewpoint of what PEA is based on just that one article alone. There are other answers to your question which I believe paints a good picture of what kind of environment a private school will be able to provide a student, regarding mental health and prestige. Hope this is helpful! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing particularly wrong with it, but consider that private schools have a quota for top colleges. If you want your child to get into a top college they better be bright at PEA, a school that already attracts the best and brightest. There\u2019s gonna be something like 7 slots for MIT, 5 slots for Harvard, 6 slots for Brown etc. the admissions counselors at PEA are all former admissions officers at these colleges and have relationships with them. They are in communication with the schools as well. Most schools like this even have charts and graphs that can show, with little error, based on your grades, sats, and extra curricular, which schools they will get into. An average student at PEA could easily make an attempt at being a valedictorian at a public school. Instead, this student might be #40 at PEA. Even if the grades are incredibly impressive, a strong student at a school like this might find their options limited since good colleges only accept so many from the same school. So is your child up to the challenge of competing with the best and brightest? It can be incredibly hard at a young age to be referred to as gifted and extremely intelligent, but then thrown into an environment where everyone else is as well. Is your child independent enough to live away from their parents and feed themselves properly? What kind of ideas are they forming into part of their identity as a result of their time living at school with gifted kids? Do you want the school to do this to your child or do you want to be involved in the process? These are just two things I think are important to consider. For my personalities sake, I wish I had stayed at home, but my brain was better for it. Source: went to Loomis Chaffe, played sports at Exeter many times. Beautiful campus. ",

The classes are small, taught mostly by excellent teachers around a conference table, where everyone participates. Students are expected to perform well. Some students thrive in this setting, others find it an unbearable pressure cooker. I found it difficult but it was worth it: it seems that half of what I know I learned at Exeter. The school tries to help students who are having trouble, but for some students a more nurturing environment, or a different style of learning, would be better. You certainly don\u2019t need to go to Exeter to have an excellent college experience and a good life. I\u2019m looking in a mirror to see whether, as Matthew Handy said, there\u2019s \u201csomething not quite right\u201d about me.

There were three full-time therapists on staff who, between them, counselled around a third of the student body per year. The school has exceptional facilities that wouldn't shame a small university. It offers an incredibly diverse programme of academics and extra-curriculars. At least some of the faculty are world-class educators. But it\u2019s an intense hot-house that only suits particular types of students and even for them \u2014 apparently \u2014 it often gets too much. It is possible to go to a great college and live a happy, productive life without having gone there. You can almost tell if someone\u2019s an Exonian. There\u2019s something not quite right about them . . . ",

            "answer_text": "The question is loaded. PEA works best for children who love to learn through reading and discussion. It is less well adapted to children who learn through visual stimuli or movement. The school is also full of very bright children and a child may initially feel a fall in status from being the best of the bunch in their former school to being an also ran in PEA. These are not things that are wrong with PEA. It makes a clear offer of problem based and discussion based learning drawing the best and brightest students from across the social spectrum. It is not the best option for every child particularly those who would struggle to learn in this way or struggle with a fall in relative status. It is a great school but there are other great school out there with different offers! ",

Because if your child does, then there is nothing wrong with PEA if you can afford it. The downside of any boarding school is your child is no longer living with you. Side note: My daughter wanted to go to boarding school. She pick out the schools, applied, and got accepted to one with a scholarship. It was the best thing that could happen to her. But neither my wife nor I encouraged her to do so. ",
