            "answer_text": "Is \u201cPlease find the attached signed document\u201d correct? Yes - because it is a traditional form, used for years and still widely recognised.No - because the phrase is stuffy and overly-formal and sounds like it was written by Charlotte Bronte\u2019s lawyer. We are now in the 21st century and there are many other ways to say this. \u201cI have attached\u2026\u201d, \u201cI have included\u2026\u201d, \u201cI have appended\u2026\u201d etc.Yes - because your observance of stuffy formality will impress crusty old curmudgeons who went to school with Queen Victoria and it will reduce the chances of them thinking that you are \u201c\u2026a young, ignorant whippersnapper.\u201dNo - if you are writing to a modern, high-tech company that prides itself on innovation.Yes - in the sense that it will successfully draw attention to the attachment.No - because If we are really going to play \u201cthe archaic business speech game\u201d - we should say \u201cPlease find attached the signed document\u201d. The document to which you refer is (presumably) attached - and you are simply pointing-out the fact. \u201cPlease find the attached\u2026\u201d sounds like you are directing the recipient on a scavenger-hunt! You should also refer to this month, last month and next month as \u201cinst\u201d, \u201cult\u201d and \u201cprox\u201d and sign-off with \u201cI have the honour to remain, Madam, Your most humble and obedient servant\u2026\u201d",

            "answer_text": "As it stands (and as commented on already), the statement sounds much like an invitation to go in search of the document, which is almost certainly not the intention. The usual (if somewhat archaic/stuffy) instruction is to say: \u2018Please find [attached/enclosed] the [signed] document\u2019. A more casual alternative would be to say: \u2018I [attach/enclose] the [signed] document\u2019, adding if necessary a description of what the document in question is, if this has not already been made clear. Of course, it is often better to be specific and name the document for what it is, e.g. the contract; will; lease, or whatever. So, \u2018I enclose the contract, which you should sign where I have marked your initials in pencil \u2026\u2019 would be a clear and user-friendly instruction. Strictly, a document should only be described as \u2018attached\u2019 if it is physically joined to the covering letter, e.g. by a staple or even a paperclip. Otherwise, it is merely \u2018enclosed\u2019. ",
