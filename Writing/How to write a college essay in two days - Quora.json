            "answer_text": "Okay, first finish panicking, if you do not get the panic out of your system, you are doomed since all you will think about the deadline and nothing else will. If you can, ask for an extension on the deadline but if your college is strict, you are going to need a good excuse. Second, stop procrastinating about not knowing what to write, you do, it really won\u2019t feel like it but you do. Pick a start time and go from there, do not deviate. Third look at the prompt, since you mentioned college essays and mine were about 2000 words I will assume yours are about the same, break it down into themes and review your notes. Your notes will have the answer, if you can\u2019t find it in them or it\u2019s a creative writing type prompt or college application prompt, stick the prompt through a thesaurus and rewrite it until it makes sense. Try about four themes, 400 words or 20% of the total word count per theme and link them, forget about an opening paragraph and your conclusion for now which can be formulated at the end of writing from the meat of the essay. 10% of the total word count should go to the opening paragraph and 10% - 15% conclusion. The above will make a first draft. Go for a walk, eat, take a bath, play a game or something to relax. Revise the essay by reading it aloud, by reading aloud you\u2019ll change how you perceive your own writing. Fix the errors, go to bed and hand it in on time. Breathe, it is more than a little doable in two days, unless its 20,000 words at which point I wish you luck and recommend a lot of caffeine. ",

            "answer_text": "Step one: Read the question carefully. Step two: Bullet point what will fulfill the essay\u2019s requirements. Step three: Check the asked for word count, the format (font size and type, spacing, etc.) and set up your document accordingly. Step four: Your intro paragraph - it should have your core statement/hypothesis. Step five: The paragraphs that support your hypothesis. Each paragraph should be built around one of the bullets that supports the essay\u2019s ask and your hypothesis. Step six: Your conclusion should wrap up what you\u2019ve just said in a tight little paragraph. Step seven: Copy edit your essay. You can run it through a free program (I like Grammarly) that will catch a lot of errors. Then, go take a 20 minute nap or walk, come back, print out a copy and read it aloud in a speaking tone. Your ear will pick up other errors and you may discover some logic errors, clunky writing, etc. If the ask is for an experience essay, then don\u2019t make stuff up. Think about your life to date and write about something real. In this case, Steps 1, 2, 3 and 7 still apply. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a tip that will make the task a lot easier: Almost certainly, there is no right or wrong answer. Don\u2019t agonize over the \u201cright\u201d answer to whatever the prompt is. That\u2019s not what the college is looking for. It\u2019s looking for essays that: Specifically respond to the prompt and to the instructions. Answer the prompt directly, whatever it\u2019s asking for. And if the instructions say \u201c. . . no more than 2,000 words . . .\u201d then make absolutely, 100% sure your essay is 1,999 words or less.Are written clearly. Check your grammar and spelling.Develop and defend your position. If the question is \u201cWhich is a better color: Red or blue?\u201d you answer the question and defend your answer. As I said at the beginning, your answer itself is meaningless. It\u2019s how you defend it.Red is a better color because: It is the color of blood, which embodies life itself.Red is the color of the sky at sunrise, offering the promise of a new day.On stop lights, it signifies \u201cstop,\u201d preventing injury or death to people who otherwise might drive through the intersection without stopping.Blue is a better color because: It is the color of the sky, offering nearly limitless possibilities.Blue is the color of the oceans as seen from space. Water gives life.It can be the color of a person\u2019s eyes, offering a view into that person\u2019s soul.OK, some of my examples are a bit strained. But the point is clear: Even with a nonsense question asking you to choose the better color, you can make a solid argument regardless of your position. That\u2019s really what the college is interested in: Can you think logically and argue persuasively? So don\u2019t worry about the answer itself. Just make sure you show how you get from Point A to Point B. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, there are always so many debates over the ways of speeding up the writing process, in which the students are involved unwillingly. I remember my own studentship and the pains, which essay composing brought me at first. It really took me a lot of time before I tasted the joy it gave me. However, I worked hard then to prove my good writing ability. But that\u2019s another story\u2026 For the past 10 years I\u2019ve been watching a lot of guys, who worked their fingers to the bone in attempt to produce some more or less fine content. This allowed me to make just one conclusion: if you finally understand that writing is not your cup of tea, better stop wasting paper. The specialists may easily solve all your problems in a matter of hours and the fees they ask for their services are not usually extra high. Quite apart from the fact whether you compose the text on your own or buy it, here is one rule for you to learn: unchecked text will never bring you success. Can\u2019t cope with editing on your own? Hire a professional proofreader to help you with all the errors detecting and correcting. Thus, you will soon manage to achieve much in writing business and who knows, maybe you will soon realize that writing is your calling. It\u2019s quite a nice try to earn some money. ",

I don't anticipate that myself will begin combining material for the paper till this end of the week, which abandons me a lot of time to design a successful exposition. Here's the timetable I effectively utilized last time, when I was taking a gander at parts of Nietzsche's In this way Spoke Zarathustra and the Gay Science. In all actuality, the entire procedure I'm proposing is longer than only two days, yet I guarantee in the event that you utilize the pre-composing steps I recommend, you'll have the capacity to do the real writing in a substantially shorter timeframe!

If I were you, I would also apply to the college for an extension of time right now, while it\u2019s still possible. If you don\u2019t understand the question, then ask one of your class-mates to explain it to you. Brain-storm a few ideas and write them down. This should help. As long as you hand something reasonable in, you should be fine. It doesn\u2019t have to be the best essay of all time- you only have to pass, so keep your expectations of yourself realistic.
