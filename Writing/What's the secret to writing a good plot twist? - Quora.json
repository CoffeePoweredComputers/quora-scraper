The following answer is from my writing book titled W Write Better Right Now: Creative Writing Tips http://amzn.com/B00IHIWUDC Only $1.99. \u201cTwist It What is a twist? A plot twist is a change in the expected direction or outcome of the plot of a novel or other work of narrative. It is used to keep the interest of an audience, usually surprising them.  A perfect example of a good twist can be found in the movie The Sixth Sense, a 1999 film starring Bruce Willis. In it a boy who communicates with ghosts that don't know they're dead seeks the help of a disheartened child psychologist. Throughout the film the psychologist has problems of his own with his marriage. The twist? The reason the boy can communicate with the psychologist is because the doctor is also dead but doesn't know it. This twist comes at the end. In order for the twist to work, you have to deliberately mislead your audience, but the build-up once revealed has to also be true to the twist. All of the scenes in the Sixth Sense make sense. In other words, they all worked whether the man was dead or not. For example in a teary restaurant scene where the doctor and his wife were seated opposite one another at a table, it appeared that his wife was talking to him when she was really talking to her dead husband, telling him she was angry that he wasn't there for her. The doctor, not knowing he's dead, thought she was angry because he had forgotten their anniversary and had arrived at the restaurant late. He was trying to tell her he was sorry, but she appeared to be talking right over him. It was an excellent scene that gave you an aha moment once you knew the twist.  The twist should always be pertinent to the story. Don't make the mistake of dropping something odd in that has no bearing on the storyline whatsoever. Plot twists have to be logical, make sense to the reader, and they must be connected to the story.  Here are 5 rules to twist your story. \u00b7 Make it believable. Even in a paranormal you have to make it somewhat believable. For example a fireman dies in a fire and his family is devastated. A good twist here might be that instead of burying her husband, the wife goes to a Voo Doo lady who claims she can bring the dead back to life. And she does, but it goes terribly wrong. A bad twist? You have a tiny fairy popping down from heaven who teaches the wife how to dance the cha-cha. What? You can't have a silly twist that will end up spoiling the story. \u00b7 Don't get too outrageous. Something too oddball will have the reader putting the book down. No pink unicorns in the middle of a modern mystery. You want your twist to fit right in, not throw the reader off. If the twist is too strange, it's basically a story killer. \u00b7 Don't be boring. The point of a twist is that it must be surprising and it must enter the story at the right time. Any type of story can benefit from a twist. If a man is trying to win a woman's love and he sends her flowers, that's nice but predicable. A good twist here would be if he sent her a puppy not knowing she's allergic to dogs. \u00b7 Don't spring something on your readers out of the blue. Leave small clues, and slight descriptions that could eventually lead the reader to the right answer if they paid attention. Nothing is worse than reading a good murder mystery only to find out the killer is some character that is introduced in the last chapter. Makes me want to kill the author. Write the most predictable scene imaginable. Write three ways that the reader would expect the story could go. Then throw those ideas away. Here's your scene: a man and a woman are stranded on an uninhabited island in the Bahamas because of a boat fire. They swim to shore and watch the boat burn and sink. Nighttime is near. What happens next? 1) They make a fire. 2) They find shelter. 3) They try to find water. Nope. What happens next? They hear odd growling noises coming from the interior of the island. There are no wild animals in the Bahamas, but something quite large is definitely making its way towards them. Now do you want to read on? Sure, you do ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t PLOT your novel. The best plot twists happen when you surprise the hell out of yourself as a write. The only way to achieve this is to write as EL Doctorow has put it, like a car driving in the night with the headlights on. It's a received idea that thriller writers must work to a plot. Yet even someone like Stephen King avoids plotting. \"I start a book ... knowing just two things: the basic situation and that the story will create its own patterns naturally and organically if I follow it fairly...and by fairly I mean never forcing characters to do things they wouldn't do in real life...For me, the first draft is all about story. I trust that some other part of me\u2014an undermind\u2014will create certain patterns.\" Instead, he chooses pace of creation, writing his first drafts of novels in a season or ninety days. In my case, I prepare a rough plot outline and then I ignore it. I work out what I\u2019m doing in draft after draft probably because I love the mystery of the writing act and I write to find out what happens! J.M. Coetzee has said he too works things out in the writing. He prefers revision over plotting. So from mainstream to upstream, this is how many writers really write books. I think beginners get stuck on the rocks of plot and stay there. That's why the preoccupation is dangerous. The problem with outlining in detail is twofold. First, it gets in the way of writing and it becomes a bad habit and an activity in itself. Plotting is not writing. The zealous plotter is like the nervous swimmer pacing around the edge of the swimming pool and not getting in. Second - you sink under the burden of the meanness and confinement of the detail you have created and when you have finished the plotting you almost feel you are done with the book. My best advice about plotting is to have one sentence for your concept, one page at most scrawled as a promise to yourself and the reader at the beginning of your notebook. There you will write where it\u2019s going, but you can remain uncertain about the end and leave that special discovery, that particular joy yours to unfold. Plotting is a false friend in an hour of doubt too. Even old hands may go to it as a comfort blanket at times, and I too will tinker with a plan a couple of times probably between drafts knowing I'm prevaricating because the real work is being done deep down inside me and needs time. I'm stalling that's all. It's ok, you need to pause and take breath at times. But don't get stuck again in the bad habit of plottery. Once I've drafted a plot a second time, I will allow myself again the willful liberty of diverting from it because I keep the mystery and magic of the tale foremost in my heart and mind when writing a novel, and that's how you build into your book an experience a reader enjoys too. Showing up every day and loving the work to bits and forgiving yourself and seeing the way writing transforms your own experience of life is where it\u2019s at. That's the essence of what I preach at Kritikme.com. Not tired old writerly clich\u00e9s designed to keep you on the starters blocks addicted to doing courses and drafting plot outlines, but a way to get your novel done. Let go of the handrail, stop biting your nails. Sit down at your desk, begin with three or four words that came to you today and be at peace. ",
