Convincing 50+ yo old people their world-view is dated and soon their opinions won\u2019t matter ( Yep, parents any one? )Convincing the girl you like that she should date you ( yep, yep, I realize V day is coming )Doing Jumping Jack \u2014 lotta effort but \u2026 meh. No work.Pushing Mount Everest - trying to move it ( equivalent to 1,2,\u2026 )Oh you meant the physics one? That is also true for [3,4,\u2026]. Fact.  Thus\u2026 any force that could not move any particle where it is being applied\u2026 is doing zero work. Now convince yourself. ",

E.g, a boy pushing a wall, a man carrying a load and walking on level ground does no work. Negativwork; if the component of a force is in opposite direction to displacement, thework done is negative!
