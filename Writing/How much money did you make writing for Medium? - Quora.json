            "answer_text": "How much money did you make writing for Medium? I have joined the Medium Partner program at the very beginning of 2020, the 1st of January. It is not that I was waiting for the first day of the new year but I was writing on Medium from March 2019. So, technically, you can only make money on Medium if you are a part of the Medium Partner program. Medium has changed the criteria for paying its writers. You make money on Medium based on the read time from the Medium members. For a 1-minute Member read time, you make $0.03 to $0.04 so in one of the case studies on Medium Is Lengthy Medium Stories Make More Money? it has been showed that Lengthy stories on Medium make more money as one user on average spends more time reading then shorter stories. So, one of the most important things about the Medium partner program is to write lengthy writers on Medium.  So, here is my two months report as I am writing this answer in March 2020. In the first month of 2020, I made over $4.4, yeah, my first month. One thing I have learned about this is that the more stories you publish on Medium, the more money you make. The second thing I learned was that you should focus on targeting medium members interested in a topic. Let say, there are people who are interested in \u201chow Medium works?\u201d and they are also interested to know everything about Medium, then there should be a writer on the platform that provides them every bit of information they need. Traffic from search engine also plays a very important role, here is how you can optimize your Medium story for the search engine. Don\u2019t Buy A Course Of SEO Instead Read ThisIn the second month of 2020, this was far better than the previous month. I have made over $44 In February and this gives me the confidence you can make more then that if you are a little bit consistent on this platform. There is something that I have learned over the course of one month. Curation and getting published in popular publications matters a lot, but there is a twist to the story. You can also make your own publication and fortunately, if you use the same tags in all your stories, Medium will also show your posts from the \u201cMore from Medium\u201d option. The publication I have started is this one, you can follow it if you want to know about Medium, Quora and other digital products Menlo Blogging And Blogs \u2013 Medium I hope this will helps you. You can follow me on Medium Or I will eat your cookies Aamir Kamal \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \u2013 Medium ",

            "answer_text": "I joined the Medium Partner Program in December of 2019 and made my first post a couple of days before Christmas. I\u2019ve been posting there ever since, sporadically at first, but now fairly regularly, as I\u2019m looking to make Medium a more consistent source of income going forward. I\u2019d have to go check for exact stats, but I\u2019ve made about $10,000 since I first started writing there. I\u2019m currently at about 3.5K followers. The key to making that kind of money and gaining followers is writing stories with viral potential. The great majority of what I\u2019ve earned (as well as the followers I\u2019ve gained) came from only two stories. I lucked out and had my very first story go viral. Then it happened again with another story I wrote over this past summer. After the second viral story, I figured I\u2019d better spend more time over there and put some work into becoming a consistent poster. The more articles you write, the more potential you have that one of them will become a runaway hit. So, it\u2019s definitely possible to make a decent chunk of change over there. There are even people who write on Medium for their full-time living. You get there by writing as well as you can as often as you can. Taking every opportunity to learn and improve is important, too. Even a good writer can always be much better. ",
