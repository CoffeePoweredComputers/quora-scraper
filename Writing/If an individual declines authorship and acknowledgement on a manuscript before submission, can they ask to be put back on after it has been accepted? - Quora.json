            "answer_text": "They can ask, but whether this is reasonable or will be successful is another matter. This kind of authorship dispute is sadly too common. You may however be able to avoid this process by offering a compromise, which is to publish a correction to acknowledge the PI for their role. You may tell the journal and PI of this offer, and that if the PI does not agree and still insists on authorship that you will seek a decision from your institution and provide them with the evidence that the PI declined to be an author or be acknowledged. The PI may take the easy option of an acknowlegment If not, I suggest you request a meeting with the PI and the department chair or dean as soon as can be arranged to discuss the matter of authorship and contributions to the project. If you have a research integrity officer, involve them too. Make sure all the other co-authors are aware, if there are any. If you don't initiate an institutional investigation, the journal editors or publisher probably will request one. Tell the journal this is happening - journals cannot usually resolve authorship disputes themselves, as they do not have knowledge of who contributed. Give them the contact details of whoever is going to oversee and resolve the dispute and an idea of how long this may take. Bring documentation of who contributed to the research (conception, funding, design, providing materials or data, running experiments, recording data, analyzing data) and the manuscript (drafting, creating figures and tables, editing). Also bring all communication you had with the PI about the manuscript and in particular their refusal to be on the submission as an author or in the acknowledgments. ",
