            "answer_text": "I have to disagree with the previous answer. I read a LOT as a middle school and high school student, most of it fiction. Some of the authors were great, some only OK and some rather poor. But one thing I did come away with is a sense of how grammar works and how a proper sentence should \u201csound\u201d to your inner ear. After a few hundred books, a poorly written sentence is obvious, even jarring. I happily confess that I could not diagram a sentence if my life depended on it, but I know from numerous professors and, more recently, readers of my science fiction books, that my writing is strong. I do believe that you can absorb the rules of good grammar from reading good writers. You may not be able to specify the rule of grammar, but you sure can point to something and say it is improperly written. In fairness, it certainly doesn\u2019t hurt to take a grammar course and learn it the traditional way, but as you get out into the world you will learn that in most cases you write to persuade your reader of something. It might be a memo in which you are trying to persuade a business prospect to partner with you, or you may be selling a product or service to a potential buyer, or you may be writing books. In any case, you will find that knowing traditional grammar only takes you so far, you must also know how to best structure your thoughts to achieve your goal. And sometimes you will find that you can be more forceful with a statement that does not rigidly follow the traditional rules of grammar. It will not be grammatical, but it will read well and \u201csound\u201d well to the reader, which is always your ultimate goal. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not think a person can become proficient in grammar just by reading. When we read, we do a lot of skimming. We pass over the tough grammatical choices the writer had to make. To become proficient with grammar we have to use the tools of grammar, not just skim over words. Grammar is a tool that enables us to construct good, creative sentences. Can a person be proficient in building houses simply by looking at houses? No, they must use the tools, make the decisions of a carpenter, and build a house. If a person wants to become proficient in grammar, they have to do some writing. That is where the tools are used.
