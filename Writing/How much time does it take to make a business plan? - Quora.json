            "answer_text": "Since I am writing the plan (as a one-man team) right now and I can tell you to budget about 4-8 weeks.  Why?   I have a lot of experience in writing business plans given this is to be my third startup.  Experience in knowing what to analyse helps a lot but even then its  harder work than I remembered. A good business plan is not just the plan itself, its (at least partially) validated assumptions.  Anything else wouldn't really be a business plan... just a business plan plan.  Calling it a lean canvas doesn't avoid the need to test assumptions before showing it to investors or have a clear strategy! However, the truth is that the business plan is only one of many things that need to happen when starting a business.  I am also networking (3-4 hours per day), interviewing lawyers and potential recruits, opening the legal entity, filing for patents and IP, figuring out the financial side and funding strategy, and writing the product specs for the prototype... and all of this needs to happen yesterday.  Plus, as any good entrepreneur, I have several projects which I am involved with which require a minimum amount of time. The point is that business planning is not a full-time activity, but one of many things that need to happen in parallel. There is never a \"good\" time for business planning so it occupies the late shift, 7pm until 3am.  Clearly the more you can focus on writing the plan the quicker it gets done.  But when there is the chance to build a great company on the line you need to multi-task. Ok, enough distractions, go start! ",

            "answer_text": "That is a very broad question. It depends upon how knowledgeable your team is. A startup has no history, so you need to utilize comparable market data. If you have it, this cuts down on time. If you don't, you could spend weeks searching for the appropriate data. If you have a very good handle on your proposed startup, all data required and a proficient team with non-stop time to allocate, you can produce a business plan in less than a week. This does not just pertain to startups. Established businesses have all of their historical data. But they may not have the time, staff or other resources to prepare the business plan expeditiously. Or they may have different ideas about the direction the business should take causing debate, deliberation, delay and multiple extensive rewrites which could lead into months. In regards to which section will take longer, once again, that depends upon your team. If you are deficient in the accounting arena, you financial projections will either take longer or they will be incomplete. If you are deficient in the marketing arena, your marketing plan will either be deficient or the process will be lengthy as you educate yourself while completing the section. Time frame is directly proportional to your professional team's experience and adeptness in that area of experience. A business plan should be a living document that is updated as you progress. So, you will write, rewrite and modify the plan multiple times over the life of the business. If you have further questions, feel free to send me a message. ",
