            "answer_text": "I am perpetually reminded of Ellen Ripley, the protagonist from Alien, when thinking on a question like this. That character is often listed as one of the few beloved female characters in popular culture, especially by social conservatives who have an axe to grind about fundamental differences in masculinity and femininity. Ripley is assumed to be a feminine hero, who does what she does without abandoning her motherly side. What amuses me without end is that Ripley was written to be gender-neutral, as were the rest of the cast; her gender was changed at the last minute specifically because the director wanted an element of feminism in his movie. Ellen Ripley is the very definition of shoehorning gender politics into a movie, yet people \u2014 social conservatives, especially \u2014 list her as a prime example of how not to do that exact activity. Why, one wonders? The reason is twofold. Firstly, the character is genuinely beloved, which makes it easier to forget and forgive any flaws. Secondly, people such as this have a picture of history in their heads that lacks details or nuance, wherein everything before a certain point is simple free of gender-politics, and everything after is plagued with it \u2014 because Ripley is in the former category, it must be free of gender politics, even though it isn\u2019t. However, the larger lesson here is in looking at why she is beloved. It\u2019s not hard to write female characters in general; people have been doing it since the dawn of literature. What is hard to do is to write a female character that\u2019s actually beloved \u2014 one that people not only like, but also think about for years to come. Male characters like that exist aplenty in a variety of genres, but not female ones; whether the female characters are perfect or flawed, heroic or villainous, allegorical or simply people in their own right, the female ones tend to have a harder time getting traction with just about anybody, beyond a cursory and temporary interest. Consider the last time you read a story with a female lead that explores existential questions, or metaphysical ones, or some sort of symbolic struggle that might lead one to ruminate on the archetypal nature of femininity. Any kind of profound human struggle that goes beyond everyday pettiness. Can you think of even one? It\u2019s quite difficult. All the female characters I even halfway like are more or less stable members of society who, at best, amuse themselves with atypical interests. There\u2019s little to no real struggle there that might change their worldview in a way that explores difficult questions \u2014 unless the struggle is sexism, in which case the book either turns into an amateur social commentary, or the female character\u2019s lack of interesting characteristics are immediately forgiven, for the sake of ranting about how men and male tendencies are garbage. The reason it\u2019s hard to write a beloved female character is because almost nobody writes them that well. Almost nobody writes them to have profoundly difficult journeys in which they conquer massive obstacles to become vastly different people. The stakes are rarely enormous, which means the reader\u2019s investment in them is rarely enormous. Argue about gender roles all you want, but this is a really boring way to write characters, especially as a standard for an entire gender. And I gather it will continue to be this way, because even the most \u2018progressive\u2019 among us would prefer to read about remixed stereotypes. Ideology, liberal or conservative, can\u2019t substitute for character traits. The result of that is inhuman. ",

            "answer_text": "I keep seeing a lot of people saying \u201cthey aren\u2019t because women are people\u201d, and while I do naturally agree with that, I do have to interject that I think I know what you mean. A person is a person, regardless of gender or sex, but at the same time, it can be Uncomfortable to write certain perspectives. Many writers - especially when just starting out - have a fear of writing something they are unfamiliar with, or that they were raised with some sort of biased views around. I myself STILL struggle with abject terror every time I start trying to write a male character. It doesn\u2019t last long, but I was raised in a family that hammered in a LOT of gender bias. It can be hard to get past that, even if you don\u2019t personally believe it. Even if you hate the way of thinking that creates that discomfort or fear, it is hard to set it aside. There is also the fact that, while we want our characters to be real people, regardless of gender, the world around them HAS had an effect on them. In much the way my upbringing makes it hard to deal with anything male (ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s in a negative sense), it can be hard to think of how certain aspects of some part of humankind that we have not been exposed to might be affected by their society. If I write a male character, I have to create a believable person, but I also have the immediate fears of \u201chow would male society have impacted this sort of personality?\u201d or \u201chow hard would it be for a man to be like this?\u201d. Fears of \u2018getting it wrong\u2019 can be monumental. On the reverse side, there is also the terror of stereotype. Some authors fall back on stereotype rather than put in detail, and I know I\u2019ve caught myself going that way a few times. Sometimes stereotypes happen for a reason, but it\u2019s always good to make sure that the character is still a person underneath. If you are having trouble writing a female character, ask yourself why. What stops you from feeling comfortable with the character? What feels right? How would a real person react? How would they react if they had been through this or that earlier in life? It CAN be very hard to get around these fears and hesitations, but just keep in mind that when you get stopped up behind something, either you are unconsciously aware that something in the story is wrong, or you have run into one of your personal fears. Short version: Don\u2019t feed the fear demons, unless you can get a REALLY good bargain.  \u201cYou know if you had caught something bigger, this would have been a really bad idea, right?\u201d Arra asked. She got up onto all fours again and scrambled over to the mannequin. \u201cBigger?\u201d Claire asked. She got up and followed Arra. \u201cI\u2019m just a tiiiiny Nacht,\u201d Arra said, twitching and jerking in unpleasant ways. Her tail slithered past her and poked at the leather boot that was still on the mannequin. Her voice took on a sing-song cadence; \u201cOnce around the mulberry bush, the demon chased the weasel, bit its tail and chewed off its ears, and gave it a lit-tle squeeeezel\u2026 It saw a door not far away, and wondered what was waaai-ting, it knocked and rang and smelled a tang, of rage\u2019s new-borne eeeasel.\u201d \u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Claire said, \u201cthat\u2019s creepy as ____.\u201d ",
