            "answer_text": "Oh my goodness,  this is quite the question. My opinion is that here in the U.S. there's a standard that we as a society have over time built-in to our mindsets of what is right and what is wrong,  what behavior is acceptable and not acceptable. However speaking for myself only, I tend to want my daily activities private and this is because I fear that some of my personal pass time activities will be judged and I will not be respected or friends and family members will feel like they must insert their own opinions on my prefered way of living my life. I know that having an opinion is just a natural thing we as humans do in order to figure ourselves out and I believe aids us finding our individualaity. Here in states public opinions for a lot of people dictate every aspect of our lives from our sleeping schedule, the food we eat , to even the toiletries we display in our bathrooms.  It's not to that extreme for everyone but it's a very sad truth here that's a reality. It's sad that studies have claimed to find that in the first ten minutes of meeting someone, they will tell you at least 3 lies. We lie because want or My belief  (based on personal truths) feel like who we truly are or are not is subject to such scrutiny by any individual that it's better to just lie or even worse deny ourselves and live in a shame driven shadow of what society as whole deems acceptable.  Making true uniqueness rare and mental illness a growing epidemic and more normal and accepted than true individualaity.  It's sad that I fear posting something to my social network page at 3 am or 4 am because unless I am working \"what on earth am I doing awake at those times when I should be sleeping.\"  It's that ignorant at times and would like to live where the people that you're having to explain this to live.  I maybe wrong and many may disagree with me and that's greater if they do, but this is the opinion of just me ok, so take it with a grain of salt.   ",
