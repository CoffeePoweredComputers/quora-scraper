            "answer_text": "I appreciate your eager spirit, but don't worry, they will tell you. Virtually on Day 1, you'll be given a \"Skill Plan\", which is a matrix with ~20 individual skills and the expectation for how you express those skills in 6-month intervals from first-year Associate Consultant all the way up to Partner. I believe Bain would consider that matrix proprietary, so I won't reproduce it here, but broadly, the skills are grouped into three categories: Value Addition, Client/ Communication, and Team. The weight on each category changes as you progress - the early focus is primarily on Value Addition. Twice per year, you will receive a formal \"Consensus Review\" from your \"Consensus Reviewer.\" Your Consensus Reviewer is an independent Manager or Partner in your office - you may or may not have worked directly for him or her. You generally have one Consensus Reviewer for your entire career at Bain. The Consensus Reviewer's job is to consolidate Input Reviews from your case Managers and other Input Reviewers, look for trends, and create a development plan for you. She will also put check marks in your skills matrix to mark the level of each skill that you currently possess. Finally, she will advocate for your performance rating (and therefore your bonus) with the Performance Committee, which is ultimately how you get promoted (or fired). This whole process is what Bain does best. Ultimately, they want you to develop skills as quickly as possible. As they say, \"Our People Are Our Product.\" Hopefully you joined because you're looking to grow and learn, because this process ensures you will get plenty of feedback (and most of it won't make you feel great).
