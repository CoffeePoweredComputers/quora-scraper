If you would like an idea for the brief speech\u2026.talk about the power of silence\u2026in speaking. That may seem odd, but it\u2019s not. According to Dr. Don Kirkley, who taught public speaking at the Pentagon, the key to effective speaking is\u2026.hesitation. Pause. No more than six (6) words at a time without a pause\u2026.even less..than six\u2026.will work\u2026.nicely. That will give the audience an opportunity to process what you\u2019ve said and will convey confidence. ALL great speakers pause. Regardless if you liked their politics\u2026.JFK, Clinton, Obama, Paul Harvey, all great speakers\u2026.pause. Also, it means you are saying less, which can mean less stress for you. If you use hesitation correctly, your audience will cling to every word.

            "answer_text": "A 2-minute speech is only about 250\u2013300 words, which is about 1 page in Times New Roman 12-pt type, double-spaced with 1-inch margins. So you need to be VERY focused - make one point and one point only - and start off with a story, not 30+ seconds of thank you and it\u2019s nice to be here. The best thing you can do is to write the intro for the person who will bring you on stage (or intro to a room), so that it sets up your talk. Don\u2019t give your whole background, only the part of your background that establishes you as an expert and/or the authority on the subject matter of the 2-minutes you are about to espouse. You can thank the introducer AS YOU WALK ON STAGE, not from the podium during your 2-minutes. With all of that in mind, now you must take 30 minutes to write as much as you like about what you want to say. Then take the next 2 hours to review-cut-read-review-cut-read-review-cut-read until it is down to 250\u2013300 words. ",
