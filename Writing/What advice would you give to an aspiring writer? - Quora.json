            "answer_text": "Write everyday. Period. Full Stop. No excuses. Now get up and do it. Work on your prose (the craft of stringing words together with your own, distinctive voice). Develop your own unique voice. Don\u2019t use big words simply for the sake of sounding smart. Know thyself and write thyself because nobody is going to want to read you if you aren\u2019t really you on that page. Exercise your storytelling ability. Storytelling and writing are not the same skill, though in the hands of an experience writer they always overlap. Understand what makes a good story, or moves a story along by studying the various forms of short stories, novels and plays. Know basic things like Point of View and tense. Play with point of view. For example, put your own voice into third person. Try to keep personal pronouns out of your writing, or move the character\u2019s point of view around. Switch from present to past tense, play with tense of verbs as though they were paint. You can learn how to play with point-of-view and tense intuitively if you read every day for years. Which leads to the next piece of advice: Develop your narrative muscles. EG. READ. And read a lot. And don\u2019t just read a lot of mindless froth\u2026read quality literature everyday. If you read junk, you\u2019ll write like junk. So read only the best fiction and narrative. That means that the pantheon of writing gods like Melville, Faulkner, Welty, Hemingway etc etc etc and should be the staples of your diet. Read the winners of the Pulitzer Prize literary award when they are announced every year, and also the other authors who got shortlisted. Reading contemporary writers will give you the added benefit of knowing what publishers are looking for, and what they consider to be quality work. If reading all of that sounds boring then don\u2019t be a writer. Writers only have two jobs: to get up everyday and bled onto the page, and to read until words and stories are coming out of their eyeballs. If you don\u2019t enjoy both of those things then find another hobby. Mimic great writers. Having trouble with action? Read some Anais Nin and try to craft your own story based on the structure of her erotic novellas. Struggling with dialogue? Get your hands on some stage plays and write a narrative that\u2019s entirely told through dialogue. Train yourself by studying the techniques of the greats who went before you. Use guided meditation or acting methods to get into character. Writing is a lot like acting: in many ways authors also have to get into character. Actors are astute observers and mimics of people. Authors are as well. Go to bars, sit on buses. Watch people. Then act them out, but on paper. Actors use meditations to get into character and writers can, too. Take an acting class or learn the Meisner or method acting techniques and adapt them for the written word. Travel, Look and Live. Writing may be a solitary act but the best writers were always traveling around, meeting new people and experiencing the juice of life. Capote, Orwell, Hemmingway, Duras, Celine, Fitzgerald\u2026all of these writers and more lived life to the fullest, then wrote about it. Don\u2019t be afraid of going on an adventure. Just be sure to take your notebook and write it down! Speaking of notebooks, all the best writers were constantly writing. And by constantly writing I mean they were putting their ideas down into notebooks. Carry a notebook and pen with you at all times. When an idea pops into your head, or a certain turn of phrase, PUT IT DOWN! Don\u2019t wait. If you wait, the words will pass you by. If you hear the muse, catch her before she runs away. Train yourself to write in a notebook every day, every chance you get. Train yourself to go back to those notes and expand on them later down the line. Transcribe your notes onto the computer. The act of doing this \u2014jotting down and then revisiting your notes\u2014 is one of the best ways to keep your hand writing all day, every day. Attend a writing retreat. Don\u2019t just attend any writing retreat. Only attend the best. Every few months I attend the PARIS WRITING RETREAT hosted by NY Times Literary Agent, Wendy Goldman Rohm. Her retreats are listed among the top 3 writer\u2019s retreats to attend worldwide by the Lonely Planet. The money is well worth the experience: you will meet literary agents and NY Times best sellers and other authors and writers from various walks of life. There are other great (literary) writing programs out there, but the ones of a high caliber may require you to send in a resume and writing sample. Some retreats are competitive. I prefer to attend Wendy\u2019s retreats because there are writers of every level in attendance, which means that you get to learn from authors that have done it before and new writers that are just starting out. Find a great agent or developmental editor who understands your work and what you are about. I found my agent through the Paris Writing Retreat (link above) and have since gotten excellent developmental editing through my agency\u2019s services. A good developmental editor will help you learn how to write. However, you won\u2019t get a good agent or editor if you are not a serious writer and haven\u2019t made writing your lifestyle. Let me be clear: writing is a LIFESTYLE. To be a truly successful writer you need as much dedication as a Russian ballet dancer or a classical pianist. You need to be writing every day, all day, reading as much as possible and posses a ruthless critical receptor that is willing to tear your own work apart. You have to get up every day and vow to do better. A real writer knows that perfection is miles away and they aren\u2019t there\u2026yet. A real writer doesn\u2019t hold on to their mistakes or reject good advice. A real writer revises and revises until they get it \u2018right.\u2019 Writers who succeed are often their own worst critic. Like a dancer, a truly excellent writer strives for perfection and is never satisfied with what they published last\u2026they are always moving forward with another plot, another outline, another story. In their hands, the pen never stops because that writing is what they exist to do. Don\u2019t self-publish or put your stuff on a blog. If you are determined to be a serious, published author one day then DON\u2019T, for the LOVE OF GOD, self publish. Once you self-publish a piece, that piece will no longer be eligible for republish with a serious book publisher. T Know what you are writing about. You have a story to tell. Know what it is. If you can\u2019t explain your story in two or three sentences then maybe you don\u2019t really know what you are writing about. Half the journey of writing a story is knowing what the f\u2014- you are actually trying to say. Don\u2019t go to college for a creative writing degree. This is a subjective piece of advice, but one that\u2019s worked for me. Everything you need to learn about writing can be done with your pen and a piece of paper. The \u2018how to\u2019 of writing comes from reading, writing and life itself. If you are writing and reading at least four hours a day, trust me, the words will come. You don\u2019t need pay thousands of dollars for a professor to tell you to write. Only you can make yourself write. The great thing about this craft is that anyone, no matter how poor, can write, provided they have access to books, paper, pens. In closing: embrace the suck that is writing. Find joy in this solitary path and welcome obscurity. If you are a dedicated reader and writer will take about ten years to become a competent writer, and many more years of reading and writing to become a great writer. Accept that this profession will take thousands upon thousands of words to develop before you are able to write beautifully and express what you are trying to say. Extra Pro Tip that Nobody will Tell you in College/Workshops: Say Something. If you work very hard to become a competent writer then you have one final hurdle: you must ask yourself\u2026.do you have anything worth saying? Great writers not only have their own, unique style and voice, they have something to say. Whether it\u2019s profound or simply observant, a great writer has the desire to share something that really, deeply moves them. Writing is not an exercise in the vacuity of self expression. Of all the art forms, writers are probably the most compelled of the creative types to be heard and understood. I say understand because while visual artists might want to be seen and felt, and musicians to emote and be heard, writers \u2014-good writers\u2014- are driven to emote, to be heard and to be understood. Writing is cerebral as it is emotive, expressive and spiritual. If you don\u2019t have anything to say \u2014\u2014if you aren\u2019t being moved to share something that deeply moves you or that you love or that enrages you to the fiber tips of your being\u2014\u2014 your writing will suffer as a result. Nobody wants to spend four hours reading something that\u2019s shallow, vain or trite. Readers work hard to become intimate with the writer\u2019s ideas, so make your writing worth their while. Be a writer with something to share. It doesn\u2019t have to be revelatory or genius, but it should be heart-felt and sincere. If you don\u2019t have anything to say, don\u2019t write. Writing, serious writing that seeks to find readers and get them to turn the page, is an art form. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I mostly agree with what Neil Gaiman had to say on the subject when I heard him speak at SUNY Purchase, so here\u2019s his advice: 1. Write! Duh. Seriously though, you can\u2019t actually write anything if you don\u2019t sit at your computer and start putting words down. Write often. Write whenever you can. Write even when you think it sucks. 2. Finish it (you learn more from finished projects than from abandoned ones) Gaiman says that you learn more from finished projects than abandoned ones. I\u2019m pretty guilty of this\u2014 I tend to start rewriting before I finish, but I also decide which projects I want to invest in (no matter how long it takes or how many times I have to start over) and I make those my priorities. You\u2019ll always start projects that you\u2019ll end up abandoning, but you can\u2019t get anywhere if you abandon every single project. 3. Read everything. This is so important. Of course, you need examples of your craft, and if you don\u2019t read, you won\u2019t have any source material. Source material is extremely important. It\u2019s a lot harder than you think to just come up with completely unique, original ideas. You have to take ideas from everywhere else and compile them in an original way. 4. Read non-fiction. Non-fiction will teach you about people. It will help you ground your ideas in a way that feels authentic to the reader. Grounding is very important, even for the most fantastical of worlds. Especially for the most fantastical of worlds. Learn about human cultures and behavior, so you can replicate it in a fantasy setting. 5. Steal ideas from places no one is looking. Remember what I said about taking ideas from everywhere else? Anyone can write another tired Tolkien clone, but what interesting premises can you take from outside your genre? From your life? From this random manuscript written during the Inquisition that compared humans to mites on cheese (yes, really. This was Gaiman\u2019s example. He said he thought it was a great premise). The best ideas are ones that you found in places no one would possibly expect. 6. Be persistent, don\u2019t be afraid of failure. Finally, writing is tough. It\u2019s painful. It takes a long time. Don\u2019t give up. Keep at it. Even if you feel like you lack motivation (and I always go through long episodes where I feel like I have no motivation to write and I swear I\u2019m going to DIE), you will undoubtably get it back eventually. Mark my words. Good luck! ",
