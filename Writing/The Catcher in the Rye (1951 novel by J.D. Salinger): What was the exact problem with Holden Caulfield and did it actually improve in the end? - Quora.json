            "answer_text": "The problem was that he valued innocence, but saw it undermined at every turn. Phoebe represents innocence, and so does Allie, and his death is representative of the progressive death of innocence in his culture. Holden's preferred occupation: being the \u201ccatcher in the rye\u201d illustrates his desire to save kids from falling off \u201csome crazy cliff\u201d which represents a fall from innocence. Although Holden is somewhat consoled when he takes Phoebe to ride the carousel, his \u201cproblem\u201d doesn't really get better in the end. He's in a rest home, and he seems to have completely given up hope. He seems less agitated, but I believe it's because he's resigned himself to despair. ",

Which I can say because he doesn't like to do things which he isn't enjoying, which he isn't loving .... That's all .... Well! As far as the improvement part is concerned ... Yes! He did improved or else realized would be a better word that some things in life are ought to be performed .... I loved the way he used to think about all the small ordinary happenings in his surrounding and maybe that's why he, with the reference of the small girl , could compute the right decision! ",
