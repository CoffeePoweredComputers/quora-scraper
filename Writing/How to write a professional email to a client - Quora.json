            "answer_text": "Say what you need to say in a professional way. Usually, a professional email starts with a polite greeting. Then, there's the body of the text.

(There are exceptions when, for example, you've worked with a client a long time and have a more relaxed way of communicating. Yet, you should always be careful not to be too casual.) Lastly, your conclusion might consist of a request for some action, a brief recap (if a longer email), a thank you and a salutation. An attractive, informative email signature would also add to your professional image. ",
