            "answer_text": "To make my work fun, I usually try these tricks: Switch between projects.I work on 3\u20134 projects at any time, ranging from SEO, digital marketing, or purely content work. So if I get tired working on a particular project, I switch to another one that suits my mood at that time. Take regular breaks.Same refreshing trick as above, but instead of continuing to work, I simply step away from work during breaks. Whether doing household chores, stepping out under the sun, or playing with my daughter, any activity away from my work refreshes me to tackle work with a renewed mindset, making things fun around me. Work where I\u2019m comfortable.I\u2019ve set up my workspace in such a manner where distractions are low and my comforts are galore. I need good music blasting on my speakers while I work. Cool room temperature is another requirement. And a pitcher of water nearby. As long as I\u2019m comfortable while I\u2019m working, I can take a fun and enthusiastic approach to my work. Set rewards for each milestone achieved.My standard goal is to write 500 words in an hour. If I achieve that, without any mistakes or rewrites after my proofreading, I reward myself with an hour of Netflix or a session of games with my family, or even order take-out if I feel like it. More complex achievements have better rewards like spa days, shopping sessions, taking day offs, and so on. Trick to being creative in satisfying yourself when achieving milestones. Simply working for money soon fizzles out. You get stuck in a rut, or feel burned out. Even suffer health issues. I had major health issues in the summer of 2017, and once I set up this reward system into my work, I feel more at peace, in more control of myself. Try these out to see if the above works for you. But keep in mind that your natural affinity and passion towards writing will matter in this a lot. If you enjoy your work, even writing the most mundane piece of content will be fun. But if you don\u2019t enjoy your work, nothing can help you. It\u2019s better to switch to a new career at that point. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Deeksha, Thank you for the A2A. I am happy that you asked me this question\u2026 :) in fact, I myself have realized the answer to it only recently. So, I can suggest the following things - Try to enjoy what you write about; I know this sounds cliched. But I will explain how I look at the matter. I joined Quora only 2 days back (on August 17th, 2020), but I have written about 25 answers until now, and they are all quite comprehensive. In fact, I don\u2019t write short answers usually, because my motto or goal is that, if someone reads my answer to a question, they should not need to read anyone else\u2019s ;)So, why do I put so much effort into writing such detailed answers when I am not getting paid for them? Well, I have a different perspective on things. Firstly, Quora is full of wonderful people who are trying to improve themselves every day by freelancing and writing better content. I LOVE putting my efforts to help them out. I can stay up at night, writing content for hours if I know it helps someone make more money and live a better life. So, start by finding joy in the fact that you or your content can be a reason for someone\u2019s life to be improved, perhaps even in the smallest manner possible.Secondly, define your results. For example, I have seen a lot of people writing poor quality answers and trying to promote a website or an affiliate link when it comes to freelancing and content writing. I have a different approach. I know that I am here to deliver the absolute best content that exists on freelance content writing - and that is what I will be doing. I enjoy writing, because I love creating content that is far more detailed and helpful than all else. Yes, sometimes Quora collapses my biggest answers (it collapsed an entire 2,500 word answer that I had written to explain how to start a blog although I had never included any commercial links). However, I know that my job on Quora is to be the best writer possible for freelancing and freelance content writing. So, consider setting some milestones for yourself, let your efforts define you as a person.Thirdly, know this - we are all competing against ourselves, whether we know it or not. We tend to judge ourselves all the time. If you write content everyday and you put your efforts, you know for a fact that you are doing the very best you can to be an AMAZING writer. With this realization, you will be able to sleep happily at night knowing that you put in your best efforts.Lastly, know this that we are all humans, and we are here to make each other\u2019s lives better through our knowledge. Businessmen make the world better through good products and services, soldiers make the world better through improved safety. And\u2026 people like you and me, make content and information simpler and easier to read and understand :)So, my main point here is that\u2026 it is about the mindset. Consider thinking about writing content in the ways I mentioned, and you WILL find happiness in writing content, just as I have. And if you need any help with content writing or freelancing, you can always drop me a message :)  If you like my answers, feel free to upvote and follow me; your support keeps me motivated to continue writing.
