            "answer_text": "Why are there no ways to describe color? Because the experience of a colour is a quale [1] , a term that basically means \u201csomething you can\u2019t describe because it\u2019s impossible to describe\u201d \u2026 which isn\u2019t particularly helpful, I guess. As an example, a normally sighted person can\u2019t describe what it\u2019s like to see the colour red to a colour-blind person lacking the ability to see red.So, in contrast, it is possible to describe the color red to someone who already knows what \u201cred\u201d is and what it looks like; for instance by naming examples of things that are red: a sunset, blood, (ripe) tomatoes, fire trucks\u2026So if the person receiving the description can\u2019t themselves see these examples, the description fails. Taste is another area with plenty of qualia; you can describe an item of food as being salty, sweet, bitter, but you can\u2019t describe the experience of tasting (something) salty. My way of looking at it is that qualia \u2014for the purposes of your question, colours\u2014 can\u2019t be described because they are the most basic building blocks we use to build descriptions for other things. That doesn\u2019t mean that all colors are impossible to describe. You can talk about a grey-ish orange-y red, for example. Cyan is often described as a green-ish blue (or possible a blue-ish green). Nor that it is impossible in any context to describe colors. As already mentioned above, you can describe a certain shade of red by using examples. In prose, an author can go on for pages remembering a particular sunset, just to describe the exact shade of red of a character\u2019s trousers, but that doesn\u2019t tell the reader what \u201credness\u201d is.And in the context of computers (let\u2019s say web design) the purest red is #FF0000, which is certainly a way of referring to a colour, but does it count as an actual description? A final point to think about is the age-old question: Is the red I see the same red as the red you see? Footnotes[1] Qualia - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "We can only describe using our senses. Our senses have specialised receivers which respond to stimulation. If you do not have a working receiver you cannot receive. There are colours outside our eye receivers which we can only perceive via an external aid. The perception comes after the receipt. The perception is interpreted by the brain. It is possible to receive colour as sound, or sound as vibrations, so to a certain extent those without the sight receiver can share the experience of colour but it is not the same.Can the blind 'hear' colors, shapes? Yes, show researchers. CuteCircuit's Sound Shirt Allows Deaf People To \"Feel\" Music Why do colours exist? Colours exist because of light. Without light there is no colour. So we can imagine light made of a flight of three different balls (soft, prickly and hard) - invisible and without substance in transit. When the balls hit an object some are absorbed and some are bounced back. If all the balls are absorbed (or no balls ever arrived ) we would not feel any balls. Colours are like the reflected or emitted balls we feel - how many soft, how many hard, how many prickly. All hard, all soft or all prickly are the primary colours. A mixture in equal amounts hard/soft, soft/prickly, prickly/hard are the secondary colours. All the other colours are mixtures of varying amounts. What Color Means to Blind People colour : the property possessed by an object of producing different sensations on the eye as a result of the way it reflects or emits light. ",
