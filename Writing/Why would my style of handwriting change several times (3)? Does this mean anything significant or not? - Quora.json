            "answer_text": "Why would my style of handwriting change several times (3)? Does this mean anything significant or not? Lots of things can influence your handwriting. Mental illness of several kinds - depression, anxiety, any neurological condition that causes one to shake, and many others. Arthritis - the grip on a writing instrument will change the way your handwriting looks. Age - Elderly people often have a hard time maintaining quality handwriting which can become crooked, wavy, not on a straight line, and so on. Your mood or another state of mind - If you\u2019re taking notes while on a phone call, your writing might be almost illegible. My handwriting has gone to hell in a handbasket during the past ten years. Some are due to age, I\u2019m sure, to arthritis, to stress. I used to be proud of my script and take time to make it better, but all that stopped many years ago. As far as meaning anything significant, what I\u2019ve mentioned here might figure in; you might have an illness, Parkinson\u2019s for one, or another nervous condition. You\u2019d probably know if you have arthritis. Or maybe you\u2019ve just lost a desire to write legibly and with a tad of beauty to it. If you feel it\u2019s something serious, get yourself checked out and take old and new samples of your writing for the appointment. ",
