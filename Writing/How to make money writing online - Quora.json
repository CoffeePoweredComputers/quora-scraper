            "answer_text": "1. Freelancer Even if you still do not work on the Internet, you have probably heard of freelancers. They are professionals who act independently offering their services to other people or even companies autonomously. But how to make money writing as a freelancer? You can offer your texts to digital entrepreneurs who have a blog but do not have time to write on this communication channel. Another option is to write sales texts for those who sell an online product. Or you can even help an expert in some subject to write an ebook on the subject that dominates. There is always someone or some company that, sooner or later, needs a very well written text. And if you don't know how to start, there are online platforms such as Workana, Nubelo /Freelancer, Soyfreelancer and Fiverr that connect content producers with those who need this type of service. 2. Blog editor Content marketing has been increasingly exploited by entrepreneurs in various areas, both online and offline. This happens because this form of promotion allows customers to reach products naturally. That is, the company no longer needs to bomb people with advertisements that, most of the time, are considered even invasive. There are many ways to set up a content marketing strategy, and creating a blog with interesting texts for customers is one of the most common ways to start implementing this type of promotion in business. That is why, more and more, blog writers are more sought after. Be it autonomously, as we showed in the previous topic, or even as hired by a company, you can earn money writing a blog for other people. In addition, if you have specific knowledge and want to share it with third parties, you can also work by writing your own blog. And how to make money writing your own blog? You can, for example, allow the display of ads on your blog or even recommend products related to the topic you are dealing with and receive commissions for sales that have your content as a source. 3. Ebook editor Still thinking about the profession of copywriters, it is possible to earn money writing ebooks. The big problem for most people who think about writing books online is that they don't always have ideas for their content. If that is your case, what you can do is look for people who are experts in their areas of activity, but who do not have the ability to write, and can offer you to develop your theme in an ebook. Again, you can use freelancers platforms to find this type of work. Now, if you want to be the author of your own content, you can create an ebook that teaches techniques for writing better, for example. Thus, you can make your ebook available on a digital product platform and earn money with your knowledge. 4. Copywriter The copywriter is one of the professions of the future that attracts the attention of those who write well and want to make money from it. Basically, the copywriter is the person who creates texts to generate sales, as in the case of advertisements, landing pages, product promotion videos and much more. But, more than writing, this professional also needs to know how to persuade with his texts. In the end, copying is a type of text that aims to convince a person to make a purchase. 5. Social network-manager Many people believe that to be a social media manager you only need to know those communication channels. Of course, this is essential, in the end, how can you manage a network you don't know? But, in addition to knowledge about social media, the good manager must also know how to write well. Why? For the simple reason that you not only have to dedicate yourself to publishing content on those networks, but it is the one that uses words to captivate and attract the attention of people who interact through those communication channels. The intention of having a manager is to keep the social networks of a business always up to date and, as you must have noticed, most of the media use words and images to communicate with their audience. Therefore, if you know how to use words to convince and charm people, take the opportunity to offer this type of service to companies and entrepreneurs with various social networks and that you know they need help in that task. 6. Author of books So far, all the professions we show for those who want to know how to make money writing involve the use of the Internet but remember that it is possible to work with that skill even outside the online environment. Have you thought about writing a book? We talk about ebooks, which are also books, but commercialized digitally. We are talking about books that do not necessarily imply technical content, such as novels, adventures, poetry, and others. Writing a book involves several processes that range from planning to publishing and selling your material. This may seem like a distant dream to most people, but if you're already a good copywriter, why not take this opportunity? And if you still don't know how to start, don't worry. We have a post here on the blog that teaches how to write and publish a book, don't miss it! 7. Screenwriter YouTube is a communication channel widely used not only by entrepreneurs but also by producers of diverse content. It has been increasingly exploited due to the ease of communicating something to an audience through videos. With that, an opportunity arises to make money writing: the role of the screenwriter. In general, when we talk about the script, we think only of movies, like those in Hollywood. However, remember that even a short video, to be of quality, needs a script. Of course, you can be a screenwriter of great films or independent films made by yourself. But if you still do not want to start, an opportunity is to write scripts for YouTube videos , for example. It offers this type of service to people you know who have ideas of themes for videos, but who do not record for not knowing how to talk about a certain issue in front of the cameras. Thus, you make money by developing the ideas of these people in a script and, perhaps, you can even be a partner or co-producer of these people's YouTube channel. In addition, many companies that have a YouTube channel need screenwriters. Therefore, this is a way to earn money that is not necessarily autonomous, since you can apply for vacancies in that function. ",
