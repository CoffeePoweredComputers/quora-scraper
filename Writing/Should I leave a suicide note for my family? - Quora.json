            "answer_text": "As someone who's often pondered the question myself and drafted my suicide note numerous times, I'd say yes. Personally, writing a suicide note has brought me a lot of closure. There's something very freeing about writing everything you've wanted to say to everyone for so long, and writing it under the premise that they'll only be reading it when you're gone. That way you can truly let it all out without worrying about judgment or negative repercussions. Adding to my note is what has really helped me get through the hard days. It's also caused me to look back on my life and reflect on things. I've been able to reminisce about better days and realize that things used to be good. Sometimes it's that realization that helps me to give life a chance for just one more day. At this point not so much, but for awhile there, it really did. Besides a suicide note bringing closure to you, it can also bring closure to your family to a small degree (they're still losing someone dear to them, so this is by no means a substitute for staying alive, but if you've tried everything and you're determined to do this, a note is one way to mitigate pain). By telling them how you were feeling, what was going on behind the scenes, all that you were struggling with, it helps them understand the decision better, so you don't leave them confused when they're already hurting so much. In my note, I also discussed specific events that brought me to the decision, so you might consider that as well if it applies. Please, don't leave them a note that's intended to make them feel guilty. They'll already feel plenty guilty, guaranteed. If the note is meant to do this, don't bother leaving one. If it's meant to explain things though, and to tell your family you love them and it's not their fault, I think they'd appreciate having something. I need you to know though, you don\u2019t have to do this. You do not have to do this. There are so many other ways to end the pain that don't end with you dead. Please, please check off all of the boxes before making such a permanent decision: Tell someone close to you. Get help.Read the To Write Love On Her Arms blog every day. This was critical when I first started seeking help. It's written by all sorts of people with similar issues, and it's always there to remind me I'm not alone and to give me the strength to keep going for just another minute. I think it'll do the same for you.Therapy (DBT, ACT, CBT, and many more options)Medication (SSRIs, mood stabilizers, the list goes on)Suicide hotlines/text linesInpatient treatmentI care about you, and it breaks my heart to think of you going through with this. I know you're in immense pain, and I know it all feels like it's too much, but you are not alone. I'm here, we are here, to hold the pain with you. I care about you and I want you to live to see another day. Please do all you can to get help. I know it's scary, but it'll make a huge difference and perhaps even save your life. If you ever want to talk, I'm here. Stay safe and don't give up just yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not, ok? If you want to tell your family something, you tell them face to face because if you are honest with them, about everything, more than likely suicide will not be an option for you, ok? Listen, I lost my best friend to suicide in 1995 and it still hurts more than anyone will ever know. You have no idea what kind of pain your family will go through if you end your life. I know that doesn\u2019t sound very supportive to you and I apologize if I sound harsh but it\u2019s the truth. You are here for a reason. You matter just as much as anyone else in this world. I know it sounds cliche but we are all struggling and hurting in some way, believe that. And one of the best things in life is to get through the tough times with people who love and care about you, whether you believe they do or not. That\u2019s why I say to you, do not leave a note for your family. Tell them how you\u2019re feeling yourself. Let them know that you are feeling so horrible that suicide has crossed your mind. Give them a chance to love and support you instead of bury you, ok? I wish I knew what the reasons are for your choice to do such a thing to yourself. I know that when I contemplated the thought of doing the same thing, it was uncontemplated when I thought of my mother and two young boys. When I looked past myself and imagined how it would affect them, I realized that no matter how bad life got, as long as I had them, I could survive anything. Tell your family, please. Suicide is not the answer you\u2019re looking for. You know how I know? Because you cared enough to go on social media and ask others if you should leave a note for your family. As long as you still care, you are still alive. Just remember to care about yourself, too, ok? You got this~ ",

To help ease the burden of those left behind. They will ask themselves \u201ccould I had done something more?\u201d Tbf they're going to ask themselves that regardless of if you leave a note or not but if there's a note that explains you tried so hard but are thankful for everything they have done, it will help them in time when they can accept that. Despite what other day, suicide is NOT selfish. When you get to a point you can't go on despite trying to get help, I strongly believe you should have that option rather than spending the rest of your life in misery ",

I've answered a lot of suicidal questions, because once I have attemted and I live with the thoughts every day of my live. Trust me, I have been through some very rough times and bring bipolar 1 amplifies a billion times. If it wasn't for people like Holly giving answers like she did, I would be gone. And for me to answer questions like yours, makes me think deeper into my head, soul and heart. What will I accomplish if I do? When you hear people like Holly and myself giving you an answer, we are talking with you not to you are trying to make you feel that you're feelings are wrong, we are giving yourself an opportunity to look at the entire situation. I am not able to get on here as much, but if anyone needs someone they can talk with at anytime, I would be more than happy to give my personal number out. I'm no doctor of any sort or therapist, I just know what it's like not having the right person or people to talk with. Good Luck..remember it's your choice and I personally hope that you will keep on living. Someone out there will need your guidance one day. ",
