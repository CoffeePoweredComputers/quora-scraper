The required length at Harvard: We ask that you limit your statement to two pages, double spaced, using a font size that is comfortable to read (not less than 11 point). The required length at UCAS: You can write up to 4,000 characters of text that show you\u2019d make a great student \u2013 so it might take a few redrafts until you\u2019re happy with it.

            "answer_text": "Most schools give applicants some idea of the limits on essays. For example, the Common Application, which is used by many schools in the US, gives these guidelines: The Common Application will be maintaining the word limit of 650 words for the \u201cpersonal statement\u201d essay for 2015. 650 words is the limit, not the goal. The application will not accept a response shorter than 250 words or greater than 650 words. It is not the length that matters nearly as much as what you have to say and the way you write it. One of the best essays I have ever read was short, but it was so because the writer demonstrated wit and exceptionally good writing skills: Parke Muth, consultant: Voices: Flash Essay Workshop   I generally encourage students to write something that will approach the upper limit of the word count. Essays are one of the few ways to humanize the process now that interviews are rare and numbers are what get looked at first. At highly selective schools the essay gives students a chance to say something that will help them stand out from many other strong students. ",
