            "answer_text": "I know he writes so fast it's hard to believe he's not made up, but last time I checked, Brandon Sanderson was real, not fictional. The best fictional author of all time is probably Dr. Watson, Sherlock Holmes's sidekick. Watson actually wrote all the Sherlock Holmes stories, at least if you believe that non-fictional weirdo Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. ",
