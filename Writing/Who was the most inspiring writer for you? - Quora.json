            "answer_text": "J.K.Rowling hands down. I have read works of many authors as I grew up. But the memories of Harry Potter haunt me and in a way have moulded me. I was an introvert as a child. I didn\u2019t know the right way to socialize with family or cousins. And I was always treated as the one cousin who is to be included in all the activities just because she is our cousin. The Prisoner Of Azkaban episode where Harry remembers his broomstick manual to keep his temper in check when dealing with Aunt Marge was something I applied to my life as well. Until I was even 17 years old I used to remember snippets from HP books as a part of keeping my sadness in check. This is just one incident. There have been many similar to this. Hermoine has given me the drive to do well in my tests and exams and take education very seriously. I used to sit for 8 hours at a stretch. That has shaped my study habits in a way. The sense of friendship made me strike deep, meaningful and ever lasting bonds with the few very best of friends I have in my life today. The woman has taught me that \u201clight can be found even in darkness, if only one remembers to turn on the light\u201d Thank you Joanne for this wonderful change in my life. Owe my sanity to you, woman. A potterhead through and through :) ",

            "answer_text": "This is going to be an odd choice, but the most inspiring writer for me that is published would be Gordon Korman. As a young Canadian, and someone who wrote from a very young age, I often identified similarly to him, and how he published his first book in grade 7. He was the figurehead that pushed me to writing more and more, get better and better. I also adopted a similar genre, with most of my books being comedy/adventure. ",
