            "answer_text": "You might construct a way in which you could use a phrase \"one in the same\" and it would be grammatical\u2014as long as in makes sense with the antecedent of same.  For instance: Tara threw two pieces of fish food in the bowl on the left and Roger put one in the same, but Nancy put three into the one on the right. However, I assume your question is actually \"which is the proper spelling of the common phrase?\" and it's \"one and the same\". The President and the Commander-in-Chief are one and the same. ",
