            "answer_text": "I think it depends what is said after, however as an ideal apology you would take full ownership and say \u201cI am sorry for x, I did it because of Y, and I promise now to do Z\u201d However it is easy to judge people, saying \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d might be a big leap for that person. I just think it depends on the person, the incident, the facts\u2026sometimes it is a ping pong effect in that two parties contribute to the outcome and incident I hope that helps. I would have been inclined to be righteous and say yes it is a very bad apology, however how can I know without all the facts Let me give you an example; recently I punched my ex boyfriend in the arm, he was my boyfriend at the time. I had to step back and look at it, I apologised and accepted how unacceptable it was, however as we were walking he shoved into me (he denied it). He annoys me generally and at that point when I hit him, I was annoyed about a few things. I have had to end my relationship with him. I might not kill him, but I get a temper around him I don't want to have - he annoys me! So I ended it, and whilst I understand people might say work on your anger issues etc. I accept certain types of people annoy me, and that\u2019s ok cos I want them to be them and me to be me. So walking away is the \u201ccompromise\u201d I don't want him to know the full extent of how much it annoys me things he says and does\u2026I just need my sanity back. Hence I walk away from people who have too many conflicting views from me But that's me! ",

            "answer_text": "Because this is what an apology is (per Merriam Webster) an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret the \u201cbut\u2026\u201d has no part here. If you didn\u2019t do something wrong, then what you are doing may be valuable, but it\u2019s not an apology. For instance, if someone totally fails to follow your instructions and you say something like: I\u2019m sorry, but on p. 1 it says to floop the gizmo. You didn\u2019t do that. Then on p. 2 it says to squorkle the gadget. You couldn\u2019t have done that without flooping the gizmo. Then, after several more instructions, on p. 4 it says to check your work by examining the device for storkle and flapdoodle, but you didn\u2019t do that either. You can return the device and we will ship you a new kit\u201d. Then you are expressing regret that the person had difficulties and showing how to fix them, but you are not apologizing. Apologies follow one of a few patterns: I\u2019m sorry. I was wrong. How can I help fix it? is one I\u2019m sorry. That was rude. It was unintentional but it was my fault. or, here\u2019s one from George Wallace, apologizing for his segregationist actions and views: \"I was wrong. Those days are over, and they ought to be over.\u201d (Wallace was very wrong for a very long time, but, that is a good apology). ",
