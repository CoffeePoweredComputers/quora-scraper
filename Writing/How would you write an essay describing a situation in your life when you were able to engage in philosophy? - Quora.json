            "answer_text": "What\u2019s the situation? Sit down and jot down some of the details. How did philosophy come into play? Add those details to the notes. Was there a lesson in this? A message? A realization? Write down that as well. My approach would be to write the essay with an anecdote that is the situation, or part of the situation. If it\u2019s a long story, then break it up into a compelling part at the very beginning of the essay. Somewhere in the essay you will want to add the idea, the message, the realization, whatever you want to call it. Sprinkle throughout the story, details that bring the story to life. Your essay will consist of an idea (the message, the lesson), anecdote and sensory detail. The anecdote is essentially your proof. The details help ground the story, make the story more real. Don\u2019t go purple prose on it, just enough details so the reader can see, hear, maybe touch some of the story so they feel a part of it. ",
