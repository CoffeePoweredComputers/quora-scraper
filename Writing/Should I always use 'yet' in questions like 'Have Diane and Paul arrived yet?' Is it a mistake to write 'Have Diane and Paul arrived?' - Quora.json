But - there are nuances of difference: If Diane and Paul have not arrived yet and it has only been a short while since they were expected, someone might ask calmly \u2018Have Diane and Paul arrived?\u2019 Later, long after they should have arrived, one might ask in a more strident, disappointed or angry manner \u2018Have Diane and Paul arrived yet?,\u2019 with a lot of stress put on the word \u2018yet\u2019.

            "answer_text": "There's no need to always use 'yet' though many do. Yet can be an intensifier - but the sentences ' Have Diane and Paul arrived? and Have Diane and Paul arrived yet? - can mean one and the same thing. Placing the 'yet' on the end might be more a reflection of custom - unless the word 'yet' is said in a different tone - it doesn't change the meaning of the sentence. ",

The first version implies that the person who is asking the question is expecting Diane and Paul to arrive very soon or that they are already running late. The second form of the question is more neutral and has no overtones of anxiety, impatience, expectation or worry. ",
