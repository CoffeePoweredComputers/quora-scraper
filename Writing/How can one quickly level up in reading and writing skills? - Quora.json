            "answer_text": "One week is too short a time to make a drastic improvement in your reading and writing skills. However, it is also ample time to test your own motivation and perseverance in really setting out to attain your objective. I suggest the following: Allot a fixed amount of time daily and also identify the time slot in which you will focus on reading and writing.One newspaper, one magazine and one other reading material of your choice ( short stories / thrillers / mystery / travelogues etc.) must be part of the material you plan to read.Daily write down 5 achievements you attained during the previous day and 5 goals for the next day. ideally do not repeat the achievements / goals. You can also jot down your feelings on attaining your goals and reasons for not attaining it.See if you can extend your target by another week. Then make it a habit.Expand your reading and writing by exploring new books/ new topics to write on.If you are passionate about something you can always start a blog on it. This is very easy to do but spend time on figuring out what you want to write on, what your style will be etc. You are welcome to visit my Inspirational and Motivational blog Actspot's Blog to get an idea of what I am trying to say.Best Wishes ",

            "answer_text": "You can take speaking practice even a step further. What you can do is to make an agreement with some of your best friends to speak and IM only in English, although you could communicate in your native language much more easily. It may be weird at the beginning, but who likes normal and easy anyway. You can add some grammar books, mobile or web applications and language courses on top of that. But if you aren\u2019t reading, writing and speaking in English on a daily basis, all other effort is more or less a big waste of your time. You should try to write, read and speak in English as much as possible every day and on top of that have some fun with mobile applications that help you with your grammar, idioms, pronunciations, phrases etc. You should develop the following mindset: Every sentence you write, every text you read, and every word that comes from your mouth in your native language (with all due respect toward it) is a lost opportunity to improve your English. It\u2019s not that I have something against native language (like it may sound), but you probably already speak it quite well. Besides that, the world is becoming completely flat with English and Mandarin as the two dominating languages. The better you are at one of them or even at both, the more opportunities you will have in life. And don\u2019t forget: writing in a new language is pretty similar to fitness. It\u2019s hard and mentally exhausting at first. It\u2019s even harder if you aren\u2019t very talented for languages and you\u2019ve always been more of a numbers guy, for example. You just have to build up your own capacities to the point at which you think, write or speak in English as effortlessly as you do in your mother tongue. To do that, try to think about things in English before you think about them in your native tongue. It will get you thinking faster. And try to speak English in your mind as much as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "What you\u2019re asking for requires complete dedication and devotion. So be prepared for a run. First, I suggest you begin with newspapers and sitcoms, side-by-side. The daily editorials in the Hindu and in the Sunday Times are worth a read for anyone with a literary eye. There are loads of words, phrases and styles to learn from. Sitcoms will help you learn various slangs and accents popular in urban culture. Again, you can pick up phrases and styles. Listen to songs and I mean rap. Eminem is amazing. Try to sing along and feel the emotion in those lyrics. That is a very interesting style of writing and loads of metaphors to learn from. Add magazines as well along with reading news bits online. You can try Stumble Upon, its a great app that shows you various articles from the web based on the interests you select. Its worth a try. Remember, all this is to go hand in hand with your regular reading of books. Fiction is the obvious area although some non-fiction ones are also amazing. And also, try all sorts of genres. Paulo Coelho is a good read if you are looking for some crazy writing ideas and skills. Do this for sometime for a while and if you feel you are an avid reader now, get a Kindle. Hope this helps. ",
