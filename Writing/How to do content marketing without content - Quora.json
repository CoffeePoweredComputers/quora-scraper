Prioritize content marketing in your marketing program.Identify someone to own the activity, and suggest they hang out on Hubspot's website for a week. Growth Hackers and InBound are also excellent resources and communities for learning. Content marketing newbies can become pretty knowledgable inside a month. Identify your audience.Identify how to reach that audience (your channels and media options). There are many more channels than Twitter and FB. Create a topic map - basically identify their interests, and what you can add to their lives to educate and entertain them. Obviously, most of this outreach will be somewhat relevant to your product or service. Dig through your company to find the content you have already created, or that can be repackaged as content. You probably won't recognize it as first but, as Derek Phillips and Justin Belmont emphasize, content is already everywhere in your company. You just have to package it the right way, and then distribute it with great enthusiasm.  Finally, a couple of words about the definition of content. It's not just writing and it's not just blogging and white papers.

            "answer_text": "I agree that, for most businesses, content is no longer optional. It's a must-have. What large brands are starting to do well today is to try to own a topic. The content on your site doesn't have to be about you or your product; instead, it should be about the things your audience loves to do. For example, if you make surfboards, don't write about your surfboards. Instead, write about the 10 best places for surfing (or, better still, get your readers to tell their stories). Marti has some good suggestions above. However, I'd caution that if you look to purchase content, make sure that the content is unique to your site. Recent changes in Google algorithms will \"punish\" sites that are republishing content found elsewhere, so make sure it's unique and original to you. Then, employ social media to tweet out or share links to those stories on Facebook. Those links drive more clicks and can also help boost your position in the SERP. Video and photos can be great as well, but be sure to accompany them with text to make them search-engine friendly. And, definitely focus on the inbound links. If your content isn't compelling enough to get other sites to link to you, it probably means it's not compelling to read, either. ",
