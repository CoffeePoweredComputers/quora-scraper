            "answer_text": "No. Never take anything in a tabloid at face value. I wrote a book about my experience with the tabloids. In 2014, I was dragged into a $10,000,000 lawsuit between two men. It was a breach of contract lawsuit that claimed that the defendant had poached the Plaintiff\u2019s keyboard player and had stolen the Plaintiff\u2019s idea to start Long Island\u2019s first P!NK Cover Band. The split happened when the defendant had been investigated for elder fraud by Chase Bank. I was named as an accomplice in the lawsuit (not the elder fraud, just the whole \u201cstealing his idea part\u201d). I spoke to a journalist at The New York Post for a couple of days. They extensively covered the relationship between the two men when interviewing me. They asked me about the elder fraud investigation and why the two men were fighting. It was an exhaustive interview process that lasted two days. Here is the headline they came up with: Singer sued for being too old and ugly for Pink cover band They had a perfectly good TRUE story they could have told, but went with this mostly made up story (that took actual text from the lawsuit and spun it). Some of the quotes from me in the article are made up from thin air! This story was told on the news, on the radio and at tabloids around the world. It wasn\u2019t true. Don\u2019t. Trust. Tabloids.

            "answer_text": "While I hate to generalize, the vast majority of tabloids since their inception have been about attracting readers by making use of scandal and sensationalism. And while it is true that some tabloids have also had a few good reporters, that\u2019s not what these publications are usually known for. So, if you are reading the tabloids, just be aware that although what you see might be entertaining, it might also be exaggerated, or sensationalized, or biased; and also be aware that the writers may have gotten the information by paying for it (a practice called \u201ccheckbook journalism,\u201d widely regarded by most mainstream publications as unethical).

Others aren\u2019t sensational at all, such as the Christian Science Monitor. And some are just a bunch of nonsense. ",
