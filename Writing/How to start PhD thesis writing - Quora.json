            "answer_text": "Thesis writing is arguably among the most undervalued phases of a Ph.D. Technically speaking, your thesis writing should have started since Day 1 of your Ph.D! This is because, every bit of your documented work contributes to your thesis. Let me explain this through my own experience last year, for my thesis. I gathered every bit of documentation I had ever made. These include (some obvious, others not):(i) All of my authored research papers(ii) All of my previous annual Ph.D progress reports(iii) Each and every weekly/bi-weekly report I made for myself or my advisor(iv) Rough notebooks for daily work(v) Log books containing every experimental result (including failed ones)I found that a journal paper contributes to at least, one-half, or a full chapter of my thesis. Conference papers may form smaller parts. I segregated my papers, and they gave me most of the matter for my technical chapters (Chapter 3 onwards, barring the Conclusion).Though the above provides most of the material for a chapter, one important thing most people overlook, is connecting the dots. i.e. flow of the thesis. This you get from your weekly reports and daily work, so do maintain those!One thing not mentioned in point 1 is literature review compilation. Everyone requires it for Chapters 1 and 2. Ensure that your literature review is well maintained and up to date (research findings change regularly!).Once I had everything ready, I started writing. I devoted most of my time and energy to Chapters 1 and 2, since these set the tone for the thesis and that is what people may look at, first.It usually takes 2\u20134 months to get a first draft ready, post-which there would be multiple revisions, generally suggested by the advisor.Good Luck!
