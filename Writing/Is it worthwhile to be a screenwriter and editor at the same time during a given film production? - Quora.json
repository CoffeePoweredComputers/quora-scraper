            "answer_text": "You ask if it\u2019s worthwhile, but that is subjective. The question of whether it\u2019s even possible requires an understanding of the film production process. A screenwriter writes the script before the production begins. An editor edits the raw footage after it\u2019s been filmed. In this case, the editor wouldn\u2019t start work until the screenwriter is completely done with their work. This means a writer could successfully edit the movie without much conflict. However, in some cases, the screenwriter is present during production to provide on-set rewrites, adjusting the script to the day-to-day issues that crop up. At the same time, I\u2019ve worked on films where the editor began editing the footage as soon as it was in the can, in order to get a jump on post production. In this case, the production would be having both the writer and editor working concurrently on the movie, which would probably be impossible to pull off for the same person to do. Both of those jobs are full time or more, and require being in two different locations, so the individual would have to decide which is more important, or the whole production would suffer. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely it is worth, because you will get two payments, without running for a next job somewhere, screenwriting is before the production begins, you can concentrate all your attention in writing,to give best results, as also you will be editing, you can also have a better grip on screenwriting, once the shooting you are on the editing suit, much of job already written by yourself, you can sail through editing with flying colors, but first thing is are sure and have professional experience in screenwriting, and editing BOTH ? if yes, then two birds with a single stone ): ",
