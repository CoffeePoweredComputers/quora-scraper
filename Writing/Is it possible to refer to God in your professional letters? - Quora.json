            "answer_text": "That's depends upon how real you think he is. If he's just a \u201cfigment of your imagination\u201d then don't do it. But if God is as real to you as the paper the letter is printed on or your professional degree then he may be referred to. I don't know what your belief system is but we need to stop pretending that people who refuse to believe in God are correct when those who actually have a relationship with God know that they are incorrect. I've talked to super qualified doctors who believe in God and in miracles. Same for every profession out there. God is interested in every human endeavor, when we choose to involve him. So, by all means, in a tasteful way, feel free to talk about, in every situation possible, the most real and important being that exists: God. Don't be put off by modern sensibilities. The world has gotten very odd on the past few decades and, in some ways, is becoming unhinged. Maybe people need to be reminded from time to time that the God they refuse to accept or believe in is actually out there watching and intimately interested in our behavior. This was the way the entire world thought for thousands of years. Are we so advanced and intelligent now that we know all things? Hardly. Einstein believed in God (\u201cSpinoza's God\u201d) but, at least he left room for a supernatural being. Some of the most intelligent people who ever lived and who still live, believe in a Supreme Being Creator God. Currently, more than 50% of the philosophy professors on every University believe in God. Alvin Plantinga has done marvelous work on this subject from a philosophical viewpoint. I believe God is real and so do many others. Most of the people who SAY they don't believe in God actually do believe in God but hate the idea of God so much that the try to convince themselves that there is no such thing as God. There are numerous quotes from atheists saying EXACTLY this. The idea of a Supreme Being to whom one must someday give an account of his/her life to is very troubling to most people, me included. Why yield any ground to the bitter, unhappy people who loudly say otherwise? The real debate should not be \u201cis there a God\u201d but rather, \u201cwhat is he like and what does he expect of us?\u201d I'm happy to have that debate. ",

            "answer_text": "Possible? Naturally it is possible but I suppose you meant \u2018Should one refer to God \u2026?\u2019 In that case you should consider the old advice write for your readers. If you are writing to an atheist society and sign off with God Bless you might annoy them, but if you are writing to members of your church they might find it strange if you don\u2019t. In general I should avoid mentioning God in a professional letter else you will be disregarding those who have no belief. Though I must say, I have met believers who find it tiresome when someone continually mentions God in professional letters and emails. A professional letter should be neutral save specific cases, e.g. a letter from a lawyer about his client. ",
