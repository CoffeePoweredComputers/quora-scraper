Like most systems and the mess around it in this country, this was just another noble addition. The motive was to cut red-tapism and tout-mafia. Well, may be the intent of ones who introduced it was noble, but the ones supoosed to implement it are paid a share by the touts or local agents. You can always try to take a screenshot of the defunct website and if you have a twitter account, tag pmo and ministry of road and transport alongwith Shri Nitin Gadkari and post the same. Your problem would be addressed if all the media reports about prompt action by ministers because of twitter etc is to be believed. All the best and do share your experience. ",
