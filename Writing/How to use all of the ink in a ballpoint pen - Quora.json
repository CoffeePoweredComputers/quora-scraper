            "answer_text": "It's impossible to use all the ink, as some of it adheres to the walls of the ink cartridge, and won't dispense no matter what you do. Besides, ballpoints are ridiculously cheap. If a pen doesn't write after scribbling for a few seconds on scratch paper, just throw it away and find another. Anything you could possibly do to fix the pen would cost more in time and materials than the pen is worth. ",

            "answer_text": "Just keep writing with the same pen every day until it's gone. Ballpoint pens used to leak a lot, but they are a lot better now. Ballpoint pens still sometimes seem to be out of ink, but it might be a question of waiting for gravity to pull the ink down, or something. If your pen seems to be out of ink, you might be able to get it working by writing or drawing on scratch paper. Pens usually last several months at my house, but I'm not necessarily using the same one every day, and I don't use it all day, either. Some pens are refillable, and you can buy cartridges of ink to go inside if you really like that pen. ",
