            "answer_text": "I am not sure whether I got this question properly. If it is about the usage of the appropriate tense while wrting an article (a piece of writing), then you can use many different tenses depending upon the type of article. If you are wrting an article on the event/action/person of past then you can use Simple Past Tense, if you are writing about something in general which involves regular actions or/and states, then you can use Simple Present Tense. And depending upon the requirement you can use mixture of the different tenses. Have a look at the following short & interesting article made in Simple Past Tense and Simple Present Tense.  ",
