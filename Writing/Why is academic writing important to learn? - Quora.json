            "answer_text": "This is sort of like asking what is the importance of pure science. Usually the answer is that, pure science is carried out in the better interest of discovery. Applied science on the other hand, uses structured methods in the interest of furthering scientific aims, which are then held to be of a broad benefit to society. Academic writing is the applied written science and is done under form and discipline. Creative writing may be and quite often is free of form. Both types of writing may be in an accepted substantive style however, academic writing requires a delphi consensus of other expert writers of topic in order to be validated. You only need to like the voice of a creative work in order to validate it. I guess what I'm saying is, academic writing is important to each academy which demands its \u201ccollective\u201d voice be clearly and precisely structured and intrepreted. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure there are many aspects of academic writing that are important, but I would argue that the real value is in the effort that was put into the text. You can be sure that a genuinely academic work is the fruit of someone\u2019s hard work. I know many texts that were the result of many, many years of in depth research and study. If someone is willing to put that kind of effort into a text, you can be sure that much valuable will come out of learning from it. To approach the question from a different angle, academic writing is important to learn to \u201cdo\u201d, because it forces the writer to truly understand his or her subject. In the academic world, one cannot get away with fluff. Truly academic work is peer reviewed and carefully analyzed, especially in cases where the work is a doctoral thesis. Learning to write academically will challenge your thought processes, your depth of knowledge and your ability to critique yourself. ",
