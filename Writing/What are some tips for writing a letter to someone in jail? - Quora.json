            "answer_text": "You know, at first I was just gonna say something along the lines of committing to writing someone who's inside a letter at all is such a good thing by itself that there really isn't any way to fuck that up, but after the briefest of considerations I decided that you can totally fuck that up. So here's a couple things I managed to think of for you to keep in mind while you're writing this. One letter written with even 50% effort can make such a positive impactSo this letter, this one little letter, it really can make a world of difference to someone. If you yourself have been incarcerated then you know, and if you've ever had a relationship or close friendship with someone who has been, then I'm sure you've at least heard of it. But the effect of a letter on most people when they're inside is something you can't just duplicate. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, it doesn't have to be a novel. When I was inside, I only received a handful of letters over a period of 4 years, and one of these letters was simply a piece of construction paper that one of my friends had stolen from a Hobby Lobby, covered with signatures and quick messages from some of the people at the skatepark I hung out at. Most of it was ignorant nonsense like \u201cDon't drop the soap\u201d, shit like that, but to this day that letter remains to be one of the best things I've ever received from another person and the effort that was put into it was next to nothing. Just understand that no matter how busy your day gets, this letter has the potential to give another human being a reason to make it through their rough patch, and it isn't difficult to accomplish. Maybe you're busy, maybe the post office is closed until Monday, but it shouldn't take forever to send it. The person waiting for this letter is already feeling like they're waiting an eternity. So just do it. Just because minimal effort is required however, don't use that as a crutch or consistent shortcut because you canRemember that whatever you've got in this letter, whatever you're writing to this person, this is what you're giving them of the outside world. They're in a place right now where it's basically cut off completely from the outside world. Sure you've got the news, but it isn't just events and happenings that are different on the inside. The fundamental aspects of how to be a person in general have already been flipped over and changed completely, and a really intense feeling of complete ignorance at how life really is comes from that change. So what you're giving this person is pretty much their taste of what life is really like. I remember about 8 or 9 months into my sentence, I genuinely couldn't recall what life was like before knowing how to spin string from my mattress or light a cigarette with a razorblade and a AA battery. So recognize that this letter is what they're getting of the the thing they miss most, and remember not to do it half assed. Write a fuckin Letter or don't write at all. I get it, things get bland, or rough, it happens. It's okay to send the occasional minimal letter, but don't make it a habit. Think of all those times your boss or superior was saying some shit to you that you simply 100% would never in a million years even begin to give a shit about, yet somehow found the will inside yourself to chat it up about whatever stupid thing it was. Writing a letter to a person you care about should be at least 3 times easier than that was. Remember where they are and what they're going throughFights happen between people who really care, that's the way things go, but try and keep something very important in mind. This person you're writing to is at an emotional disadvantage. Let me give you an example. Hypothetically, a guy gets busted, let's say dope and a gun, the feds pick it up, he's got a record, and signs his second plea putting him at 140 months. Let's also say this man ran with the eses like I did, meaning statistically he's not gonna get his good time. So 140 months flat out, a little over 12 years. This guy's got a kid or two with someone, maybe they're engaged, have family plans, a couple vehicles, whatever. Well this dude getting busted throws a wrench into things and so of course, after some months, there's gonna be tension. It's understandable. But if this man has kept a connection to the outside, then for him, whatever letters, phone calls, pictures, money, and/or visits that he gets can sometimes become the only thing or things keeping him sane. I was lucky and had nobody and nothing really, I did my time alone and didn't have to deal with shit like that. But if you send an angry letter out of frustration or annoyance, you blame your child's deteriorating grades on this guy, you hang up in the middle of a call and don't answer for a week, these things fuckin destroy people doing time. Trust me. This guy just spent a week and a half, maybe two even, sticking his fuckin head up at mail call, hoping to hear his name, finally does and as his reward gets to read about how much of a piece of shit his only connection to the outside thinks he is. This doesn't excuse him for anything, but keep that in mind, that it is a very different beast. Your words or lack thereof can hurt much more with them incarcerated. Don't make any promises unless you are 100% you'll keep them, even small sounding onesOne of the first things you're told, if it's your first time being locked up, is at the end of the day, all you've got is your word. This is something drilled into you and very very true. Following this rule allows you to place a very fragile trust in others by taking them at their word, and it's something not easily fixed once broken. With this being one of the many underlying themes, it becomes a part of who you and to this day nothing infuriates me more than a carelessly made promise or commitment. Even if it's putting money on the phone, when you'll send pictures or your next letter, don't make promises you can't keep. Just don't. Sometimes, shit happens sure. But let's say I'm in there, and you write me saying \u201cNext week Cameron, I'll send some pictures\u201d. Next week comes and I get a letter explaining how things got crazy and you couldn't get it done. Maybe the next two letters give me similar explanations. Okay so yes, you're doing me the favor by sending pictures, but I would have much rather you not even mentioned them in the first two letters, and then actually following through later down the line, than to hear it the first time and expect them for 2 weeks to no avail. It might not seem like a bug deal, but it becomes a big deal. And if you really genuinely give a shit about doing a good job writing to someone in prison, then you should care enough to make these small concessions for them. I promise they'll appreciate it ",

Theres nothing worse than receiving a letter & getting all excited and it's like 5 lines long.Don't prattle on about how great life is or all of the things you've been enjoying lately. The person is likely stuck in a cell 24 hours a day and doesn't need to be told about how much fun you had drinking on the weekend.Fill them in on as much as possible while keeping in mind they don't get to do anything funKeep any bad news out of it, especially if it affects them as they are ultimately powerless to do anything about any news that may upset themShow empathy for thier situation. Say you miss them.Any deposit of money, no matter how small, is going to be greatly appreciated. (Check with the prison for guidelines on sending in money.)Go into great detail about anything and everything. Tell jokes. Draw pictures. Draw up some find-a-words. Anything that serves as a distraction is awesome.Photos! Photos are a huge thing and always, always appreciated.Tell them you keep them in your thoughts and can't wait til they get out.",
