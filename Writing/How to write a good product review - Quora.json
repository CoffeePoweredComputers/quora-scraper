            "answer_text": "Regardless of good or bad, a product review must be able to give the reader something that is useful and usable. Usefulness and usableness override everything else. The tech details, the performance stats, you name it -- all are necessary and I think you know how to do them. But lots of product reviews are chockful of details without being actually useful or usable because they don't have the expected product user's expectations in mind. Other than that, a good, solid product review is bound to be a longish piece of writing. So you would have to intersperse lots of big, closeup images of the product in various angles and operating modes to get the point across. Annotations within the images really helps, but strangely not always seen in product reviews. On the score of writing, be sure to keep facts relatively together, expectations relatively together, and opinions relatively together (and neutral-sounding). Nothing else special to do. Your technical knowledge should guide you what's in and what's out for the piece. ",
