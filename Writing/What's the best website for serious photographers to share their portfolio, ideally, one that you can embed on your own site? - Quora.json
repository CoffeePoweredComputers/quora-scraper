            "answer_text": "Daniel is correct.  It is important to have your own independent website for obvious reasons, they are about creating and promoting your brand.  However it is also important to have a presence (especially for pro and commercial photographers seeking assignments) on portal sites that aggregate a lot of portfolios in one place.  The reason for this is because you need to be found by means other than someone typing your name into google.  Professional buyers and assignment editors primarily search for photographers by genre and/or location, a process that if undertaken in a google search would make your head explode...  In addition to the buyer needing to be able to search by specialty and location etc, (which these sites provide) without knowing your name, these portal sites (such as www.workbook.com or lebook.com or behance) act as curator/editor also, and this is very important for the buyer who needs to work at a certain highly professional, aesthetic and production level. As a consultant to the pro photo community, i have used and worked through almost of the companies mentioned here for individual website templates.  For most of my clients, the absolute best is www.aphotofolio.com.  It is affordable, reasonably customizable in terms of maintaining the photographers' brand and design equity, is optimized for the ipad and phone, the pictures are huge, the screen dynamic, and of course has very good customer service.  I also require for most of the photographers and agents i work with, a submenu driven architectural structure which they have.  Aphotofolio, btw (and this is no small thing) is one of the only interfaces that was created by someone (Rob Haggart aka aphotoeditor.com) who hires photographers. And, Samantha, you are incorrect.  Many many very high end and well-known photographers, (in fashion, celebrity and documentary and advertising) have templated websites, especially now that they are not so cookie-cutter.  What matters most is that they are easy to use for the buyer, and that they are easy for the photographer to update, without having to call a designer in every time they need to make a change. Also, even if they did all look alike (as livebooks sites do, and photoserve etc...) , is it the worst thing that the people who may potentially hire you to more instinctively know how to move around your site easily because they have done it before?

            "answer_text": "While not strictly a portfolio site, in my opinion, SmugMug is the best option around. http://www.smugmug.com/ The reasons: Clean UI - Your photos are truly the center of attention.Tiered features - If you are just starting out, or just want to share with family/friends you can get a lot for a small fee.  When you are ready to take advantage of more serious options (like completely white labeling it, custom domain, etc), you can upgrade to the Pro tiers.  Also, you can sell prints using their services if you want (or not).Fanatical support - They care and it shows.Doubles as cloud-backup - You can opt to upload full-res versions (and have them down-scale them accordingly\u2014I believe storage is not capped).  Should something tragic ever happen, you can access your full-res photos in bulk.  On this note, their back-end runs on Amazon's S3 storage.API - If you are also technically inclined, you can do advanced things (like embedding the photos in your own site).Great photographer community - You can get feedback on your work or get help with specific challenges.They've been around a while - They are a profitable business with a proven track record.  You are less likely to be forced to switch down the road as with some of the newcomers.I do have quite a few friends using behance.net these days, but it is a tad more designer-focused than photographer focused, in my opinion.
