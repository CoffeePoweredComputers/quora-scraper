            "answer_text": "Leaders are Born When we are born, everyone of us carries some genetic programming which we can not change. But throughout the life, you have the power of change in your hands. Though some people demonstrate leadership qualities from very childhood, but the rest of us have to learn it from our parents, teachers, bosses, and yes, peers. And yes, everyone has the same potential for leadership abilities.   You know the best part of being in the college? It mostly occurs in the age when you are most susceptible to change. You have the environment where you can learn the vice as well as the virtue. Excited enough?  Play some mild music, grab some coffee and read on... Once a man like you goes to his Zen Master (read, Guru) asking a question similar to this one. The guru took him to the living room - a decent with a plush wooden floor with a short table and two wooden stools. As both men sat, the Master picked up the elegant teapot from the table and pulled two cups out. Skip the paragraph if you have heard this story before. The man felt delighted, as this was a gesture that the Master was interested in imparting his wisdom. The master started pouring tea on the (now) disciple's cup. The evening light from the vast windows was making the deep color of the tea shine brighter - there were streaks of silver and golden. The cup was filled up to the brim. As the tea started falling down and spilling over the table from all the corners of the circular rim, the master stayed still. The man now grew worried - face tensed, eyes wider and eyebrows ruining his otherwise beautiful appearance. The tea trickled down the table and started dripping on the floor. The man said, \"Master, you must stop. The tea is spoiling your floor.\" Master stared into the eyes of the man, smiled, but still didn't move. Now there was a stream of tea, flowing down the teapot, passing by the top of the cup, going down the table. Man now spoke louder, \"Master. My cup is full. Please stop.\" The master's serene smile seemed to say something. He still didn't stop. The man finally took the teapot and put it down on the table. \"I didn't understand why you're pouring down on my overflowing cup.\" Master calmly replied, \"Son, this is why you must empty your cup.\"  College is the best time to empty your cup - let go of all the preconceptions about the world you've had in the early teenage years. Unlearn the leadership lessons you have learnt and begin from start. Do not think you already know something - it will only stop you from learning what is yet to come.  This also means, let go of all your beliefs about where you stand right now. They will stand in your way in form of ego or fear. To be a leader, you have to be a learner.  Leadership Lessons in College I'm not teaching you anything. All you need is already around you. I'm just making you see it.  Here is a quick tip:  Explore.  Join societies, groups, committees, clubs. Leadership is all about people - the more you understand them, the more you are capable to lead them. Many of such groups or clubs will give you chance to lead in a non-risky way. Leader is not president of the club. It is not organizer for a particular meetup. Many leaders don't even have a title. Think Gandhi, who went on a solo journey to revolt against the British in India, and soon thousands of the people joined him. He wasn't chairperson of \"Non-disobedience movement\" or organizer for some \"Satyagraha March Meetup\". Only fools chase the titles.  Just being a part of such a club will give you opportunities to manage a group of first year students who will arrange the stage. Soon you will have to deal with university administration along with your friends. When you are an active member, you will have to take tough decisions when there is no senior member around. This is how you learn leadership. You don't learn leadership by reading books, or watching videos or reading some answer or Quora.  Again, leadership is all about understanding people, and make them go the right direction if they are not.  Leadership is related to power. And power is related to responsibility. Assume you are part of an adventure club, and are going for a hike in a forest a hundred miles away from your city.    Speak Up. College will give you ample opportunities for public speaking. Whenever you are on the stage, remember one thing - every time you fumble, your experience score is increasing. Every time people clap, your experience score increases by two points. Every time they boo, it increases one time. If you can't have two points a day, at least you can have one point.   Public speaking is not only about speaking. It boosts your overall confidence. Your communication skills improve as those rabbits in your tummy stop jumping when you are meeting a new person or attending a new event. It makes you charismatic - perfect sign of a good leader.  Stop Saying Yes. Coming back to the Experience point system, every time you say yes when you could have said no, you lose five points. Saying Yes is easy. You say Yes to please people. Saying No is hard. But saying No doesn't kill you.  Saying No requires a good amount of confidence and a status of power. You friends are calling you for a drink while you have to prepare for a test next day. Just say no. They'll say that the score of this test won't matter anyways. Say no. They'll say you are a wussy. Say no, and finally they will accept that you are demonstrating the signs of a good leader who knows and respects his priorities. Read. Did I just say reading doesn't make leaders? Ahh! Only reading doesn't make leaders. You have to follow. Here're a few books you MUST read.  These aren't the only ones you should be reading. Just read something non-fictional everyday. Even reading 15-20 minutes feed your mind with one million words in a year. And you are definitely going to learn something out of it.  Keep Learning. Learning is a life long process. You never become a perfect leader. You will fail. You will stumble. You will have to climb the mountains. You will fall. You will climb again. Sometimes you will feel you have become perfect. Your mind will be deceiving you. And when you become a true leader, never force your followers to do something they should not be doing. Never become hollow-hearted or arrogant. Have compassion. Have high vision. Those you are below you will help you go up. They have the power to throw you down. Be good!  Now finish your cup and ask for more when you need it... ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, You are a Leader.\u201d While you are a student, your mind is subjected to new ideas each day, meeting new people, discussing thoughts, innovating processes etc. So this is the best time to focus on leadership skills as youth is what will bring change to the world. It is said that, As you sow, so shall you reap. So every seed of responsibility at college level will give rise to dense trees once you mature. These are the certain things that you must focus on to develop leadership qualities at college level: 1.Develop a sense of responsibility You ought to take charge of roles that require you to manage a task . This may include managing a college event, managing a group of 5\u201310 individuals under you, portraying leadership skills by being the Student President or Student Coordinator for various college activities. These small steps will help you tackle issues and emerge as a stronger leader. 2. Start Networking The ability to communicate well is the most important quality of a good leader. Start building connections with your seniors, college professors, administrators or even high level people off campus. This will help you to develop networking skills . Moreover these relationships will last even after your college days developing into highly valuable professional and personal contacts. 3. Sharpen your Problem Solving Skills While you are managing a set of people, you would often come across people management issues. In this way, you are trying to solve problems, that usually people do in their professional career. Also, your decision making ability will strengthen and you would be able to make better decisions professionally and personally. 4. Discover your Capability Unless and until you take a step forward and try to achieve something, it is almost impossible to reach your goal. Step out of your comfort zone. Go that extra mile and test yourself. This is the right time to discover how capable you are ! You might feel that a particular task could not be done, but once you try it out; it might turn out to be the best thing you have ever achieved. 5. Your Resume speaks volumes It is very important to have a diverse profile as an individual. The course you are pursuing in your undergrad is the same as other millions of folks must be pursuing. What is the one thing that makes you stand out? Go out and try new things. Do internships to build your professional sense. Take up a course to build on your soft skills. Learn new technology and make sure anything and everything you do , makes you smarter each day and adds on to your profile. These are the grooming days, if you work hard now and are proactive, you would soon emerge as a leader once you step out of college!!! All the best! Be different and Go for the kill:) ",
