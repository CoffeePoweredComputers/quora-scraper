            "answer_text": "Sometimes. Every case if different, right? It could be lack of confidence. It could be lack of inner personal values. It could be identity politics. As I wrote in If My $12,000 Watch Makes You Feel Bad, You Probably Need to Work on Yourself: From an early age, my mom imparted solid values on me. My self-worth has never come from the clothes, shoes and accessories I was wearing. I mean, sure! It feels good to look nice. (On a side note: some so-called \"experts\" are saying not to call your daughter beautiful. Here's why they're completely wrong.) But what feels even better is my achievements, awards, contributions, and ideas. You know -- the person I am on the inside? Read more > The post continues: Today's obsession with \"identity\" politics contributes to feelings of victimhood (rather than empowerment). Schools used to encourage children to think independently and fill their minds with facts and ideas. Now... we encourage them to think about themselves. Their \"specialness\" and \"uniqueness.\" Their \"identity.\" Maybe if I showed up at Exeter -- a prestigious boarding school whose student body includes senators' children and offspring of the Fortune 500 -- obsessed with my \"identity\" as a white, Christian farm girl from Iowa... a watch on the wrist of someone I may or may not know could have hurt my feelings. Instead, I showed up as a girl with Heart. With determination. Eager to be independent and chase bigger challenges than I'd had at home. Someone who cared more about inner characteristics than outer labels. I even made it a point not to wear \"cool\" or \"sexy\" clothes, because I wanted to be respected and loved for who I was, and not what I wore or looked like. I'll never stop feeling grateful that I grew up before identity politics and the participation trophy movement... because who knows if I would have developed my strength and confidence otherwise? It would be funny, if it weren't so sad, that the modern effort to \"teach\" self-esteem in schools has kind of resulted in worse self-esteem (but more narcissism) than ever. But you know what else will backfire big time? Shaming students who wear expensive clothes and/or making rules against it. This doesn't build up poor and middle-class students. It infantilizes them! It reinforces the very message it's trying to subvert. Humans are highly social learners. Rules like this teach low-income students that they SHOULD feel bad when they see expensive watches, instead of teaching them that expensive watches don't matter. It teaches them that the clothing of people they may or may not even know can and SHOULD hurt them and make them question their belonging. It teaches bad self-esteem and helplessness. Read more > Or maybe you\u2019re jealous in a social sense. As I wrote in Eva Glasrud's answer to What do you do if you're jealous of people having loud and fun conversations when you're just sitting there looking at them? Join them! If they\u2019re talking about something you\u2019re interested in and you want to listen or participate, what good reason is there not to? I say \u201cjoin them,\u201d when, in fact, it might feel more like \u201cbutting in.\u201d But here\u2019s the thing - as I described in You'd Get Invited to More Parties and Events if You Would Mingle, Instead of Cling: 6. Act (and, ideally, feel) like you belong. I already said that Alex has a lot going for her. But, apparently, confidence isn't one of them. When I told her she's a clinger, not a mingler, she replied: \"I feel weird butting into conversations.\" To which I replied: \"Yeah. The reason you feel weird is because you have a confidence problem. You don't think you're valuable. You don't think you're wanted. You think you are an intrusion with nothing interest to contribute. Of course you feel awkward.\" When I'd interrupted those two men at Fylwheel to ask about the typewriter, I knew they were in the middle of a conversation, and I was interrupting\u200b. But I never thought of myself as \"butting in.\" There are a lot of psychology studies on the importance of belonging. Feelings of belonging keep students from dropping out of school or quitting their jobs. Feelings of belonging build community and help us fit in and excel. Read more > One way to deal with feeling like you\u2019re \u201cbutting in\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d is through cognitive reframing. As I wrote in Cognitive Reframing Is One of The Most Powerful Psychology Hacks Ever Invented, And It Only Takes a Few Minutes: Cognitive reframing has long been used in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help patients with identify -- and then dispute -- negative thoughts and thought patterns. Originally developed to combat depression, it quickly caught on among psychologists, and soon spread to more general uses. Lachman et al. (1992) found that cognitive reframing improved poor memory. It has also been shown to reduce performance anxiety and help parents and children cope with disabilities. It reduces stress and anxiety... and even increases happiness and wellbeing.... \u200bFunctional MRI (fMRI) studies show that our brains process understanding, then belief, then disbelief. In that order. (Probably because disbelief requires the most cognitive effort.) Even if the belief only lasts a moment, it still helps alleviate hurt and anxiety. It still helps resolve some of the uncertainty you've been feeling. Moreover, our brains are somewhat rubbish at distinguishing fantasy from reality. When you imagine a possibility or tell yourself a story, part of your brain stores that fantasy... as a memory. Read more > You are (probably) just as welcome and wanted in this room as anyone else. That is a true fact. There is a CHANCE these people are old high school friends who only have a few minutes to catch up, or something. But probably, they\u2019re just as eager to have you join them as you are to join. But if you're still feeling paranoid, imagine some \"alternative facts\" - just for a moment. You don't even have to believe them. They don't have to be true. Just visualize a story or situation where you are the hero, the rock star, the motivational speaker, the billionaire -- or even the beauty. Imagine that people want to talk to you -- even if you don't believe it. \u200bBecause part of your brain will think it's real, and it will boost your confidence and lower your anxiety. But one thing you don\u2019t want to do\u2026 is sit there being jealous. If you\u2019ve got this look on your face:  you\u2019re going to scare everyone away and make them not want to talk to you.

            "answer_text": "I highly doubt it, because then it would make it harder to understand people like OJ Simpson, serial killers, the unabomber, and rapists. Essentially they have high self-esteems and since they are regular people but have a self-image that is out of proportion with reality, reality is going to challenge their self-image. Robert Greene once wrote that reality has it\u2019s own power and will always win in the end. If I think I\u2019m god\u2019s gift to women and I\u2019m constantly admired by adoring fans and the woman I\u2019m in love with is constantly showing attention to other man, then her behavior means I\u2019m not as great as I believe myself to be. This is extremely threatening and it leads to acting out and rage. Same goes with geniuses who\u2019ve demonstrated amazing levels of competence in academic disciplines. Ted Kaczinski was a genius and he knew it, but couldn\u2019t handle any kind of rejection or disrespect and came to despise the entire university system. He was jealous of all the inferior people who had higher status than him and didn\u2019t deserve it and because of the subjectivity of propriety he was able to justify in his own mind sending bombs in the mail to \u2018arrogant\u2019 professors.
