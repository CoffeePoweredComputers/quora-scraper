            "answer_text": "The best way to do it is to start with something from your own life. You don\u2019t have to make your story totally autobiographical, but think about what\u2019s given you the feels. Certainly you\u2019ve had some life events, and even the small ones can have a big emotional impact. Then there\u2019s a question of what\u2019s affected you. Are there songs, movies, books, poems that have really made you emotional? Try going back to them to get in that state of mind. While you\u2019re there, think about what it is in these things that makes them hit you so hard. All that said, it doesn\u2019t usually work very well to write stories with a single goal and outcome like this in mind. Writers who evoke emotion well do it by pulling it out of a really well-written story, not by working backwards from what they want their readers to feel. ",

            "answer_text": "I find the best way to do this for me, is when you write a story test it out on yourself. If as you read you build a strong emotion with the protagonist and at the end you cry, the most likely thing is that other people who read your story will feel the same way. However if (like me) your an emotional person who cries at everything, then you test it out on some of your friends see what they think, if they read the story and feel the same way. Also use lots of descriptive words that draw the readers in, make them almost feel a part of the story. The more the readers connect to a story, or to a character the more they are likely to feel for that character when something happens. ",
