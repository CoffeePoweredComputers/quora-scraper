            "answer_text": "Whether or not it's realistic depends on the choices you and your spouse make. You could both decide to remain married until death, no matter how miserable you become. People in societies that stigmatize divorce do exactly that. Even if they hate their spouse, they don't leave. If that sounds nice to you, go for it. Of course, if you don't want to promise to remain married until death, then don't. No one's forcing you. When my husband and I got married, we wrote our own vows, and we didn't include anything about the duration of our marriage. We are both aware that there are circumstances that could cause us to divorce. If he starts beating me, I'll divorce him. If I start spending all our money on hookers and blow, he'll divorce me. And so on and so forth. Honestly, I think it's sort of pathological to promise to stay with someone for the rest of your life, regardless of how they behave. Because I take promises seriously, I wasn't interested in making a promise I knew I might break. Instead, I promised to do the things that maximize the chances of a lifelong happy marriage: Listen to him, respect him, be kind to him, tell him the truth, stuff like that. I'd rather promise to study two hours a day than promise to get my degree. It amuses me when people insist that there's no point in getting married unless you promise to be together forever. Apparently they don't care about the thousand-odd rights and responsibilities of marriage and don't see why anyone else would care about them. And they're either the sort who would stay with someone who abused them and made them miserable \u2014 which is certainly their prerogative \u2014 or they're hypocrites. If they know that something could make them leave, they're just like me, except I'm honest about it. ",

I\u2019m trying to recall if I\u2019ve seen anyone actually use those vows\u2026can\u2019t recall. In the Jewish tradition, we make a fair number of wedding blessings, seven, to be exact. But we don\u2019t call them vows at all, we call them blessings or benedictions. You can see a nice translation of those at http://kerem.org, Seven Wedding Blessings. The legal part of the wedding is in the marriage contract, called the ketubah, and in its most ancient verbiage, it specifically describes what the groom must pay the bride if they divorce. No \u201ctill death\u201d stuff. And those laws never claimed no divorce. The Hebrew Bible does not claim there is no divorce. My tradition assumes \u201ctill death\u201d is a goal, not an oath. Jewish tradition considers the sin is to make an oath that you don\u2019t know you can keep, since it is considered a sin to break an oath. The contract is all about what things of value you bring to the marriage, and what you will pay if you break it. It is the original prenuptial agreement. You can see the text here: Text of Orthodox Ketubah. In the modern version, it is nearly identical, but adds \u201cthe Lieberman clause\u201d which allows for civil divorce if one person wants a divorce, and the other is making things difficult. You can see variations on the theme here: What is the difference between texts? The traditional words that are spoken by the actual groom (traditionally) and bride (in modern times, with some editing), are: \u201cBehold, by this ring you are consecrated to me as my wife according to the laws of Moses and Israel.\u201d For a variety of Jewish vows, check out this link, Choose your text Ketubah and click the link near the top/right of the page, where it says, \u201cView Text.\u201d From there you can choose the different texts, and see a bunch of different options. For the most modern, choose \u201cEnglish Only.\u201d  The problem is in the question: looking for a \u201csubstitute\u201d for something that is not required in the first place. Don\u2019t look for a substitute. Put in what you want to vow. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, I have to give a bit of a background. When I got married, I was so sick. I had influenza, and later got Mono, which was kind of a nightmare. Top it off with a control freak of a minister, a sociopathic brother in law that was running the show, and an abusive mother in law, I pretty much wanted to die rather than get married. There was no discussion of vows, no cute writing vows or anything like that. Instead, my wedding dress was inspected to see if it was modest enough. My veil was proclaimed too fancy and I had to wear a kerchief tied under my chin instead or I would offend my father in law to be. So, when we got married, there were no vows. No promises to the death or otherwise. The \u201cminister\u201d (and I use that term lightly), was so into putting on a show for the attendees, he spent two hours preaching a sermon that he translated himself in English and Russian. He claimed to have \u201cforgotten\u201d about vows. So, after wedding clean up was done, my brother in law took my new husband and I to the basement, sat us down and said, \u201cPromise each other.\u201d I said something generic like, \u201cUm, um, I will always love you.\u201d (I was sick and really had no idea what to say, so went with what I thought I should say.) My husband says, \u201cI will love you and care for you, unless you commit adultery. Then I will never forgive you.\u201d (I found out later that he included rape in this as well as other acts that he considered to be intimate, such as a hug or brief shoulder rub). So, do I think that \u201ctill death do you part.\u201d should be included in marriage vows? No. I don\u2019t. For the simple reason that I know people that have allowed themselves trapped in abusive marriages because they believe that because they made a promise in front of witnesses, they should fulfill them and until he kills her or the other way around, that is better than divorce. I personally do not believe that. I go back to my sham of a marriage and the \u201cpromises\u201d we made, where if I was not only 18, sick, weak and unable to hardly hold myself up straight, I would have turned and walked away from him right then. I was a strong person, but months of fasting, sickness and brain numbing manipulation had worn me down until I didn\u2019t know what to do or how to respond. Don\u2019t put yourself in the position of \u201cpromising\u201d something in the beginning that you may not be able to keep. And moral of the story, if you skip the vows, and your husband thinks that it is a good idea to tell you it is your fault if you get raped from the first night of your marriage, and he will never forgive you for it, turn and walk away then. As a substitute, I would say make vows something that you think that will make your marriage a healthy one and something that will reflect that. ",

            "answer_text": "While I suspect other religions use phrases with similar intent, I doubt they use those specific words. Given that Christians are not a majority of the world\u2019s population, it is certain that \u201cmost\u201d couples do not actually say those words. Many Christian wedding vows that are taken from various denomination\u2019s Books of Prayer use those words. Some people marry in churches / denominations that don\u2019t allow them to alter the words. Other people marry and decide those are the right words for them. Lots of people write their own vows. Some of those people include similar words; others don\u2019t. If you believe \u201cmost\u201d people say those words, you probably attend mostly Christian, mostly church weddings, and likely, those weddings involve people marrying for the first time. I suspect the odds shift as people get older, get away from church, and marry again. I have no interest in modifying traditional religious wording. If it works for you, follow it. We said, \u201chenceforth and forevermore.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It is a personal decision. In order for you to know if a promise that you are about to give is realistic, you need to know yourself good enough first. In our case, there was no question about it. I would not even bother marrying and spending a single dime if a bunch of \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d came up before the ceremony. I am either all in - or out. And my wife is exactly the same way in this. Civil marriage to us was not much more than a societal requirement you can enter and leave at will, just like a leasing agreement for a car. Actually, these days it is harder to get out of a car lease than out of civil marriage. It lacks true significance. That is why we got married by the Catholic church afterwards. Here, your vows are already established. No substitutes. Followed by: \u201cWhat God just has united shall not be separated by man\u201d That is valid until the death of one of the spouses. Is this for everybody? No, not really. Even the Church calls marriage a \u201cvocational sacrament\u201d. So the ones who are feeling inclined to be realistically able to follow through on such a promise - go ahead and marry until death do us part. I have never felt any particular hardship to keep my promise. It is basically just a loyalty thing, I would not call this love. But loyalty is so old fashioned. \u201cWhimsical\u201d is so much more fun, it seems. But it is also true that these days, too many folks find it a challenge to behave like a decent human being. ",

If you take out \u201ctill death do us part\u201d, it would reduce weddings to a very expensive and elaborate party just to say \u201cI do, for now\u201d. In that case, why not live together until something or someone breaks a couple up instead? Why get married? Why should there be a commitment? Vows need to be serious because the act of getting married is serious. You don't quit on your husband or wife when life gets rough. It\u2019s not a fling or a or a short term deal. You\u2019re a team, you work through the tough times. Bailing should only be an option when all else fails, when you tried all you could but couldn't turn it around. The work it takes to maintain a marriage cannot be half-assed. Marriage vows shouldn't be either. ",

            "answer_text": "The first time I got married, the part about death bugged me not because I had any doubts about the marriage lasting, but because the man I was marrying had already been diagnosed with lung cancer. We wrote our own vows, steering clear of everything about sickness and health, death and life, religion, and several other things we felt didn\u2019t reflect our values or our commitment to one another. If you don\u2019t like those words, or any other words, write them out. Just because there\u2019s an established ritual, doesn\u2019t mean you have to follow it. One of the things I said during that wedding was, \u201cI make no promises today, because all the promises have already been made.\u201d For help and inspiration blazing your own trail, search the web, and you will find wedding vows and ceremonies for atheists, for denominations which proscribe oaths, and many other variations. Mix and match the parts that suit you and your spouse-to-be, add poems, stories (including your own), or songs you like, and let your officiant know your preferences and plans. ",

            "answer_text": "What has changed that would make you think we ought to change it? You might talk about life expectancy changes, but life expectancy percentages were grossly skewed by infant mortality. Those 35\u201340 year life expectancy numbers were at birth, after infanthood it increased significantly. So the idea that marriage was for a few years is wrong. In my opinion, it\u2019s realistic unless there is infidelity or abuse. So I don\u2019t propose a substitute. So if you\u2019re going into marriage expecting to cheat or abuse, or you expect to be cheated on or abused, my advice is don\u2019t go through with it. All you\u2019re accomplishing is a legal stranglehold on your property. ",

Life being what it is, nobody can predict what will happen in many years time, and I think it ridiculous to imagine you can enter into an unbreakable agreement at any time. The important point is that both parties intend the relationship to be open ended, indefinite, and that they will endeavour to make it so, But nonetheless, it is a wish, not a fact. And \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, \u201cuntil it can no longer be made to work\u201d and so on sound unbearably equivocal.
