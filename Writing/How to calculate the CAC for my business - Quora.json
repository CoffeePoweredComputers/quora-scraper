            "answer_text": "There are two approaches to calculating your Customer Acquisition Cost that I find most often. One is Simple and the other is Complete. I find that most business owners take the simple approach and use just the cost of the advertising campaign whether that's Adwords or TV Commercials (or whatever their campaign is) and dividing that by the number of customers they bring in. The complete approach is to add up all of your advertising campaign costs. These include the costs of your campaigns, internal labor, consultants, creative, and software. Campaigns include internet, TV, Outdoor, mobile, whatever the medium is that you're using to get in front of your target audience. Internal labor is your time, your marketing coordinator/manager's time and any marketing consultants you use. Creative involves the cost of any artwork or video that you may have had created for the campaing. Software accounts for things such as InfusionSoft or Salesforce fees that you may pay on a regular basis. Add up all of these costs to get a true sense of how much money it really takes to acquire your clients. From there, divide that by how many clients or customers actually bought. There is one note about how you treat repeat clients in this calculation. The more commodity-like your business is the less you should think of your clients as being guaranteed to repeat with little or no thought. Meaning that you may need to continue to advertise to people who have bought from you before to get them to buy again. If you're able to put a client under contract or you are very confident that they reasonably repeat buy without seeing your advertising, then I would not include them in the calculation. What period of time should you calculate your customer acquisition cost over? No shorter than your sales cycle. As with the statement above, if you're in a commodity-like business, then you're likely going to have a shorter sales cycle. More relationship based businesses or businesses that sell more complex items or services have a longer sales cycle.  So if your sales cycle is 4 months, then look at your customer acquisition cost over the preceding 4 months. There are several reasons you're going to want to track this metric. They include measuring the effectiveness one campaign against another, monitoring brand strength, and also as a complimentary metric to measuring market saturation.  Think about seasonality as well. If you're in retail, don't compare Q4 numbers to Q2 of the prior year. Always compare like periods of time. Ideally, as your brand becomes stronger, your customer acquisition cost goes down, and you'll also be able to spot diminishing returns when looking at putting additional dollars behind a campaign or into a particular market. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Calculating Customer Acquisition Cost, or CAC, is fairly straightforward. CAC is basically all of your marketing spend for a specified period of time (the period of time does not matter, but I would suggest 6 or 12 month intervals to make the calculation worthwhile), divided by the number of paying customers you have acquired in that same time frame. So, to clarify that's Marketing Spend/# New Paying Customers over a specific time period.Since I doubt you are solely operating on PPC, the cost of Google AdWords is going to be a piece of this equation but not the whole thing. Let\u2019s say, for example, you are running a candle shop. In six months, you spend $1,000 for Google PPC, $550 for a postcard mailing, $100 for an ad in the local newspaper, and $350 for a few email blasts to local community members. That\u2019s a $2,000 marketing spend. Now, take that number and divide it by the number of new, paying customers you acquired in the same six month timeframe. Let\u2019s say that number is 100 for simple math purposes. That is a $20 CAC. To determine if this is a good number, you need to figure out your average spend per customer. If it\u2019s $40, for example, you\u2019re doing well. If it\u2019s $10, you have some work cut out for you. Something else to consider here is the lifetime value of your standard customer. Let\u2019s say each customer spends $10 on average but shops with you once per month. That\u2019s $60 in a six month period, so your CAC is actually better than if they shop once in that same amount of time and spend $40. Another consideration when it comes to CAC is long-term marketing efforts. It\u2019s really all a guessing game. Sometimes, you hit your list with several marketing pieces over a specified time period, and it takes awhile for them to buy. There is no true way to determine what specific promo caused that person to buy at that specific time. Maybe they love your candles but did not have the money to spend until that time. Maybe their significant other had a birthday and they were buying something as a gift. You may never know.  Speaking of gifts, something else that happens a lot in retail are peaks and lulls. Black Friday sales and other holiday promotions, for example, spike new customer transactions while summer months are often slower. Many people have opinions on this topic, but I would say that all of this comes with the territory. In any given six-month period, there will be ups and downs. My suggestion would be to calculate your CAC once per year for consistency and see how it\u2019s improving. If it isn\u2019t, you need to ask yourself what is working and what isn\u2019t and adapt your marketing strategy from there. ",
