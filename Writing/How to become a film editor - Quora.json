            "answer_text": "When I left university in 1996, I initially didn't have much interest in being an editor. Primarily because linear editing on tape was an inelegant process. I had experienced offline editing whilst I was at university. During my second year at university, I found myself in the position of being the producer of the college TV company, which may sound fancy, but it was a fairly thankless role. Being producer inevitably involved having to assemble a film from the fairly rubbish footage filmed during a semester into highlights packages. Since there was nobody else to edit the blasted thing, I had to learn to do it. Linear editing was arduous and frustrating, and I will leave it to you to research why it was so flawed. Around the time I was leaving university I heard about Avid and non-linear editing. During lunch at a wedding , the brother of the bride, who was one of the then editors of Top Gear for the BBC, gave me a long and rather interesting discourse on the technicalities of non-linear editing. Whilst I wasn't terribly interested in the technicalities from an artistic point of view, I was made aware that creatively, these concepts made editing video far more like cutting film manually, but with far more freedom. It sounded to me like non-linear editing was like sequencing video, like Cubase was for Sequencing music - my brothers and I loved MIDI sequencing. I did loads of it at university and it was totally up my street. So I concluded that should I be able to find a way to become an editor, it might be rather a fun way of making money... After selling music equipment in Denmark Street in London, between August 1996 and August 1997, I tried to break into editing by being a runner for two high-end post houses. They were Blue and its sister company VTR, on Old Compton Street, and Dean Street respectively. I hated being a runner, especially at VTR. The staff editors were so full of themselves and rather rude. They were paid too much and had massive egos. The flightpath to being an editor that was sold to the runners was: make tea for a year or two, then be a tape-room operator for two years, then hopefully be an assistant editor for a couple more years, then eventually you might be good enough to try for being an actual broadcast editor. I only worked at both companies for a week or two. I met a lovely woman who worked on the Quantel Henry suite at VTR and told me loads of useful stuff. I met a nice chap who was a telecine operator at Blue and he was helpful too. I concluded that this proposed career path was a way of fobbing off people whom really didn't have the skills or dedication to do it. I then worked as an assistant sound man at Thames TV for the new Channel 5 for a few months. This was really fun, though it made me realise that I did not want to work in live telly. I was making a show called Five's Company, a day-time chat show. There was no artistry at all. It was like pantomime for bored housewives. Tons of lovely people though, often very skilled too. They were just working, like everyone else - paying the bills. So I went back to Denmark Street at tried to sell more Akai samplers and Roland synths, whilst talking about music all day with my music shop friends. I met a chap in the shop in about October 1997, who asked me / mumbled whether I knew anything about MIDI triggered visuals. I vaguely knew of a bit of software that did such a thing and pulled out a demo of it, that was unopened in a cabinet. The chap was kind of astonished that I knew of this software, as he actually knew the programers and wanted to find somebody to programme visuals with it. He said he had a Media 100 and an editor. I said I wanted to be an editor. he offered me a job - well he offered me a few weeks work. Well I was not an editor for a while really. However this aforementioned chap became a great friend and the editor he mentioned remains one of my closest friends. We ran a ramshackle production company for a few years. Along the way I learnt Media 100, Adobe After Effects and lots of stuff about bullshit and stress. About a year after I first started, I was asked by an agency, called Crimson (long dead) if I was ready to have a go at doing a freelance editing job. I said \"yes\" and it was terrifying. About the same time I got asked if I wanted to do a Sony music video for a trashy Europop girl band by a brave director. I said yes again, even though it was on Avid and I barely knew Avid Media Composer. So there I was, back at another of the sister companies of Blue and VTR, barely a year after I'd been a runner there, editing a music video, with the same sort of runners I'd been, serving me sushi and lattes. I recall feeling guilty at my audacity and wanted to hide my face from the former associates who might see me - a pretender. Again, I was probably frightful, but I think the shots were adequately well chosen. I was blagging, but I was learning. I reckon by late 1999, early 2000 I was a proper editor - just a fairly green and inexperienced one. Somewhere along the road you have put in your 10,000 hours - the amount that Malcolm Gladwell would identify as being the critical and approximate threshold of experience that signifies that you are a master at something. Or at least good enough at it that most people realise that you probably know more about it than they do, so they should not bother to question your judgement (they should though, no one is above criticism). I'd say, generally, that whatever approach you take to learning editing - be it, sport, TV news, drama, live events, corporate videos, multi-camera live music shows, music videos, short narrative films, porn, documentaries etc. They all make you better at editing. Often the easiest things to edit are the ones with the most money spent on them. Sometimes the things with the most money spent on them are a nightmare because the clients are nutters, or the production company / agency / employer are feeble 'yes men'. Learning to change things, even when you love them is crucial. Learning that you can make it just as well again, that it is not a fluke when it works, is also important. Anyway, one of the things that is least important, among a myriad of complex details, is knowing the difference between 24p and 29.97 drop-frame interlace before you start your journey. Thats nonsense. Worrying about the technicalities is a waste of time. You will learn that stuff if and when you need to. That is not to say that learning technical stuff is without merit. I actually love the geeky stuff, but it's not essential. My wife is great editor who is hugely in-demand and she doesn't really know much about the technical crap. Find jobs to do and in time jobs will find you. Eventually, hopefully, you will do a job where you say to yourself \"this isn't shit!\" ",

            "answer_text": "The technical side of editing, though time-consuming to learn, shouldn't be hard to figure out on your own. There are many tutorial sites and videos out there, both free and paid, that you can look into. Research the overall film process from scriptwriting to the final stages of post-production, as well as the software necessary to be an editor, such as Adobe Premier Pro and Avid Media Composer, as well as Pro Tools, if you want to get into sound work (Adobe Audition has become a decent parallel for audio work on the Adobe side of products). Make sure you understand the type of formats that video exists in when shooting, when editing and when finalizing/finishing post-production.  With a good base of technical knowledge, try to get your hands on some footage to edit together, just to practice. Sometimes you can get free footage from others that are holding editing contests and such, but your easiest bet is to shoot some simple footage yourself on your phone or something. It doesn't matter if it's low-quality, the point is to practice going through the motions of editing. Maybe shoot some basic exteriors of landscapes and/or cityscapes, and practice pulling it into a video editor, cutting pieces of clips into a timeline, adjust timing, trimming, color, etc. You can also rip some DVD's and practice cutting a trailer for a film. Export your timeline in a bunch of different formats with different settings, and watch what you're getting for video quality and file size so you know what might work best in different situations (i.e. an h.264 mp4 file with a high bitrate is great for quality, but potentially troublesome for streaming online).  When you get some technical experience under your belt, see if you can find some freelance editors in the area that wouldn't mind letting you sit in and watch their process for a day, or perhaps even work as an assistant editor. They're going to be your best bet for learning the creative side of editing. If you do good, you can either move up to being an assistant editor for higher-level editing professionals, or they may throw you some editing work that they either don't have time to do or is too low-paying for their own experience.   A few notes on software... Avoid Final Cut Pro X (first released in 2011), as it doesn't offer all the necessary features you need for professional work and the workflow is different from virtually all the other editing programs out there. The previous version, Final Cut Pro 7 (which came as part of Final Cut Studio 3, released in 2009) was a professional level program, but is becoming dated fast.  You'll need some software for converting your video files. Apple's Compressor used to be my workhorse, but just like Final Cut Pro 7, it's getting a bit dated.  I've been dabbling with Adobe Media Encoder for converting video (also called transcoding) and it seems a solid program, especially if you're already using Adobe Premier Pro.  Two free programs for transcoding that have served me well in the past include MPEG Streamclip (been a while since I used this, not sure if it's still being actively developed) and Handbrake. If you want take my suggestion above on ripping DVD's to practice editing trailers, Handbrake will let you do that (though it won't rip Blurays).  Sooner or later, you're going to need to work with images in some way, such as preparing logos to be used in credits, so get some pictured editing software. Photoshop is the go-to program of course, but there are others like the free GIMP that can do what you likely need for video. You don't need to make learning image software a priority, but don't wait until you actually need it to learn it, either. ",
