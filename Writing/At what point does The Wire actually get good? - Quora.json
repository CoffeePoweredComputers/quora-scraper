            "answer_text": "It took me about three episodes to really start getting into it. There\u2019s sooooo many moving pieces, different characters and names you need to remember and then all the vocabulary; street slang, dealer slang, cop slang, politician slang. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Give it time and soon enough you\u2019ll be using that slang with your family. I still think it\u2019s the greatest show of all time. I\u2019m watching it for the third time, but can\u2019t bring myself to watch the last season because I know it\u2019s gonna end again. PS. It\u2019s just as good the second time you watch the season, because you understand a whole lot more. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it was series 1, episode 10. It paid off a lot of the setup that had been building up over the prior episodes, and ended on an amazing cliffhanger. The following three episodes, especially the closing minutes of the last episode cemented the show as a classic in my mind. ",
