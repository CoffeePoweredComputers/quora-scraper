            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: This is not medical advice from Dr Weseley but, rather, a description of how one splinter hobbiest does his thing. You may try what I describe at your own risk. I assume no responsibility for the outcome. There are always risks when using sharp objects on the human body. Perhaps this is best left to professionals. Here I am assuming that we are using splinter in the common modern sense, a small sliver of wood sticking into the superficial skin. Historically, splinter also referred to large objects that might enter your abdomen and exit your back; I will not address that issue. Sometimes a splinter is still halfway out of the skin and they're easy to remove. Grab the end that's sticking out with a good pair of tweezers (good means the ends come together. If they can grab an eyebrow hair they can grab a splinter). More commonly, in my experience, not enough of the splinter is sticking up above the skin to grab onto. I will describe how I deal with these in a way that pretty much always works. You need some supplies. A good set of young eyes or some reading glasses, good light, a clean, small, very sharp instrument, antiseptic and good tweezers. For the sharp instrument I prefer either a new large bore hypodermic needle (preferably 18 guage or larger) or a new #11 Bard Parker blade. If you're not in the medical field you probably won't have access to these things but a safety razor blade or a very sharp paring knife or small pocket knife could work if they are sharp enough. If you're using something which isn't sterile, you can flame it over a gas stove to clean it. A sewing needle isn't sharp enough to do what I like to do. The last prerequisite is a steady hand. Procedure: Find the splinter. Typically it is passing obliquely into the deeper skin. With a good light you can see the most superficial part of the splinter. You can see the direction it's going and it fades from view as it goes deeper. Clean the skin over the splinter with soap and water and then alcohol betadine if you have it. Use your sharp instrument to make a slit, to \u201ccut down\u201d over the most superficial part of the splinter. Especially in the bottom of your foot, there is a thick layer of dead stuff covering the skin. The part of the splinter that you can see pretty clearly through the skin is jus covered by this dead stuff. If you cut in the direction of the splinter, stay over the splinter, and go slowly, this should cause little if any pain and no bleeding. Cut through the tiniest bit of dead skin with each stroke (and the whole slit should only be about one mm in length) and check after each stroke whether the splinter is still covered. Once you can see that there is no tissue covering the end of the splinter, lift the end of the splinter slightly with either the tip of your blade or one tine of the tweezers. Finally, grasp the exposed end of the splinter and slide it out opposite the direction it appears to have gone in. Was the area again with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment and keep clean for a couple of days until healed. If the area becomes red, swollen or painful, or if you develop a fever, there could be infection and you must seek medical attention immediately. This is a technique that's worked 100% of the time for me. I am not suggesting this as medical advice for anyone and you certainly should not do this if your eyesight isn't good, if your hands aren't steady or if you don't have the right equipment. ",

            "answer_text": "Field guide (a little painful): get a pointy head metal, needle or pin works fine, make sure the tip is sharp. take a lighter or box of matches and subject the sharp tip to the flame for about 10 seconds to kill any bacteria. Alternatively, if you have any strong alcoholic beverage (90 proof or harder) you can bathe the needle in that as well. Poke the sharp tip, almost at an horizontal angle, just under the skin, where the splinter is located and pull up the needle to tear the skin and expose the splinter. Repeat this until enough section of the splinter becomes visible and able to come out without breaking. Using the same needle, guide the splinter out of its lodged location. Wash the area with clean water. If you have alcohol, apply a little bit over the wound, if not, while the area is wet, try sprinkle a little bit of salt over it. It will sting a little but reduces the infection risk. Wrap with clean piece of fabric and go to the nearest medical facility to make sure you do not have infection. ",
