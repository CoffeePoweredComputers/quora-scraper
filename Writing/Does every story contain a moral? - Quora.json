            "answer_text": "This is not true at all. There is lots of fiction in which people do not get what they deserve. This goes as far back as the Book of Job. Horror movies get their power from inflicting harm on those that don't deserve it at all (or at least don't deserve a punishment as severe as death). Tragedies are again a genre in which bad things happen, often undeserved, more often far out of proportion to the mis-informed choices that led the sufferer to his fate. And real life accounts are also stories. These might or might not have a moral. A moral comes in presenting a morality and playing out the choices of characters in that morality. This might be a simplification of your culture's morality or it might be a fabricated one (as with horror movies: being a girl that has sex is a death sentence, for instance). But there is no requirement for the author to stick to the society's rules for what is right and what is wrong, nor to reward or punish choices of his character. I imagine that some say that the morality the story is built on is defined by what actions are punished and which are rewarded. This theory only works because stories are deliberate constructions and not the recounting of naturally occurring events. However, events in fiction are chosen by the author for a variety or reasons, such as spurring action or adding dramatic hurdles, and are not always meant to be a reward/punishment system. So I feel this argument breaks down. ",

            "answer_text": "Greek myths are amoral for our current standarts. Heroes are savage and cruel, many times criminals. Gods are like kids and make their will no matter what. Sometimes they are good, noble, sometimes... well not. The stories don't try to say it is ok, neither try to make the reader feel disgust. Do not reward or punish the same things we will want to reward or punish nowadays. Most stories seems to have moral because the structure of narration is:Equilibrium-disruption-recovery. Now, there are 3 types of process in a story, a material change, and knowledge change, a moral change.  Moral change is the way a story tell you things are the way they should be. Whne a story doesn't have a moral you end thinking... but why this all happens?   It is not so hard to find stories when justice is not waiting in the end. Even when this is also part of the famous Hollywood's \"happy ending\" format. It is hard to find a story we cannot cover with a moral meaning. We do look for it, we push for it. We can say world is cruel if the evil win, or justice is stronger if there is a happy end. Now, when we dont get that we feel nothing happened.  Think about Brad Pitt playing Achilles, think about the mythic Achilles. The movie and the original myth is the difference between an amoral story and what we are acostumed and look for as spectators. ",

            "answer_text": "it's certainly true there are works of fiction where immoral characters fail to be punished for their misdeeds, but these are often written with a deliberate awareness of the majority of fiction in which antagonists receive the fate they deserve. Your question does kind of imply you're primarily reading fiction with a clear and unambiguous moral message, which may be skewing your perceptions a bit. It's worth noting that fiction offers an opportunity to see justice done in a way it often isn't in real life, and is therefore most frequently satisfying to the casual reader on a deep, emotional level.  If you go back far enough, all fiction - when it took the form of story telling around village fires - consisted of morality tales, where the Gods punished or rewarded based on the willingness of mortals to enact their will. The roots of this form of storytelling still lie at the heart of modern fiction, whether the reader - and, sometimes, even the author - are aware of it. ",

It was pure nonsensical fun for fun's sake.Sure, you can try to apply any morals you want to it retroactively, as you can do for anything. But I'd say that even for stories where bad guys get their comeuppance, it's more about wish fulfilment of a fair universe than a moral about how it's better to be good. ",
