It has really [how it affected you.] Especially, it [more on how it affected you.] I also want to thank you for [Commendable Development 2]. It has really [how it affected you.] It [more on how it affected you.] I do think there is one area for where the school could be improved. [Describe the problem, and quickly lay out a few ways you think it might be addressed.] But the solution is more within your experience, training and expertise. I just thought I might bring the issue to your attention. Thank you for your time! Yours truly, [one of thousands of kids the headmaster has drifting by like leaves in the wind] The headmaster will appreciate the thanks. Why? Because they live under an appreciation deficit. They work much harder than anybody knows on problems that no student or parent will ever be aware of. They have to endure jumped-up, callow kids and entitled, demanding, angry parents. Any bit of thanks, even if ignorant, will be understood as generous and well-meaning, and will be appreciated. The headmaster will likely ignore the problem you point out. He or she is likely aware of it, plus a dozen more serious problems that you aren\u2019t aware of. Or he or she is not aware of it, but those other problems are still far more serious. Also, he rightly regards you as a fleeting voice, much like a bird chirping as it flies away. I attended a university that is approaching 300 years old (which is a lot, in the US.) When I was there, we students would get all agitated about some issue that would be forgotten in an eyeblink. We thought we made the school, when we were really its most temporary residents. There were squirrels who likely stayed there longer than we did. Now if we played some professional or educational role at that institution for the usual ten or twenty or forty years, then we might have a greater right to pipe up with our bright ideas. That is not to say that it was impossible that we actually raise some important issues along with the trivia that kids typically complain about. It is just to say that those problems are usually not easy to fix, and that other people might have greater investment in those problems than we do, hard as that may be to believe. ",
