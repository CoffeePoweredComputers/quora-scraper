            "answer_text": " One of the best things that writers can do is continue to read\u2014especially if it\u2019s in pursuit of bettering their writing skills. Every author I know has his or her go-to favorite books on writing that have inspired them or pushed them to hone their craft. For me, it was Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White. Strunk wrote the first version for an English course at Cornell University, which White took as a student. The student would then become the master as White, the author of Charlotte\u2019s Web, would later go on to edit two subsequent editions of Strunk\u2019s original manual. These days, Elements of Style has been surpassed in popularity by more modern writing manuals. Stephen King\u2019s On Writing, for example, has 3,000 positive reviews on Amazon, which speaks for itself. But for a craft as varied and personal as writing, it\u2019s beneficial to learn from multiple voices with varying techniques. To get you started, here are the five books any aspiring author should add to his or her reading list. About Writing: Seven Essays, Four Letters, & Five Interviews by Samuel R. Delany Samuel R. Delany is the best-selling author of Dhalgren and The Mad Man and Times Square Red, Times Square Blue. A master of the science fiction genre, Delany\u2019s best nonfiction book is a compilation of essays, letters, and interviews devoted to the craft of writing. His essays focus on what he calls \u201cthe mechanics of fiction,\u201d and address writing techniques like when to use flashbacks, how to create sympathetic characters, and the overall general structure of a novel. Delany is a writer\u2019s writer, making him a necessary addition to any passionate author\u2019s collection on craft. If You Want to Write by Brenda Ueland Carl Sandburg himself said that If You Want To Write is the best book ever written about writing. That\u2019s praise worth trusting. It was one of only two books Ueland wrote in her life (the other being her memoir), but it holds up. Ueland organizes her book into 12 points that writers should follow, ranging from advice on being reckless, to keeping a diary, to \u201cWhy Women Who Do Too Much Housework Should Neglect it For Their Writing.\u201d Central to these points is the idea that every writer \u201cis talented, original, and has something important to say.\u201d Ueland insists that writers must \u201ctry to discover [their] true, honest, un-theoretical self.\u201d Written with Ueland\u2019s characteristic humor, If You Want to Write is a fine example of this advice. Reading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them by Francine Prose Francine Prose takes readers on a long, thoughtful journey through samples from masters of the trade, arguing that this is the way writers learn. \u201cLong before there were creative-writing workshops and degrees,\u201d begins Prose. \u201cHow did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries.\u201d Prose guides readers through the tools and techniques of writers like Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, and Woolf. She borrows from some of today\u2019s best writers, tapping one of my personal favorites, John le Carr\u00e9, for a lesson in how to advance plot through dialogue. The result is a deeper understanding of a book lover\u2019s romance with words and stories through this skillful examination of the best of the best. Steering the Craft: A Twenty-First-Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story by Ursula K. Le Guin Over the course of her career, Ursula K. Le Guin published more than 60 books in just about every category possible. We lost Le Guin in early 2018, but she left a special legacy to writers in her short and concise guide. Le Guin addresses the most fundamental components of narrative, including the sound of language, sentence construction, and point of view. Each of the ten chapters is filled with examples and exercises that writers can do solo or in a group. You may no longer be able to take a workshop from Le Guin, but this book is the next best thing. The Writing Life: Writers on How They Think and Work by Marie Arana My last suggestion is not about craft or science. It\u2019s truly a book about writers for writers. Marie Arana, editor of The Washington Post\u2019s Book World, has gathered over 50 inspirational stories about writing from some of literature\u2019s greatest creators. In The Writing Life, authors share important stories and milestones of their professional careers: how they first discovered they could write, how they work, how they deal with the frustrations, challenges, and delights of a writer\u2019s life. It\u2019s a thorough examination of this special blend of art and science. But it doesn\u2019t shy away from the hard parts. Arana presents many writers' concerns about the creative process and the place of literature in 21st century America\u2014a necessary reality check for anyone on the road to becoming a writer. Whether you\u2019re looking for a solid foundation for your writing or hoping to find solace and encouragement in the stories of other writers, this list offers some guidance in your lifelong pursuit of the writerly life.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A, Ninad Deshpande :) Renowned author Stephen King said \u201cIf you don\u2019t find time to read, you wont find time (or tools) to write.\u201dJust read-a lot-frequently-books of various genres. This will give an idea on: *how each author has approached that particular genre* how they develop the plot* how they write in a manner than the reader finds interesting*Characterization of the protagonist in the novel and other important characters, and * exploration of various themes.*Writing style Also, you  will have a plethora of words at your grasp and all that one has to do is put them in a way to interest their reader(Easier said than done!)  That most people who love reading, delight in classics is undeniable. I think these classics can be read by writers, both aspiring and novice ones. Don Quixote-generally considered one of the first novels ever written and an inspiration for many writers, including Charles Dickens. Chales Dicken\u2019s Tom Sawyer, David Copperfield, great expectations and A tale of 2 cities:Dickens might have a few critics but he\u2019s one of the best authors of classic English literature.  His books do not fail to invoke tears, laughter and are deeply moving as well. A tale of 2 cities is a tragic love story of sacrifice. Tom Sawyer \u2013a deeply moving book about a poor little orphaned boy facing inexpressible cruelty \u2013is heartbreaking.Stephen King himself listed Charles Dickens as one of the authors an aspiring writer should read. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel defoe written around 3 centuries back is one of the first novels of English authors and an inspiration to a generation of authors who followed, Charles Dickens included. In fact one finds references to Robinson Crusoe in the works of various English authors like Dickens and Elliot. Incidentally Elliot is one of the best writers, and her works are a delight to read, especially the books: Middlemarch (A coming of age novel)and Mill on the Floss which are must reads in my opinion. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee- A Classic \u201ccoming of age\u201d book which deals with the issue of racism, honor, duty, standing up for what is right etc. One must read books of Russian authors, at least once in their lifetime. No one better than Leo Tolstoy, whose book, Anna Karenina, is a classic realism novel. Another book of this genre, with a bit of historic fiction that is one of the best books ever written is Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. The protagonist in the novel is Scarlet O\u2019Hara who may not appeal to everyone and sometimes her actions are distasteful to say the least. But she was just blooming into a young woman, is someone who loves fiercely, is brave to a fault, and an intrepid business woman. One can only speculate on the kind of woman she had it in her to become! Ivanhoe is perhaps one of the best historical fiction ever written with 2 of the most admirable women depicted in fiction-Rowena and Rebecca. The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas and Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson have to be read for their engrossing, fast-paced adventure that thrills the reader. A 1000 + page novel that is unputdownable, like the former, is worth reading after all. For fantasy one need look no further thanThe Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series. Charlotte Bronte\u2019s Jane Eyre is one of the most beautiful stories on love and romance. The heroine, Jane is perhaps one of the best female characters in fiction and a woman who is admirable in every way. Comic/humor genre is perhaps one of the most difficult genres, and an author who has kept his readers chuckling aloud throughout the novel for more than half a century is PG Wodehouse, particularly, the Jeeves-Wooster series. Agatha Christie\u2019s books for their thrills and detective genius. Murder on the orient expressand And then there were none to name a few. Sherlock Holmes is another series of the detective genre which is great and has engrossed generation of readers. Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula. One of the first books on Vampire that has chills and thrills. Victor Hugo\u2019s The Hunchback of Notre Dame.Will people mostly read fiction for pleasure, any knowledge or learning they get out of it, is always welcome. In that way, this book\u2019s description of architecture of Paris many centuries back and the significance of people of that era using monuments as symbols as expression because paper was not invented yet are insightful to say the least. Finally, Virginia Woolfe. Profoundly difficult as her work may be, one must read her books for their sheer uniqueness and exploration of various themes like time, perception, meaning of life, the journey of life, symbolism, to name a few. She is unmatched in this aspect! There are many other books I\u2019m sure that an aspiring, amateur or even a seasoned or professional consummate writer can read. Books that renowned authors like Stephen King and Ernest Hemingway themselves have suggested is a place to start. Here is the link: Books Stephen King Recommends (183 books) ",

            "answer_text": "There is a great list of books for writers here (along with their descriptions and links to purchase) but here are three that really shouldn\u2019t be missed: On Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft\u202fPaperback\u202f\u2013 Special Edition by\u202fStephen King  This half biography/half how-to-manual is one of my favorites. In On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, King discusses the basic tools of his trade, including how and why a writer should always have them on hand. He also has a lot of inspirational advice for writers dealing with rejection and trying to set positive and productive work habits in their daily writing practice. Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within\u202fPaperback\u202f by\u202fNatalie Goldberg  Natalie Goldberg is an American author and speaker known for discussing the process of writing as Zen practice. Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within is along these lines. Her approach is sometimes comical, sometimes practical\u2014but always insightful. Wired for Story: The Writer's Guide to Using Brain Science to Hook Readers from the Very First Sentence by\u202fLisa Cron  This one is different than a lot of the \"self-help\" books on the market available for writers. In Wired for Story, author Lisa Cron focuses on how writers tap into the evolutionary purpose of storytelling, and how the human brain is wired for hearing tales. She includes information on recent breakthroughs in neuroscience and discusses how authors can use this information to reach wider audiences. There\u2019s even information on how to trigger dopamine rushes in your writing\u2014it\u2019s really a fascinating approach. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": " I don\u2019t have the words to properly describe awesomeness of this book. I don\u2019t read much about writing. As a proper published author I think I\u2019m perfect and nobody will tell me how should I write. Or do my business. It\u2019s not their business to poke their noses into my business. I\u2019m so glad I decided to read \u201cYou Are a Writer\u201d I was drawn straight into it from the Why Listen To Me? section at the beginning of the book. Once Jeff stopped covering theoretic pitiful creatures (wannabe writers) and started talking about himself, the book suddenly become deadly serious and deep. Writers don\u2019t write for the money. I\u2019m past my own struggles with my writer\u2019s identity. I have nine books published and six more in various stages of completion. I\u2019ve been writing every day since 23rd of September 2013. I think I\u2019ll pass the 1 million words mark this year. But when Jeff took me to the beginnings of his career it was so raw and real I felt it in my bones. I thought: \u201cWow, I was in the same spot.\u201d I was back in my own skin at the end of 2012 when I put my words \u2018out there\u2019 for the first time. I was back there when my short story was criticized on the big Science Fiction forum; I was once again rejected by a huge site in the last possible moment, literally a few days before publishing the article I had worked on for months. I put the time in and showed up\u2014and I saw results. I was also back on the path which took me out of that miserable start. I kept writing and everything had passed away. I was again surprised that my writing was praised, that my book sold thousands of copies, and that my readers were reaching out to me and telling that I\u2019ve changed their lives for better. It all materialized because I was consistently writing. Exactly as Jeff said in his book. Without patrons, you won\u2019t reach your potential. I\u2019m even more grateful that I\u2019ve read this book as one of the first on my new Kindle device. I could highlight. It\u2019s hard to find a page of \u201cYou Are a Writer\u201d on my Kindle without at least a single highlight or a note. The \u2019empty\u2019 pages are compensated by those with multiple (2-4) highlights. Jeff said that you should write your content in a manner making your readers willing to share it. This crazy number of highlights is another proof that he practices what he preaches. A brand will happen whether you like it or not. If the first part was great and synchronized with my feelings, the second one was like the kick in my balls. I theoretically have known that an author needs a platform. My mentor hammered it into me a long time ago. But my platform is a mishmash of things I did or had been chasing. Jeff\u2019s meticulous arguments detailing why I need a platform was like a knife in my guts\u2014painfully obvious. His advice on how to build a platform was like twisting the knife in the wound\u2014conveying the point without a grain of doubt. I have some partly success in creating my online presence. I\u2019m also past the initial struggle of starving indies. My books are selling in hundreds of copies in the stale months and over thousand when I release a new title. I have over 500 subscribers (and in January 2014 I had 27). I cultivate relationships with bloggers, influencers and other authors. But I do it all in \u201cby the way\u201d manner. As a result my publishing is more of a job than a business. I have to constantly produce fresh content to stay afloat and when I don\u2019t, I sink. I work hard, not smart. Content is not king. Relationship is. And I found Jeff\u2019s marketing advice right on the spot. It\u2019s so far away from the common approach (sell, build funnels, draw them into your web) and so close to my heart. Be genuine. Connect. Serve. Reach out. Do favors. Follow up. Ask. Answer. That kind of marketing I can do in my sleep. No sleaziness, no hard selling, no lies. Because freelance writing is (\u2026) marketing. I found especially worthwhile the part about creating the relationships with editors. I was playing with the thought of doing that for at least several months, but I have never felt it was urgent or important. Just one more avenue to probe. \u201cYou Are a Writer\u201d convinced me that this is the right path and showed me how to do it in Jeff\u2019s non-sleazy way. I shouldn\u2019t have written this review. Without going back to his book this lesson had a chance to be forgotten. \u201cUnfortunately\u201d I refreshed this knowledge going through the notes once again. Time to design a course of action and follow it. You will see things start to happen. Hopefully so. I highly recommend \u201cYou Are a Writer\u201d to anyone overwhelmed by the thought of writing professionally. In the combo with \u201cWriter\u2019s Doubt\u201d those two books will make writing even a dead man. -------- Originally posted on ExpandBeyondYourself.com ",

            "answer_text": "Stick with what you know. Or what you imagine, for that matter. In your stories you can make anyone or anything your main character, you can make it do or go through whatever you like. So, if you assemble toasters for a living, make one your main ch\u00e4racter (It has been done, already, by the way). Or if you love creating a world from scratch, make it stand out from everyday life (wizards and witches have been done, already, as well). There are two ways to go about this. The \u2018J. K. Rowling way\u2019 (she planned the story to span 7 years, one year per book, and did so in meticulous detail. The story forned in her mind before she started writing, so she knew ahead of time what would happen when, except for a few details). Or you can let the story write itself, imagining on the fly what happens next. If you want to tell a true story, then research, in other words, getting your facts right, and getting permission to tell it, are important starting points. What are good book ideas, or not, depends on how you sell your story to the publisher that, hopefully, won\u2019t reject your idea of a great story. Speaking of publishers: They have teams of people going over tons of ideas for new books every week, so keep a pitch short, simple and enticing. Make sure you grab a reader\u2019s interest in the first few lines, so they want to know what happens next. In short, use your imagination, think your idea through, pitch it to friends, write, then pitch it to publishers, get rejected dozens of times, but ask why, so you can work what you learn into your next attempt (aforementioned Rowling was rejected a dozen times, and look what happened) and believein your story. Don\u2019t give up! ",

My personal favorites are Steinbeck, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dostoevsky, and Vonnegut, though there's certainly more examples than these few. As you're reading, why not consider why these authors had so much staying power?  What about their books or their writing do you enjoy? ",
