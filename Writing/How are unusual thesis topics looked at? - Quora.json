            "answer_text": "An MPhil or a PhD is, by definition, an original contribution to knowledge in its field. So either you are asking a question no one has asked before, or you\u2019re trying to produce a new answer to a question that people have already answered. There are three ways this can go. You can have a small increment on existing knowledge. This is \u201csafe\u201d in the sense that you won\u2019t be saying anything controversial, or disagreeing with things that have already been said. It is \u201crisky\u201d in the sense that readers and examiners may question whether you\u2019ve genuinely produced new knowledge.You can go way out there, and answer a question that is far removed from anything that has been studied before. This is \u201csafe\u201d in the sense that no one can say that your work isn\u2019t original. It is \u201crisky\u201d in the sense that there may be good reasons why no one thought this was worth doing. Maybe your topic contains assumptions that contradict existing knowledge (e.g. you\u2019re doing whatever is the equivalent in your field of proposing a perpetual motion machine).You can propose a topic that challenges accepted wisdom in your own field. This is \u201csafe\u201d in the sense that this is often how the best researchers carve a name and a career for themselves. This is \u201crisky\u201d in the sense that if you can\u2019t convince your examiners that the challenge is at least plausible, you appear to be wrong, rather than controversial.All of these are acceptable paths, with risks and benefits. If your topic is just \u201cquirky\u201d - well, that\u2019s how most PhDs appear to outsiders. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for this interesting question. I think unual thesis topics are rare nowadays. The vast majority of students choose topics that are easy to find information about. It is understandable. Personaly I am sure unusual topics are more enlightening, a person who cecks the work is engaged in reading. It is a way to express yourself, all your ideas. ",
