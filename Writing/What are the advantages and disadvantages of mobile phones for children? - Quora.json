            "answer_text": "even though i\u2019m very strongly against kids having cellphones I\u2019ll be kind and start of with the advantages. A cellphone is a very powerful tool and used properly can be valuable to your child and yourself. It allows them to be in touch with you and you to stay updated on their whereabouts. It also enables them with the proper programs to stay in the social loop with their friends who communicate that way with programs such as whattsap as well as keep track of schedules and have other organizational tools and valuable information at their fingertips. On the problem side, a phone irresponsibly used can have many detrimental effects on your child so if you\u2019re going to give them one make sure they understand your ground rules because there are many perils out there for a kid with a cellphone it gives them access to a private line of communication you may not know they\u2019re in touch withIt\u2019s a powerful tool that can hold lots of apps and games that can be time wasting at best and corrupting at worst.It can be used asocially or even antisocially as kids tune into their conversations/videos/music rather than interacting with each other.textual communication among kids often encourages poor communication practices rather than positive ones whether its the use of shorthand (example c y l8r 4 t - see you later for tea) or misunderstandings caused by lack of facial cues.social interactivity forums and chats are often places ripe for bullying among kids outside the parents eyesit can be used in class discretely for everything from messaging (while ignoring the teacher) to cheating on tests.Having help always available can be a crutch as it can stunt the child\u2019s development of self-reliance. When we were kids if we had a problem we solved it on our own. Today the default is to call for help.if access to the internet is available there are any number of dangers out there on the digital highway which can confront the child even if they\u2019re not looking for it. As an example, the 10 year old son of a friend of mine was once told by his grandparents that he should decide on a toy he might like for his birthday and the grandparent would pay for it and have it sent to him. So the kid went online and searched for \u201ctoys for boys.\u201d let\u2019s just say that the sites he found had a lot of inappropriate things with leather and were neither age appropriate or something he\u2019s likely to ever forget.screens are addictive in many ways and have even been found to hamper the ability to intake informationwe still don\u2019t fully know the effects of cellphone radiation",

            "answer_text": "Great question! My son got a very basic cell phone in 7th grade, due to the fact that he had to walk home and be home alone for the first time and I was a nervous mommy! He\u2019d always been in the same schools I taught in, but transferring to middle school was hard for us all! One of the biggest questions is always, When Should Your Child Get a Cellphone? By looking at the pros/cons/needs you can determine the right time! Pros Many cell phones allow access to the Internet, which can help a child obtain answers to questions very quickly and easily. This can help with studies as well as other simple daily questions like daily weather or finding directions to go someplace new.Some cell phones have tracking devices in which a parent or guardian can track where their child is to ensure that they are safe and where they are supposed to be at any moment.Cell phones allow parents and children to stay in touch. If a child needs to stay after school and needs a ride, they are able to call their parents and let them know by simply using their cell phone. This is especially important because pay phones are become more and more rare. Cell phones can be important in emergency situations as well when a parent needs to quickly get in touch with their child or vice versa.Cell phones can help teach children responsibility. Parents can set guidelines for their children such as staying within a certain minute or text message range. Children are also responsible for their individual cell phone and parents can set rules about misplacing it or breaking it.Cell phones can be a learning tool for children as they can learn a new form of technology as well as explore the Internet if the phone has the capability to do so.Parents can set guidelines for their children on when they are able to use their cell phones. This can help teach them discipline, time management, and also allow them to learn to enjoy their time without using their cell phone.Older children who can drive will be able to have a phone on hand in case they face any type of emergency situation on the road.Cons Cheating with cell phones has become a huge issue in many schools. Students can text answers under their desks during tests. Since many phones are now Internet compatible, children can sometimes even use a search engine on their phone to find answers to test questions. If the child is caught cheating they can face serious consequences from the school.Cell phones are not cheap. If a child goes over the limitations on a plan, the cost can increase rapidly. Prepaid phones can limit overall payments, but the cost per minute may end up being more expensive depending on amount of usage.Cell phones can be very distracting from more important events in a child\u2019s life such as studying, doing homework, or even crossing the street. Studies have shown that children are more likely to be hit by a car if they are talking or texting on a cell phone while crossing the street. Since cell phones can connect children to their friends and the Internet, they can take away from study or homework time.Older children who can drive may be tempted to call or text while driving which can severely increase their risk of a car accident.Sexting, sending sexual messages or pictures to another person\u2019s cell phone, is also an issue for parents to consider before purchasing a cell phone for their child. If a child does not have any blocked numbers on their device they can receive message which may include sexual explicit messages from anyone who has their number and chooses to send them the message or picture.Children can also receive calls from anyone who has their number unless there are specific blocks on their phone. Parents have no way of knowing who is saying what to their child.Hope this helps! ",
