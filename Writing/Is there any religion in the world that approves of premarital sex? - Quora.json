            "answer_text": "Up until the late 12th century \"fornication\" or simply living together and doing whatever wasn't considered much of a problem, regardless of marital status. That's why many british rulers were bastards. No offense, chaps. Just paraphrasing wikipedia. It took them up to 1753 to actually make a law about pre/extra-marital sex. Christianity is very much divided in the bedrooms. Nothing about sex is sure in that book of theirs they believe to be the word of god; from homosexuality to orgies anything can and are interpreted to be right, wrong, and fifty thousands shades of gray area. Believe you me, these debates take up a lot of of the time of the righteous dudes even today. Apparently who the girl next door sleeps with is a bigger issue than whether its moral to invade and bomb a severely weaker country. The dudes haven't yet made up their minds about what exactly 'moral sex' is, and how much it should be done, and when, and which direction they should face when they make sticky. I tell you, that's one really confused crowd. And I'm sure somebody will be here in a minute to 'smite me' for writing such blasphemous stuff. With the Jews, its technically not forbidden to have sex before you sign the contract, provided that you've given your word. I don't know about anybody else, but I must have been a super jew in college. Funny enough, the Torah says clearly enough that its okay as long as you're not stealing off someone else's woman. Martin Luther makes an interesting point of view. He's all about marrying virgins, but he says it's none the church's business, but the king's. Made my head spin, that one. The Anglicans used to tolerate young people in love. Now, well... If you stick it to an unmarried catholic girl they will smite you with the sixth amendment. Sorry, commandment. Funnily enough, this is the same church that told their clergymen to be celibate but they were allowed to run with fornication and concubinage, at the time of reformation. I don't get it properly - probably they were talking about lapdances.  Evangelists, baptists, methodists, calvinists - there are hordes of christian cofusionists who will say anything you can imagine about sex. So let's forget them now and move on to other people. Islam makes no confusion, about marriage outside sex, unlike christianity. You do dirty things with someone not in your own harem, you die. Even if you're pregnant. Unless there's no loose stones in a 100-mile radius. Its a bit more complicated with Hinduism. Sex isn't considered as bad or good not depending upon who did it, but how, where and when did they do it. For example, you're okay to go if the woman came to your house and begged you to ravish her then and there. Yay. Also threesomes are okay if your wife supplied the other girl. Yay yay.  It's really a more social problem with hindus than anything else. I mean, forget the book, how the hell are you two supposed get some alone time among so many people? There's always somebody watching! It doesn't stop even when you are married - then peeping is a custom! Buddhism disapproves of premarital sex, but then again they disapprove a lot of stuff  but never say \"or else!\", so you can chuck that book out the window. Those were more or less the mainstream religions that are all the rage now. There existed many other religions before, or still exist in the shadows of the world, that have a much open-minded and respectful view about your body. However we are very efficiently hunting them down, don't worry. ",

            "answer_text": "Pre-marital sex is not, strictly speaking, a sin in Judaism - it\u2019s just a thing you\u2019re strongly discouraged to do. Strictly speaking, pre-marital sex leading to pre-marital cohabitation isn\u2019t a sin in Hinduism either, specially for the warrior caste which are supposed to be operating in the passion mode - it\u2019s indeed a sin for the brahmins, not sure for the other castes. In fact, a while ago an Israeli newspaper got into hot water by publishing research by a rabbinical student in that single women wishing to have sex with their boyfriends would be OK should they just go out to the mikve and ritually immerge in the water to be ritually cleansed before going out and having sex with their buddies - and no, their synagogues theoretically couldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t deny them the use of the water pool in spite of their marital status. There was a lot backlash from a lot of right wing rabbis not as much related to the correctness of the deduction (most agreed it was within Halachic law) but as to the pertinence of making it public - an interviewed rabbi plainly stated \u201cthere are some things which are better not said in public\u201d and another said \u201cwe put fences surrounding our core commandments, making them stronger, so that if people cross the fences accidentally they might still be clear of actually sinning\u201d. Most rabbis also said giving thumbs-up to pre-marital sex could lead to immorality, curious when you read Solomon\u2019s \u201cSong of Songs\u201d and it\u2019s clear near the end that the 2 lovers are not married. Don\u2019t know at what point in history did Christianity became more papist than the Pope and decided (most of its sects) pre-marital sex is a sin. ",
