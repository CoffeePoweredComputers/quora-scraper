            "answer_text": "Obviously, not for a while at least. She is way too young and does not meet the age requirement. Down the road is a different thing. She has an aggressive personality (and I do not meant that in a negative way)and is outspoken and has made a pretty big splash for a freshman congresswoman. She is articulate and seems quite knowledgeable. She does, however, need some \u2018seasoning\u2019 , must gain experience. All this being said she certainly has the capacity as well as the potential to become president. A problem that she is going to face, indeed, is facing right now, is the fact that the Republicans (though they won\u2019t admit it) have already identified her as a potential problem, a potential adversary for the office of president, down the road and their mainstay procedure of dirty tricks is already being employed relative to her. They take the slightest thing, such as the video of her dancing, or her boyfriend gaining email access to her (and not being given a job by her) to make fun and ridicule her. They have already started to do to her what they did to Hillary Clinton (and it worked) by damaging her image so much that they keep her from being elected. There was a time a long time ago, when the Republican Party was an honest and decent political entity. In many cases the Democrats were, years ago, more reprehensible than were the Republicans. BUT, those times have changed, drastically which is why I left the Republican party many.many years ago. The downfall began with, probably, Richard Nixon and went into overdrive with Reagan and his lackey, Newt Gingrich when they courted the religious right. It now is the haven for most of the true bigots, racists as well as the height of hypocrisy the fundamentalist evangelicals. In my book they are the worst of the lot, all those FAKE CHRISTIANS who profess one thing but live and accept the complete opposite as represented by Trump and their adulation of him. The Republicans nowadays resort to any kind of heinous activity to retain power and influence. They depend on gerrymandering and voter suppression and engage in all the \u2018dirty tricks\u2019 they can think of to sway the voters. The Swift Boating video is a typical example. The reason I brought all this out is because their dirty tricks actions is so well developed and consistent that they are automatically attempting to degrade the image of AOC. This is, to me, one thing that could prevent her from becoming president, depending on the degree of success they meet in this endeavor. Otherwise I would say yes, her chance of becoming president sometime down the road is pretty darned good. ",

            "answer_text": "A decent chance. In 2019, AOC, a 29-year-old freshman representative, is the cat\u2019s meow to progressives. In 2024, the media cycle will have long moved on, so the jury will be out on whether she is still relevant. Tradition says probably. Bernie Sanders is still popular after 2016, Trump was still popular after 2012, and so AOC can still be popular after 2020 (though she\u2019s not running for president, she practically has the media coverage of a candidate). So, if she\u2019s still relevant, she\u2019ll be turning 35 shortly before Election Day 2024. And remember, that\u2019s the earliest possible time she could run. Maybe she\u2019ll stay in New York, run for Senate or Governor, maybe stay in the House and try to be Speaker or Majority/Minority Leader. She certainly has a lot of elections ahead of her, but I think it would be best for her to run sooner rather than later. Her whole appeal is her freshness and newness. In, say, 2052, she won\u2019t be new anymore. She\u2019ll be another politician in the crowd. As for her actual chances at securing her nomination and the election, I think it\u2019s definitely conceivable. Her nomination chances would be dependent mostly on college students, millennials, and non-millennial leftists. Certainly possible - Sanders won a lot of state through this process in 2016, and by 2024 these population sizes will have grown to more of the electorate. So, saying she secures her party\u2019s nomination, the general election is where things get more complicated. 2024 will see a new Republican nominee, but if Trump is re-elected in 2020 then America may be sick of Republican leadership by that point (since Truman followed FDR, there have only ever been three terms of the same party one other time - Reagan and Bush). So, in that case, tradition would be on AOC\u2019s side. But AOC is the kind of person that throws tradition to the wind. Would the Republican candidate pose as a moderate to counteract AOC\u2019s avowed democratic socialism? I\u2019m not sure how that would turn out. I think it\u2019s possible AOC could become president, but I\u2019m not sure what her future holds. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, just at the moment, she\u2019s not qualified for the office and can not run. She won\u2019t be old enough until the 2024 cycle; and even then she won\u2019t be powerful and experienced enough. That said, I don\u2019t really like her chances. Never mind her politics\u2014 she\u2019s too far left right now, but she\u2019s also barely out of diapers and this can change\u2014 but because of her positioning. For one thing, she\u2019s not a lawyer. That\u2019s not a complete proscription, but the most common route to the presidency is through a governor\u2019s mansion, and the most common route to the governor\u2019s mansion is through the State Attorney General\u2019s office. So, while not a bar, it is a handicap. Another problem is she\u2019s New York. NY is our third most populous state. That makes it easier to get elected to Congress\u2014 there are a lot of seats\u2014 but harder to move up in rank because NY only has two Senators and one governor, and there\u2019s a lot of competition for those slots. Moreover, she\u2019s a left-wing princess and a POC. This makes her a good fit for her district, but not as attractive as a state-wide candidate. Her biggest issue right now is having a district to run in for 2022. NY is almost certainly going to lose a seat in the House following this year\u2019s census. They might lose two of them. Her seat is going to be high on the list to vanish. She has been abrasive and annoying to her superiors both in the House\u2014 I cannot believe she thought it was a good idea to stage a sit-in in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office; Her Nancyship is not known to forgive such slights\u2014 and in her home state. The legislature will have a very hard time getting rid of another Republican; they\u2019ve already got them gerrymandered into about as few seats as can be legally managed. If you\u2019ll look at her district, you will see it is surrounded by a lot of long-term and powerful members of the House. But never say never in politics. She\u2019s hella smart, just woefully uneducated and has a severe reality deficit. She can outgrow those, if she survives the \u201922 election. She\u2019s been keeping a low profile lately, and this is wise of her. More to the point, she\u2019s a big electoral speaking draw and raises money a lot faster than most freshmen. If she can keep that up for 10 or 15 years, she can wangle a good committee chair, or a leadership slot. From there a cabinet position is not impossible, and she might parlay that into the governor\u2019s mansion. It is not impossible. But it is less likely. She is not well positioned. ",

            "answer_text": "ANSWERED 13 MARCH 2019 - UPDATED 26 MAY 2019\u2014 A very thoughtful answer was written by Dr. Judy Klass. She reminds us that among other things, ACO must wait until she\u2019s 35 years old to even become eligible. By my calculation, that would mean the 2024 election. Here\u2019s the problem. If a Democrat wins in 2020, that person would typically run for two terms. Now, given the fickleness of voters, it\u2019s not likely they would vote for another Democrat in 2028 (I recall a neighbor saying she was going to vote for Ike in 1952 just because she thought the country needed a change). I was in the 5th grade. I remember my mom quizzing our neighbor about her decision. \u201cAre you upset with the Democrats,\u201d she wanted to know. \u201cNo,\u201d said our neighbor. \u201cIt\u2019s just time for a change.\u201d Our neighbor admitted that she loved Harry Truman, and FDR before him. She thought that Adlai Stevenson would carry on their tradition, should he win in 1952. She didn\u2019t particularly like Ike, and really didn\u2019t like Republicans. Still, she told my mom that the country had had too much of the Democrats. My mom kept quizzing her, but she never really got a substantive answer. So, our neighbor voted for Ike. Year\u2019s later, in 2000, I heard the same comment from one of my neighbors. This neighbor was a Democrat and couldn\u2019t bring herself to vote for \u201cW.\u201d Still, she thought the country needed a change after the Clinton years, so she was voted for Ralph Nader, throwing the election into a tie. We all know how that turned out. I will never forgive my neighbor, or Ralph Nader for his arrogance. But back to AOC and her problem. It might be that she couldn\u2019t run until 2036. If my math is correct, she\u2019ll be 47 years old. Still young, and still vibrant. I can think of a lot of if\u2019s in front of AOC between now and 2036. Dr. Klass has mentioned many of them. I won\u2019t do a repeat here. I\u2019ll close by saying let\u2019s pray that today\u2019s House Dems will stop this President from destroying our Democratic/Republic so that AOC still has a Presidency she can run for. Since your asked, I believe the House Dems will stop him. Semper Fi, JE-PhD\u2014Political Science (Political Theory, Economics, History, Mathematics) \u201cOld Corps, New Corps, Same Corps\u201d ",

It\u2019s also impressive how she has virtually the entire right-wing chattering class obsessing about her, raging against her, foaming at the mouth over her, distorting her views, stalking her and so on \u2026 Still, I\u2019m a little troubled by her line in an interview suggesting that the main thing is to be morally right, instead of \u201cprecisely, factually and semantically correct.\u201d It\u2019s possible to over-emphasize that comment of hers. But I think that the greatest distinction between Democrats and Republicans these days is that Democrats believe in the fact-based universe, and in science, and in fact-checked journalism, and Democrats believe the intelligence that the people who work for our country risk their lives to gather, and believe in being rigorous and careful when presenting ideas and statistics and in making the case for a policy proposal. Republicans are more like Trump these days, which is a disaster and a tragedy for the nation; they have left the fact-based universe far behind. If honest journalists get something wrong, they admit it and print a retraction \u2014 and people in politics, and people on Quora (it happens to all of us at some point) should simply do the same. And obviously, there are tests of leadership ahead for AOC. Can she put together a piece of legislation that others will want to vote for? Can she build coalitions with people who think differently (other Democrats and perhaps even Republicans) and get things done? Can she advocate for the kinds of change she wants while remaining respectful of those who disagree? There are many kinds of situations that will come up for a stateswoman who is this early in her career, and since it will be years before she is eligible to run for President, she has time to show what she\u2019s made of in lots of ways.

            "answer_text": "Hey Clinton! I can answer that question\u2026 In the past year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has skyrocketed to political fame in America as a progressive firebrand who advocates on behalf of workers, the environment, people of colour, and for universal healthcare. With more than two dozen Democrats running for president, many of them unknown to the vast majority of the United States, the question has popped up -- why isn't she on the debate stage in Miami? Well, there are a couple reasons why the New York Democrat may not be throwing her hat into the overcrowded ring: She says she doesn't want it, literally just got into Congress, and her age happens to be an issue. The first two reasons aside, AOC's youth is the biggest obstacle to her taking on Donald Trump in 2020. That's because the US Constitution sets the minimum age requirement at 35-years-old. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, at the present moment, is only 29-years-old. It brings her the distinction of being the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress. But, she has to wait six years if she hopes to make a run for the Oval Office. Donald Trump's shocking victory in the 2016 presidential race caused liberals across the United States to question whether the country was indeed ready for a woman president. Since then, there has been much speculation about various female politicians and celebrities running for office, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Kamala Harris, Oprah, Michelle Obama, and others. There have even been rumours that Hillary Clinton might run again. I, however, don't see any of these women making it to the White House. I think the first female president of the US will AOC. It may take her another six years to get there, but the youngest woman elected to the US Congress will win the presidency. Here is how and why. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 election but lost key swing states and, under our complicated and arguably unfair Electoral College system, this meant losing the presidency. But the biggest political upset in recent US history cannot simply be blamed on the unfairness of the electoral system, under which countless Democrats managed to defeat opponents stronger, and more experienced, than Donald Trump. Clinton lost the election because she failed to convince working-class voters that she would be able to understand and address their growing grievances. While she started her journey as a young, educated, idealistic feminist believing in social justice and equality, over the course of her life in the political limelight, she (and her husband) madea fortune of over $50m, including $21m in speaking fees she was paid by Wall Street businesses and other interest groups. She gradually became an unrelatable poster-child of corporate America's greed. This, combined with the proliferation of fake news and misinformation provided by Trump's campaign were the proverbial \"nails in the coffin\" for her presidential bid. Unlike Clinton and most politicians for that matter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rejected donations from corporate political action committees, or PACs. She didn't take millions from Wall Street and then preach to blue-collar Americans that she understood their struggles. This helped her not to be perceived as a member of the Washington establishment like Clinton and her peers Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, for example. Moreover, Clinton just offered middle-of-the-road policies that simply promised more of the same. By contrast, Ocasio-Cortez, as an out and proud democratic socialist, advocated for federally guaranteed jobs and \"Medicare-For-All,\" called for tuition-free public colleges and the dismantling of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. With this, AOC made it clear that she offers a different kind of politics that is unadulterated by corporate and lobbyist connections. This is, in fact, what helped her defeat a 20-year incumbent and the fourth-ranking House Democrat, Joe Crowley, in the Democratic race for New York's 14th Congressional District. After she was sworn into Congress, she continued talking about progressive policies, calling for a return to John F Kennedy's 70 percent tax on the wealthiest Americans and supporting a \"Green New Deal\", a proposed economic programme addressing climate change and inequality. If Ocasio-Cortez continues down this path and successfully rejects cooptation by PACs, working-class Americans across party lines would undoubtedly be moved to vote for her. AOC is also a master of grassroots organising and, while her actions convey that she is in touch with the challenges ordinary Americans face, her greatest asset may be her ability to connect with them in a way that feels genuine and not contrived. Millennials, for example, find AOC more relatable than any other potential presidential candidate. With her 2.37 million Twitter followers and growing, she is a skilled social media user who knows how to connect and communicate with the younger generation and will certainly be able to secure their vote. And in the coming decade, it increasingly seems that it will be the millennials who will become the most important voting bloc within the US electorate. And finally, AOC was also able to capture the attention of the press and has already shown much skill in fending off public attacks. Even before she was sworn into office on January 3, conservatives had already launched a smear campaign against her, which is indicative of how much she scares them. With the election of Trump and AOC's rise to stardom, one thing has become undoubtedly clear: US voters are desperate for new politics and fresh faces who can offer real change. And with her charisma, presence and political acumen, Ocasio-Cortez is able to tap into these sentiments. To put it in Trump's words, Ocasio-Cortez is a \"winner\", she is \"winning\". Her popularity in the press parallels Trump's during his presidential bid in 2016 when he proved true the clich\u00e9 \"any press is good press\". Yes, it was thanks to the media's obsession with him, both on the right and the left, that he remained a constant figure in the public eye, which ultimately paved the way for the unimaginable to happen - his win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The same is already proving true for AOC. She is the Democrat that Republicans (and even some Democrats) love to hate, and she will be all the better for it. ",

I\u2019m one of the view Democrats who dislikes AOC very much, I think she often talks down to her base and says whatever her dumb supporters want to hear. She also puts feelings above facts in many situations and that gives the whole party a bad name. If she was ever the Democratic nominee, I along with many moderates would hold our noses and vote for the republican. ",

The younger, more progressive demographics will have a larger proportion of the vote. AOC will have more experience. She'll be better at campaigning, at rhetoric. She'll be smarter, wiser. The impetus for change, greater. Barring some unforeseen meteoric change in circumstances, it would really not surprise me if she becomes president in the future. ",

The younger generation, unhappy with the conservative status quo, is beginning to see the power of their votes. They are liberal, and they want to push the Democratic Party into being a liberal party again instead of its current conservative state. That said, in 20 to 30 years, AOC will gain more experience and more support. I definitely see a presidential run in her future, and quite possibly, a presidential win. ",
