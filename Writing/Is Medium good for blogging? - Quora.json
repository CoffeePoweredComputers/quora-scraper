            "answer_text": "I think Medium is just a tool, like any other tool. It has certainly increased my visibility with the articles I have written there. I\u2019ve seen new life on articles I wrote back in the early 2000\u2019s and I love the \u201ccurated\u201d option where Medium lists where the article first appeared. I\u2019ve seen new audience members come into my own business website. So, it does help to generate traffic. I do find it interesting that most people don\u2019t understand the appreciation system of \u201cclaps\u201d to essentially vote on a story. I try to give very generous amounts of claps on articles I really enjoy. I try to write something for Medium at least once a month, but I most likely will be writing more often. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Although, it\u2019s popularity levels are decreasing. I still think Medium is great if you\u2019re not willing to purchase your own domain. Medium is great if you get loads of claps, meaning you can probably make some money. It\u2019s nice to read other people\u2019s posts if you\u2019re willing to splurge five bucks a month. Although Medium has some features that users don\u2019t love, which is why I would recommend Bawler: http://bawler.seunite.com/ a new social network for written content and podcasts, that\u2019s completely free, unrestricted, and fresh.
