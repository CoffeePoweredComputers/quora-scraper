            "answer_text": "I love this question it is surprisingly layered and produced the usual crazy answers. I love the answers from Meganites claiming the evil newspaper is picking on the righteous woman/mother or whatever virtue signalling moniker they chose. Just completely discount the facts - Meghan launched this legal suite against all top legal advice on an issue no one cared about. It was advised that the five friends whom it turns out were referred to the magazine by Meghan\u2019s own PR hence the \u201cfriends\u201d tag would be made public. Then it was referred to mediation which Meghan turned down, fair play she wants her day in court with no regard to the five, which rich privileged people spending other peoples money are entitled to do. These five were always going to be dragged into the issue, there was no way that they couldn\u2019t, remember Meghan\u2019s lawsuit has had rulings against it and knocked back at every stage. Now she and her team are desperate. The Royal Household advised them not to do it, that the current mess would be how it would play out.  As with the trademark applications, the use of Royal (the subsequent tantrum against the Queen saying she doesn\u2019t own the use of Royal, yep 1883 international treaty), HRH freeloading, illegal Charity structure, illegal foundation structure. It appears that the management is completely woeful and lacking going from disaster to disaster. So many Oops, this is just a continuation of the trend. They have lost at every stage in this particular legal proceeding and the legal experts who are reviewing the case are saying that the legal team advising Meghan are either giving really terrible advice or not been listened too. To absolutely answer your question the labelling by Meghan\u2019s team of vicious to name the five \u201cfriends\u201d is just patently absurd. It was called out before the suit went to court that this would happen and that you couldn\u2019t control the outcome or even what the friends would say. After all there is a huge difference between doing an interview and giving the pre-set talking points and then being dragged into a pointless court case in Britain with someone who isn\u2019t really your friend. Then they have to put up with the hate from social media. Is it just the case, that the true reason behind the suit is the whole PR aspect and the ability to form a narrative, that this is more of a PR strategy? Strangely this was part of a proposed story line on Suits that Sunshine Sachs were advising on. The same agency that is making a fortune from Meghan in handling her never ending crises. It fulfills the US vs them narrative which has constantly been playing and is straight from the playbook of Sunshine Sachs, it\u2019s been on their blogs and talks. It is allowing for the truly absurd narrative that the couple are Billion Dollar Brand - i.e. in the court filed papers they claim that they generated more than a Billion dollars for the UK etc. That narrative had previously never gotten any traction despite being said in multiple interviews , but has now been widely reported with those headlines. It affects the search results and rankings of the couple. The whole fake it to make it. It is quite brilliant from a PR perspective as rather than laughing because it is part of a court document it is quoted and turned into a headline. Remember Kylie Jenner is still thought of as being a billionaire despite that being fraud. From a PR perspective she now absolutely needs to be seen to protect the five who can now turn on her - both legally and professionally. While they are clearly being used, it has gone to completely taking the piss (British slang). It seems to be forgotten that the article was a massive puff piece that was PR coordinated with Meghan\u2019s team giving the names of people to interview for the piece, heck two of them were Sunshine Sachs clients. This is why it was so coordinated with the same message from the five. Don\u2019t be stupid and ask yourself why it was an amazingly high number of people that had knowledge of the contents of the supposedly private letter and they were so close friends. Really the only surprise was it didn\u2019t include her waxer, makeup artist and cleaners, or maybe that\u2019s because they work for a living unlike freeloader Harry? Perhaps she really is a victim, a victim of greedy PR, Legal, Management who are milking them, sorry others money dry? If so, then please explain how a couple with only one child and claim to be against white privilege and climate change live in a house like this;  Oh sorry that was the previous house, it was too small so they moved to this one;  So a privileged woman living off a rich privileged white man and his family, launches a lawsuit throwing five colleagues under a bus for doing her a solid. Then calls people trying to publish their names vicious. What is vicious is once published then the five are able to make their own money through the paid interviews and books. Oops exactly what the Royal Household PR teams and legal teams warned will happen. This lawsuit has very little chance of success, really a narrow possible view of a letters ownership, a letter given to someone and to claim that that letter is not the property of the receiver. Which is quite crazy, well just quite crazy. ",

THE DUCHESS OF SUSSEX is accusing the tabloid of being vicious because they\u2019re being vicious in trying to reveal irrelevant information. The friends (assuming they even exist) did not HAVE the letter. They supposedly were informed of the contents by the Duchess but there is no actual proof that. Even if she read it to them, it\u2019s irrelevant as that has nothing to do with the lawsuit the Duchess has filed against the Mail on Sunday. The friends did not have possession of the letter. They did not sell the letter. Supposedly they merely said \u201cMeghan said she told her father\u2026 yadda yadda yadda\u201d. ",
