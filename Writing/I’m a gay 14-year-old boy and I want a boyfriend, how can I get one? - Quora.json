            "answer_text": "I agree 100% with the other answers, but I would ask, are you out? If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s going to make it a lot harder to meet guys. If you are, then join your local Gay-Straight Alliance if there is one at your school. If not, try P-FLAG or the Trevor Project like the other guy said. Call them and ask if there are any youth groups in your area. Also, if there is an LGBTQ Resource Center in your city, they will probably know of places for youth. They might even have their own youth group. I know it\u2019s hard, man. It can be really lonely when it seems like no one else is gay but you. I was 14 in 1980, and in the South. I had pretty much no where to go to meet guys, and there was no way in hell I was out. Just remember, at the very least, you can talk to other gay kids online. But remember, please, please, please remember \u2014 people LIE. DO NOT under any circumstances give anyone your full name, the city where you live, or any other information that could lead to you being identified or located. DO NOT under any circumstances agree to meet anyone anywhere. It could be a very smart liar or scammer. DO NOT under any circumstances share nudes with anyone. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough. Besides being illegal, it could be a ploy from a scammer. As an LGBT Youth Counselor, I have seen quite a few cases of sexual blackmail. It\u2019s the new trend, unfortunately. I had one young man named Zach who made an online friend named Ethan. He believed Ethan was 14, like he was. Ethan had been feeding him lies for weeks. One day, Ethan convinced Zach to send him nudes. Zach did, only to have Ethan come back later and reveal that he was actually a 40 year old man. The man told Zach that if he went to the police or his parents, that he would post Zach\u2019s nudes all over the Internet, where his parents and friends would see. He also told Zach to keep sending nudes or else he would post them all over the Internet, where his parents and friends would see. So for several months, Zach made videos of himself masturbating and doing various sexual things, and taking nude selfies of himself, and sending them to the scammer. This new scam, called \u201csextortion,\u201d is going around, and it\u2019s especially hitting gay kids who are more likely than straight kids to cooperate with the scammer because of fear of being outed to parents and friends, as well as being humiliated. So I am not kidding when I say, NO NUDES! PERIOD! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether gay or straight or anywhere in between, you don\u2019t just get to get a boy/girl friend. What I mean is it is not like getting new sneakers or a skateboard. You have to get to know someone, allow yourself to be vulnerable (let someone know you are interested, even if they reject you), and be a little gutsy (willing to try). The trick is putting yourself in a position to meet other gay boys, and, then seeing how you interact. Not all will be what you want as a boyfriend, but, do not let that prevent you from being friends. Now the warnings \u2014 protect yourself physically from harm and from abusers. The Internet is home to many frauds, adults claiming to be your age, bashers who bait you into harm. You know how horny you get, know that others do to and will lie lie lie. So, please Cian, be careful. At your age (40 years ago) there was no Internet and being gay was very closeted. It was a much different world when to came to gay existence \u2014 not a single TV character, and when in movies, always the bad devils. In Berkeley California, though, there was a community center that sponsored youth groups. A safe place to meet and find friends. In today\u2019s world, search online for groups in your area where you might be able to join in. Remember, being gay happens about 5% of the time, but, at your age, most kids are just beginning to figure things out about who they are. For every 100 kids in your high school class, half boys/girls, so 2 or 3. They may not be ready to be open about it though. Does your school have a gay/straight alliance? And, you can contact the Trevor Project or PFLAG to see if they have anything in your area. Meeting through groups will help you learn more about what is going on around you. ",
