            "answer_text": "Members of the Protection Detail arrest his sorry ass and cart him off to a high security federal detention center. They are, after all, sworn federal law enforcement officers and people of the highest conceivable integrity.The Vice President convenes the Cabinet. Pursuant to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the Vice President and the entire cabinet (it takes only a majority of the cabinet concurring with the VP) transmit to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate a written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the duties and powers of his office by virtue of being under arrest for murder. The President is arraigned for murder and is held without bond, as he is a flight risk.The Vice President becomes Acting President by virtue of the above.The Acting President directs that the Secret Service and the FBI jointly investigate the death of Mrs. President. The FBI takes lead because of its superior crime lab facilities and because its agents do not have the kind of close personal connection to the First Family as exists with many members of the Secret Service Protection detail.The investigation rapidly concludes that Mr. President killed Mrs. President. The evidence is turned over to the Acting President who transmits it to the Speaker of the House.In record time, the House votes Articles of Impeachment which are approved 403\u20134 with 28 abstentions/absences.In record time, the Senate votes to convict with a vote of 94\u20133, with 3 absences. Mr. President is now Mr. Former President and the Acting President becomes the President.Defended by a \u201cDream Team\u201d of some of the best criminal attorneys who ever lived and lusted for publicity and glory, the President is tried for murder (the White House being in the District of Columbia and under Federal jurisdiction) under 18 USC Section 1111. Federal prosecutors elect to refrain from seeking the death penalty.The trial lasts three months. At the conclusion, Mr. Former President is found Guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in federal custody. He becomes a surprisingly popular prisoner, eating dinner each evening with his inner circle of favorite prison friends, jokingly referred to as \u201cThe President\u2019s Cabinet.\u201dYes, I did fictionalize a bit, but all the legal and constitutional procedures are correct as best I understand them.",

            "answer_text": "In David Baldacci's Absolute Power (1996), the Prez is getting into rough sex with a woman when the Secret Service breaks in and kills her. The weenie? The woman is the wife of a billionaire and the murder is witnessed by a burglar that is robbing the house. The movie (1997) was entertaining with an all-star cast: starring & directed by Clint Eastwood as the burglar; Gene Hackman as the Prez; Ed Harris as the cop on the case; Scott Glenn & Dennis Haysbert as the Secret Service agents; Judy Davis as the Prez's Chief of Staff; Laura Linney as Eastwood's angry daughter; E.G. Marshall (in his final film role) as the billionaire. You need to watch to see how they handle the cover-up. I won\u2019t spoil the ending.
