            "answer_text": "Writing \u201cunique\u201d content is becoming harder and harder with each passing year. In fact, being \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cunique\u201d doesn\u2019t cut it anymore. The web is saturated with \u201cgreat content\u201d already. Expect that majority of content that you find on the Google\u2019s first or second (do you even go there?) page is basic-level knowledge.  Whenever I look for something, I end up scanning these pieces more than reading. I check sub-headings and quite often it\u2019s enough to determine that this particular piece isn\u2019t adding anything new to things that I know. Whenever you want to find quality, or you\u2019d say, unique pieces\u2026 well, that\u2019s research waiting for you. And a long one, too. But how do you create a unique piece? You could write a whole essay on it, but here\u2019s a quick recap. All in all, you\u2019ll want to include elements that nobody else can copy. Here\u2019s how. Include data you\u2019ve gathered (conduct a research). Basing your claims on data and numbers is cool in itself, but it\u2019s your own research, study and findings that are most valuable.Interview people. Ask for quotes and advice from authority in your industry. These quotes will be found only in your piece and nowhere else.Share your experiences and stories. Nobody has the same experience and knowledge as you do. Your perspective is unique so go ahead and share it with others - and if it somehow helps them, even better. People can learn from your mistakes and events from your past.Give it a twist. The best writers attract our attention with plot twists and unexpected turns of events. We cling to them because we don\u2019t know what to expect on the next page. Following the same rule: want to write a food guide for tourists in Florence? Pretty sure someone already discussed all the restaurants, so why not touch on eating street food only or other unexpected and extreme solution?As said above, it\u2019s not easy to create unique piece of content because with everybody\u2019s having access to web these days, we\u2019re flooded with content on pretty much anything. Will it take time? Yes, it will. Will it be hard? Definitely. Will it pay off? Probably. And I say probably, because the last tip I\u2019ve got for you is to remember that being unique won\u2019t guarantee your copy\u2019s success. The most popular products aren\u2019t those which are the best - but those with the best marketing. So, get to promoting or all your effort will be wasted. I hope this helps! P.S.

Every McDonalds all over the world is essentially the same as well. The key is to focus on what John Travolta called \u201cthe little differences.\u201d So don\u2019t try to write something that\u2019s never been written before. Try to find the little differences from your own unique perspective. ",
