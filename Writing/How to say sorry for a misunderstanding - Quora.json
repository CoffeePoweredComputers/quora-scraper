Take responsibility for any hurt or offense you caused. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I thought you said that the moon is made of cheddar cheese. That\u2019s why I laughed, I honestly believed it was a joke. Of course you meant that the moon really is made of green cheese, which is serious, and nothing to joke about. I didn\u2019t mean to disrespect or offend you in any way.\u201d If they misunderstood you, do basically the same thing in reverse. Explain what you meant, take responsibility for any hurt or offense, etc etc. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, that came out completely wrong. I didn\u2019t mean that the moon is made of cheddar cheese, although I understand how it could have sounded that way. Of course we both know that the moon really is made of green cheese. I didn\u2019t mean to disrespect or offend you in any way.\u201d ",

You already know the answer: \u201cHow can I say sorry for a misunderstanding?\u201d In reality, your question is the time-honored, \u201cHow can I say sorry for a misunderstanding\u201d when it really means How can I apologize for misunderstanding without having to deal with the stress of admitting it? Here\u2019s the thing about admitting guilt: It\u2019s usually painful \u2014 first when you admit it to yourself and later when you admit it to the person you misunderstood. You can rationalize your way out of it but it\u2019ll always bother you. The best course of action is to grow-up and admit it: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for our misunderstanding and I apologize to you for it. I\u2019d like us to put it behind us. Again, I apologize.\u201d There. It\u2019s done and maybe you and your friend can move on. Thanks for asking, Janet ",
