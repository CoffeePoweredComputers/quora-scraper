            "answer_text": "Short answer: yes. Sometimes I just have so much going on in my head and I need to get it out. If I can\u2019t talk to someone about it, I write. Most of the time it\u2019s a kind of journal entry where I write down the story of whatever I\u2019m anxious about. Sometimes I write letters to people without ever planning to send them. If I\u2019m just anxious and don\u2019t know why, then writing helps me figure out what\u2019s wrong. I just pull out a notebook or the diary app on my phone and let the words flow. Writing things that aren\u2019t related to my anxiety helps as well. I write short stories, illustrate comics, or go on Quora to answer other people\u2019s questions. Anything to get my mind focused on something else. Something productive. So yes, writing helps with anxiety. It\u2019s a creative outlet and a safe way to process your emotions at your own pace. ",
