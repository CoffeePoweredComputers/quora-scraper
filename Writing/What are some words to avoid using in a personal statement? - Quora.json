            "answer_text": "Hey, I\u2019m not sure if this helps, but this is what I learnt in primary school. I thought it was pretty insignificant because the teachers never went through it, but it has helped me much more than I realised. It\u2019s called the IMessage. Basically, instead of saying \u201cYou hurt me,\u201d where the \u2018you\u2019 is the main subject, more focus should be used on \u2018I\u2019. So, you should be saying \u201cI was hurt by your comment,\u201d instead. It sounds less like you are putting the blame or accusing the person you are talking to. However, I did realise later on that it might come off as self-absorbed in some peoples\u2019 eyes. Do take note of that! I think you can fit this into personal statements as well. I hope this helps you and kindly let me know if it did :) ",
