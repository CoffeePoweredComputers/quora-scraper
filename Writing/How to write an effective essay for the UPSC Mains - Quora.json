            "answer_text": "A good essay should have A good introductionVery good flowCoverage ( of different aspects)well articulated pointsA good conclusionLet us consider each of these points seperately. A good introduction The introduction eases the reader into the topic. It should be able to invite the reader into the topic that is being discussed without he/she knowing it. Different people attempt different strategies to begin the essay. The most popular method that I have seen people use, but I don't personally like is to use a quote to begin the essay. Another method is to paint a picture about the topic and then introduce the matter. I almost always rely on this method. For example, in 2014 essay paper, I remember that the question that I attempted was Words are sharper than the two-edged sword. I began the essay with something to this effect: Thousands of years ago Mark Antony stirred an entire nation to action standing on a podium. Thousand years hither, it was the same podium that Hitler used to stir men into committing atrocities. Words, history has proven to us, are sharper than a two edged sword. I scored 145 marks in essay that year ( if I remember correctly) The advantage with this method is that it requires only a good imagination. It doesn't ask of you to learn numerous quotes which you fit in whatever the essay. The downside of course is that imagination is hard to come by for everyone. Very good Flow A good essay should effortlessly segue through its various parts. This means you should properly plan the execution of the essay before you even start writing it. One technique I apply is to write down every single point that comes to mind and then categorise and put them into a framework. In this, I write down the points as it would appear in the essay and then simply go on and expand them. This would ensure that the flow between the various parts is maintained. Coverage I always tried to cover different aspects of a topic when attempting it. Many people advocate a \u201cSPELTE\u201d strategy, which is analysing the topic\u2019s Social, Political, Economic, Legal, Technological and Environmental aspects. I have found that this makes the essay very mechanical and reducing the vitality of the essay. I don\u2019t compartmentalise the essay into such pigeon holes, but attempt to cover all aspects without such explicit compartmentalisation. Articulation There is a difference in being able to say something concisely and having to put it out in so many words. Long, tardy sentences reduces the readability of the essay. To score on this aspect, you need to have a good command over the language. In my case, I developed it through reading a lot. The best place to start is the newspaper editorial. I used to regularly read the editorials of Hindu, LiveMint and Business Standard. Without you even realising it, your vocabulary would expand and many of the words which were otherwise inaccessible to you would come to you by second nature. This is something you should work on right from the beginning. Conclusion As they say, All is well that ends well. A good essay should not end abruptly. The main constraint here would be space and time. Many people write and write and by the end find themselves with very less space in the paper to end the essay. Don\u2019t commit this mistake. Also make sure that you end the essay very well. It could either put out an opinion, or an outlook for the future or an exposition of both sides of the debate. Use your discretion in making this good. Some people would be natural in writing well. For the others, the only way they can improve is by writing a lot of essays and practicing the craft. I never had much difficulty in the essay department. I would recommend that you find out whether it is a strong forte for you and then decide on the future course of action. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAs the nation mourned the death of our beloved ex Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, almost everyone was glued to their television screens watching the last rites of the funeral process. As tears poured down across many dignitaries from across the political spectrum, people were caught off by a major visual on the TV screen. The funeral pyre of Vajpayee ji was lit by his foster daughter, Namita Bhattacharya. What was striking was that this went against the age old Hindu customs of not letting women folk enter the funeral procession. It was a powerful symbol, coming right from the highest echeleons of the power that things as they are should be ready for a progressive change. Truly, customary morality cannot be a guide to modern life. \u201c \u2026\u2026.. \u201cSince time immemorial, our social dealings, interpersonal interactions have been guided by age old customs. These customs important in their own time frame, have defined our society and social values. But at the same time, these customs have been dehumanising, exclusionary and degrading for many marginalised sections of the society, for example: women, transgenders, disabled, downtrodden, Dalits, religious minorities etc. A modern society needs a modern, inclusive, egalitarian and progressive outlook. Age old customary morality cannot be a guide to modern life.\u201d \u2026\u2026.. The above two are two different introductions for the essay: Customary morality cannot be a guide to modern life (UPSC CSE 2018 - Essay) Both introductions are fairly good: One is an example based, another is historical/definitional based. Which one did you like better ? I think, most of you would agree that the first one is better. It is more powerful. Emotive. Personalised. And an unique example. You won\u2019t find that in any other of 10,000 answer scripts being evaluated. That is what an effective essay should be: It should be your own creative personalised intervention so that you express truly what you feel about the subject. I scored 163 in UPSC CSE 2016 Essay (second highest for that year). Just after writing the essay, I was sure that I\u2019ll score well. Both the topics (women, cooperative federalism) were well prepared for me and I strongly felt on both the issues. I myself couldn\u2019t emulate that again in my next attempt, the next year. And I knew too, just after the exam, that I haven\u2019t done a great job. Here\u2019s your cheatsheet for a good essay: Have ready reference material prepared on various Themes:Health - status and reforms neededPublic Health (Corona)Education (NEP 2020 in news too)Women and associated issuesYouth / Sports [Utility, Olympics]Globalisation ( deglobalisation ?)Cooperative and collaborative FederalismEconomy / Development / Poverty / Skills/ EmploymentUrbanisation and issues associatedAgriculture and associated reformsDemocracy and problems with itFreedom of expression / Liberty : need and issuesGovernance issues / CorruptionGlobal conflicts, for example: Issues in West Asia, wars (ISIS etc), South China sea, Coronavirus, US-China (trade, 5G), North Korea, Iran, African problems, theatres of cyber and space etcTerrorism / Crime control / Security issuesForeign Policy changes and challenges (Multialignment, border skirmishes, neighbourhood relations, regional groupings)Environment / Climate Change / Blue economyLand / Air / Water resources and challengesScience and Tech and current trends (AI, Blockchain, Cloud computing, nanotech, Robotics, space, 3D printing IT etc)Social Justice - Progress on that frontIndia\u2019s cultural diversity / Communal harmonyRole of Media and issuesRelevance of Gandhiji and his ideas todayMoral degeneration of society and collapse of ethical infrastructureRise of relentless consumerism and idea of minimalismYou can easily expect atleast one essay every year on the above list of topics I have mentioned - Prepare relevant introductions (anecdotes, data, facts and figures, stories, quotes), various different dimensions (body part) and progressive conclusions (best practices etc) regarding every such topic.Choosing the one topic out of 4: Please, don\u2019t choose the tough topic thinking you will score high as fewer people will write on it. That\u2019s a sureshot recipe for disaster. Choose what you\u2019re comfortable with.Introduction is very important. (You can see why from the way I began this answer with). Intro acts as a hook. It should be captive, catch the reader\u2019s eye. It has the maximum impact on the reader. It is famously said that the first two pages of your essay tell the reader how your rest of the essay would be like. Quotes, facts and figures, real life examples, stories, anecdotes help a lot.Essays should have a very broad approach, reasonably holistic in nature and diverse in scope. The body of your essay should have varied dimensions. Don\u2019t do PhD in one dimension, instead touch every aspect of the topic. Some good general body formats (won\u2019t work in every essay) are:SPECLIH (society, political..);Indvidual, state, national, global;Causes, Issues, Interventions, Reforms;Infrastructural, Administrative, Attitudinal;Short term, medium term, long term;Public Sector, Private, Civil Society and many such ways you can think ofEssay should be balanced. A reason I scored low in my second attempt in essay was that on the essay of \u2018New India woman is a myth\u2019 - I totally justified it to be a myth - in hindsight I should have devoted 30% space to how women have also grown so much in matters of rights and freedoms. My essay became quite one sided.Conclusion should be optimistic + progressive + visionary + global perspective and should have mention of government efforts in that direction.You have 1.5 hours to write an essay. For the first 25 minutes don\u2019t write: just brainstorm, make your structure, dimensions, have relevant quotes, data written down, then while writing for next hour ensure a smooth flow while writing it.Try to brainstorm on topics while preparing - Think about each and every small thing regarding the topic and them formulate 4\u20135 key different dimensions on which you can elaborateYou will realise that 80% of your essay content is a combine of your GS 1+2+3+4 prep. Many people forget this.But an important point to note: Don\u2019t make your essay a long GS answer. Don\u2019t write in bullets. Use 2 paras on each page.Underline the key words and ideas. (VERY IMPORTANT) Nobody has the time to read your full essay word by word patiently.The most important thing is to have a proper and comprehensive structure to your essay. It will only come with practice. Essay should not be a disaggregated piece of information overload but good 1200 words of coherent wisdom.Your essay should have a proper flow. Your dimensions should have some connect as one reads your essay. Try to give sub headings (max 4\u20135) and ensure coherence of thought throughout the essay.Real life unique examples of leaders- Indian and global, famous personalities, thinkers, etc if are mentioned, have a very good impact.Also note: Gandhiji (ideas of Sarvodaya, Swaraj, Satyagraha etc) and various ethical ideas (different theories) can become one dimension in any kind of an essay.Similarly, an international dimension can be a dimension in any essay (health, education etc)You should practice atleast 8\u201310 essays before the final exam.I will end with a funny point. Search for Kofi Annan\u2019s quotes. That genious of a personality has said something on everything! His quotes are eye catching to say the least.In the end, essay is make or break. There are people who have secured an amazing rank just by virtue of a good essay score and there are people who have done everything right except the essay and found their name out of the list. Finally, make your essay a worthwhile engaging read, with good mention of examples/stories. You should really feel for the topic that you are writing on. It\u2019s very easy to distinguish what comes from the heart, what doesn\u2019t. If you feel strongly about education and its need for the society, it will reflect in your essay. But, suppose you don\u2019t really care about women\u2019s rights, then however good an essay you may write with various facts and figures, the essence of it will never be pure. It\u2019s easy to distinguish. That\u2019s what I feel about a good essay. It does not need excellent English. But it needs wonderful thought provoking ideas. It should be your own personalised intervention. Be creative. Be you. All the best. ",
