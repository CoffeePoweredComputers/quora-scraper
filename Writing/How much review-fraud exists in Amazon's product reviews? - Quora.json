            "answer_text": "I can't speak for books, but as it would pertain to other categories I think I can say with confidence that the proportion of fake reviews on Amazon varies greatly by the product type, by the manufacturer of the product and also by how the product is being sold. Perhaps if you're doing a paper for school, some aggregated numbers that came from the MIT or Harvard studies would be helpful. But in a meaningful, practical sense I think the question you're asking is virtually impossible to answer. There are too many variables and the proportion of fakes will swing too widely from one variable to the next to give an average of them any meaningful weight. However, if you're a shopper trying to determine whether to trust the reviews, the study is not helpful at all because fake reviews are much more prevalent in some product groups than they are in other product groups. For example, the fake reviews in electronic accessories being sold by smaller 3rd party companies may be MUCH, much higher than the fake reviews posted under laptops manufactured by global brands and being sold through Amazon. As an honest smaller company selling our own branded products in the on Amazon since 2007, I am all too familiar with the deceptive practices some smaller 3rd party sellers engage in. Particularly over the past 12 to 18 months as Amazon started courting China based companies to sell on their marketplace, it has gotten very dirty in some categories. Even if you had access to the entire Amazon review database and built an algorithm to give you a top line number of (what the programmed algorithm) would say are fake, that number would probably be meaningless in any practical context for a shopper. I don't think anyone would dispute the idea that the proportion of fakes will be much higher in some categories than it will be in others so it will depend on the specific product you are researching, who it's manufactured by and how it's being sold. For example, let's say you're looking at a Canon camcorder being offered by ABC Camera Co. Well, the likelihood that Canon hired people to post fake reviews on Amazon is very, very small. And it's also very unlikely that their retailer ABC Camera Co. has hired anybody to post fake reviews. Why? Because ABC Camera Co. sells all different brands of camcorders and doesn't care whether you buy the Canon, the JVC or the Sony. It's all the same to them. Now, let's say you're looking for a replacement battery for that camcorder which is being offered by an unknown brand such as say \"XYZ Battery Company\" who sells their own XYZ batteries on Amazon. In this case, the incentive for fake reviews is multiplied many times. I'll explain. In the case of the Canon Camcorder. Here, you have a global branded product supported by global advertisements, not only on television, but also by the endless number of retailers from Best Buy to Walmart to other e-commerce sites such as Staples. Amazon is most likely a tiny part of Canon's business. In fact, most global brands don't even has one person overseeing or looking at the feedback that is being posted on Amazon. Canon creates their own image via advertising and doesn't rely on Amazon reviewers to any significant extent to communicate it's products strengths and weaknesses. In the case of the 3rd Party replacement battery being offered by XYZ, this is an unknown entity to most. There is no advertising on television, no product placement in store advertisements or prominent placement on display racks at retailers to help convince you of its legitimacy. It's not even sold in retail stores. The first important distinction is that the reviews posted on Amazon have an out sized impact on convincing the shopper of the XYZ brand & products legitimacy. The second important distinction is that XYZ likely is more heavily reliant on Amazon sales and likely has staff directly engaged with all public postings pertaining to their product. We would be similar to XYZ in these respects. So, it's easy to see that the potential for faked reviews varies greatly in these two scenarios. And I want to stress that this by no means would imply that any company like XYZ would fake reviews for their product; it just means that the incentive to do so is much greater and thus conventional wisdom would imply that there will be more of it going on. All these things make the answer impossible to answer in a meaningful way, at least in the context of an Amazon shopper. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon: No More Incentivized Reviews* As of 10/3/16, when it comes to product reviews (exception for books) unless you\u2019re in Amazon Vine, you\u2019re out.  If you\u2019re in the influencer marketing / product reviews space, you\u2019re probably aware of how big of a market Amazon is\u2026er\u2026was. Now, it would be easy to point out how hypocritical it is of Amazon to not only remove incentivized reviews, but to go so far as to hint at lawsuits, while in the same breath offer a similar service that does the very things they are now claiming to be poisonous. However, that\u2019s not going to help you. Instead, let\u2019s look at the reality and existing problem as an opportunity. Amazon Sellers You can no longer request incentivized reviews, even if they are honest reviews, to exist on the Amazon platform. You can, however, get such reviews to exist external to Amazon. In fact, this may even result in something more powerful if the competition can no longer create fake reviews. Example: Provide a coupon code for a 100% free product sold on Amazon to a product reviewer that has a blog and Twitter account listed in her profile. The reviewer can provide an honest review (we suggest nothing less than honesty), which is then tweeted out to her audience. This review may drive some sales by itself, but in aggregate can provide a large pool of social proof a seller can point to when interacting with prospects doing research on the product\u200a\u2014\u200aif you are thorough in your campaign, the externally created reviews will end up being referenced in the organic Amazon reviews later. Make sense? Try it out today for 2 weeks free. Product Reviewers / Influencers You\u2019ve been placed in a difficult situation. I have spoken to and corresponded with thousands of you over the past 60 days and recognize just how passionate you are about performing product reviews. At Intellifluence we still have a section for providing an Amazon review profile on our influencer sign-up page, but we encourage you to extend the number of platforms that you\u2019re involved with. By becoming involved on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram, and/or a blog you will become that much more valuable in the eyes of a brand seeking reviews. Confused at how to start? Here\u2019s a sample of how a future conversation might work for you\u2026 Brand: Hi Joe, I saw your Amazon reviewer profile and want to give you free product in exchange for an honest review. Reviewer: Nothing would make me happier, but Amazon has cracked down on incentivized reviews on their platform. What I can do instead is take the free product you\u2019re offering and write a post on {my facebook account|my blog|my twitter account} and then promote it to my entire audience. Then, because I will be listed as a verified purchaser of the product, if someone asks a question of me through the Amazon Q&A system, I can point them to my post. Brand: Amazon is crazy to do this; as I understand it Vine isn\u2019t doing too well. Reviewer: It may have just been a way to get some attention to their program, but the irony is in the reviewer community their program isn\u2019t even as trusted as some of the 3rd party groups like Intellifluence. That\u2019s ok though; I am keeping plenty busy from Amazon sellers seeking out my influence on other platforms. Ok, ok, it probably won\u2019t be word for word like that, but expect to start having those conversations. Worried that you don\u2019t have any social profiles setup yet beyond your Amazon account? It is never too late to get started; get some, sign up and start growing your reputation as a reviewer today. This answer was based on an article I wrote for the Intellifluence blog. ",
