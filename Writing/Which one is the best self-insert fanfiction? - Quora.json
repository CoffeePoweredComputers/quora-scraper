            "answer_text": "There are a lot of very author-y characters out there, some of them in excellent books. But some of the best that occur to me: And Then There Were (N-One) - Uncanny Magazine is a novella by Sarah Pinsker who several nebula awards for previous stories. I nominated it for a hugo this year. It\u2019s about an insurance investigator who attends a conference for parallel universe versions of herself. Four or five versions were successful physicists who first discovered how that were possible. Most were there just out of curiosity. But they were all \u2018Sarah Pinsker\u2019 and one of them had a nebula award like the real-life author. It\u2019s not technically fanfiction but I think it should count :) It\u2019s simultaneously the most blatant and yet the least intrusive self-insert I\u2019ve ever seen. Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a story by Eliezer Yudkowsky devoted to explaining ways of thinking to avoid getting trapped in the patterns that most people get trapped in. Whether or not you agree (I love a lot of it but find some of it wrong-headed), it\u2019s very \u201chim\u201d. G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach - Wikipedia by Douglas Hofstadter explains Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorem, by way of Escher and Bach. It constantly illustrates examples with humorous dialogues of two characters, Achilles and Tortoise, based on Lewis Carol\u2019s dialogue in which the same characters are used to explain logic, based originally on the figure\u2019s Xeno used to illustrate his famous \u201cif you can\u2019t go the whole way without going through an infinite number of half way, three quarters, etc points, how do you ever get to the end\u201d paradox. Hofstadter appeared himself in one of the later dialogues. ",

            "answer_text": "One of my latest finds is All of Eternity at my Fingertips Chapter 1, a vampire diaries fanfic, which features a villain as the protagonist that I enjoyed every much. Its sequels are not obligatory and the main character is placed in different universes each, but I do quite enjoy some of them, such as the Spy Games Chapter 1, an avengers fanfic. Another Harry Potter fic I\u2019d like to recommend (besides Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which Jack Vickeridge already recommended in this page) is Rose Petal Red. The same author also wrote a Hunger Games self-insert, Quell, though it\u2019s still in early stage chapters. Those are the long series/memorable ones I can recall at the moment, but feel free to ask for more recommendations if needed. ",
