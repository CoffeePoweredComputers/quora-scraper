            "answer_text": "You can get into a number of colleges with no essays at all, but it really depends where you want to go. If you are aiming for a selective, highly selective or Ivy League school, then you will need a good essay. It won\u2019t be as much of an issue if you apply to either your own state schools or large state schools (even if they are out of state for you) such as the Universities of Missouri, Kansas or Iowa. My question would be: why are you even asking the question that way? Do you feel that you are not a good writer? At the application stage, there are consultants available (for hire) who can work with you on your essays to help you to form them into the kind of essays the schools will expect. But longer term, you should consider working on your writing skills because you will need them in college no matter what school you attend or major you choose. ",

            "answer_text": "A bad essay is not an automatic disqualifier for admission \u2014 your SAT or ACT score carries the most weight when schools are looking at your college application. Don\u2019t get me wrong, factors like your essay, recommendations, GPA, and extracurriculars are important, but a great SAT or ACT score should be priority number one. Check out test prep resources like UWorld to help with your writing skills and prepare you for your SAT or ACT exam. And be optimistic . . . you\u2019re going to write a great essay! ",
