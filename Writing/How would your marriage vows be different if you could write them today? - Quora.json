Even on the bad days, I will still choose to make up before bedtime. We will never go to bed angry with one another. It is us against the problem, not us against each other. We are a team. Our successes are 50% yours, and 50% mine. As are our failures. Even when we make mistakes, we can exhaust all efforts to heal wounds. And then keep trying. I swear to not throw in the towel at the first fight, the first stress, nor the first hurdle that life will inevitably throw at us. We have songs that hit us on personal levels.. and there will continue to be lines that stick with us. I swear to you that I will always share music with you, and bond with you over the romantic rock songs that we both know and love. Please, please know that I love you. We will follow each other anywhere. This is not a passing fancy\u2026 this is not a crush. This is Love. Love that I can feel in every cell of my body, and every bit of my soul. You have ignited my stardust, electrified my blood, and lit up my soul. You have brightened the darkest corners of my mind, and shown me new colors by simply battling life at my side. You are my best friend, and I will cherish you forever. I am honored to be your loving wife. Thank you Jesse, for showing me my own true colors, and how perfectly they mix with your true colors. ",
