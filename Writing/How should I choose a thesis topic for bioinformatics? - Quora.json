            "answer_text": "Well, much will depend on the level of thesis you are doing. Is this a senior undergraduate thesis, master\u2019s thesis or doctoral thesis? But much of my advice remains the same. Pick something that really interests you, that energizes you. Bioinformatics is a ginormous space and you\u2019re going to bite off a small piece of it; pick a piece that you can dive into passionately. You may need to balance that against local expertise, as if you\u2019re doing something interesting you can expect to run into troubles. But there are also lots of folks you can find by Quora, Twitter and other means who can help out. Skimming some recent papers in the space is a good way to find potential topics. For example, there was a really nice paper in Science very recently analyzing a large and versatile protein family. Performing a similar analysis on another family (well, the computational part \u2014 they did a lot of cool experimentation too) could well be the core of a thesis topic. Another recent Science paper did a lot of 3D structure prediction \u2014 doing that on one protein family might be a doable topic. Analyzing error modes in recent genome assemblies could be a topic. Or so many more \u2014 there are so many data resources and open source software out there that you should have a lot of options \u2014 so don\u2019t waste your time on something that doesn\u2019t get you intellectually excited.

            "answer_text": "Most methods, used today for RNA-seq, are inaccurate. Even best programs used for RNA-seq analysis (such as StringTie) produce some errors. Most methods used for sequencing produced short reads, which are noisy and lack the information necessary to build globally accurate transcripts. I suggest you to develop an algorithm that will work better than other algorithms plus to develop a new methods that will improve the nature of the data (longer and accurate reads, improve ribosomal depletion protocol etc). When you solve these problems in your thesis, I promise you, this will be the best thesis in the field in a long time. ",
