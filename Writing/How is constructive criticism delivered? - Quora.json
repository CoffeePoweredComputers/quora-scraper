            "answer_text": "With difficulty! What is constructive to one, is destructive to another. If necessary, it is best to provide an indirect example of the problem, and this should ideally not be directly associated with the specific individual. Diplomacy is called for! Never try to deliberately hurt another\u2019s feelings. Underneath, no matter how macho we like to present ourselves to the world, we are probably not quite as much - underneath our skin. Respect is called for at all times and demonstrate this but still get your point across with finesse so that there is no undue animosity. We all do things, with which on refection, we probably wished we had not! The ideal result is to both feel good about what has been said. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea it is constructive would be the opposite of destructive criticism which would be harsh tactless criticism that doesn\u2019t seeks to correct as it does to destroy! Consider it as a teachable mornent and seek to show it gently to guide and in a friendly way lead one to the right course of action without any reproof on your end! ",
