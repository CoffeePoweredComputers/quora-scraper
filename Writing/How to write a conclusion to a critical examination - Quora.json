            "answer_text": "There are a few types of conclusions or closures that can be used at the end of a persuasive essay that includes a critical examination of an issue. A very short summary of the argument/evidence presented and a statement of the proven thesis is the most commonly used type.A few questions that arise from the persuasive argument can be of two types: questions that are meant to cause the reader to come to the conclusions you\u2019ve reached and questions that are meant to suggest that further investigation might be interesting or worthwhile.A statement of the proven thesis without restatement of the evidence/argument, sometimes combined with suggestions of what further conclusions might be drawn but would require further analysis.It\u2019s helpful if the statement of the proven thesis is recognizable from reading the thesis/hypothesis that is typically at the beginning of the essay. However, it\u2019s preferable not to use exactly the same statement in both places. Just be sure that you have not proved something different from what the thesis states. Some people have difficulty focusing their arguments and evidence in a way that stays focused on the original thesis. Their arguments drift to a similar thesis, but proof of the similar thesis is not proof of the original thesis. ",
