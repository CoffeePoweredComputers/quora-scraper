            "answer_text": "ORIGINAL QUESTION: How do you even write a song? Usually, my \"songs\" are about 2-3 paragraphs long and I know that's not enough to make it a song. I'm just starting off with my first EP and I want to release a FULL album but not with songs that are 2-3 paragraphs long. Songs don\u2019t usually have \u201cparagraphs\u201d. They have \u201cverses\u201d, usually a \u201cchorus\u201d, and sometimes a \u201cbridge\u201d. Occasionally, they may even have a \u201crefrain\u201d. So, you may have more \u201csong\u201d in front of you than you realize. Choruses are oftentimes repeated after each verse, so you may have even more song in front of you still. It\u2019s just a matter of how you work it. Generally, a song tells a story. One way to get the ball rolling on that, is simply to write out the story in your own words, ignoring \u201cverse\u201d and \u201crhyme\u201d and \u201cmeter\u201d, just tell the story any old way, just like you were telling a story to a friend. Write that down like this: A long time ago, I knew this guy in Louisiana who was a really good guitar player. He wasn\u2019t the brightest bulb in the box and really could barely even read or write, but he sure could play guitar. He was a country boy and lived in the woods in an actual log cabin believe it or not. This guy played guitar so well that people would come from miles around to hear him play. He was that good. Sometimes, he played so well, that those listening would be overcome with emotion and start shouting, \u201cGo! Go!\u201d That\u2019s how good he was. He was so poor he couldn\u2019t afford a guitar case, so he just carried his guitar in a gunny sack, I kid you not. He would walk to town and sit down by the train station and, I swear to God, this kid picked up the rhythm of the old steam locomotives and used that like a backing-track for his guitar playing. It was amazing! Word of his skill on guitar spread and pretty soon, he started drawing a pretty fair size crowd. The people in the crowd would nearly always be swept away by the emotion of his playing and soon the habit of shouting \u201cGo! Go!\u201d had spread far and wide. His mother, recognizing his unusual talent, told him that someday, he was going to be a really famous band-leader, with his name in lights. Now you have a story. So it\u2019s time to hammer the story into song form. Here\u2019s what that might look like \u2192 (The first verse): Deep down in Louisiana close to New OrleansWay back up in the woods among the evergreensThere stood a log cabin made of earth and woodWhere lived a country boy named MaxwellWho never ever learned to read or write so wellBut he could play a guitar just like a ringing a bell So we have \u201cMaxwell\u201d which is my friend\u2019s name, \u201cso well\u201d and, \u201ca bell\u201d so far. Pretty clever, don\u2019t you think? Now we need to write the \u201chook\u201d. The \u201chook\u201d is the part that everyone will remember even if they\u2019ve only ever heard the song one time. So, it has to be catchy, simple and easy to remember. I\u2019m going to use what the crowd used to shout at my friend. So let\u2019s try that: Go! Go! Maxwell go! Go! Go! Maxwell go! So, not bad. But \u201cMaxwell\u201d is hard to pronounce and makes the whole phrase clumsy. So, even though that\u2019s my friend\u2019s name, and even though it\u2019s going to ruin my cute three-rhyme thing in the verse, I\u2019m going to change it to \u201cJohnny\u201d cuz that\u2019s easier to say. And I\u2019m going to change the phrasing because the way it is now sounds more like a football cheer than a song. So, let\u2019s fix that part and try again: Go! Go! Go, Johnny Go! Go! Go, Johnny Go, go, go! Go Johnny go! Go! Go! Johnny Go! Go! Johnny B. Goode! So, I added a last name and middle initial too, in such a way that now, it\u2019s not just a name, it\u2019s an admonition! That should make it even more memorable! And the whole chorus is only two words repeated over and over. Easy! Everyone should be able to remember that, right? So now, I have my first verse and my chorus. The bridge and refrain aren\u2019t mandatory and so, since this is my first song ever, I\u2019m going to leave those out. Maybe on the next song, I\u2019ll try adding them in, but for now, I\u2019m sticking with verse and chorus and maybe a guitar solo in there somewhere. So, for the music, I\u2019m going to keep it simple. I\u2019m using that \u201clocomotive\u201d rhythm with a simple I, IV, V chord progression (don\u2019t worry about the chords for now, as that has to do with another concept called \u201cmusic theory\u201d which we will go into on another post. But just remember, we\u2019re going to use the \u201cone\u201d chord, the \u201cfour\u201d chord, and the \u201cfive\u201d chord in this song. There are about a million or more songs that use those three chords, so we\u2019re in good company there. We use numbers instead of letters for the chords, so that, in case we need to change keys for some reason, no one gets confused. One, four and five are always the same no matter what key we\u2019re playing in. Here is what all that might sound like once we put it all together:  Not too bad, eh? This isn\u2019t the \u201coriginal\u201d version of this song, but it\u2019s a very good version that I think illustrates some important points in songwriting. You did great in your first songwriting effort! Now go forth and write! (NOTE: This song was actually written a long time ago by the late, great Chuck Berry Chuck Berry - Wikipedia. It is one of the most memorable and often-performed songs in all of Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll history, and a sterling example of how to write a song.) ",

            "answer_text": "-You know I think that Less Equals More works pretty good on Original Lyrics.Some of the Best Rock Songs I have heard sometimes use less than a paragraph of words. I believe the master of the paragraph song was (Sadly) Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots , and Velvet Revolver. He very creatively would sing maybe half to three quarters of his paragraph,, THEN USE HIS REMAINING WORDS IN A REPEATING FASHION. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? Most of the time you or anyone never noticed unless you were writing down the words to maybe perform or record that tune! Don\u2019t be down on yourself because you ONLY wrote a paragraph. Be thankful for every little transmission of creativity you receive. And be creative with HOW you use your \u201cTransmissions.\u201d I will usually \u201cWrite\u201d either \u201cHalf\u201dor a \u201cComplete\u201d sheet of paper, envelope , Napkin, or whatever.And all my stuff is what I call \u201cStream of the flow of UN-Consciousness\u201d And it looks pretty good right after I do it. But a couple of days later\u2026\u2026uh man. I usually find that I MAYBE at most have one, maybe two good ideas on that paper. And if I try to go back a day or two later and fix it, Nope I am too invested in it, and lack the restraint, or discipline to make Major changes that NEED to be made to it to make it flow or work. But if every time I write lyrics , AND WHEN I GET DONE WRITING, THE PIECE OF PAPER GOES IN ONE OF TWO OFFICE TYPE FILING CABINETS. You would be amazed how quickly pages start stacking up when you write regularly, and often. So now when I have an idea, or want to work on an idea, I go to the drawer and start pulling out sheets of paper with lyrics. And Nine Times Out of Ten, I will find something that blends nicely with what I am doing, Or something I wrote a ways back, That I don\u2019t have ANY TROUBLE SNIPPING IT INTO LITTLE BITS SO MAYBE I USE IT ON FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT IDEAS. Maybe go on youtube and look up the Stone Temple Pilots band\u2019s channel, and i would recommend Core, Tiny Music From The Vatican, and PURPLE. ALL great albums/CD\u2019s in their own write. But Get them back to your \u201cEvil\u201d Laboratory for a little dissection. Check out the creative way he used just the barest of lyrics on some songs and you will be amazed! And then you can Amaze your friends and then their Friends until you AMAZINGLY get your ass kicked! No, just kidding. Be humble, and Thankful for every tidbit you DO receive, because\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026(Some people DON\u2019T get ANY kind of creativity or inspiration AT ALL! Or they are just too insensitive to realize they are being gifted!) And don\u2019t be so serious or demanding on your self. I have actually heard recording artists (Bands) who recorded songs that after intense scrutiny, They could not come up with like one or two lines of prose, and instead of maybe turning up the faders on guitar or bass to make the spot not so noticeable, Instead elected to just sing \u201cMush\u201d or \u201cUnintelligible Garbage\u201d into the microphone on a \u201cBig Corporation Sponsored \u201c record. The Red Hot Chili Peppers come to mind in that category.. ",

That's not how the industry does it. If you want an album of 8-10 songs, you should intentionally write at least 20, then start narrowing down the choices. Don't limit your creativity by volume. The lucky album makers have \u201cunreleased\u201d and \u201cB-side\u201d gems that surface after the album gets released. ",
