Given the Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein Theorem all we need is an injection f:A\u2192Bf:A\u2192B and another injection g:B\u2192Ag:B\u2192A. The Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein Theorem guarantees that there exists a bijection between AA and BB. If we can\u2019t come up with a bijection between two sets, then we cannot associate members of one set with members of another. They have different cardinalities. ",
