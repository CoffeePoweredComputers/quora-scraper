            "answer_text": "Probably the fastest way to get published today is with a well-written letter to the editor or opinion column. Be sure to ask the advice of someone other than your high school pals about the appropriateness of the topic, and the quality of your writing. Until you start to get some success, it is especially important to make a habit of writing at least one 100-word piece that no one has assigned to you EVERY DAY. It doesn't have to be good, it just has to be a habit. Print hard copies and keep a portfolio. You will be amazed when you look through them from time to time how even something done poorly will give you an idea for how to do something better. ",
