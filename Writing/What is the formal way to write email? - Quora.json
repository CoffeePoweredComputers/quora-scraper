However, I have run across several problems. First, the number of fence posts delivered differ from those I ordered and paid for. I ordered 17 fence posts, but only received 7. Second, one of the panels were badly scratched and one was cracked in the middle and unusable. When I contacted Michael about the problems, he sent out an agent to inspect the damage. The agent indicated that replacements would be made for the damaged panels and the additional fence posts would be sent within a week. I have been waiting for over two weeks for the replacements and have received no additional correspondence with your company. Could you tell me when I can expect the replacement panels and the additional posts? Thank you for your attention to this matter, Robert Girard cell: XXX-XXX-XXXX Example 2: Dear Dr. Agaiby: Thank you for the time that you took last week to answer my questions about your diabetes research. I wonder if I could impose on your time for a couple of follow-up questions? You indicated that you were looking into how hormones affected the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Could you direct me to the research conducted by Drs. Callie and Sydney you were basing your own research on? You also suggested that I look into the research being conducted at the Mayo Clinic by Dr. Princeton. Do you have contact information for him as well? Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Robert Girard It\u2019s important that the email is concise and Be professional;Write complete sentences with good grammar, accurate spelling and punctuation.",

            "answer_text": "A formal email is typically sent to someone you don't know well or to someone who's in authority. Examples of someone who you might send a formal email to include your professor, a public official, or even a company you're doing business with. If your workplace has a formal environment, use formal emails with your boss and colleagues unless you're told to do otherwise. Many workplaces are moving towards a more casual environment and this often carries over to email communications. If you're not sure what's right for your workplace, ask. Casual Versus Formal Email: What's the Difference? A formal email differs from a casual email. A casual email usually goes to a person you know well\u2014often it's someone you're on good terms with such as a friend or family member. When sending a casual email, you don't need to worry as much about structure and tone. In fact, part of what makes a formal email different from a casual email is the structure. A formal email has a very defined structure, with a definite salutation (the opening part of the email), signature section, opening sentence, and body. You also use language differently in a formal email than in a casual email. Avoid using abbreviations, contractions, slang, emoticons, and other informal terminology. The tone of a formal email is different as well. An informal email may not even use complete sentences or proper grammar, but a formal email always does. Here's an example of formal email language: The meeting is scheduled for December 5th at 9:30 a.m. All students must attend. Your project updates are needed. Compare the formal language with the informal email language in this email: Required meeting\u2014Dec 5, 9:30 a.m. Updates needed. See ya there. :) Both statements share the same information. But the tone of the first is much more formal. Notice the incomplete sentence, slang, and emoticon in the informal example. 2. Writing a Formal Email While an informal email can often be sent quickly, writing a formal email typically takes a bit more thought and a bit more time. Careful consideration needs to be given to each email element. With that in mind, let's take a closer look at some common elements of a formal email: Subject Line The subject line is what the reader sees in their inbox. If the subject line is misleading or missing information, your email may not get read. The message may even be sent to spam. The more formal your email is, the more detailed your subject line should be. But beware of making your subject line too long. Here's an example of a formal email subject line: Required Student Meeting: December 5th, 9:30 a.m. Compare that subject line with this informal email subject line: Upcoming Meeting Notice that the first subject line is more informative and complete. The informal subject line, sent to someone you know well, just barely touches on the topic. Salutation The salutation directly addresses the person you're sending the email to. It's always used in formal email messages, but sometimes skipped in informal messages. Here are some examples of formal and informal salutations: If you're sending the email to a group, address the entire group. Here's an example: Dear Students, If you've got the person's name you want to send the email too, it's proper to use their name along with any title the person has. Here's a sample formal salutation for an individual: Dear Professor Smith, If you don't know the name of the person you're trying to reach, you should make every effort to discover that information. As a last resort, it's okay (but less effective) to address the email to the title of the person you hope to reach. Here's an example of a formal salutation without a name: Dear Human Resources Director, In rare instances where you don't know a person's name or title, it's okay to use this salutation: To whom it may concern, Contrast the formal salutation examples with the following informal salutations: Informal Salutation for a Group Hey Class! Informal Salutation for an Individual Hello Taylor, As you can see, the formal and informal salutations are very different. Introduction The opening of a formal email often requires the sender to introduce themselves. In contrast, informal emails are sent to someone you know and the introduction isn't needed. Here's an example of an opening in a formal email: My name is Jordan Smith. I am the professor of Statistics for XYZ University. This message is for all current students. Body The body of a formal email typically elaborates on the purpose of the email. Elaboration may not be needed in an informal email. Although the body contains detailed information, it's important to write clearly and concisely in a formal email. Remember your reader isn't familiar with you and may not be familiar with your topic. You don't want your email recipient to misunderstand an important point. Closing How you end a formal email is equally important. Since the email closing is the last thing your recipient looks at, your email closing can leave a lasting impression. A good formal email closing also reminds the reader who you are since it should include your full name, contact information, and title (if appropriate). If you can, use a professional signature template for added impact. (Learn more about signature templates in the next section.) In contrast, an email closing may be extremely casual for an informal email. In some instances where the recipient is well known to you, you may even omit the email closing. The most common way to start a formal email closing is with the word \"Sincerely.\" It may be a common closing, but it's also a safe closing. Here's an example of a formal email closing: Sincerely, Jordan SmithProfessor of Statistics, XYZ College[Email address goes here][Phone number goes here] Formatting and Structuring a Formal Email While many informal emails are unstructured, how you format and structure your formal email is important. At a minimum, a formal email should contain all of the following elements: Subject line. Be specific, but concise. Many experts agree that the ideal subject line is six to ten words long.Salutation. Address the recipient by name, if possible. Use honorifics, as appropriate. For example, write Dear Professor Smith, not Hey.Body text. This section explains the main message of the email. For a formal email, use proper grammar and complete sentences.Signature. Your email closing should be formal, not informal. Use your first and last name. If you're writing on behalf of an organization and you know the title of the person you're sending the email to, use it.",
