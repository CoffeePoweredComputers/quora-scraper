It can be an essay, dissertation, assignment, report, reflective, dissertation proposal, literature review, etc.After that, you choose the level and the grade you want.Usually, there are five levels: A LevelNVQHNDUndergraduateMastersAnd there is A or B grade. 3. After you choose your level and grade, you have to choose your word count. The more words you need in your essay the more you pay for your essay. 4. In the end, you will get the price for the service you are ordering. Then you can choose if you want work to be delivered in 5 days, 7 days or 14 days. If you want your essay to be done quicker you are obliged to pay more. For example: If you want your essay to be finished in 5 days you will have to pay \u00a3115. If you want to be finished in 14 days you will have to pay \u00a3105. This example is taken from UK Writers Hub\u2019s site. I have been using their services for some time now. ",

            "answer_text": "As soon as you share your topic and place your order (aka pay the money), your topic and anything else you share as requirements will be forwarded by the essay writing company to a freelance writer. That freelancer won\u2019t receive a great share of the money you are paying, so he or she has to be quick in writing. Some freelancers are really good and can deliver a great essay without plagiarism, but some just copy/paste from wikipedia or some other less credible websource, then do a bit of re-writing to avoid plagiarism and send your essay back to start working on the next one. So if you\u2019re wondering whether you should contract such a service: my advice is to do all that yourself - it won\u2019t take too long. Or even better: do your own research and write the thing yourself. You will learn more and don\u2019t rely on an overworked and underpaid freelancer. If you are really unsure on how to write, ask your professor and/or take an online course about academic writing. That way, you will learn how to do your work and over time you will become good at it. Never avoid an unpleasant thing. Hope this helps - if you have more questions, feel free to reach out. ",
