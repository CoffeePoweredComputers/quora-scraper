There could be a lot more reasons why they declined. Also, you should write back to them asking for feedback.If you are seriously considering starting up, rejection will be a daily occurrence. It will happen so frequently that if every time it happens, you stay still to ask this question, you\u2019ll not be able to do anything else.This, in no way suggests that your idea is great. Here\u2019s a guide you can follow that will quickly help you validate your idea. Cheers, -Y ",
