For some 220 to 280 would be OK. So, what can you do when your essay runs over its word limits? By the way, this is often a task given to authors by their publishers: \u201eCut 10%\u201c. Delete filler words and phrases. Lets us cull the first paragraph of this answer to the absolute minimum \u2014 I am first marking optional words: Can, yes. Should, no. I know teachers who would grade both 249 and 251 words as \u201efailed\u201c. Most consider 240 to 260 as acceptable. For some 220 to 280 would be OK. So, this could be shortened from 32 words to 19, just by deleting the optional words and phrases. 40% of the original text are gone. Now it reads \u201eI know teachers who would grade 249 and 251 words as \u201efailed\u201c. Most consider 240 to 260 as acceptable.\u201c, but it still has the same meaning. Rephrase ideas shorter. \u201eI know teachers who would grade 249 and 251 words as \u201efailed\u201c.\u201c This could be shortened to \u201eSome teachers might fail you for being a single word off\u201c. Another word gained, more than 8%, without sacrificing meaning. Have fun editing! ",

            "answer_text": "No. If the essay goes above 250 words, it is no longer a 250-word essay. This probably sounds facetious, but it really isn't. If a publisher asks for a story to have no more than 5,000 words, odds are, that is all they have space for. Going over the word count will usually lose you the contract. ",
