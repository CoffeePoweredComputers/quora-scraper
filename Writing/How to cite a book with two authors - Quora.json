            "answer_text": "As ever, this will vary depending on the citation standard you\u2019re expected to use. Make sure that you\u2019re using the right one, because otherwise it will get very complicated. In the standard I use, the first author\u2019s surname is reversed (in the bibliography, anyway), while the second one is not. Thus \u201cMisiunas, Romualdas and Rein Taagepera\u201d or \u201cEatwell, Roger and Matthew Goodwin\u201d. Then it\u2019s a case of adding in dates of publication, titles, and the rest of it. ",
