            "answer_text": "When I look back in my memory, the whole Exeter experience is bathed in golden light. It\u2019s a feeling I take wherever I go. I just love it that much. It\u2019s funny to me how we recall the past. When I really think about it, I can recall struggling immensely. Exeter was by no means an easy period in my life, and I remember feeling like I was at the breaking point more than once. I know many classmates that had similar breakdowns at several points in time. Thankfully, most made it through. For what it\u2019s worth, I think all teenagers feel a similar angst at some point in time, and these emotions are normal and part of growing up. Everyone is trying to figure out who they are as a person, who they want to be, and where they want to go. It\u2019s no surprise this comes with growing pains. Despite the struggle, there\u2019s something else that made it all worth it. Everything I am today is because of my dorm. It was a brotherhood I\u2019ll likely never experience again. After living in the same dorm for all four years, I developed an identity and sense of belonging I\u2019d never experienced in my life. There\u2019s something magical that happens late night in a dorm room. Nothing polite and responsible, but still, it\u2019s something that I cherished. I formed bonds with my classmates that I think about to this day. The power of Exeter - and boarding school in general - is it\u2019s ability to expose you to people you otherwise never would have met. I shared experiences with kids whose lives I never would have understood had I not lived with them. Growing up in this environment helped us all find ourselves, and that is the greatest form of education I could have ever hoped to gain. One thing is certain. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without my time spent at Exeter. ",

            "answer_text": "Exeter was my best educational experience ever. The teachers were very good with only one or two exceptions. I could never say that about my professors or Stanford at Yale who were generally much lower quality. The Harkness table honed one\u2019s qualitative skills to a razor\u2019s edge. You will never be afraid of a book or a debate again in life. The students were often wildly interesting. For more so than those at college. I communicate daily with people from Exeter I communicate with exactly one person from Stanford and Yale. It was a great intellectual rite of passage. ",
