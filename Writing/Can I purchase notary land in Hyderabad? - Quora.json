            "answer_text": "As per my knowledge there is no land which is known as notary land. From your question what is being presumed is that you want to purchase a piece of land the transfer deed of which has been notarized. If so then my advise is that you should not. Transfers of property are effected through duly registered sale deeds. The said sale deed attracts non judicial stamp fee and is executed on non judicial stamp papers of the value as prescribed by the state where the property is situated. The same varies from state to state. To be legally effective The sale deed is registered in the office of the Registrar of deeds where property is located. It is brought to your notice that properties cannnot be sold or purchased by notarized documents. Such transfer is not accepted. Yes in some cases the same is acceptable and the said procedure is used as mode of transfer of ownership rights in immovable properties. This is so where the ownership vests in a housing society etc. The ownership remains in the said society whereas the title of ownership is transferred in the name of beneficiaries or purchasers on their becoming members of the said society. In such a case the seller also transfers his membership that he had in the said society and also the property. Thereafter the new owner steps in the shoes of the seller and acquires membership of the said society and by virtue of the said membership gets limited ownership rights of the purchased properties. The rights transferred herein vary as per the constitution and bye laws of the respective society and the same will be applicable to all its members. If this is the issue then you should study the details of the constitution and bye laws of the society etc. and be aware of your rights in respect of which you are spending hard earned money Disclaimer: above is not a legal advise to constitute a client attorney relationship between us. Act as per you personal wisdom as per the existing facts of your case. ",
