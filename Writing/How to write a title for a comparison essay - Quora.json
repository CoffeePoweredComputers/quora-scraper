It gives the reader his/her first impression of the comparison essay\u2019s text. Remember: first impression counts! Grab the reader\u2019s attention There are a lot of tips and techniques to help you in capturing a reader\u2019s interest. You can find some pretty good information in the following articles: How to Grab the Reader's Attention A Proper Introduction Essay Introductions The most common five methods to grab your reader's attention, commonly used by professionals, are the following: Give a brief historical review of your topic for help reader to better understand itStart from a little story or an anecdote, which leads the reader into your topicTry to use a surprising statement \u2013 something disgusting, joyful or even shocking\"Dropping\" the name of a well-known person (celebrity) usually gets the reader's attentionState straight out what your essay is going to be about, simply and clearlyStart from a short background High school students often find it difficult to view their teachers as anything but \"the enemy.\" However, after the first few months of a school year, students learn to appreciate their teachers as individuals with different approaches. Some teachers are \"cool,\" while others are \"tough.\" State the thesis Although Sally Strict & Larry Lax are both respected teachers at our school, their teaching styles and expectations for students differ significantly. While Ms. Strict maintains a highly structured classroom atmosphere to keep her pupils disciplined and motivated, Mr. Lax downplays structure in order to allow his students to push themselves. Point paragraph State the point Finally, Ms. Strict enforces high standards for her students' written work. Provide supporting details She collects homework every day at the beginning of class; to turn it in five minutes late is to turn it in a whole day late. Every piece of writing, whether it is a journal entry or a formal essay, must be typed and stapled. Last but not least, all homework must display a sophisticated level of thinking and writing. Use appropriate transitions Transitions are important in comparison / contrast writing to avoid confusion. Without transitions, the points you are comparing / contrasting may blur into one another. Also, a variety of transitions prevent monotony. For comparison: Like, compared to, similar to, similarly, by analogy, likewise, in the same way, as well, both, too For contrast: Unlike, conversely, on the other hand, however, nevertheless, still, although, while, but, even though, although, despite, yet, regardless, on the one hand \u2026 one the other hand Conclusion The conclusion of a comparison essay is just as important as the introduction. The conclusion seals the comparison essay and tries to close the issue. Conclusion is the last part of the essay that your reader will experience. Summarize the similarities and / or difference of the subjects Thus, Ms. Strict and Mr. Lax both accomplish their goals of motivating their students to do excellent work, though they do so in very different ways: while Ms. Strict emphasizes the high standards she expects everyone can meet, Mr. Lax uses a more personal approach. Emphasize the thesis and say why this topic is important Their success demonstrates the importance of diversity in a school community: different students respond to different teaching styles. So rather than viewing their instructors as a monolithic \"enemy\" intent on making them suffer, students should recognize how they benefit from the variety of ways their teachers inspire them. Finalizing your Work Pay attention that even though your essay is fully written, it still isn\u2019t ready to submission. There are some common and annoying mistakes which may significantly harm your grade.
