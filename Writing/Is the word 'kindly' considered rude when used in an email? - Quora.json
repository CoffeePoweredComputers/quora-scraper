Please, thank you, best wishes,  are words which occur in the same category. If it pleases you, could you make me a cup of tea?I offer you my thanks, for making a lovely cup of tea for me, which you were kind enough you do. Because I think you are kind, would you be able to also get me a biscuit?   'Kindly' is a very good word to use to make people feel good towards you. (not really, but it means that you are engaged in a friendly social interaction). NB: It does not mean that you are trying to fool them by making them think that you are nice when you are not. And it does not mean that you are trying to con them into doing something for you. It is more superficial than that. It is just social nicety.  It is why people shake hands - to show that there are no concealed weapons. Thanking you kindly, best wishes Anila Syed ",

            "answer_text": "Context and culture are both very important here. There is nothing wrong with the word \"kindly\" in itself, but I agree with Dana that using it to make a request can sound awkward and old fashioned. That's fine if I'm reading something that is supposed to be very formal like a letter from my bank. But if someone on Quora sends me a message asking me to kindly do something, it could come off as condescending or snarky. It's also possible (and more likely here on Quora) that the person is not from the United States and instead comes from a culture where very formal speech is more common. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Kindly\" can be an awkward term, especially in email. It has a snarky, sarcastic, old-fashioned sound to it, as in \"Kindly send payment at your earliest convenience\" or \"Kindly refrain from contacting me again\". There is nothing intrinsically negative or rude about the word; the definition is simply \"in a kind manner\". But I think in general it might be better to simply substitute the word \"please\". ",
