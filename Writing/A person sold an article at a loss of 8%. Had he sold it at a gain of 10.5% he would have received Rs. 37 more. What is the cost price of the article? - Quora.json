            "answer_text": "ANSWER: Cost price of the article (Rs) = 200 SOLUTION: Let \u2018x\u2019 be the cost price of the article. Sale price with 8% loss = x-(8/100)x= x-0.08x = x(1\u20130.08) = 0.92 x Had the article been sold with 10.5% gain, then its sale price would be: Sale price= x+ (10.5/100)x = x+0.105x) = x(1+0.105) = 1.105 x As per statement made, 1.105x = 0.92x+37 => 1.105x-0.92x = 37 => 0.185x = 37 => x = 37/0.185 = 200 ",
