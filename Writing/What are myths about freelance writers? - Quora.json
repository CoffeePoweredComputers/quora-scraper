            "answer_text": "Foremost, I agree with everything Robert said below. There are a lot of misconceptions about freelancing, especially if you\u2019re doing it full time. (Bonbons and Price is Right midday on a Monday, anyone? Nope!) When I started my own thought leadership writing consultancy, I couldn\u2019t believe how many people said: \u201cOh, how fun! You get to work from home all the time in your PJs,\u201d or \u201cGreat! Now we can hang out in the middle of the day!\u201d Sure, there are days when you might not see anyone in person and can dress more lax, but I\u2019m constantly on calls and meeting with my clients, servicing them like I\u2019m a big business even though I\u2019m a solopreneur, if you really want to put a label on it. If you freelance, consultant, or any number of other one-person shows, you usually have to work even harder, not to mention handle your own IT, admin, benefits and more. I also keep very regular work hours, often entering my home office at 7:30 or 8am and not leaving it, except to make some lunch or go to a client meeting, until 6p at the minimum. This ensures that I\u2019m available when my clients are working. Some freelancers have different practices and don\u2019t mind working on the weekends if they want to take a Wednesday off, but that likely wouldn\u2019t work for me. Freelancing or consulting are not open gates to freedom and working less. Quite the opposite, it takes great discipline and consistency to thrive. ",

            "answer_text": "Freelance writers live an easy and carefree lifestyle. I still remember thinking this before I started freelancing. I had heard the tales and read the stories of people who worked as a freelancer whilst traveling the world in style- and for many years. Yes, this is possible, (I have done it myself) but it's not easy and the lifestyle is definitely not carefree. Being a freelancer means that you have to make sure you have contracts and clients set up and you have to meet (sometimes unreasonable) deadlines. It's also super easy to end up working when you should be spending time with family or loved ones. So I guess that's another myth: freelance writers have a lot of spare time. ",
