Asking a question publicly, then answering it publicly, somehow gives it a greater reality. It makes it a little more powerful. It makes it a little more real. It confirms one\u2019s view, position or opinion to one\u2019s self. Even if no one else actually reads it. It\u2019s still out there in the world. ",

Some people talk to themselves, or think out loud. I find it slightly distracting, depending upon how animated that activity is, but as I periodically engage in it myself, I don\u2019t really judge it harshly.On Quora. I don\u2019t know, I find the practice self-indulgent in the extreme.",
