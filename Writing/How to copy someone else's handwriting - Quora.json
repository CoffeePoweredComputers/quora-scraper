            "answer_text": "That is a very interesting question. If a person is very good at drawing they can do a passable job of copying the forms of another person\u2019s handwriting\u2014especially if copying an existing passage. But, such a copy is often easy to spot by an astute observer. Handwriting is more than drawn forms. It is made up of motions. To copy someone\u2019s handwriting, especially so that you can write words and sentences where you don\u2019t have an example in the person\u2019s hand, one must be able to imitate the manner in which the person writes. To copy someone\u2019s handwriting I certainly analyze the way in which the person forms particular letters and letter connections. I look at the way they cross their t\u2019s and how high their ascending letters go and how far below the line their descending letters are. But I also try to form my hand in the manner I guess that that person writes. In addition I position my hand and the paper so that the angle of the letters and the slant of the line of writing (many people do not write in a perfectly horizontal fashion) match that of the writer. Finally, I pay attention to subtleties such as how much pressure the person uses when writing, how often their pen or pencil skips or skates along the page. All in all I am attempting to form my hand and my method of motion to match as closely as possible to that of the person whose handwriting I am trying to duplicate. Having explained all this, I am more successful with some people\u2019s handwriting than others. I find that familiarity with a person and their writing helps. ",
