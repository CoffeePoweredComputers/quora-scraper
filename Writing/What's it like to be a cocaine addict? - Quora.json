            "answer_text": "For me, personally? It started out fun. I was hanging out with a crowd of peculiar people in Little Five Points, which was (then) the freaky area of Atlanta. And we used to inject it. I used to do drugs once a month, which became once every two weeks, which became every week. And by then, I realised I was an addict and wanted to stop. And I couldn't. Every week, after doing drugs, I would feel like shit and be out of cash. I'd tell myself, \"Enough. No more.\" Three days later, I'd want more. Another two days after that, my skin would begin tingling and I'd be unable to stop thinking about it. A day after that, I'd give in. And the cycle began again ... until I started going to a Twelve-Step program. With some help, I was able to stop using. The main difference between me and others is that I was able to hold out for a week. Some people cannot survive a day without cocaine. Their story would be like mine ... only much more so. What all addicts will have in common is: if we can be honest, we will admit that doing cocaine is idiotic. The high is too short; the rotten feeling afterwards lasts too long. We get less and less out of each high, and yet we keep doing it. We know that the more we binge, the more miserable we will be ... and we cannot stop. Short answer? NOT WORTH IT! ",

If it\u2019s illegal, there are good reasons for it. The main reason is illegal drugs destroy life. Instead of using the money on illegal drugs that are going to kill them in slow motion in the most painful way, there are thousand of other things to enjoy in life. If they want to become a home owner, they can save that money up for down payment. If they like car, they can save that money up for their dream car. If they like food, there are all kinds of delicious food to try. If they like to travel, they can save that money to travel to their dream destination. If they like jewelry, they can save up the money for the diamond, gold, jade, etc. There are thousand and thousand of great things to enjoy. Why do they have to use illegal drugs that going to kill them in slow motion in the most painful way? Just say NO and stay away from drugs. ",
