            "answer_text": "I am not the greatest writer in the world but I have seen continual improvement in my writing over the last 5 years on Quora. Here are my Ten Commandments of writing on Quora. I. Thou shalt write as frequently as possible and as much as possible. The more you do anything the better you will get at it. So write as much as you can. II. Thou shalt pretend your writing is golden. If you let the negative voice in your head take over while writing you will never finish anything. Only come back to edit once you have put everything down on paper\u2026 or computer screen. And you should wait a little while before editing; it will make you less emotional about your writing. III. Thou shalt look over your old writing after you have forgotten about it. This is the time to critique it and figure out what you can do better. For some reason if I have not read something I wrote in over a year I feel like I am reading a stranger's writing. I sometimes even enjoy what I wrote! IV. Thou shalt focus on your audience. You should not be writing for yourself; writing is to communicate with others. If you want to write to please yourself than improvement of writing doesn't matter too much anyway. It's just like laughing at your own jokes. V. Thou shalt set writing challenges for yourself. Do a Quora post where you use alliteration. Or make a list (this is what I am doing) or write from a different perspective. Play writing games to challenge your chops and find out what works! VI. Thou shalt focus on good results. I had a Ten Commandsments of traveling the USA and it got over 100K views. I found that style of writing gets attention and positive reactions from my audience. So I do it on occasion. VII. Thou shalt answer the question. If someone asks if Donald Trump is from New York City you should not go on a rant about how you don't like Trump; just answer the question. If someone asks a question about religion don\u2019t tell them how there is no God; just answer the question. VIII. Thou shalt stop writing when the question is answered. Some questions require a lot of time and effort to properly answer while others only need a paragraph. Keep in mind Quora frowns on one sentence answers; so make it last a paragraph. I also think the principle of stopping once the question is answered applies to many other forms of writing. Don't make something long to make it long and don't make something short when it requires more depth. IX. Thou shalt remember that upvotes are not the only thing that matters. Just because your answer did not go viral does not mean it's not wonderful. And remember there are plenty of viral answers on Quora that are crap. Focus on helping the person who asked the question. X. Thou shalt have fun. Use your creativity, and answer questions that give you a sense of curiosity, joy and wonder. Help people and make a difference. This will motivate your writing and make you strive to be better. A little bit of passion goes a long ways and a lot of passion is dynamite! ",

            "answer_text": "I thought I was a terrific writer in high school. When I reached college, my Shakespeare professor told me I had a poor grasp of idiom and asked how long I had been away from the old country. In grad school, I couldn't pass the exam to opt out of the basic writing course. Now, I write for a living. A book I wrote was named an award-winning finalist for a national book award. My newsletter won an award for publication excellence. I've published poetry and received a \"Bravo\" from a MacArthur Fellow (a genius award winner). I don't know how people become good writers, in general. But I can tell you how I became a good writer in two genres - exposition and poetry. And they involve two different paths. The path to becoming a good writer of exposition (writing that explains things) was pretty brief and direct. When I flunked the writing test in grad school (business school, not English), I was encouraged to take a class in writing taught by a PhD in psycholinguistics. I learned to write clearly and effectively in those three months. Here's what we did. We read a piece of writing, usually something fairly technical. Then we wrote a letter or factual document about it. Then we sat down with someone unfamiliar with the material and taped them as they read it aloud. We called this a \"psycholinguistic protocol\", or for us, just \"the Protocol\". As the subject read our writing, they also described the experience of trying to understand it -   \"it was a tragedy, terrible functioning\", \"OK, I thought I had it. I get what a tragedy is. But terrible functioning? Are you referring to the tragedy or to how the hammer worked?\"   And like that. Through the whole document. Then we rewrote the document. And sat down with another subject and another, until we could get the document as clear as possible. Strunk and White was our bible. Here's the nut of what I learned. Write shorter sentences. Write declarative sentences. The easiest thing to parse, from the standpoint of pure understanding, is a simple, declarative sentence. See spot run. Run spot run.  I immediately became the editor for every group project I was on. I would routinely sit down with a colleague's writing and cut the sentences into thirds. Most bad writing, if it's exposition, tries to cram too many thoughts into one sentence. I found that I could break most sentences into two or three. Then, I'd make most into declarative sentences. You leave in a few clauses here and there to vary the pace, create a rhythm, and keep interest. So it doesn't sound like a robot generated them. Those lessons won me awards. The poetry was an entirely different experience. I don't know why I wanted to write poetry. I started on a dare and loved it. Maybe because the exposition is pretty dry. I was remarkably bad when I started. I was the caricature of a bad poet. I actually wrote a poem that featured a line about beating a pike into a sword. That's not only a poor rip off of a worn cliche, it's also nonsensical. If you have a pike, why go to the trouble of beating it into a sword?  I asked my poetry mentor (Robert McNamara at Univ. of Washington, who is just terrific) whether he thought I could be a good poet. \"First, write for 5 years,\" he said, \"then ask me again,\"  And that turned out to be the process. I did eventually get published on a small scale. And I have written poems that really good writers have called really good. But it took me hundreds or thousands of hours of working. Robert taught me to pick up a book by a poet I liked, read for an hour or two to get filled up with it. Then, try to write like that poet.  I did that with book after book after book. Writing poems in the style of... Supposedly that's how St. Augustine wrote his great tracts on the bible. He said, \"read the bible until you are filled up with it, then the words will come.\" I don't have better advice than that. Find a style you like. Read as much of that author as you can get your hands on, until you are filled up with it. Then write. And have someone who is a good writer critique what you've written. Then repeat. Edit:I remembered that the MacArthur Fellow I studied with (Rick Kenney, as great a guy as he is a great poet) also had a seminal exercise we did to really grok poetry. It was stunning. Here's a link to the description: Tim Dawes's answer to If there are only a limited number of word combinations, and thoughts are best expressed in only a certain number of those combinations, how can I learn to make more original word choices, when it seems like so many necessary phrases have been used already?
