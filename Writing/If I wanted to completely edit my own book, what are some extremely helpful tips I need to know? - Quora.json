            "answer_text": "Well, there are different levels/stages of copy-editing. I'll assume you want to go through all of them because you of course want a finished product. So the levels/stages are light editing (AKA baseline editing), medium editing and heavy editing. It's basically a scale from most technical aspects to least. Level 1 is purely about identifying issues with the most basic units of meaning, namely: letters, punctuation marks and words. Issues like spelling, (possibly) legibility, punctuation, word choice etc. You can find a PDF online about copyediting symbols so you have a controlled and consistent code for flagging each issue. Level 2 is where you now start to look at the logic of your content. So grammar, sentence structure, phraseology, register, citation etc. Level 3 is even more broad. You start to lean towards easthetic presentation and layout. So maybe shortening things, lengthening others, separating etc. PS: When it comes to the first two levels, my lecturer would always say \u201cRead backwards for spelling, and forward for logic.\u201d So read backwards during level 1 and forwards during level 2. This is because your mind can play tricks on you. If you instead read forward while looking for spelling mistakes for example, you might miss one because it's enveloped in a sentence whose logic you approve of. So the logic can \u201chide\u201d the spelling mistake and you'll say to yourself unconsciously \u201cOh this sentence makes sense,\u201d and miss the spelling mistake. But reading backwards forces you to have regard for each individual word because there is no logic to distract you in a backward sentence. Lastly, take a break. Read other things in between. Come back with fresh eyes after a couple of days. You'll be surprised how much detail you can miss due to fatigue and repetition. Especially if the text is long form. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Your first draft of your manuscript is not your last draft. Neither is your second, third, or even your fourth draft! It will go through multiple rounds or edits, even before you hand it over to a professional editor (which I strongly suggest doing). Below are a few self-editing tips to help you get through the often-dreaded self-editing process. Utilize Microsoft Word\u2019s grammar and spelling tools first. This will eliminate a lot of errors that you may not realize are errors. Word also gives grammar tips which can be helpful. Keep in mind, it is a computer and isn\u2019t perfect. Some errors that come up, you may just need to ignore. You can also check readability statistics for your document including the grade level. (Look to the internet on how to use these tools.) Check out Grammerly. This program can help you track down, even more, issues than Microsoft Word can find. You should not replace a professional editor with Grammarly (a human is always better than computer algorithm), but it will help you find problems that you have missed. Certain words we use in writing are not necessary. Create a list of unnecessary words, such as that, just, then, really, very, etc. Search your document to see if you can get rid of any unnecessary words. Instead of doing all these things what you can do is get in touch with any leading publishing company like BecomeShakespeare and get professional help from them.\" ",
