            "answer_text": "By getting on with it. At my absolute most productive, I could probably do 1,000 words in an hour on my thesis. I\u2019d rather not have to, since it\u2019s quite tiring to do that much thinking as well as typing, but it\u2019s something I could do given the need and the opportunity. Pretty sure I normally end up getting about 750 words in an hour if I\u2019m working hard at it, so the extra 250 shouldn\u2019t be impossible. The trick I\u2019ve used when typing a lot in a short time is to basically shut up and keep typing. I don\u2019t stop to check for references or the exact quotes that I\u2019m after, I just keep going. The result is something like \u201cAs Smith has argued, \u201c[INSERT SMITH QUOTE ABOUT ELECTION]\u201d in places, and if I\u2019m desperately unlucky it can sometimes take me 15 minutes or more to find what Smith\u2019s quote actually was (particularly if it turns out it was Jones\u2019 words I wanted, rather than Smith\u2019s at all\u2026), but I push past that and just keep going. Once the timer goes off to signal that I have a break, I stop. Doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m in the middle of a sentence or a paragraph (in fact, I\u2019ve read something recently suggesting that it\u2019s better to be in the middle of a sentence, since you can pick up the train of thought more easily when you start again). At a separate time, I then go back over what I\u2019ve written. Odds are that I\u2019ll have repeated myself a bit, left a few sentence fragments lying around, and probably introduced some of my arguments in a less sensible order than I should have done, but that\u2019s what editing is about. The object of the exercise when writing so-many words is first and foremost to write them. Making them the best possible words is the next step. ",

You make yourself a list of bullet points on a scrap of paper. This serves as your outline. Spend another 1\u20132 minutes prepping in your head and then start speaking. Dragon is good software but you can also use Otter Voice Meeting Notes or Google docs just as easily. Speak clearly and don't get mentally tangled if you mess up. Once you're finished with that section do a quick read through and correct any errors. Having grammarly or pro writing aid helps pick up context errors but good old human eyeballs work best. One of my guys clocked close to 2000 words per hour once he practiced enough. 1800 maybe? That's a lot of words in an hour. ",
