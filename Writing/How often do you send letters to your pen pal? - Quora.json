            "answer_text": "If you are referring to pen on paper letters, very rarely. I may write a letter to an aunt once or twice a year, but that's all. Excuses? I have poor penmanship and when I start writing, I don't pay attention to ensure it is legible. On the other hand, I have a few pen pals who I may write letter length email to every day, some once a week, and the respond the same day. The letters are legible, but there are a few spelling errors. I'm just as pleased to receive an email letter as one delivered through the Postal service. ",
