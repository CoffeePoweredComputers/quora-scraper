            "answer_text": "What is your X factor? What is the one thing that makes you different from every other stationary and Xerox business in the world? Write it down. You\u2019ll need it later. A great name can help you build your credibility and improve your recognition. All this combined can result in more sales and bigger profits. And who doesn\u2019t want bigger profits at the end of the day? If you\u2019re like most people you tried to figure out the name of your next brand, product, book etc. by yourself. By doing that you realized two important things: Brainstorming name ideas is hard as hellFinding a name that isn\u2019t already taken is impossible.Maybe you\u2019re not a creative person, or maybe you work in a monotone niche where no one tries to stand out with their name. But in reality, naming a business isn\u2019t hard. It shouldn\u2019t be hard. If you know what you\u2019re doing. So, to make the most out of your business name, you need to create a name that stands out but remains somewhat relevant to your industry. Sound hard, doesn\u2019t it? Unfortunately, there\u2019s no magic formula when it comes to brainstorming names. Just suggestions and tips. Here\u2019s an easy recipe you can try: Take the list of things that make you different. The one I asked you to create.Look at the words and things on the list.Now think of things that could represents your X factor.Pick nouns if possible.And remember, a good name evokes a desired emotion. At least it should. Does that sound like too much work? You can always hire a professional namer to do all of this for you. If you go with a professional namer like me, you don\u2019t have to worry about names anymore. It also means that you can focus on important parts of your business and you don\u2019t have to waste your time doing trademark checks. ",

So what you have left to say is that it\u2019s a digital printing business or more inaccurately a photocopying business. (Don\u2019t mind me, I\u2019m something of a word-meaning snob. I bristle when people say \u201chot water heater\u201d. If it\u2019s already hot, why heat it?) ",
