For me, the goal is to give just enough description for the reader\u2019s imagination to figure out where we are, and then leave the rest of the details to them. If there are elements there that are critical to the story I will mention them, but I want my reader to be involved in creating the story that pulls them in, rather than just \u201creading\u201d my story. If the action is taking place in a crowded coffee shop, I might mention there were no empty seats and the noise level was high\u2026but I\u2019ll let my reader decide how many people there are, what the tables look like, what colors things are, and the rest. If I can engage their imagination in creating the story with me, we both win! Good luck! ",
