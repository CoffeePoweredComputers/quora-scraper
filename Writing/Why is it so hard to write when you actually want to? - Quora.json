            "answer_text": "The answer to this isn't simple. In fact, I believe there is no end of answers. I love writing. But when it comes to inspiration I frequently find myself staring at a blank page.. and then Facebook, and then Instagram. It can take hours before I'm ready to sit down and write something worth reading. So why is it so hard to write when I actually want to dedicate some time and compose? It's difficult because we live in a world chock-full of distractions. This is just one answer to the problem, unfortunately. Matter of fact, I am currently (trying) to write while watching t.v. I find myself reading for hours and hours. Although, once I sit down to write even a simple poem, I find myself distraught. I've done everything from locking myself in my room with noise-canceling headphones to surrounding myself with everything possible to distract me (to see if it will kick start any inspiration.)  Sometimes, writing just has to come to you. I know. I know, World's biggest cliche. Sorry to disappoint but the answer isn't straightforward by any means. But at least we can all agree that writing is gratifying when it actually happens! ",

            "answer_text": "In a single line, because writing is a free bird and it hates a single wheat grain on its feather even if it will sattiate its hunger. If we talk about studies, you actually wants to study, it helps you. Talk about cooking, you give your maximum focus, it becomes your artillery. Talk about coding, you learn all the syntax and actually give it a try, it emerges with flying colors. Talk about guitar, you learn it once, you will kill it whole your life. Well, why not writing? Best writers have written award winning bestsellers randomly sitting on their porch watching Netflix or in similar environment. Some rare people find touch in their writings with the help of nature. Some make it work with their pain and suffering. Some geniuses trying to impress their crush write their first poem. Let's say writing is not difficult. It just stays with different situations. It has its own terms and conditions. A bird that does not want any weight of trials or efforts. It just comes randomly to a free mind. My best recommendation is to keep your mind free , don't think about your topic, just feel your life and you will write. ",
