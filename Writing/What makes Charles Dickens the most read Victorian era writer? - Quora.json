            "answer_text": "Charles Dickens, unlike many of his literary contemporaries grew up in poverty unlike many of his literary contemporaries who came from the middle classes and upper classes. He had a \u201clived experience\u201d of what it meant to be poor. He was an author who concerned himself with the lives of poor people and recognized them as people, something that had not previously been written about very much. Usually writers concerned themselves with the lives of the upper classes. His compassion for his characters shines through. For probably the first time ever, a sense of the real lives of the poor became subject matter for books rather than just writing about the wealthy in society. Perhaps he could also be considered among the first writer who gave us social documentation and conducted any real research into the lives of the poor in England which was starting to feel the results of the Industrial revolution. He could be considered among the first of the social researchers. His work would have had a tremendous impact on the upper classes who were finally seeing the poor as real people and many set about improving the lot of the neglected in society. One of the greatest fears the poor had, including Charles Dickens when he was younger, was to end up in the \u201cpoor houses\u201d as so many did. It was a mark of humiliation and shame. ",

            "answer_text": "Is he? The most read I mean? I think HG Wells could throw his hat into the ring for this competition \u2026 admittedly he was only 4 when Dickens died, but they are both Victorian era. Both are still popular today and both have had movies made out of their books (I think HG takes the box office, but that\u2019s not the question \u2026) For the rest of this I\u2019m going to ignore HG entirely \u2026 I\u2019m not saying he wasn\u2019t the most read, but how do we know who read what in those days? I\u2019m sure that someone has done the research, but I\u2019d like a citation in order to see for myself. There were a lot of books published and read at the time, and most of them, while popular for a season, just sank into the mire of mediocrity, so we are not aware of them today. I\u2019m quite happy to accept that he\u2019s the most popular Victorian era novelist today, and maybe that is what you meant? Why was/is he so popular? His books were written for the common man. Most of his peers wrote for the middle/upper classes. He mixed drama, comedy, satire and social commentary in his stories effortlessly. His use of the English language was both superb and yet simple (in comparison to his peers), making his books \u201ceasy reading\u201d. If you do a bit of research and dig up his competition (Google is your friend), you realise that while some of them rivalled him in the quality of their writing, very few of them were as prolific. I\u2019m not sure of the true count, but he definitely had over 60 books published (not all fiction). Because of this he was continually in the public\u2019s consciousness and therefore became well known by repeated exposure. I think only Anthony Trollope was more prolific, and yet he is not nearly as well known to the general public. Dickens wrote in the early half of the Victorian era, so a lot of the other Victorian era authors had read him, and I\u2019m sure his writing influenced theirs. To put Dickens, Trollope & Wells in context (remember the 60+ books?), other well known and popular Victoria era authors were: The 3 Bronte sisters (7 novels, between them)Mary Shelley (7 novels, of which only Frankenstein is well known)Elizabeth Gaskell (5 novels + numerous short stories and collections)George Eliot [Mary Anne Evans] (7 novels)Robert Louis Stevenson (13 novels + short stories)Lewis Carroll [Charles Lutwidge Dodgson ] (29 works listed on Wikipedia, about 1/2 are non-fiction and about 1/4 are poetry)Thomas Hardy (17 novels + short stories)Oscar Wilde (I can\u2019t find a reliable count, but I\u2019m going to put it at just under 20)William Thackeray (28 books, mostly novels)I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve left some out, but can\u2019t think who at the moment (and yes, I know I haven\u2019t listed poets. Tough \u2026 Charles Dickens was known for his prose, so that is what I concentrated on.) Conclusion: Until HG Wells came along, Charles Dickens was the \u201cmost read\u201d simply because he produced so many high quality books, simple, really. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know that he was. Author G W M Reynolds who edited his own periodical Reynolds Miscellany and wrote the hugely successful Mysteries of the Court of London which was partially based on the Mysteries of Paris by Eugene Sue, who also wrote The Wandering Jew outsold any of the periodicals that Dickens was associated with, and that's just example. Today they are largely forgotten. A large reason for his continued popularity is that he didn't rest on his laurels. A few months after the last instalment was in print, the whole novel would be published in book form and attract even more readers. On each new edition, he would edit them himself, and make \u201cimprovements\u201d, so that each new edition would be the definitive one, and everybody would want to update. Then in later life, he made a lot of money on his public speaking tours in England and America and the complete works starting coming out. This included not only his novels, but also minor works like Holiday Romance and A Child's History of England that he had written for his children, Pictures of Italy and Amerian Notes and The Uncommercial Traveller, a collection of his best essays, so once again the reader would need to update. And there were so many different editions available for every kind of purse and taste. Clothbound editions, cheap editions, you name it. On top of all that, you could also buy bound editions of the periodicals in six monthly or yearly sets, as well as in monthly or weekly instalments, so he really catered to every taste. It was all about the marketing. He started off as a court reporter and then became an editor before he started writing novels, and that put him in good stead. ",

            "answer_text": "Well Dickens introduced the novel in monthly instalments for a shilling a month in the 1850s and so had a captive audience....there were usually 20 monthly parts and you stuck them together and voila, you had a novel at the end f it. That is the reason novels of the Victorian period sometimes go on and on. Before that there were triple-deckers = novels in 3 parts and Mudie's travelling libraries carted them around all the nooks and crannies of the UK...There was also Dickens; famous \"Household Words \"....full of short stories and adverts...mind you written in one hit and one of Dickens' best novellas, was \"A Christmas Carol\" of 1841 or thereabouts. ..an excellent tale of moral philanthropy and memorable characters and always with the suffering child, male or female....Dickens the youngster possibly? Coming at your readers from all angles ....and giving public readings of a theatrical nature.....Mr D had the literary world sewn up! ",

Says who?

            "answer_text": "His primary gift was as a storyteller, and in this he has no equals. Dickens wrote about all levels of society except the very highest. One of his failures is his inability to write convincing female characters. There are some grotesque ones like Mrs. Gamp, and pathetic victims like Little Nell, but no real ones, with the exception of Lady Deadlock in Bleak House. Anthony Trollope, an only slightly less gifted writer, wrote wonderfully realized women. Dickens couldn\u2019t have created Lizzie Eustace, in the Eustace Diamonds, if you stuck a gun in his ribs. But altogether, an unquestionably great writer. ",
