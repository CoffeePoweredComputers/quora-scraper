            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do I write a book in an essay?\u201d Please, if you are asked to write an essay, do not turn it into a book. If you are meant to write about a book in an essay, look more carefully at the assignment description. What exactly is your instructor asking you to write? How much creative latitude do you have, which points are you required to make? Is this a standard sort of book report, or a pr\u00e9cis, or some other sort of writing assignment that focuses on a certain book? Fulfill the requirements of the assignment, please. If you are meant to cite a book in an essay, the citation format will depend on which style guide your school or university uses. Look up that format on the internet and find examples of \u201cin-text citations\u201d or \u201creferences\u201d or \u201cworks cited\u201d and see how that style guide asks you to craft your citations in the text and your sources listed in a separate section at the end of the essay. This separate section might be called a bibliography, a list of sources, a list of references, a \u201cworks cited section,\u201d a \u201creferences section,\u201d or something similar. Follow the format your instructor wants you to use. (Note that some universities have their own style guide that they want you to follow! Check your syllabus to find out.) I hope this is helpful. If I have misunderstood your question, please post a clarification in a comment below! ",
