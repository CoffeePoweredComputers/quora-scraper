            "answer_text": "If you have measuring spoons, there are 16 tablespoons or 48 teaspoons in a cup. Or if you have bar tending equipment, you probably have something that holds one ounce. Or, a standard coffee scoop is one ounce. There are 8 ounces in a cup. Very experienced cooks (and to a lesser extent, bakers) can measure by \u201ceyeball\u201d but I don\u2019t recommend this until you have made the same recipe or measured the same ingredients many times. For example, I can \u201ceyeball\u201d a teaspoon or half teaspoon of salt. But I don\u2019t even try to guess at a half cup of flour, I measure it. If you know the capacity of a measuring vessel, it\u2019s not too hard to do the math for measuring larger amounts. ",

            "answer_text": "You can use a scale if you know the weight of what you are measuring. Remember that a cup of one food isn\u2019t equal to the weight of a cup of another. You can also create your own measuring cup using known weights or measurements (such as having a 750 ml and a 1000 ml water bottle). Empty that amount into another bottle and mark the line where it ends up. Lastly, for some recipes which are ratio based, just use any cup or bowl, as long as you still keep the ratio (ex 2 parts water 1 part chocolate can become 2 Starbucks tall cups water, a Starbucks tall cup chocolate).
