            "answer_text": "Most of the topics and preparatory articles for GRE talks about mostly the Verbal and Quant sections only. However the final section of the GRE - Analytical Writing also plays a vital role towards your GRE scores. If you are applying for a Masters program which involves more use of your language skills over your problem solving skills then the Analytical writing score will influence your admissions in the university of your preference. The first step to performing well in the writing section is to immediately develop a reading habit and become a voracious reader. You can start reading about all topics and read everything you can get your hands on. This helps you get accustomed to the various styles of writing and you are familiar with the structure of essays. You will become more confident as you will now have improved knowledge on a wide range of topics. Additionally you could check some essays written by candidates who have obtained a high score on their GRE Analytical Writing. You will be aware of which components to use and how to implement the same. Finally you must practice writing on a few topics before the actual exam and self evaluate yourself. This way you will be able to recognize which areas you can improve on and correspondingly prepare. All the Best! ",

            "answer_text": "In preparing for GRE\u2019s it\u2019s really helpful to look at past GRE tests. These books are commonly available pretty cheaply online, used. Look at the essay questions and try to answer them in a short amount of time, as if you were actually taking the GRE\u2019s. Do a number of such essays, all in one sitting, as if you were in a testing environment. Then, a day or a week later, go back and look at your answers. Read them out loud so you really hear them and see how the logic flows. Then edit them carefully, improving spelling, grammar, structure, and content. Do this for all the essays you wrote. Then go back and repeat the whole process. This will help you develop the skills to write well under time pressure. Your essays need to be well-structured, evidence based, and logically flowing so you make clear, concise, convincing points. ",
