            "answer_text": "I have been on and off blogging for past eight years. I started with what you may say a naive blog and have grown to learn many things since then. I am not yet a popular blogger by any means. My latest blog which I started in March 2018, along with a friend gets about 12k-20k page hits every month. Here are two cents from my experience with blogging, Everything that had to be written, has already been written on the internet. The Niche There exists no niche market to blog about on the internet. You name a topic and there is already someone popular writing about it. Here are some questions you need to ask instead. What topics do I know about? Can I write about any of them?Look up for popular blogs on the internet regarding the same topic. Does your opinion or experiences differ from what\u2019s been already written?How does your knowledge help those reading? Does your blog add value to the overall equation?Picking the topic you know well about rather than a niche would help you express yourself better and also help those seeking to know more about the topic. Assuming that you have a topic or topics to write about, we move on. Technical Expertise If you sound with web development and know about how to host your blog, skip this step. Wordpress or Blogger?: Wordpress and Blogger provide free hosting for your blog. I would not go into the details, as having *.wordpress.com or *.blogspot.com in your domain name won\u2019t give you much credibility. Check out my first blog from about eight years ago, Its My Life (Please do not laugh).Buy a domain: Buy a domain with a proper name that relates to your topic. The domain would cost you a few dollars for the first year and it is a great way to get started. If the blog does not work out, you can let go the domain after the first year.Hosting: This decision can make or break your blog. Slow websites have pissed off more people than Donald Trump! A slow website is also enemy of SEO. So choose a good host. Start with shared hosting and gradually migrate to cloud hosting. Both of which can be cheap at a couple of dollars to five dollars a month. Don\u2019t go rogue with AWS or alike with dedicated cloud servers yet. They will drain your money for infrastructure that you do not need.CMS: Your content management system is another important thing you need to think over. Wordpress is a good choice, to begin with. It provides easy to use interface so that you can focus on writing rather than managing the website.Now that you have a website up and running. Here are the next steps. Writing: Start writing ASAP. Write in a simple and uncomplicated language. Make sure you do not have any grammatical or spelling mistakes. Use Grammarly. I can\u2019t tell you how many embarrassing mistakes Grammarly has saved me from, including correcting the word \u2018embarrassing\u2019. Organize your content properly. Consult a friend to read through if necessary.Email Subscription: Get a plugin on WordPress to collect the email addresses of those who wish to subscribe to your blog. You\u2019ll thank me later.Spread the word: Once you have written four to five blog posts. Post your blog post on your Facebook feed. Ask your friends to share the blog post if they can relate to it. Find the topics that relate to your blog on Quora and answer those question, leave a link to your blog post (Only if it adds value to your answer by providing more information).Going Forward I\u2019ll skip some steps. The answers would be too overwhelming otherwise. I\u2019ll write a step-by-step blog someday about it. Follow me, to keep updated. On to few closing points. SEO: Invest in Yoast SEO premium plan and understand how to work Google Search Console and Bing Webmasters Tool.AMP: Accelerated Mobile Pages are the quick loading mobile web pages that are becoming defacto now. Adopting AMP will boost your search ranking and also help to load the website quickly.Monetize?: If you do plan to monetize your website, read and understand the policies of your ad provider. It took me getting banned three times to finally understand how to make the best of AdSense publisher account. Keep your ads to a minimum in the beginning. NO POPUP ADS!Analytics: Sign-up for Google Analytics. It provides you with very useful insight into demographics, behavior, and acquisition. Where are people coming from? What are they reading? How long are they staying? This will help you plan your future posts.Build a community: Build a community around your blog. The easiest way is to start a facebook group, a more complicated way to start a forum.SSL: The most important of all! The \u2018https://\u2019 is very important in today's privacy-obsessed world. Use free SSL providers like Let\u2019s Encrypt to secure your website.If it helps, here is the link to our blog, The Honest Blog. The content on the blog is unrelated to this answer, but it might help you with planning your own blog. ",

            "answer_text": "Blogging, content marketing, and writing in general is one of the best things you can do to build your own personal brand. I got into writing because it's a great way to sell more of what you are good at.  Here is how I got into blogging: Consume A-grade content  The best part about the web is you can literally learn from the best for free. When I got started, I read some of my favorite writers (and friends now) such as Neil Patel, Ramit Sethi, James Altucher, John Rampton, Murray Newlands, and many many more. Learn HOW they write, what format they use, word choice, etc. Take time to really grasp how they do it.  2. Write about what you are passionate about Once you've learned how the best people in the industry write, it is now time to start writing! I use Wordpress where there are a ton of free templates that can help get you started. In fact, it would take you less than 1 hour to set one up. My biggest suggestion is write what you are good at and what you are passionate about. In my case, I stick to content marketing, social media, PR, and growth. Focus on informing others about what you are all about, not selling what you do.  3. Connect with and help other bloggers Once you've admired and learned from the best, tried writing a few posts, it's now time to reach out.  I use Content Marketer .io to help with my outreach, but first reach out to people that are in your domain that will understand what you are writing about. Here's an example of what to say: Dear blogger, I've been a huge fan of your content, and especially loved the piece on B2B Marketing for Ecommerce companies.  I recently wrote a piece on B2C Marketing and would love your feedback to learn how I can make it better. Thanks, Chirag From here, you will most likely here back from them if they aren't too prolific and give you honest feedback. Take it. And make your posts better. I use products like Qualaroo to ask my community directly what would be interesting topics or things they are struggling with for me to write.   4.Syndicate across other columns  The last step is to start writing for larger publications or audiences so you can increase the reach of your message. My go to way to this is my reaching out to bloggers in my domain that have a sizable audience. You have to be careful because if you are writing a great post you don't want to post to a website that only gets 100 page views a month. Ideally you want to start writing for Inc, Forbes, Entrepreneur, Huffington Post, etc. in order to spread the message behind your writing and continually build your brand.  ",
