            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Cordelia already provided a fairly comprehensive list; I\u2019ll complement with a few more words that may be common/handy. These were previously mentioned: \u6b7b\u306c\uff1ato die (shinu)\u6b7b\u306d\uff1aDie! (shine) - as in an imperative\u6b7b\u4eba\uff1adead person (shinin)\u6b7b\u8005\uff1aone who is dead (shisha) - used in news articles, etc; not personal\u6b89\u6b7b\uff1amartyrdom (junshi)Some common words: \u6b7b\uff1adeath (shi) - e.g. \u6b7b\u306e\u6050\u6016\uff08\u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\uff09/ fear of death\u6b7b\u56e0\uff1acause of death (shiin)\u6b7b\u9ab8\uff1aa corpse; a cadaver; a carcass (shigai) - usually for animals\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff1adeath (shibou) - e.g. \u6b7b\u4ea1\u3059\u308b = to die\u6b7b\u4ea1\u8a3a\u65ad\u66f8\uff1aa death certificate (shibou shindansho)\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5e83\u544a\uff1aan obituary (shibou koukoku)Some interesting/related words: \u6b7b\u89d2\uff1aa blind spot (shikaku) - written \u201cdead angle\u201d\u72ac\u6b7b\u306b\uff1ato die in vain (inujini) - written \u201cdie like a dog\u201de.g. \u5f7c\uff08\u304b\u308c\uff09\u306f\u72ac\u6b7b\u306b\u3057\u305f\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044 / He didn\u2019t die for nothing.\u81ea\u6bba\uff1asuicide (jisatsu) - written \u201cto kill oneself\u201d\u4ed6\u6bba\uff1adeath at someone else\u2019s hand/murder (tasatsu)\u4ed6\u754c\u3059\u308b\uff1ato pass away; die (takai suru) - written \u201cother world\u201dAdvanced Cultural Tip: While such politeness is not expected of foreigners, this is for mega extra points if you know the difference. Traditionally, if you are talking about someone\u2019s death personally, it\u2019s considered bad luck / bad manners to use the word \u201c\u6b7b\u306c\u201d. If you are talking politely about someone dying, you would use the verb\u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3002(nakunaru - to die) This would be someone outside your own family. E.g. \u6628\u65e5\u3001\u4f50\u85e4\u3055\u3093\u304c\u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002Ms/Mr. Sato passed away yesterday. (Kinou Sato-san ga nakunari mashita.) On the other hand, if you are talking politely about your own family member dying, you would use a verb like\u65c5\u7acb\u3064\u3002(tabidatsu - to leave for/pass away) - written \u201ctravel to [the other side]\u201d E.g. \u6628\u65e5\u3001\u6bcd\u304c\u65c5\u7acb\u3061\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002My mother passed away [left for\u2026] yesterday. (Kinou haha ga tabidachi mashita.) Hope this helps! ",
