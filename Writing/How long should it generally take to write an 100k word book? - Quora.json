            "answer_text": "How long is a piece of string? There is no should when it comes to length of writing time. There is a rough minimum amount of time that it is likely to take you though. First step is working out how fast you type. 50 words per minute is fairly average. That would mean 2000 minutes or 33 1/3 hours. That is the physical time that it would take to type the piece. Now most people aren\u2019t robots so would find it difficult to keep this up. It is possible to do and you can (if you are only doing writing) physically write the first draft in a week easily. As an aside I have recently booked a week off to attempt 100,000 words in one week. I am pretty sure I wont manage it but it\u2019s always good to push yourself. Realistically you are likely looking at 2\u20134 weeks to write a first draft full time. I\u2019ve read some comments by full time writers that write at a pace of between 1000 and 2000 words a day so that is 50\u2013100 days or 2\u20133 months ish. So you have the first draft written. But, wait, there is something that you did beforehand if you were writing from scratch. You came up with an idea and a plot to write to. You also did research. Now the research can take a while or no time at all. The novella I have just finished a first draft for took about 20 minutes of research to get terminology correct as the rest of the terminology comes from my job. If you are writing a historical fiction though then you are probably looking at a few months of good background research. That is even if you are someone like me who has studied history and works as an archaeologist. The point of this is that your research is decided by the setting and subject matter of what you are writing. How long it takes you to research is linked to how well you know the subject. For example if I were to write a crime piece that centred on coding I would have to do a lot more research than if I wrote about the Danubian Limes in the 6th century. Lets say you are writing science fiction. Nothing to high brow. You are probably looking at about 1 week to research the science behind things in your book and another week getting the plot and character names together at minimum. So back to the finished first draft. Well you have to read through it a few times. That is for simple errors and typos. then you start the first edit. The first edit may well involve asking friends and family to read through the piece to point out any glaring errors. Even if you do it yourself you are still looking at about 2 weeks of work to iron it out into a second draft. A quick spelling and grammar check then the next draft run through for minor plot points. You may have an editor that you can ask so would be beholden to them at this point or you may do it yourself. That is still going to take a couple of weeks. One final check for spelling and typos and then you have a manuscript to submit. lets add that up. At hardcore writing speed it will take you a couple of days to a week to write. Then there is the research of around a week. The edits are going to take about a month. So you are looking at around a month and a half at minimum if everything goes well and you focus solely on writing. As we all know that type of near perfect scenario doesn\u2019t happen. Realistically a fast writer will likely take at least 2\u20133 months to write a book of that length. The majority of people though are looking at 6 months to a year before they have something that they will accept as good enough to share with the world. if the book is non-fiction then that is a completely different ball game but I suspect the time frame would not be too different. When you consider a Phd would be that length and that takes 3 years to complete you get the picture. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Talmort, who is right on the money with my experience. But first of all, are you asking about writing a book or writing-down a book. One of my most successful books was in the works for 15+ years, and I have one now that I\u2019ve been researching for more than 50 years but it\u2019s not yet ready for publication. On the other end, I once drafted a novel in 11 days, averaging roughly 10,000 words typed per day. Then, of course, there was time to revise and edit. In other words, there is no \u201cgenerally\u201d when it comes to the time to write a book, though when you\u2019re ready to write a part of the book down, you might go at 10,000 words per day, or even faster, or much slower. As far as the 100,000 word length goes, it\u2019s too bad that most writing courses teach you to write with a word count goal. That may have been important in the past, but with the advent of ebooks, you can publish a book of any length. (though I once bought a bound book entitled \u201cEverything Men Know about Women\u201d\u2014and it was zero words long, just blank pages.) So make your book the length that fits for it and don\u2019t worry about word count. ",
