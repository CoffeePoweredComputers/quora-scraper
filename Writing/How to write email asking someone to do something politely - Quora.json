Get to the point and don't do so much small talk that you come across as if you're just being nice in order to butter then up. Be genuine. Make sure to be respectful regardless of the answer and make sure you're careful to not come across as pushy or manipulative. Be aware that there is no tone over text so it matters how you word it. Also, depending on what you're asking, there are some situations and questions that you should ask in person. For me, there are just some things I feel is not appropriate to ask over text or via email. ",

If you are asking for something much larger, say to pay off your student loans\u2014I need to ask you, \u201cWhy an email?\u201d The larger the request or \u201cask\u201d, the less appropriate an email becomes.

However, if you cannot make the request in person, then simply be polite in your email. The problem with email communication is that about 80% of our intent is communicated with body language. In addition, there is a question about the relationship that you have with the person to whom you are making a request. My advise would be to ask in person, prepare your rational for the request, and simply be polite. If you must use email, then read and reread your email to be sure it communicates clearly your request. ",
