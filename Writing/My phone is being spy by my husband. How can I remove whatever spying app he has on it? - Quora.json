She has the passcode to my phone. In fact, she has the password to every account I have. Banking, email, social networking - everything. If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about with a spying app. Keep in mind, these apps are designed not to be detected, so the only way to get rid of it is to wipe your phone and NOT restore it from a backup.

Far more likely, he has figured out your passcode, or he has seen you enter it. Anytime he has access to your phone, when your sleeping, when you\u2019re in the shower, whatever, he gets it and reads whatever he wants. Change your passcode to something only you know, and ensure he\u2019s not watching you enter the new one, and don\u2019t tell anybody about the new code. ",
