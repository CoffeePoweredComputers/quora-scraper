            "answer_text": "A2A I assume you are talking about laser printer printed label? Try to change printer label as it might not be fully compatible with particular laser printer you are using. it might work with B&W laser printer, but might not on Color laser for examplelabel might not be compatible with laser printer because it is intended for other printer technology such as inkjet.laser printer label is designed for specific type of laser printer or copier and not designed for your printer (operating temperature difference might be factor)You can minimize flaking off by laminating it or spray coat surface after printing it. But if ink is flaking off right after you printed, it normally lot to do with paper compatibility or problem with printer itself. If it is print normally with regular paper you use, I am pretty sure it is problem with paper. ",
