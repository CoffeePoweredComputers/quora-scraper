            "answer_text": "It depends on what century you are living in. By this I mean that we have resources like no other generation before. We can speak repeatedly or use recorders to get a copy made and then play back the recording to anybody from then on. It\u2019s what YouTube does every single second of every single day. I\u2019ve used the old style cassette tape recorders as well as the computer and microphone option as well as text to speech computer programs, so I can create poetry and songs in these ways. But, pay attention, the human voice isn\u2019t meant to function for long. It can\u2019t keep on speaking. I\u2019ve been on the phone to people for a while and found it was getting more and more difficult to speak. : The human voice has limits. It\u2019s why Frank Sinatra trained his voice to have better lung capacity, so he could hold a musical note in a song for longer. The human voice can be trained to extend its vocal range and as such become an enhanced experience. The film called The Fifth Element had this type of vocal enhancement explained and a similar enhancement was mentioned in the Star Trek Voyager story with the hologram Doctor perfecting its vocal skills. In one scene, the Doctor was training 7 of 9, yet she had a Borg enhancement that already adapted her singing voice to perfect pitch. He was trying to impress upon her the way that emphasis is put upon certain words and phrases. In another scene, she played the piano and was playing it perfectly, yet without any feeling or adapting it to enhance it with emotion. She was advised to become more open to the human emotions and joys in simply being able to play such a beautiful piece of music. In Star Trek, the Next Generation, the android Data could paint and write poetry and play music. Its abilities to adapt styles meant a better experience enjoyed by listeners. The poetry examples made me happy, yet Data was advised to change from one style to another. Consider the needs of the audience, not just your needs as a writer or as a poet. : YOUR audience is one at a time, so instead of 7 of 9, it\u2019s 1 of 7, then 2 of 7 and finally 7 of 7. Each will be either ready, willing and able to pay attention or not so much. The Parable of the Sower reminds us that some fell on stony ground. THAT\u2019S IMPORTANT. YOU must watch the way each listener is responding with rapt attention or boredom or frustration. There may even be a way to present a story using longer or shorter versions than the original story. Imagine if you were prepared with such different versions of the same story for just these types of situations. Sometimes a 15-minute story being compressed into just a 5-minutes story because one or some of the listeners just didn\u2019t give a damn! Or to extend the story with explanations that enhanced the storytelling with those more open to such insights. : With such points of view in mind, I write poetry then read it through several times. Can I correct errors, remove tongue twisters, use language that children understand as well or will I use Christian jargon that some don\u2019t understand or names hardly anybody has heard of? Is there a better way, even if it involves further editing, as well as compromises for a finished piece of poetry to be read correctly and spoken correctly the very first time? : YOU may choose to speak a story in advance to improve the performance later on. Or just plough your way through it, stumbling blocks and all. Maybe you\u2019ll edit out the awkward phrases and present your adaptation instead. : Maybe you\u2019ll learn basic microphone techniques at home or in a studio. Maybe you\u2019ll make a video recording instead. Frankly, I don\u2019t envy you going it alone and making mistakes because you weren\u2019t fully prepared or up to the task. : Use whatever resources you can! : As they say, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT! : Google Search for text-to-speech programs and downloading of their spoken voices and accents. Or making a video for YouTube, or how to edit a story, or presentation skills etc. : ",
