If it\u2019s a specific area you\u2019re talking about, I would avoid Lower Broadway in downtown Nashville. When it is not blocked off for some country music awards show (seems like there\u2019s one every other week\u2014-makes you wonder when country music singers ever find time to record songs in the studios), in the day time, the tourists are practically walking in the middle of the streets\u2026. at night, the street tricks and homeless are out from Lower Broadway back to Vanderbilt University ready to rob you or pick your pocket.

There are parts of East Nashville that might be dicey around 11pm or beyond. But those are mostly not Five Points. And I suppose there are parts of Downtown that can be dicey, but there\u2019s a police station for tourist and other security right on Broadway for that very purpose. Here are a couple suggestions: You can look at a zip code online.You can ask a real estate agent.",
