            "answer_text": "The question I'm waiting since long to answer but nobody tried to ask.:p I'm a kind of person who says a lot, every second thought to make people laugh, people don't know me at my first glance, they consider me lovely, social, clear sighted, cherishing but the fact is I love being social but there is a hidden habit of solitude. Somehow I find time for myself apart from crowd. I enjoy my own company. No! Really! Because a time comes when i find nobody around me, to listen to me. Then I discovered a friend i.e My Diary! Yes, I remain secluded if I don't have my dear diary. Whenever I feel sad, or excited, or happy, or full of romance ( romance here I tell you not that bollywood masala but it is an expression of any type of emotions) when I find no one around me to listen my chat, I just open my diary and write it down every single action handicapped to perform to. I am little reserved type I don't want to share my real emotions to everyone. So I invented for myself that I should write it down; so that I will feel relieved. Just like when you say your words you feel relaxed likewise when you write how sad you feel will not make you again feel depressed so write it down, it will make you feel better. Follow my advice, books and diaries are real friends:);p (Whisper) I have completed four diaries up to now(giggle) Have patience! ",

            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t say for sure, if anything, I feel indifferent about it. But what it can do is make you reconfirm your twisted, dark and grim views of life and it\u2019s cruel games. It doesn\u2019t help that dark, grim and twisted views of life receive more approval than positive, enlightening and happy views of life. People want to be sad, it seems. Another thing is, depression doesn\u2019t come from the sad and negative things you do, it comes from your sad and negative thoughts. A person can write all they want about sad stories and how sad they feel when their cat died but it still won\u2019t cause them to feel depressed. But the moment they cling on to the all the negative thoughts about life and how hopeless everything is, that\u2019s when depression kicks in. Which is a strange thing to say since depression is not a disease that you contract, it\u2019s a disorder that you have. If you\u2019re feeling depressed, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve always had it. All it needs is a catalyst for it to start festering. ",

            "answer_text": "it will make you feel better, writing your feelings good or bad, scared or anxious makes you feel relieved. It\u2019s better to let out all your feelings on a piece of paper and put them aside than to keep it all bottled up and thinking about it. Keeping things inside will make you depressed. You should write as often as you feel\u2026. also you should talk to someone you trust who loves you, a parent or grand parent, any family member you feel close too about your feelings. They have had times they felt sad too. And if they\u2019re family and they love you, they\u2019ll give you some good advice. If it\u2019s a stranger or just a friend sometimes their advice can make you feel worse. So write it down and/or reach out to a close family member you love and trust. They will listen. ",
