            "answer_text": "you don\u2019t. Publishers don\u2019t publish works because they are good, and you will never, never ever know what a publisher company think, because it\u2019s their most hidden secret. I understand that you think that quality=being published (you are young) but oher older writers than you have no excuses for being so wrong. PUBLISHER DOES NOT PUBLISH WORKS BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD, BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE MONEY WITH THEM. AND IT\u2019S NOT THE SAME THING. NOT AT ALL. They publish books because: They have read them first. Sounds obvious, bt it\u2019s not, and that\u2019s the most difficult part for a writer: having a pro-publisher reading your work. You are young and your parents owe you something. Tell them you are serious. Tell them you will find both a job and a way to pursue your dream of becoming a writer seriously. If they are good parents and you are not kidding, they will read your works.the second reason because publishing companies publish you, is bwcause you are fomous already. Yes. When you are famous for ANY reason, a publishing company will publish you. You probably think that this is not your case, but don\u2019t forget it. It\u2019s useful to undertand how all of this worksThey are seaching for a particular combination of style and content, and your work is exactly what they are looking for. Then, if your book is barely acceptable in terms of quality too, they will publish it. The reason why they are always searching a particular combination of style and content, is that they think that this combination nside your book will make them make a huge amount of money.Hope this helps. Anyway, since you are very young, you should focus on improving your quality. The first thing to do, is finding a good reader for your works first. Someone who reads a lot and is sincere enogh to speak the truth, but not so harsh to depress you. Then read S. King\u2019s ON WRITING. Read it two or three times and do exactly as the book says. If I had someone giving me this very same advice 20 years ago, when I was as young as you are, I would have spent less years wasting a lot of ink. Nowadays, I would be much more famous than I am, and I would be a better writer too. Good luck Wallace ",

            "answer_text": "You say that there\u2019s no one that you feel comfortable to have read your work. If you\u2019re willing, I\u2019d be interested in learning the source of your discomfort, if you even know. (This stuff isn\u2019t easy to figure out!) The decision to seek publication, traditionally or otherwise, is a lot bigger than most people realize. Your work will be exposed to the pubic eye, which is full of trolls, harsh critics, and people who will dislike your writing style or subject or whatever and be very vocal about saying so. If you have people in your life who would want to undermine you or actively discourage you, absolutely, don\u2019t give them your work to read. But if you\u2019re worried about them hurting your feelings \u2026 I still suggest that they might not be the best people to hand your work to, but do bear in mind that your feelings will get hurt if you publish. It\u2019s part of doing business. No matter how many times you tell yourself that even hugely successful authors like JK Rowling and Stephen King have people who loathe their work, it feels different when you\u2019re on the receiving end of critical reviews and trolling. Anyway, to answer your question more directly: There are a number of ways to have your work evaluated by people who know what they\u2019re doing. If you have the support of your parents, you might be able to enroll in an online writing course. Not all writing classes are made equal, so be sure to shop around a lot. You might also find in-person weekend seminars, workshops, and community extension classes through a nearby university. Again, not all of these are going to be a good fit for you. Take a look at the instructor. What kind of work have they published? How long have they been teaching? Do they have any successful students? Sometimes you can find inexpensive or free workshops that are part of a writer\u2019s conference or literary convention. The admission to some of those conventions is quite expensive, running into the hundreds of dollars or more, so again, look around and see which ones are the best fit. If there\u2019s one that looks perfect but seems out of reach because of travel considerations, talk to your parents. They may be willing to combine a vacation with the right convention, as many conventions occur in major cities that have tourist attractions and sight-seeing possibilities. See if there\u2019s a writing organization that would fit your needs. For example, Romance Writers of America is a fantastic resource for romance writers. (It\u2019s so good, in fact, that loads of writers who don\u2019t write romance still suggest RWA as a great resource for writers of all levels.) Become an active member of a writer\u2019s forum. One that I highly recommend is Activity Stream - Absolute Write Water Cooler. You can find beta readers, get advice, and learn about writing and publishing. There are lots of well-meaning amateurs and outright scam artists who take advantage of inexperienced writers. One way to avoid becoming a victim of a bad contract or being taken advantage of by a scam artist is to check up on them at the Water Cooler. If you\u2019re brave, you can put up a blog specifically to post sample chapters of your work and then ask online friends (or Quora Top Writers with writing creds) to look at your samples. I suggest that you keep such samples fairly short, and to fix the problems that you know are already there before you do it. There are few things more frustrating to both a writer and the person who is offering a critique than to argue over known issues. Also, if your sample is part of a larger work, post the beginning. If you feel like the beginning is too boring and you want to post \u2018the exciting part\u2019 then you need to write a new beginning. On your own, you can read up on how to write and apply the lessons to your writing. Three books that I highly recommend for writers that are just starting out are: Amazon.com: Steering the Craft: A Twenty-First-Century Guide to Sailing the Sea of Story eBook: Ursula K. Le Guin: Kindle Store, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life: Anne Lamott: 9780385480017: Amazon.com: Books, and Revising Fiction: A Handbook for Writers: David Madden: 9780452264144: Amazon.com: Books. These books are very popular and are often available used or at libraries. Lastly, I\u2019m all for writers writing and submitting short stories to paying markets. (The word limit is usually around 7500 words but I\u2019ve seen word limits as long as 10,000 in magazines and 20,000 for anthologies.) That\u2019s how I got my start. If your work is being accepted for publication, you\u2019re ready to start submitting to book publishers. You won\u2019t always get feedback from markets that you submit to. Often you\u2019ll just get a form rejection. But, if you do get a personal note, celebrate, even if the note is negative like \u201cthis story starts too slow for me.\u201d You\u2019ve gotten professional feedback from someone who is extremely busy, someone who would have only bothered to send such feedback if something about the story made an impression. Don\u2019t resend that story if you do get feedback, btw. Fix the problem if you agree with the comment, and then send it somewhere else. But do write another story and send it to the place that gave you the feedback! Once an editor has taken an interest in your work, they\u2019ll be looking for more of your work and will silently root for you. It may be that writing short stories doesn\u2019t come naturally to you. That\u2019s fine if you never master the short form, but practicing it will only do you good. I hope this helps! ",
