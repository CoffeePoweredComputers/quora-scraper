            "answer_text": "I assumed you already received the invitation letter to take the first part of the exam. There are three parts in the exam. I would rather give you some tips as Susan Thompson already mentioned about timeline. You need to answer at least 80% of question right, this was my case though Lionbridge didn\u2019t explicitly mentioned it. Please read the Guideline carefully, if you\u2019re new to Internet you need to read it multiple times. I read the whole Guideline two times before attempting the exam. There are no technical jargon thereby it is a comfortable reading. Please click on each link on Guideline, and analyze the landing page, a screen shot of a webpage, carefully. Keep in mind that some of such links have pages from porn sites. First two part of the exams are theoretical that means all the info you need to answer the questions are on Guideline. You don\u2019t need any outside knowledge. While answering the questions you should keep the Guideline open because you need to refer it over and over again If you are confused about a question try to find the most important keyword in that question, and using the text searching option from your PDF reader you can find all the related texts germane to that keyword. It would help you answer the question. If you successfully completed the first part you would immediately receive an email, and it takes you to the rest parts of the exam. Now comes the third part of the exam. This part is bit hard as it is testing you how would you apply the knowledge gleaned from the theoretical part. Most students can\u2019t pass this part. Before attempting this part I would suggest you to read the theoretical part of Guideline again, not the whole, just all the examples. Take your time for this part. You wouldn\u2019t find direct info like the first two parts of the exam in the Guideline for answering the questions but there is a trick I applied. Trick: Assume you\u2019ve a question that has a query as celebrity name, now you need to rate the result blocks that came associated with that query, you immediately refer back to the guideline, and look for any examples that has celebrity-named query. This example resembles a lot to the real question. Just don\u2019t blindly rate the result blocks from the examples you found in the Guideline. Use your intuition. If you can\u2019t pass the last part of the exam, don\u2019t be in despise. Email Lionbridge requesting you to allow for another attempt at exam. In most cases they allow it for only once. Good luck!

            "answer_text": " When people say Lionbridge Test they are mostly talking about internet assessor exam of Lionbridge while some might also be referring to Maps Quality Analyst, Internet Ads assessor, Web content Assessor, internet Saftey and another similar project, but let me help you with the exam which is assigned to most people and hence which is normally known as he Lionbridge Test. The exam is divided into 3 parts one Harder then the previous one each part are something that you have never read before so it is most difficult to pass it Here is an itinerary that you can follow to prepare for the exam. And it might help you get ready for some parts of the exam. Day 1- Study the guidelines as many times as you can. Make notes and pointers, mark important points. Day 2- Study the guidelines and complete part 1 of the exam. Day 3- Study the guidelines for the entire day/you can start with the second part if you are confident. Day 4- Study the guidelines for the entire day if you have already started with the second part (you can also continue some part of it) OR start the 2nd part if you haven\u2019t started already. Day 5- Complete the second part. Revise guidelines. Start with the 3rd part. Day 6- Devote the entire day to the 3rd part. Keep referring to the guidelines. Day 7- Devote the entire day to the 3rd part. Keep referring to the guidelines for relatable examples. But I was so tired studying again and again for the exam and still was not feeling confident as I didn\u2019t know what the exam actually looked like, I didn\u2019t want to lose this earning opportunity as I was a student back then and really needed something to pay my bills. So just like you, I started to look for help online, when luckily I founded exactly what I was looking for I found someone who not only help me understand what the exam is how to understand all the parts of the exam and how to clear it with ease, these guys also shared several tricks with me to help me get up to the marks in order to clear the exam with ease. I recommend you to get in contact with them as I guess you should not risk your chance of getting selected.
