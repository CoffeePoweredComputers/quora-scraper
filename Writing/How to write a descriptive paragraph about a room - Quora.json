            "answer_text": "Shay Hill\u2019s answer was pretty great. I just want to remind you not to infodump the reader. Tell what is necessary for the reader to understand whatever it is they need to understand and nothing more. For example\u2026 If the owner of the room was missing and the purpose of the scene was to find clues about him, then you could do a little longer piece focusing on the details that make the room his. \u201dThe bedroom was spotless. Even though dust had began to settle on the tabletops, the room was clean. Nothing was out of place; the books all neatly side by side in alphabetical order on the shelf, the folded clothes at the end of the made queen-sized bed, and the huge, white fur carpet on the floor that looked like it had never been stepped on. The window let the room soak in sunlight, revealing the dust particles floating peacefully in the air. The detective\u2019s nose wrinkled as he stepped further in. Something sharp lingered in the air; maybe the smell of a window cleaner.\u201d (So now we know the guy is super tidy and that he reads. These two facts could be the super important clue that at the end help the detective find him.) Usually it sounds nice if the description is inserted into action. Reveal something about the character through the room and their thoughts and actions, like: \u201dShe closed the door behind her, tossed the clothes off her unmade bed and climbed in, careful not to accidentally smack the dirty cups off her nightstand. Leaning over the edge of the bed, she grabbed the laptop from underneath her bed and pulled it on her lap. As she waited for Skype to open, she looked around at her room. She still hadn\u2019t cleaned up the desk like her mom had told her to, or the floors, or her closet, or the shelf\u2026 Oh well. It could wait until she was done talking with Matt \u2014 but to be honest, it could take a while. Maybe it could wait until tomorrow.\u201d (This is more showing than telling, and you usually want to go for showing. You immediately get the idea that her room is messy and that she doesn\u2019t really care. Like a regular teenager. Two birds with one stone. It also doesn\u2019t feel like the story stops to give the reader a bunch of information. This is personally the style I\u2019d go with.) Or if the room does not matter all that much, you can do just a few words. Usually just a few words is enough. For example: \u201dHe passed the messy lounge and walked into the kitchen, dodging trays, bowls of food and waitresses as he made his way towards the back door.\u201d (You know based on this that it\u2019s a restaurant/cafe/hotel kitchen, so the reader immediately pictures that instead of a home kitchen.) \u201dShe bit back tears as she rushed into the tiny bathroom on the second floor. She locked the door, drew in a deep breath \u2014 and lost control. Her friend banged on the door, demanding to know what was going on, but she simply leaned against the sink and cried.\u201d (It\u2019s only important to the scene that she\u2019s locked herself into a bathroom to cry. It doesn\u2019t matter what the bathroom looks like.) \u201dHe stopped at the door and took in the ballroom; the flyers on the walls begging guests to donate, the hundreds of people all dressed in the fanciest dresses and suits, and the huge chandelier that hung from the ceiling almost ten meters above the guests\u2019 heads.\u201d (We get the idea from just these three things.) These are bad examples and only a few but I hope that\u2019s helpful! ",
