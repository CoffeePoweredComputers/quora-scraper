            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not really a job one can apply for, like working at a Chuck E Cheese. First - It\u2019s very important for you to get a portfolio together of 10\u201315 of your best pieces. Have both a physical portfolio that you can carry to a meeting, and a digitized one you can submit online. Find someone who is writing, about to write, or has written a children\u2019s book and needs an illustrator. Look on Craig\u2019s List to start. Have samples scanned in that you can email, in case luck is on your side. Scale your expectations waaaaay down. Search at least twice a week. This is not a get-rich-quick career choice. Most important: Don\u2019t give up. With luck, you may meet an author or two; with more luck, your artwork may be exactly the style they\u2019re looking for. With lots of luck, maybe you\u2019ll be paid not too badly. With incredibly crazy good luck, your work will be hailed as genius and your talents will be in demand worldwide. Some or all of this may not happen. Don\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t give up. DO NOT GIVE UP. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question! I tried the Bologna book fair route in 2005, it did not work for several of the following reasons: Have the feeling the people who choose illustrators does not come at the fairWent the supposed last day and they were dismantling at least three hours before closingwent in and i found myself in front of the \u201cjob seekers wall\u201d, a place where young students put their work ads, and was COMPLETELY covered of art students work, most of them better than me for composition, color choice and overall craftsmanship.A very humbling experience, that however did not teach me where could i find a way to get a job as children book illustrator\u2026 ",
