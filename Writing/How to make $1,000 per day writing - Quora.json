            "answer_text": "Most writers never get rich. You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. But is it possible to make a nice little side hustle income? Get paid to write from time to time? Absolutely. In this post, you\u2019ll learn exactly how to make money writing. Different strategies, how to do it, everything you need. Let\u2019s start by talking about what\u2019s possible (and what\u2019s not). The Truth About How to Make Money Writing Writing for a living offers a ton of advantages \u2013 you get to choose when and where you work, and with whom. No wonder this promise of creative and personal freedom attracts so many people. But the truth is that most of them don\u2019t want to think about the practicalities of becoming a full-time freelance writer. They don\u2019t want to think about the uncertainty, the rejection, the self-doubt. They don\u2019t want to think about all the small, unglamorous tasks that make life as a writer possible. Deep down they fear their perfect dream will tarnish if they drag it down to earth. So it just hangs there in a shiny bubble, waiting for the day it miraculously comes true. But let\u2019s be honest \u2014 it just won\u2019t happen. Or do you really think someone will approach you one day and say: \u201cHey there. I heard from someone that you were thinking of writing something, someday, and I\u2019ve love to pay you to see where that someday could lead.\u201d Of course not, but without a concrete strategy, that is what it would take to make your distant dream a reality. Experience shows that vague plans fail. Grounding your dreams in reality is what makes them happen. Even if it means thinking about the things you\u2019d rather not consider. It\u2019s not enough to say you want to make a living as a writer; you need to know-how. You need a concrete plan to bridge the gap from where you are now to where you want to be. And the more realistic your plan, the better. Don\u2019t bet the farm on a path that only a small handful of super talented (or incredibly lucky) outliers have followed. Choose one that\u2019s worked for lots of people. Here Are The Most Realistic Ways to Make Money Writing ",

            "answer_text": "Answer: you make several times that for someone else! It\u2019s true top novelists earn $1,000 a day from their writing. But there are very few of them. (A handful of authors make 90% of all book profits.) So what you need to write is commercial prose: writing that sells products and services for customers. This is called copywriting. It\u2019s the art of writing ads, scripts, letters, and web content that boosts a company\u2019s sales and profits. Do this well - i.e. earn them at least 3x, and preferably 10x, more in profits than you charge them, and you can earn $1,000 a day. ",
