HOWEVER I don\u2019t need to explain that Quora is a fantastic question and answer resource: a place to find answersa social place to air your own viewsa human resource like no other (YET)it\u2019s helpful rewarding entertaining and valuableIt is nowhere near maturity because of a very large majority of users are the very people that want to take part in helping others. As soon as those needing help to learn that answers can be found here it will grow like CRAZY - overtaking many others. The site will change quite dramatically to include differing views on many topics. More life stories and increasingly valuable content. As I am writing this and I am being reserved - why? - Because - Quora have control they can easily delete my stuff they don\u2019t want. I do hope Quora don\u2019t delete this - why because I am a BIG fan of what they are doing and \u201cit is helping me at this stage of my life\u201d.

If you\u2019re writing factual, research based answers, fiction, or answers which require details; chances are that your answers will be long, and in my opinion readers understand it. If you\u2019re writing about what you ate this morning, or what your girlfriend told you when you went out to shop at some fancy store, or how you learned the purpose of life when you saw a cup falling from your hands and shattering on the concrete floor below; readers will appreciate short answers.
