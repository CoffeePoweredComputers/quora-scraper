            "answer_text": "Well That\u2019s a very tricky question. Stay with me as this answer will be a lot long than you expect it to be. Let\u2019s begin with an example. This word \"Cut\", in Japanese accent it's \"Catto\" Because of the Japanese phonetic system, people just can't help adding a vowel after a consonant. So, \"Catto\". Llikewise, \"Ball\" becomes \"Borru\" This famous word, \"Wife\" becomes \"Waifu\". Well, vowel again. So, the second most important part is to replace consonants and vowels because Japanese has fewer consonants and vowels compared to English. For example: Japanese doesn't have the word \"6\" or \"six\". So, instead of saying \"Six\" Japanese people say \"Shi\". So, the word \"See\" and \"She\", both become \"Shee\". So, it can be pretty confusing right? But, fortunately most Japanese people can pronounce \"See\", but some of them can't. So, when they try to say words like \"Sit\" they end up saying \"Shit\". LOL So, there's many many other consonants that you should replace. For example: We don't have the \"F\" sound. So, this word we've seen before \"Wife\". This \"F\" actually becomes \"H\" sound even though in Japanese we use the letter \"F\". But okay it actually sounds like \"Waihu\". So, that was consonants. But Japanese also has fewer vowel compared to English. For example: Japanese only have \"a i u e o\". Those are the only vowels Japanese have. We don't have \"Er\" (in \"word\"). \"Er\" sound. So, we replace this \"Er\" sound with \"A\", so this will sound like \"Waado\". See, instead of \"Er\" It's \"Aa\". \"Word\" will become \"Waado\". And as you can see, there's always a vowel after a consonant \"Do\". So Instead of 'Waad\" word becomes \"Waado\". Another important japanese consonant is \"R\". Because Japanese don't have \"L\" or \"R\" They both become Japanese \"R\". Which is somewhere between \"L\" and \"R\" \"Ra, Ra, Ra, Ri, Ru, Re, Ro\". (The japanese \"R\" mixed with \"A i u e o\") Those are Japanese \"R\". \"Ra, La\" It's basically a softer version of \"L\". So instead of saying \"La\", Japanese people say \"Ra\". So, your tongue is more relaxed. \"Ra-Ra\" it's not \"La\", it's \"Ra-Ra\" it's not \"La\" it's \"Ra-Ra\". And this can be pretty confusing for English speakers because the words like: \"Right\" And \"Light\" They both become, \"Raito, Raito\" with the Japanese \"R\" \"Raito, Raito\". Another example is \"Ball\" This becomes Because they don't have the \"L\" sound \"Booru\" \"Booru\" with the Japanese \"R\" \"Booru\" \"Booru\" So, another example is \"World\", this becomes \"Warudo\" Say this two times with me, \"Waarudo, Waarudo\" \"L\" sound is \"Ru\". adding a vowel \"D\" adding a vowel. So, \"Waarudo\". That's how it works. Now, let's see those two words Track and Truck. In English, we have \"Ah\" sound or \"Eh\" and\"A\" sound. But, since Japanese only have \"Aa\", they both become \"Torakku, Torakku\" Now, in English we have this thing called \"Diphthongs\" \"Diphthongs\" are basically two vowels combined. For example\" \"Table\" this \"A\" sound is a diphthong. But sometimes even don't know all the time in Japanese they replace this diphthong with a single long vowel. For example: \"table\" becomes \"Teeburu, Teeburu\". So, this \"A\" sound becomes \"E,E\". \"Teeburu Teeburu\", but this doesn't always happen because with the word \"Wife, Wife\". We keep the diphthong sound \"Ai\" and say \"Waifu\" By the way, the reason why I use this word \"waifu\" as an example is for you guys because you know This is not the kind of word I particularly Care about I think many of you guys do too(I see you are a man of culture as well). So I'm using this word as an example Another example, this is \"Boat\" again this \"O\" sound becomes \"Booto, Booto\" in Japanese. NOW I\u2019LL TELL YOU HOW YOU\u2019ll INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN JAPANESE ACCENTNow that we've learned the basics. I think we are ready to try some sentences. How about these sentences? Suppose my name is Kaushal. I'll introduce myself in English as Hello, my name is Kaushal, my wife is beautiful. How about yours? In Japanese accent, so let's do it slowly Hello hello \"L\" becomes Japanese \"R, Ro\". My name is Kosaru \"L\" becomes \"Ru\" My wife is Beautyfuru \"L becomes Ru\" Okay, don't forget to add a vowel beautyfuru Right? I really hope you understand what I'm trying to tell. This way you can make your own Japanese name, Like how your real name will sound in Japanese. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you have a non-Japanese or Chinese name You use this syllabary to match sounds to your name:  Note that all characters are syllables. You have to match the syllable in your name to the closest syllable written here. If (other than n) you have a letter that isn\u2019t independant, you use \u201c(letter)u\u201d or \u201cto\u201d/\u201ddo\u201d in case of t and d. For example, \u201cKrum\u201d would become \u201c\u30af\u30e9\u30e0\u201d. If it\u2019s in the case of \u201csh\u201d, \u201cch\u201d or \u201cj\u201d you\u2019d use \u201cshi\u201d/\u201dchi\u201d/\u201dji\u201d since those are the normally used syllables for those sounds in Japanese. To repeat a letter Eg. \u201cMatter\u201d you\u2019d use a small-sized \u30c4character in front of the syllable whose consonant was supposed to be repeated. (\u201c\u30de\u30c3\u30c6\u30eb\u201d) Ls become Rs, since Japanese doesn\u2019t have the sound \u201cl\u201d. Eg. Len becomes \u201c\u30ec\u30f3\u201d. Long vowels are replicated by putting the character and a \u201c\u30fc\u201d after it. For example, \u201cNoor\u201d becomes \u201c\u30cc\u30fc\u30eb\u201d. If the letter r is at the end of a sound eg. Mark, you\u2019d replace the r with a dash (\u30de\u30fc\u30af). It\u2019s like how the British tend to omit these types of Rs and extend the previous vowel. My name would be \u201c\u30a2\u30d3\u30de\u30cb\u30e5\u201d, for example. Also, when you write or say your name in Japanese, you say your last name first and in Japan people will address you with either your last name or your full name (both times with an honorific) unless they\u2019re really close to you.
