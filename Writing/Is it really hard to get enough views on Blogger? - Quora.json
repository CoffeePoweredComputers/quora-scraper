            "answer_text": "No, you need SEO tool Why doesn\u2019t anyone read my blog? If no one is reading your blog the first thing you need to do is ask yourself a big fat question. Would I share this stuff on Facebook? If \u201cno\u201d is your answer then chances are you aren\u2019t producing anything worth reading. Remember, people are bombarded with dozens of excellent, viral pieces of content every day. You see Charlie biting his brother\u2019s finger, Bored Panda and BuzzFeed showing you nostalgic funnies from the 90\u2019s, and a million other articles borrowed from the front page of Reddit and imgur. Think what you will about these sites, the content is compelling. There wouldn\u2019t be a single person reading this article now who could hold their hand to their heart and swear that they\u2019ve never clicked on one of those shareable posts on Facebook. We all do it. So now we need to look at our own blogs and ask ourselves deeply and honestly about how well we are competing for peoples\u2019 attention. Do our blogs cut it? Why it might not matter The interesting thing to note at this point is that creating content that \u201ccuts it\u201d is often not enough. It still doesn\u2019t get noticed. That is when things start to get really frustrating for bloggers \u2013 you do all the right things as far as content production goes but still nothing happens. Depressing. So what can we do about it? 1. Develop a highly targeted audience Surprisingly, having too many followers can hurt your visibility on Facebook. The platform rewards meaningful activity, so popularity without engagement is useless. The bigger your audience, the harder it is to keep engagement levels high. Facebook algorithms see your posts as spam if you get a lot of views, but few clicks. It\u2019s more effective to target a manageable audience of people who regularly engage with your content. Start by checking out your current followers and how they interact with your content. Look for trends among their interests and demographics to build a brand persona. Use the Audience Optimization tool to find preferred and lookalike audiences who are likely to respond well to your content. That way, you have a better chance of gaining comments, likes, and shares on each post. Friends of your preferred audience may also see content, which boosts your organic reach. 2. Create shareable content, but post less often Stop feeling guilty if you aren\u2019t posting updates all day. A 2015 HubSpot study showed that business pages with 1,001 to 10,000 followers get fewer clicks the more they post. In fact, organizations that posted 60 times per month earned 60 percent fewer clicks per post, compared to companies with five or fewer monthly posts. Aim for a peak range of about 5 to 30 posts per month, and try not to exceed more than two posts a day. Instead, focus on crafting calls-to-action that motivate people to keep engaging with your posts. For example: Ask a question to prompt comments.Give readers an insightful tip with a visual aid to get reactions.Ask readers to share experiences relating to a theme.Host contests that require ongoing engagement to win.Share a group of useful links about a how-to topic and ask others to do the same.Recurrent interaction keeps your content high up on news feeds, providing access to wider networks. So how did I do it? Did it happen by magic? First of all, I just want to say that: I have no experience writing for a livingUp to 6 months ago I didn\u2019t even know what digital marketing was (I am still unsure\u2026)I never liked social media (and still don\u2019t)I have never made money with an online product beforeSo if you are thinking you cannot do it, you are wrong! And if you think it\u2019s too late to start a blog in 2020, it\u2019s not! Start NOW! I learned how to make money blogging and if I did it, so can you! ",
