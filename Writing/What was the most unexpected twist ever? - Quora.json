            "answer_text": "Few months back we moved to our new flat. I still remember that day as if it was yesterday. It was my 2nd day in that flat. 21st May 2020 I was chilling on the bean bag in my room with an unfinished \u201cThe Notebook\u201d in one hand and a mug of coffee in another. I looked up from my novel to admire the scenery before me. The sky was ablaze with fire of the setting sun. The trees looked like strong, black soldiers standing in an unmoving row. I had chosen this particular room due to the attached balcony and the ravishing view from here. A few pages into the book, I heard some noise from above my head. Probably, the upper flat residents. I ignored it and continued my novel. But then the noise became louder. I could now decipher the song, it was some \u2018Eminem Rap\u2019 my brother had forced me to listen, the day before. I\u2019m not really a great fan of rap songs. So the noise was irritating me. The noise became even louder. This guy/girl was trying my patience now. I got up from my seat and went to the balcony and shouted \u201cHey! Lower down the volume. You are disturbing the neighbors.\u201d But nobody replied rather the noise increased. Now it was getting beyond limits. I marched into my room, tore a paper from my rough notebook and wrote, \u201cPLEASE STOP MAKING NOISE. IT IS DISTURBING THE NEIGHBOURS.\u201d Picked up a smiley stress ball, wrapped it in the paper and threw it to the balcony upstairs. I did a little happy dance when the ball successfully landed there. The noise then stopped. I smirked in victory and went back to my room. As soon as I seated myself on the bean bag. The same ball fell back into my balcony. But this time with a yellow sticky note on it. I quickly went and picked up the ball to see the note. It read \u201cIT\u2019S NOT NOISE. IT\u2019S CALLED MUSIC.\u201d This irked me. I grabbed another sheet, wrote \u201cWELL, THEN YOUR TASTE IN MUSIC SUCKS.\u201d And lobbed it back. Few seconds later the ball fell with another sticky note saying, \u201cATLEAST, IT\u2019S BETTER THAN YOUR HOPELESS ROMANTIC NOVELS.\u201d What! How does this person know that I like romantic books? Beads of sweat stood out on my forehead. Was this some stalker? Or a serial killer? Oh My Holy Son of the Wind God! What if it\u2019s a ghost!? No no no no. Shit! I\u2019m too young to die. Okay. Calm down. I took deep breaths and with trembling hands wrote, \u201dHOW DO YOU KNOW I LIKE ROMANTIC BOOKS? ARE YOU A STALKER?\u201d And threw it up. No reply came. With every passing minute my heartbeat increased. A few moments later the ball fell with a note, \u201cGEEZ. I DON\u2019T STALK HOPELESS ROMANTICS. AND UMM...I KIND OF MIGHT HAVE LISTENED TO YOUR CONVO WITH, I SUPPOSE, YOUR BROTHER, LAST NIGHT.\u201d I sighed in relief. But wait. He listened to me & my brother\u2019s conversation. This is so uncivil. \u201cWHAT!? YOU EAVESDROPPED ON ME. SO GENTLEMAN-LY. HUH? PS- I\u2019M NOT A HOPELESS ROMANTIC. I ONLY LIKE THE ROMANCE GENRE\u201d To which came a response, \u201cNO. I DIDN\u2019T. YOU WERE TALKING SO LOUDLY THAT THE WHOLE LOCALITY MUST HAVE HEARD IT. BTW, HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I\u2019M A GUY? NOW WHO\u2019S A STALKER?? PS- YOU MEAN THE CLICH\u00c9D ROMANCES WHERE THE GUY & THE GIRL ALWAYS HAVE A \u2019HAPPILY EVER AFTER\u2019. LOL. SO ORIGINAL! \u201c I then replied, \u201cIDK. JUST A GUT INSTINCT. (Plus your handwriting is also messy). WELL, ARE YOU? PS- WHATEVER \u201c An answer came back instantly, \u201cYES, I AM. PS- IT\u2019S NOT WHATEVER. IT\u2019S UNREALISTIC. \u201c I didn\u2019t know what to say so I wrote, \u201cHMM. PS- NO COMMENTS\u201d To which he retorted, \u201cIT MEANS YOU AGREE THAT THEY ARE UNREAL. HAHAH! \u201c I do agree that those romance books which I read are unrealistic and not every real life love story has \u2018a happy ending.\u2019 Perhaps who can know this better than me? But I wasn\u2019t going to give this guy the pleasure by agreeing to his point. So I chose not to reply anything. I went back to my room and laid on my bed. Thinking about that certain someone who once promised to accept me as I am. Who once promised to love me the way I am. Who once promised to stay by me forever. But broke all those promises and left me shattered and wounded. I was pulled out of my trance of thought by a \u2018thump\u2019 sound from the balcony. I quickly ran there to find a football with a similar note attached to it. It said, \u201cHEY! SORRY, IF I SAID ANYTHING TO HURT YOU. IT WASN\u2019T INTENTIONAL AT ALL. BTW, MY NAME IS SACHIT. YOURS? PS- I DON\u2019T THINK THE FOOTBALL WILL BE ABLE TO REACH MY BALCONY. SO JUST KEEP IT WITH YOU. I\u2019LL COLLECT IT SOME OTHER DAY. \u201c I quickly tore a paper and wrote, \u201cIT\u2019S OKAY. WHAT YOU SAID WAS PROBABLY RIGHT. MY NAME\u2019S DISHA. PS- OKAY. FINE. YOU CAN ALSO KEEP THIS BALL FOR NOW\u201d Wrapped it around the smiley ball and threw it upwards. Instantly a crumpled paper fell on my head. I unwrapped it and read, \u201cYEAH. OKAY. BYE. TAKE CARE. \u201c Idk why. But that simple \u2018Take Care\u2019 aroused a familiar feeling in my chest. A kind of feeling which I was afraid to experience again. I tried not to think more about it and went to the living room. Rest of the evening and the next few days passed in a blur with unboxing cartons, arranging furniture, etc. 29th May 2020 It was late in the afternoon. I was sitting on my bed, doing my assignments. But I couldn\u2019t concentrate on the questions all I could think of was the neighbor upstairs aka the noisy guy aka Sachit. I looked beside me to see the football still there at the corner of my room. There had been no noise for last few days. And Sachit had also not come to take his football. So I decided to myself, go and give it back to him. I jumped off my bed, grabbed the football and strode towards the upper flat. Upon reaching their I knocked on the door. But no one answered. I banged my fist a few times on the wood but it was in vain. Nobody still replied. Meanwhile, the next-door neighbor opened their door. It was an old lady. She asked me, \u201cAre you new here?\u201d I said \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cWhy are you thumping on that door? Nobody lives there. It has been empty for past one year. The owner and his wife moved to Bangalore last year after Sachit, their son\u2019s death.\u201d My blood ran cold as she finished her sentence. Sachit is Dead? So who was playing the music that day, who was replying to my notes. Oh god! With quivering lips I asked her, \u201cHow\u2019s that even possible? I heard noises coming from their balcony a few days back. And this. This football is Sachit\u2019s.\u201d I showed her the football in my hand. The lady stared at me as if I had grown another head. And said, \u201cKid. Don\u2019t play a prank on me. Go back to your home. No one lives in that house.\u201d And then she shut her door. I stood there numb staring at the wooden door in front of me. Suddenly, I felt cold and as if I got my senses back, I quickly turned on my heels and started walking towards the lift, when I heard the door behind me open. I froze on my spot. My mind was screaming \u2018Don\u2019t turn back. Just enter the lift and go to your house.\u2019 But my heart said otherwise. I slowly turned back, to find the door open but nobody was standing there. Only my smiley ball was lying at the entrance with a yellow sticky note on it. With heavy steps I went closer to it. I stooped down to pick up the ball. As I stood up, my eyes met with a pair of brown eyes. Those were not some normal brown eyes, they were dark and captivating. His jet black hair contrasting to his pale skin. A small smile dancing on his perfectly arched lips. He was beautiful. But he was dead. He stretched his arms to take the football from my hands. His fingers felt cold against my own skin yet a warm sensation spread through my body. He took the football. And\u2026 BOOM! There was a loud noise behind me. I spun back to see the source of the sound but found nothing. I turned to my front to come face to face with the closed wooden door from earlier. He disappeared. He was not there anymore. But the smiley ball with the yellow sticky note was still in my hands. That means everything was real. I wasn\u2019t hallucinating. He was here. But he wasn\u2019t alive.  Present Day : 23rd September 2020 I got to know from the other neighbors that he had committed suicide coz he felt unworthy of living and some other reasons which his family never disclosed. I didn\u2019t tell anyone else about this incident because I feared that people might think that I\u2019ve gone crazy. I still have all his sticky notes including his last note which said, \u201cYOU ARE BEAUTIFUL THE WAY YOU ARE. DON\u2019T BELITTLE YOURSELF FOR SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S MISTAKE. \u201c Love, Sachit <3 I never saw him again after that day. Neither do I hear any sounds from the upstairs flat. But every night when I go to bed, I feel someone enter my room through the balcony and kiss my forehead and whisper \u201cYou are beautiful, Disha. You are beautiful.\u201d before I drown into a deep slumber. What was the unexpected plot twist? That my supposedly upstairs neighbor was a dead person and I had a conversation with him.Or that maybe. Maybe I\u2019m falling for him.Thanks for Reading <3 xx Gingerbread PS- Apologies for any kind of errors. Edits are always welcome. ",

            "answer_text": " Nicholas Barclay vanished from a basketball game near his house in 1994. His parents prepared themselves for the possibility that they may never see their son again, but they had hope of finding him. Three years later, their son turned up alive and well\u2026 The family were excited upon hearing their son's voice, but despite the reunion, something was off\u2026  The boy looked nothing like the boy who disappeared. Nicholas Barclay had blonde hair and blue eyes. This child had brown eyes and brown hair. He also had a French accent. Nicholas told everyone that his eyes changed due to the chemicals his captors used, his hair was dyed, and his French accent developed living in Europe for so long. The family believed him and accepted Nicholas into their home for 6 months until the FBI took fingerprints and blood samples.  It wasn't Nicholas Barclay. He was then a 23-year-old con-man, Frederic Bourdin. After his exposure, Bourdin made claims that the family really knew he wasn\u2019t Nicholas all along, and that they were just putting on a show for the police. He insisted that they killed the boy, and hid his body. Lies upon lies, he eventually ended up in jail for 6 years\u2026  Bourdin began his impersonations as a child and claims to have used at least 500 false identities, three of which have been of actual, teenage missing people. Nicholas Barclay has never been found\u2026 ",
