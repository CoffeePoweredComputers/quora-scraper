            "answer_text": "Her First period She was in a great pain. I had never seen her in such a condition in her whole life. She ignored the food and maintained a safe distance from all of us. It was her first period and she wasn\u2019t aware of all this and she was so sick during the complete 10\u201312 days. Heavy bleeding followed by immerse pain and sick feeling left her with teary eyes. We all tried cheering her up, but nothing seems to work. Not even her favourite toy could ease her that day.  She kept vomiting everything she ate for the first few days of her period. It was difficult time for the whole family. We wanted to be with her, but she kept leaving us because she was little ashamed of all the mess she caused in this process. She wouldn\u2019t respond to anything. She would just lie down with teary eyes the whole day. 12 days later she finally came running towards us and ate all her food. I kissed her and she was running all around me.   Some guidelines for your dog\u2019s first period: 1. A dog heat cycle only happens once or twice a year. The canine estrus cycle (commonly referred to as the dog heat cycle) occurs every 6 to 12 months. 2. A puppy can go into heat sooner than you think. The earliest that most dogs will experience their first heat cycle is at 6 months of age. 3. Dogs in heat should stay away from intact male dogs for 3 to 4 weeks. This means that dogs in heat should not visit dog parks or do any doggie day care.\u201cGenerally, neutered males are fine, however, it\u2019s also stressful for intact males to live in the same house as a female in heat so we usually recommend totally separating them.\u201d If possible, send one of the dogs to stay with a relative or friend for a month or so. 4. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the clear once the bleeding stops. With dogs in heat, each dog heat cycle lasts 3 to 4 weeks, but you will only see bleeding during the first 2 weeks. \u201cThe fertile period is actually when the bloody discharge starts to subside and it becomes pink or clear and there\u2019s much less of it,\u201d Dr. Kelso says. \u201cEven the swelling of the vulva goes down substantially so a lot of people think the dog is out of heat, but no, that\u2019s actually the prime fertile time.\u201d 5. The bleeding from dogs in heat isn\u2019t as bad as you might think. \u201cFortunately, in most dogs it\u2019s not a large amount, it\u2019s relatively small,\u201d Dr. Kelso explains. \u201cSome people will use sanitary diapers for dogs.\u201d With some dogs in heat, you won\u2019t really notice the bleeding. 6. Don\u2019t delay scheduling your dog\u2019s spay. It\u2019s best to have your female dog spayed prior to her first heat cycle. If your new rescue dog goes into heat before you can get her spayed, your vet might suggest waiting until she is done before spaying her. \u201cIt can be done while they are in heat or immediately after, but it\u2019s not the ideal time because the uterus is much larger and much more vascular at that time,\u201d Dr. Kelso says. \u201cIf we have the luxury of time, then the perfect scenario is we wait about two months after they\u2019ve been in heat to spay them, but if we need to get it done because they\u2019re getting adopted out then we\u2019ll definitely spay shortly after heat or when we need to.\u201d 7. Spaying your dog decreases her chances of developing mammary cancer. Mammary cancer is the equivalent of breast cancer in dogs. Check your female pup regularly for lumps in her breast tissue (from her armpit to her groin). If you feel something suspicious, schedule an appointment with your vet. 8. Pyometra is another danger for female dogs who aren\u2019t spayed. Pyometra is an infection of the uterus. It can be deadly and almost always requires an emergency spay surgery. If the infection is \u201copen\u201d (meaning the cervix is open) it can be easier for veterinarians to diagnose because there is usually foul-smelling discharge from the vaginal area. \u201cDogs can also have a variety where the cervix is closed, so the pus is actually building up inside the dog and those dogs get really sick,\u201d Dr. Kelso says. \u201cThey don\u2019t eat, they don\u2019t drink and they run a high fever. If you see any of those symptoms, you should bring her in to a veterinarian.\u201d 9. Dogs in heat know when they are in heat and fertile \u2014 and when they are not. \u201cDogs know when they\u2019re ready to be bred,\u201d Dr. Kelso says about dogs in heat. \u201cThey get a little more flirtatious. Sometimes they might be a little grumpy at the beginning of heat. If a dog tries to mount them or something, they\u2019re basically saying, \u2018I\u2019m not ready.\u2019\u201d Source: Dogs in Heat: 9 Things to Know Don\u2019t take your pet\u2019s first period for granted. Most owners do and most female pet die during this time due to lack of awareness in owners. Kind request to all wannabe owners of female pet kindly read about this situation and be with her. This is the most difficult times for a female pet that is the reason people prefer male pets over female ones. Stay with your pet. Just be around her. She might get aggressive but don\u2019t get scared as these are just mood swings. Keep smiling at her and be around. ",
