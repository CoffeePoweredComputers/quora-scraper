            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Anam! The box in the picture is referring to the personal statement on the Common Application. Yes, you have room for about 650 words in that essay. I say \u201cabout\u201d because sometimes it\u2019s a little bit less. Truth! Last year we were having trouble with the longer essays getting their last paragraph cut off by the application software. The reason for a word limit is twofold: college admissions officers don\u2019t have time to read a lengthy narrative, short story, one act play or novel. (You know if there was no limit, someone is going to submit a novel!) The second reason is to evaluate your ability to write concisely. While filling a page with flowery prose is fine in some contexts, college writing is not the place to do that. They want to evaluate your ability to express ideas and connect them together in unexpected ways. Most of my students who write overly long essays are in essence writing a narrative of their resume: \u201cWhen I was on the debate team, I won first place at the local and regional competitions\u2026.\u201d Of course it\u2019s difficult to find a way to cut when you want/need to include everything that makes you special. But space on a college application is too precious to repeat any information. Each section should be a way to add information about you as a student and as a person. The personal statement is essentially a written interview. The admissions officers want to know what is unique and interesting about you and to hear an engaging story. One story. If they just wanted a writing sample, they would have asked for that. (Some do.) Keep in mind that you will probably have room to discuss another aspect of yourself in the writing supplement for each college of your choice. If you\u2019re struggling with cutting your essay down to size and you need more essay support than your school counselor can give, an hour or two with a professional can be well worth the cost. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the picture is true, and this website is a pretty reliable source. You can create your Common App account now and see for yourself. The main essay window won\u2019t allow you to fit anything over 650 words. If you create the Common App before August 1st, choose the \u201cother student\u201d option, not \u201capplying in 12th months\u201d - then you\u2019ll be able to roll over your account for the future application season. Your main essay will stay saved in the Common App and you can come back to work on it anytime. (Some things, like supplemental college essays or recommendation requests, won\u2019t roll over, but the main essay will.) Yes, I agree that sometimes it\u2019s very hard to cut an essay to the required length. You feel like every sentence is absolutely essential and it\u2019s impossible to fully express your thoughts or story in this tight space. I watched my son in the same situation last fall, and I understand how hard it is. He literally had to cut it word-by-word and sometimes a tiny little thing made a difference. For example, \u201cI will\u201d is counted for 2 words, but \u201cI\u2019ll\u201d is one word. I think \u201cword-by-word\u201d is one word (please double-check on this when you are working on your essay, because I might not remember all the details). I know it won\u2019t help you with trimming your essay from 800 words to 650. You will have to actually rewrite it, because it\u2019s impossible to delete a paragraph or several sentences here and there without rewriting the rest of the text. But in the final editing stages every word could count, so watch for these little things. ",

Second, there is a space at the end of the application that asks if there's anything additional you wish to tell them. This is not give you permission to put the last paragraph of your personal statement into that box. It does give you permission to take a specific incident of bad grades, ethnic diversity, an arrest, any single incident in your personal statement that can be separated from the rest of the story, and place it into that box.

            "answer_text": "Yes, 650 is the max now for the Common App main essay. Part of getting the essay right is trying to pick a topic that will fit in the 650 words. Students aren\u2019t that good at squeezing extra words out but it almost always can be done. You will likely also have to rework it. I have helped students reword from 800 to 650 before and it improved the essay. Sometimes I find that the entire first paragraph is just unnecessary intro. Don\u2019t use a 5 paragraph traditional format. Jump right in. I also have helped someone with a 350 word count reduce that from a 650 original essay with improvement are no real loss of message. ",
