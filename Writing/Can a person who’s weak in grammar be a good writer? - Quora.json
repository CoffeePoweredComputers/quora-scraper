            "answer_text": "No. Sorry. Grammar is to writing as a paintbrush is to painting. it is a key tool, absolutely required. I see someone talking about how not to worry, an editor will fix your grammar. Well, in professional publishing, the problem with that is, it presupposes an editor will buy a work with poor grammar, He won\u2019t, Two or three pages it and he will realize he is dealing with someone who can\u2019t use the English language properly, and that publishing your work will cost him more time and money than publishing a well written book. Because copyrighters are paid, you know. All that time they spend fixing your mistakes, they are *paid* for. So what do you think a publisher would prefer, a book that takes one week to edit, or a book that takes four weeks? The market is competetive, remember? I once asked a First Reader at my publisher what he looked for in a new MS. He said the first thing was, \u201ccommand of the English language\u201d. If a book has poor grammar, he said, they don\u2019t even read it,. How good a painting can you create if you don\u2019t know how to use a paintbrush? Can you publish something on your own with crappy grammar? Sure, but that doesn\u2019t make it \u201cgood writing\u201d. I guess you could hire an editor to fix all your mistakes, but at best that makes your work \u201cnot bad.\u201d. You still can\u2019t use words to their best effect. Grammar is not an artistic tool to you, it is a burden. And that will show. Bottom line, you can\u2019t be a \u201cgood writer\u201d if you don\u2019t know how to write, Now, that doesn\u2019t mean a person with poor grammar can\u2019t BECOME a good writer. But he has to learn the craft. ",

            "answer_text": "I must first answer this question: What is good writing? \u201cGood Writing\u201d has many different facets: Character DevelopmentPlot DevelopmentDialogueNarrationSentence structureCharacter development and plot development are not dependent upon \u201cgood grammar\u201d. As to dialogue, it depends upon the character. If you are writing a novel about the hierarchy in lower class communities, good grammar is not necessarily needed. (This is not meant to be a put down upon those from the lower class, but simply to state that typically, education is not as obtainable to them, and proper grammar is not as present. :) ) However, when it comes to sentence structure and narration, good grammar is vital to a story. Grammar does not simply mean using \u201cI\u201d when its a subject and \u201cme\u201d when its the direct object. It means to understand the parts of speech and how to rearrange words and how to write a proper, beautiful sentence. If your grammar is not \u201cperfect\u201d, do not fear. Improving your grammar is an easy thing to do. Check out a few grammar books from the library, or buy them online. Study the parts of the speech, read well written novels, and perhaps take a few writing classes. Here are a few excellent books to read: The Great Gatsby by F. Scot FitzgeraldTill We Have Faces by C. S. LewisThe Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor DostoevskyPride and Prejudice by Jane AustinJane Eyre by Charlotte BronteEnjoy, -Annalia Fiore ",

            "answer_text": "No. Not at all. Weak grammar tends to a huge confusion between what the writer wants to say and what the reader interprets. A person with weak grammar may have a very beautiful thought process or a great story in his mind but it's worthless if he can't get it on paper with right grammar. A writer without good grammar skills is a nightmare. ",
