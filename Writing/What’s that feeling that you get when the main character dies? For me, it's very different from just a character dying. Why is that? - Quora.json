            "answer_text": "Possibly because most of the time the main character isn't expected to die. I'm not saying the main character dying isn't uncommon, it's just that out of all the characters the main character is usually built up the most out of all the characters. You WANT these people to succeed, to accomplish their dreams, ect. When they are killed, there's a depressing sense of failure and shock that sticks with us (assuming the character is well developed.) It does also depend on how they themselves die which adds to the shock factor since the characters that die in brutal ways are typically a side character or irrelevant one. For example: if you've ever played Silent Hill: Homecoming(Also I don\u2019t care what anyone says, 4 is the best one next to 2 of course), Alex's deaths are fairly brutal and they range from being beheaded to being full on split in half. Silent Hill Homecoming all death animations Think of it this way, there are two characters: Spider-man:  And\u2026 Batman:  Batman is the darker-toned comic, while Spiderman is more family friendly (depending on which Spiderman version you're reading) Let\u2019s say\u2026 Spiderman is killed via extreme mutilation while Batman is killed via beheading. Which is more shocking? Most would probably say Spiderman, wanna know why? In something lighthearted, like Spiderman, not only is that method of death shockingly brutal but destroying the innocent light we see that character in. Yes, when it comes to Batman the death is still shocking but not as effective as Batman comics are, like I said, darker-themed. We're always expecting grim and dark things when it comes to Batman. Hope this helped. ",

            "answer_text": "Main characters usually have what writers call \u201cplot armor.\u201d It is understood that the main character will survive ANYTHING because they are the main character and they need to survive for the sake of the story. Other characters may have varying levels of \u201cplot armor\u201d or \u201cauthor armor.\u201d Some authors just don\u2019t kill off their important characters, so if you are familiar with that author then you know just like with the main character, nothing is going to kill them. Some authors will kill off their important characters, so if you are reading an author you aren\u2019t familiar with or an author you know kills off important characters, you know that some characters may die. And that\u2019s the critical difference. Unless you know for a fact that this author never kills important characters, you always know that a given (non-main) character can end up dead in a story. Unless you are reading G. R. R. Martin, you know that the main character almost always has \u201cplot armor\u201d and won\u2019t die. So if the main character DOES die it surprises and shocks you in a way other character\u2019s deaths don\u2019t. For some folks it will even seem like a betrayal\u2014that the author betrayed the reader by killing off a main character that the reader had a \u201cright\u201d to expect would get a happy ending. (This applies equally to watching tv shows/movies, playing video games, and listening to oldtime radio plays. I talk about reading/writing/authors bc that\u2019s my preferred form of fiction so those are the terms I\u2019m used to.) ",
