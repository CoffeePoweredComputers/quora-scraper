            "answer_text": "Yes. It is quite common, actually. When an adult temporarily forgets the character, they\u2019ll usually hastily scribble the Pinyin down, and maybe an actual character that they do remember. Example: My friend wanted to write the word \u7076\u53f0 (stove). However, he temporarily forgot how to write \u7076, the first part. However, he did remember the \u53f0 part. He didn\u2019t have his phone with him, so he simply wrote z\u00e0o\u53f0. If he hadn\u2019t remembered the second part, he would have written z\u00e0o t\u00e1i. See? It\u2019s mainly for when you forget the character. And that happens quite a lot. However, there are other circumstances. Children are always taught Pinyin (just read a children\u2019s book), and if they are writing an essay they are allowed to substitute Pinyin. However, as they grow older they are quickly forced out of that habit, as they are expected to remember characters. This starts as early as fourth grade (when they started making me do it). Maybe even third. If they use Pinyin, they actually have points taken off. Pinyin is also a vital way for adults or older students to learn new characters. Write the Pinyin over the character, and boom, you have a permanent reference. If you forget the character pronounciation again, all you have to do is look at the Pinyin. So yes, Pinyin is in many ways vital to the Chinese language, and is used frequently. ",

            "answer_text": "No. When we learn Chinese in school, we begin with Pinyin. The first language a baby can speak is probably hometown dialect, they use hometown dialect and Mandarin to communicate, so they still need to learn standard writing and pronouncing in school. Only children will write in Pinyin, just when they don\u2019t know one or two characters in the sentence they want to write. For example, \u6e56\u9762\u6ce2\u5149\u7cbc\u7cbc\uff08the glistening lake\uff09=\u6e56\u9762\u6ce2\u5149l\u00ednl\u00edn, but they wouldn\u2019t write h\u00fami\u00e0nb\u014dgu\u0101ngl\u00ednl\u00edn\uff0cbecause it\u2019s too confusing. Some books for primary school students marked with Pinyin, which aims to get children familiar with the connection between the pronunciation and that character. Besides, adults use Pinyin when they are typing. Most young people now type in Pinyin, others typing in Wubi. When adults come across new characters, they will not write Pinyin as a child, they will check on the internet, then write it correct. So using Pinyin in handwriting is childish which makes readers confuse. ",
