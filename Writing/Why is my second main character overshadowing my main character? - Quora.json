            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not completely certain, but something of the like seems to be happening to me, so I know what you\u2019re talking about. In my story, there were two relationships, which are the main character\u2019s (Pierre) and his best friend\u2019s (Jacques). Pierre is older, very confident with himself and who he is (perhaps too confident), and he\u2019s looking for romance for fulfillment and because he really loves his woman. Meanwhile, Jacques is younger (he actually sees Pierre as more of a mentor/older brother because his own father is physically and psychologically abusive), a late bloomer, awkward, poor, has ADHD, and is not well versed in talking to females. He also has a language barrier with the girl he likes, while the main does not. But throughout his time \u201cwooing\u201d her, he really is learning to accept himself. Pierre already fine with who he is, but Jacques is not. Pierre\u2019s strong, healthy relationship is actually intended to parallel Jacques\u2019s stumbling, awkward, fledgling one. Throughout his journey of his first love (he\u2019s fourteen) he learns to be more confident with who he is and he grows a lot. I realized later that maybe the story really belongs to Jacques and I didn\u2019t know it. People seem to like him, and he\u2019s still my favorite OC, even though I first created him and the rest of the cast 15 years ago. I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for him. I\u2019m not completely sure if I should switch POV because Jacques isn\u2019t the most observant person and he might not be the best for actually narrating a story. But I\u2019m definitely considering it, because he might be a more relatable protagonist for the book\u2019s young adult intended audience. Pierre is kind of who Jacques wants to be like because he doesn\u2019t have another role model, but Jacques is the one the readers grow with. So what I\u2019m saying here is, I think your instincts are telling you that someone else might deserve the spot as the \u201cmain\u201d here! Think, as I did, about who grew the most, who has struggles with himself, and who could most relate to the reader. If your main was removed from the plot, could your secondary stand in his own? Maybe you could revise the story so that he\u2019s the main character, or you can make your current main have a more active role, or you could even write a \u201cspin-off\u201d story in addition to your original.

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question. I think part of the problem might lie in how you think of them. Typically, there is only one main character/protagonist. The fact that you are thinking in terms of a second main character tells me you may need to take a look at your story idea. Why do you have more than one main character? Sometimes the story involves a group of people trying to achieve something (Goonies, The Dirty Dozen, etc.), which involves figuring out if there is a leader in the group who may or may not be the official leader. But if you\u2019re talking about someone who is supposed to be more of a sidekick or supporting character, then take a serious look at the story and the character development you\u2019ve done and figure out which one of them is the actual main character. Which character changes as a result of the story action? A good example where the main character isn\u2019t who you\u2019d expect is The Shawshank Redemption. In that film, Andy is convicted of murdering his wife and ends up in prison. The story of Andy\u2019s life in prison and his attempt to escape is told through the eyes of Red, a long-term prisoner. It\u2019s easy to think that Andy is the main character, but he\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually Red. You may have something like that going on in your own story. It\u2019s important to figure out which character is the main character in order to figure out the story\u2019s progression. If you\u2019re following the one who doesn\u2019t change the story will feel underdeveloped and two-dimensional. ",
