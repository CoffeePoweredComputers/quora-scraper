            "answer_text": "An author writes under another name (pseudonym) when (s)he feels it is convenient to do so. Situations which might make it more convenient to do so: Author writes in different genres and doesn\u2019t want fans of one genre to inadvertantly pick up a book that they will not like simply because of his/her name on the cover. Author writes in a genre which may cause a backlash in his/her community or workplace. e.g. writing \u2018steamy romance\u2019 while being a member \u2014 or spouse being a member \u2014 of a fundementalist religious group; writing erotica while being a school teacher and having parents demand the firing of said author. Author prefers to be anonymous for any of a number of reasons: being shy, fears unwanted attention, fears \u2018retribution\u2019 from a group opposed to subject matter that author has in book or books. Author feels that real name is not a good fit for the genre they are writing in: At one time certain women authors would use their initials to disguise their gender when writing science fiction. Similarly, a male author might choose a feminine pseudonym when writing romance, as readers might be put off a romance book by Wolfgang Strongman, where the same book by Beth Dainty might really draw them in; while Beth Dainty\u2019s \u201cBrutal War Between Spacefaring Nations\u201d might sell more if Wolfgang Strongman\u2019s name graced the cover. Author might not want parents/relatives/friends/acquaintences to discover just what s/he wrote especially if it took inspiration from their interactions. So, there are a lot of valid reasons for someone to use a pseudonym. ",

            "answer_text": "In my own experience, if you are known for, say, thrillers and choose to write in a totally different genre, that is one reason to have a pseudonym (author name). I considered doing that when I decided to write a children\u2019s book series for my granddaughters, after having made more of a name with scary stuff (horror, paranormal stuff, ghostly tales), but ultimately decided against it. I did, initially, choose to use my true legal name (Constance) rather than Connie both of which go with my maiden and married names (Corcoran WIlson). It took Amazon a while to figure out that \u201cThe Christmas Cats in Silly Hats\u201d was by the same woman who wrote \u201cThe Color of Evil\u201d series, but, ultimately, they put all of the books on the same author page, so that\u2019s that.
