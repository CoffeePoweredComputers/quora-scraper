            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s answer one important question: Are they notable? In another words, should they have own article? Notability is determined using number of independent reliable sources significantly covering the subject. In another words, if there are enough independent reliable sources you could use for citing all the information a good article should have, they\u2019re probably notable. Secondly, you shouldn\u2019t make a Wikipedia page about someone you know, or yourself. Following Wikipedia policies is quite hard normally (and we\u2019re happy to help), but following Wikipedia policies when you know the person is exceptionally hard, and 99 % of articles created that way is immediatelly deleted. Once those two things are sorted, it\u2019s possible to create a Wikipedia page. You should follow few key rules: neutral point of view and verifiability. Neutral point of view means the article should present facts, facts and nothing but the facts. It should refrain from any subjective claims. For instance, instead of saying \u201cThe singer is pretty\u201d, you should say \u201cThe singer was Miss Europe in 1990\u201d. Verifiability means all non-trivial statements needs to be supported by reliable sources. Reliable means mostly \u201chaving editorial review\u201d, it can be newspapers, books etc. If you\u2019re unsure about anything, you can ask at the Teahouse. ",
