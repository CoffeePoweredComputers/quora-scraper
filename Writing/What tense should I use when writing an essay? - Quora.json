            "answer_text": "Generally, college and school essays are written in simple past tense or past perfect tense. But it is ideal to use simple past tense since it is more concise. More importantly, it is advised to stick to one tense throughout the essay instead of switching between two or three. So if you begin in simple past tense, you must use it throughout the essay rather than switching between past and present or past and future. Also note that if you are expressing your opinions then simple present is used while quoting someone else\u2019s opinion usually is done in simple past tense. ",

            "answer_text": "Tense of essay nowadays different according to subject and topic. When it comes to sciene and technology we also use simple present and simple future also. But what to keep in your mind is about which personal pronoun you using. Generally we use third person but it again depends upon topic. Many time we start our essay with a short story, in that case person changes from 1st to third. Again , generally we use past tense ( simple and perfect mostly) in a general and school level essay. But when it goes to higher level then creativity comes in. I think this will help you. Thank you\u2764 ",
