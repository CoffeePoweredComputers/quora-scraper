            "answer_text": "There is a major nerve that goes through the chest known as the vagus nerve. This nerve when stimulated can slow the heart. Many older people who strain at stool can hold there breath while trying to push out a constipated stool. This is known as a valsalvo maneuver. This triggers the the vagus nerve. The heart can slow dramatically and in some cases the person drops dead on the toilet. This can also be seen as a \u201csinus arrhythmia\u201d when you breath in the pressure in the chest rises, trigging the vagus nerve to slow the heart, while breathing out lessens the pressure and the heart rate increases. On an ECG strip you may notice this rhythmic changes as being in conjunction with the respiratory rate. ",
