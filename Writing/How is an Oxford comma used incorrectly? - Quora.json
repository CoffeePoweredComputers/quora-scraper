            "answer_text": "I think you\u2019re asking how a comma can be used incorrectly. Go to OWL // Purdue Writing Lab for excellent instruction in punctuation. You may encounter people who rage about the Oxford comma - for or against. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. The Oxford comma is a choice (like a preference for tea or coffee). Book publishers require it. Newspapers forbid it. If you\u2019re writing for pay, you do what the company tells you to do. If you\u2019re writing on your own, you make your own decision and stick to it. What pros don\u2019t do is sneer at writers who\u2019ve made the opposite choice. ",
