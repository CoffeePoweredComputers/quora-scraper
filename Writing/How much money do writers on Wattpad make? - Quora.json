            "answer_text": "I can't exactly tell how much but I know it's not a lot if it would come entirely from the app. But they can venture to publishing their books(either self pub or in a publishing house). There's also a new feature on wattpad premium that readers need to buy coins to read chapters from a book. But I don't think they'd be agressive in using that feature since the app was originally made for free reading and writing. This is all my opinion though. ",
