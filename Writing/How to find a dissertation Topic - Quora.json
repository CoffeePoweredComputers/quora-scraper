            "answer_text": "What makes a good dissertation topic? GSAS\u2019s resident expert on the subject is Cynthia Verba, the longtime director of fellowships at the Graduate School, whose own PhD (from the University of Chicago) is in musicology. Her answer: \u201cOne of the most important factors in choosing a dissertation topic is to work on something you really love, enough so that you can contemplate staying with it over a fairly prolonged period of time \u2013 well after you have received the degree. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to have some innate talents in the chosen area. I personally turned to music in my early school years, even before piano lessons, because I found I could sit at the piano and play every popular tune that I knew, along with the harmonies that I apparently heard along with the tunes. Once in college, I developed what has been my lifelong scholarly musical interest, and that is the relationship between theory and practice. Much of my work has revolved around the figure of Jean-Philippe Rameau, who was both a leading theorist and composer. I keep hearing very similar tales from graduate students: once they find a topic they thoroughly enjoy and acquire the necessary skills to tackle, they seem to thrive as scholars. It would be na\u00efve not to add some of the more practical considerations that also help students and scholars to thrive: It needs to be a topic of potential interest to others in the field, not necessarily the \u201clatest fashion,\u201d but at least on themes that have proven to be compelling. And it needs to take into account the dissertation as a genre, meaning a work that makes an original contribution to the field, but by no means striving to be the definitive word on the subject. To put this in another way, a good dissertation topic should be one that will allow you to produce a professional polished piece of work within a limited amount of time and with a limited amount of cost. In this regard, it is most helpful to get advice from experienced scholars on how to limit the scope of a project without limiting the significance of the questions addressed.\u201d Where to Look for Potential Topics Dissertation topics rarely emerge out of the blue; you must proactively search them out. Here are some potential sources: 1.Your own professional interests. What excites and energizes you? What career goals could be enhanced by studying a particular topic? 2. Faculty members, professional colleagues, and fellow students. Listen to their suggestions about potential topics. 3. Professional journals in your field. This is where you can find out the hot topics of the day and for the near future. 4. Librarians. Ask them to help you run a database search on some topic of interest. Make a list of keywords and phrases to initiate the search. The results of a computer search should help you discover whether a dissertation is possible on this topic or whether the topic has been \u201cdone to death.\u201d 5. Dissertations. Review previously written dissertations. Consult Proquest Dissertations and Theses Dissertation Abstracts International and American Doctoral Dissertations, from whom you can order dissertations of interest. Chapter 5 of most dissertations include a section titled \u201cRecommendations for Future Research.\u201d This is a gold mine of potential topics. 6. Oral defense. The discussions that occur during a dissertation\u2019s oral defense often suggest potential topics. Attend as many of these as you can. It opens your eyes to what happens during a dissertation defense. 7. Current theories. Have any new theories come out in your field, or are existing theories being questioned? 8. The Internet. A variety of sources exists on the Internet. 9. Conferences and seminars. Often these deal with current interest areas in the field. Talk with presenters and authors to get their ideas about researchable topics. 10. Outside agencies or professional organizations that conduct research. Excellent resources are the 10 Regional Educational Laboratories, and the American Educational Research 11. Leading scholars in your interest areas. Usually, authors and researchers eagerly talk with someone interested in their ideas and research. Call and find out what they are currently doing, and ask their advice about potential studies. 12. Your current job setting. Are there problems that need solutions in your workplace? Your boss might have a pet topic that could enhance your career opportunities. However, be cautious. If you think a topic might be suggested in which you have no interest, you are better served not to conduct this research. A dissertation is an extensive, scholarly endeavor, and the topic should be one in which you have a strong interest. 13. References in your field. Many handbooks and bibliographies exist in most subject areas. All discipline areas have their own encyclopedias, handbooks, or yearbooks. You can access them on the Internet by keying in your area (e.g., sociology, psychology) followed by the word handbook, yearbook, and so on.

            "answer_text": " The subject of the degree thesis is a complex choice. What you need to do is find a topic that interests you, a question to look for an answer and give you dissertation ideas. It has to be something that you really care about , to avoid the dissertation becoming a frustrating experience. Consider that you will have to spend a few months in close contact with the topic of the thesis you have chosen, so choose carefully. This interest must also translate into a promising idea: a topic or problem that, in some aspect, can be tackled in an innovative way. In order to develop an idea, one can resort to suggestions from third parties and an analysis of the literature, that is, of what others have already done. Even if you have an idea, literature review must be done to make sure that the idea has not already come to others. HOW TO FIND THE TOPIC OF THE DEGREE THESIS Here are some suggestions regarding the choice of the theme: do not focus on too general themes such as safeguarding the planet or hunger in the world . Better a specific, small but current and original theme. Try to think of the interest that a degree thesis in psychiatric rehabilitation on the closure of OPGs (31 March 2015) can have and arouse compared to a degree thesis on psychiatric rehabilitation in general! Maybe you know nothing about this topic: this is the time to learn more! To be more general: better a thesis on the urban organization of green spaces in the EXPO 2015 area rather than on how an urban project of a city green area is drawn up. We hope to have been more immediate! Not wanting to do too much but badly: better a question about a small thing faced with seriousness and completeness , rather than a macro research that is not very useful and \"inconclusive\". Focusing attention on a specific topic has a decidedly positive secondary effect: you will have to take action, move, take the first steps in the world of work. Maybe looking for new contacts in companies. Can the thesis topic potentially be useful for your future as well? THE TOPIC OF THE THESIS WILL SIGN YOUR FUTURE! Exact! In your first entry into the world of work, you will find that if you have done an original thesis, it can be a valid tool and an excellent presentation of your skills. Writing a good thesis can be a great business card for your favorite company. Also work considering this scenario, it will help you. CHOOSE THE TOPIC OF THE THESIS, CHOOSE THE SUPERVISOR Once you have chosen the macro topic, think about the speaker who seemed most up to date on the topic. Try to propose and cross your fingers. Remember that the more proactive you show yourself (e.g. by already bringing an analysis of the existing literature on the topic or a lineup of how you want to deal with the topic), the greater your chances of convincing and your freedom of movement . Perhaps this way you will not risk being subjected to a topic of the thesis chosen by him for his interests and instead you will be able to deepen yours. Do not forget that it must be a subject in which taking the exam has been a real pleasure and has led to good results (at least a 27 is appreciated). Follow our SECRET GUIDE TO THE DEGREE THESIS !

Well, I\u2019m going to explain it, right here, right now. It is a phrase with a mathematical reference. An envelope is a term for the curve that encloses all other curves in a family of curves. When the term was used in aeronautics, it referred to the outer curve describing the limit of an aircraft\u2019s performance. Test pilots were encouraged to push the envelope in order to test the aircraft, and the phrase made it to the common lexicon in Tom Wolfe\u2019s 1979 book about test pilots, The Right Stuff.
