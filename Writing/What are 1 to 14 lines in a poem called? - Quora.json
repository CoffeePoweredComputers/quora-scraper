            "answer_text": "A sonnet ! Sonnets are poems which were written in 14 lines rhyming in (abab/ cdcd/ efef/ gg), and that\u2019s what Shakespeare is familiar by. 1 ex: Sonnet 130: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red; If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. I have seen roses damasked, red and white, But no such roses see I in her cheeks; And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound; I grant I never saw a goddess go; My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground. And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare As any she belied with false compare. 2/ ex: Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day? Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And summer\u2019s lease hath all too short a date; Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or nature\u2019s changing course untrimm'd; But thy eternal summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow\u2019st; Nor shall death brag thou wander\u2019st in his shade, When in eternal lines to time thou grow\u2019st: So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. (hope that helps)! ",

            "answer_text": "A one line poem is a monostich; two lines is a couplet; three lines is a tercet or triplet; four lines is a quatrain; fives lines is a quintain; six lines is a hexastich; seven lines is a heptastich; eight lines is an octave; nine lines is a Spenserian stanza. Ten, eleven, twelve and thirteen line poems don\u2019t seem to have their own names, but rather are referred to as combinations of their predecessors: for example, a ten line poem consists of two quintains or a couplet and an octave. When you put meter into the mix, then you create an additional level of description. For example, a haiku is a 3 line poem with 17 syllables broken up as 5/7/5 - that is, first line has 5 syllables, second line has 7, third line has 5. A sonnet is a 14 line poem with 10 syllables per line (known as iambic pentameter). Hope that is helpful. ",
