            "answer_text": "I like cats a LOT. Of course, I\u2019m one autistic among perhaps a hundred or so million people in the world with autistic traits. It\u2019s hard to generalize about 100,000,000 people. However, taking the question in the spirit intended - more or less, \u201cDo cats have traits that autistics might favor in pets,\u201d I think the answer is clearly yes. One theme of mine is that autistics take in and give off social cues worse, slower, or differently from neuronormal people. Part of that seems to be because we don\u2019t multi-task well - and taking in social cues is the consummate exercise in multi-tasking - and part of it seems to be the converse, to wit, that we end to carry many things out - including social interactions - in linear fashion. Socially adept people don\u2019t put off their social cues in linear fashion, however. Given this, though we can somewhat fall flat socially, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are resistant to charm, manipulation, and social engineering. Dogs are the ultimate charmers - and the ultimate manipulators. I\u2019ve read that dogs are the only non-primate animal that can read human body language fluently. Apparently not even wolves can do that. Modern Dog Magazine online has a sadly undated article on the ability of dogs to read human body language titled How Dogs Read Human Body Language. It\u2019s here: How Dogs Read Human Body Language One highlight of the article is that \u201c\u2026Daniel J. Povinelli, a psychologist at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, found that our closest animal relatives, chimpanzees, were initially quite poor at [the task given in the experiment]. (Actually, so were three-year-old human children, though they were better than the apes.) However \u2026 The dogs could immediately interpret the signals indicating the location of the food four times better than the apes, and more than twice as well as the young children, even if the experimenter was a stranger.\u201d Anyone with a dog knows this. I can\u2019t \u201cread dog\u201d well, but I know that dogs can read me, and I resent their frequent attempts at manipulation, which I read as intrusive begging. Of course, simply not liking dogs does not mean that one favors cats [though I\u2019ve set that up as sort of a dichotomy in this answer], but there ARE reasons to think cats are a good match with autistics. An opinion piece on the website Medical Daily dated July 19th, 2015 is a good read for anyone interested in pets as friends or service animals for people with autism. Here's the article: How Cats Can Help Children With Autism Become More Social The article discusses research and the personal observations of the author - Ed Cara - and goes into some detail on the benefits of dogs, cats and even hamsters for people with ASD. It takes a special look at cats, highlighting how cats seem to be a good match with autistics - perhaps because they seem to have a similar mind-frame - and how cats increase pro-social behaviors and reduce anxiety in people with autism. I have an autistic services cat and an autistic services dog. The cat is a \u201cbarn cat\u201d given to us from a friend in the Indiana countryside. I love her sociability - unlike most cats, she will actually run towards someone if she thinks they are running away from her - but I also love how she keeps her distance. She perseverates like most cats - especially on the fish - and I find that an amusing echo of my own perseveration and \u201ctrances.\u201d I\u2019m not the only one so amused: here\u2019s a link to a humorous book on the matter: All Cats Have Asperger Syndrome: Kathy Hoopmann: 0884667904259: Amazon.com: Books For the curious, here is a picture of my cat\u2019s ESA, or emotional service animal, ID. Emotional services cats for autistics are a real thing:  ",

            "answer_text": "Autistic people don't, as a class, dislike cats. That's the most information I can offer. I know some autistic people who are afraid of animals, some who like dogs and are indifferent to cats, some who like cats very much, and don't like dogs, some who love all animals, and the variations go on. If the asker has a practical reason for asking, such as \"My girlfriend's son is autistic, and I have two cats; will this be a problem if we decide to move in together,\" you need to ask her son, if he is high functioning enough how he feels about cats. If he doesn't have much language, then ask her. Aside from some reason like that, it's kind of a silly question. The only other reason I can imagine is that someone has told the asker that some person can't be autistic because he likes cats, due to this other person being misinformed about the frequency of fear of animals among autistic people. Back when most autistic people spent most of their lives in institutions they rarely were exposed to animals, and so if they did happen to see a pet, they often became frightened because it was unfamiliar. This led to the conclusion that it was common for autistics to be afraid of animals; however, a lot of behaviors that are attributed to \"autism\" are really institutional behaviors, and in fact, there is no \u201crule of thumb,\u201d or whatever, that autistic people are likely to be afraid of animals. Some autistic people have a heightened startle reflex, so animals that appear with no warning, or bark, or make other sudden noises may bother these particular people, but that just means that perhaps a slightly larger percentage of autistic people prefer not to be around animals\u2014 the percentage is still pretty close to what it is for neurotypicals, in my experience. The best that can be said as an answer to this question is that autistic people tend to vary in their like or dislike of pets about the same as other people. Allergies happen pretty much with equal incidence and severity among autistic people too. This is another example of \u201cIf you\u2019ve met one autistic person, you\u2019ve met one autistic person.\u201d ",

I think that\u2019s why a lot of autistic people like us like cats a lot, can\u2019t speak for everyone but I know a lot of other ASD people who own or would like to own a cat because of their softness, calmness and just being there for you and often up for a play and cuddle but not as excitable or demanding.

All that changed about 2 years ago when the neighbors cat decided to adopt my fiance and me. She literally moved in and decided we were going to be her People from now on. Luckily her other Mommy decided to work out a shared custody arrangement (as if you can tell a cat where she can and can't go...) or things could have gotten awkward pretty fast. Since being adopted though, I've noticed that she and I share a lot of similar traits...neither of us like having things moved around, or schedules changed. I'm working my way to having a hospital wing named after me (it feels like) and she completely tweaks out when I'm gone...same as when my fiance has to be away for any length of time over a few hours' time.  I can't think of life without our adopted Owner now (cats aren't owned, they own people) and I wouldn't have it any other way. ",

I have a 15 year old cat Kit who was born to my very first cat (she is the mean cat btw) Anyways n0t all autistic people like cats, I prefer a great dane, an irish settler, a Labrador, a cavalier king Charles spaniel, a st bernard, a great Pyrenees, and 2 coonhounds ",
