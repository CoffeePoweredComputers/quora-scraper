            "answer_text": "Heya, thanks for the A2A. I want to point out real quick that you said books written, not books finished - is a slight technicality, I know, but it changes my answer slightly. Simply because I have not finished writing anything in a very long time - excluding one shots, but I don\u2019t count those. So, this absolutely amazing person in our group NaNo chat created a bot called Sassbot ages before I joined the chat, She\u2019s undergone a lot of changes since I first met her, and one of her newest updates - linking in with the new website, will give you a list of all your past NaNo\u2019s. Here\u2019s mine: NaNoWriMo 2019: 19293 currentlyCamp NaNoWriMo July 2019: 28Camp NaNoWriMo April 2019: 38328,NaNoWriMo 2018: 50597,Camp NaNoWriMo April 2018: 2139NaNoWriMo 2017: 3963Camp NaNoWriMo April 2017: 28330,NaNoWriMo 2016: 38268Camp NaNoWriMo April 2016: 5020,NaNoWriMo 2015: 50121Camp NaNoWriMo April 2015: 12055,NaNoWriMo 2014: 50044,I think some of those numbers are wrong - mainly because I was too lazy to update my word count during camps - until Jester started doing them, then it was a competition. Anyway, now I had a different project for every NaNo, I do not think I have used the same idea twice - even with all my recent rewrites. (As in, I wrote battleships in 2014, and never again, but I would recycle old ideas I started outside of NaNo). Which means! One book for every NaNo done, so 12. Minus this years camp July - Something big happened and I couldn\u2019t do it, but I don\u2019t remember what? Probably another health thing knowing my past year and a bit. So 11, I have worked on at least 11 various books throughout my NaNo Career. Some NaNo\u2019s I\u2019d have one-four projects active especially since I got sick, because I can\u2019t focus on just one story, I need to be able to jump around. I really need to cut down on the amount of stories I have sitting around and actually finish some of them, which I\u2019m kind of working on with all these rewrites? Anyway, let\u2019s say 11 - unless you meant finished, then none. Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "None. I don\u2019t participate in NaNoWriMo. The reason being that as a professional author, I don\u2019t dedicate one particular time to writing; that would be both unproductive and inane. I follow NaNoWriMo on Instagram for some inexplicable reason, but usually their posts seem ridiculous and \u2018high-school-motivatory\u2019 to me. I can\u2019t really explain it, I don\u2019t have anything personal against the program, I just feel that actual authors don\u2019t need programs like it to do their job\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s because I feel it\u2019s promoting yet more fluff writing that\u2019ll be published on amazon without editing, or the writer having to go through the real publishing process, and therefore not learning the lessons real authors learn by doing so. It just encourages a continuous flood of mediocre writing from which there is no rescue. I think it\u2019s a great program for hobbyist writers to bond together over their never-gonna-finish books and get excited about the possibility of actually finishing. One of my high school writing teachers made us participate one year and I thought it was such a massive waste of energy and time when I could\u2019ve easily written just as much, if not more, on my own. I know some people love it and get excited, but I really don\u2019t find it worthwhile. It\u2019s great in how it encourages people to write; that\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s not great in how it produces a vast majority of sub-par drivel and gives the participants unhealthy and unrealistic hope of being published. ",
