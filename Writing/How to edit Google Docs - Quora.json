            "answer_text": "How can you edit someone\u2019s paper on Google Docs? You\u2019ll need their permission, of course. Ask them to click the blue Share box toward the upper right corner. That will open the dialog you see below. From there, they\u2019ll have several options:  They can enter your email address in the box and click Done. Then you can open the doc from your account and edit it.They can click Get shareable link. This will allow anyone to access the document. If they change \u201cAnyone with the link can view\u201d to \u201c\u2026can edit\u201d then you and anyone else who finds the doc can edit it. 3. In either case, they can click can view or the pencil icon and change them to can comment. That will allow you (if they enter your address in the People box) or anyone (if they use the shareable link) to add comments to the doc and make editing suggestions, but not to make changes to the document text itself. We use shared docs at work all the time. It\u2019s a great way for colleagues and teammates to collaborate, and to review each other\u2019s work. The same feature is available for spreadsheets, presentations, and any other Google properties you can access from Drive. If you\u2019re using Google Classroom, your teacher or administrator may have changed the way sharing works. You can always check Google Support for more information. ",
