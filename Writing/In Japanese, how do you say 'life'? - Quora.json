Type in \u201clife.\u201d You will get twenty or so entries with detailed explanations and examples. The next time you want to translate an English word into Japanese, you\u2019d do best to go directly there. One way to say \u201clife\u201d in Japanese is INOCHI \u547d. But that also means \u201cmost important thing,\u201d and so on in that semantic vicinity. In the mid 1980s, I taught a class of American college students studying at Doshisha University in Kyoto (\u201cJapanese and American Humor\u201d). One student told me in puzzled amusement that a little girl in the home where she was staying took an object, said \u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306e\u547d Jane\u2019s INOCHI with a big smile, and symbolically smashed it with her fist, repeatedly, as a game. I was happy to explain to Jane that she meant \u201cJane\u2019s treasured thing,\u201d not \u201cJane\u2019s life.\u201d International plus intergenerational communication! ",
