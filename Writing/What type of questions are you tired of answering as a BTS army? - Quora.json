Are they Chinese? *For the last time they are KOREAN!*Why do you listen to them if you can't understand their language? *Subtitles? Also you guys listen to despacito without understanding a word right?!*Are they girls?*I-*Are they gay?*I don't know. Even if they are that's none of your business*How do you recognize them? They all look the same! *USE. YOUR. EYES.These are the questions asked by my \u201camazing\u201d classmates. (Sigh). It just gets annoying when they tease me with all these questions.
