Here is a simple filter function that reads all the text of a file into a single string, makes a string replace, and then writes the file back out: def replace(file, pattern, subst):\u00a0    try:\u00a0        ifh = open(file, 'r')\u00a0    except:\u00a0        msg = \"couldn't find file \"+file\u00a0        print(msg)\u00a0        exit(1)\u00a0    file_string = ifh.read()    # read contents as a single string    \u00a0    ifh.close()\u00a0\u00a0    file_string = file_string.replace(pattern, subst)\u00a0\u00a0    ofh = open(file, 'w')\u00a0    ofh.write(file_string)\u00a0    ofh.close()\u00a0\u00a0replace(\"c:/temp/test.txt\",\"foo\",\"fox\")\u00a0Here\u2019s another version, except this one reads the file line by line, so it has to use a separate output file: def replace(file, pattern, subst):\u00a0    try:\u00a0        ifh = open(file, 'r')\u00a0    except:\u00a0        msg = \"couldn't find file \"+file\u00a0        print(msg)\u00a0        exit(1)\u00a0    ofh = open(file+\".out\", 'w')\u00a0\u00a0    line = ifh.readline()\u00a0    line = line.replace(pattern, subst)\u00a0    ofh.write(line)\u00a0    while line:\u00a0        line = ifh.readline()\u00a0        line = line.replace(pattern, subst)\u00a0        ofh.write(line)\u00a0    ifh.close()\u00a0    ofh.close()\u00a0\u00a0replace(\"c:/temp/test.txt\",\"foo\",\"fox\")\u00a0",
