            "answer_text": "Is it necessary in formal letters to write subject? In one of the original Winnie the Pooh stories, Eeyore losses his tail and it is eventually found serving as a bell rope at Wol's place. Wol has a sign up instructing visitors to knock if an answer is required and to ring if an answer is not required \u2014 the point being that the bell rope is not connected to anything. Similarly, you can send a formal letter without a subject line if an answer is not required, because lack of a subject line certainly risks not having the letter connected to anything. You can, indeed, send a letter without a subject line, written on pilfered toilet paper, scribbled with a thumbnail dipped in tar, and m myriad other ways, and you might even achieve what you want. But why ring the bell when you want what knocking is more likely to obtain? The step that people often neglect to consider is that the person to whom you address a formal letter is almost always not the first person who reads it. That duty usually falls to a mail clerk or a secretary who doesn't have the time to read your letter. I don't have a correspondence secretary, and I am pastor of a quite small church. Sunday is a day when few Christian organisations or large businesses e-mail, yet I had 51 e-mails to one account and, I think, 12 to the other today (Sunday). I don't know what most of them were about because their subject line was either too lacking or excessively long. If I can't tell immediately what they are about, they risk never being seen. The same happens to mail clerks. They do the sorting, and deliver the mail to the right person or to the right in tray. If that person can't work out immediately where your letter goes, it might go into the under-desk file. Don't take unnecessary risks. ",

IF you do not use a subject line, then you\u2019d best get to the point of the letter in the opening sentence/paragraph. if not, your letter may not receive proper attention for importance. Two examples: Complaint on RX350 Paint (subject line) \u201dI am writing to you, directly, about the \u2018peeling and flaking\u2019 problems with the recent repainting job done on my Lexus RX350 by your restoration department. This was done on a warranty claim on February 4, 2019, service order RX13579.\u201d (Opening sentence/paragraph) Personally, I might just use both to reinforce the message. Hope this answers the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes It is always recommended to use the formal letters to write the subject. The person at the receiver end will first look for the subject. There by he can easily identity the content inside it all about what. Also it is recommended to write the subject in a readable font and it has to be easily readable size. By default if you are using a email application it will highlight the subject of the mail with bigger size font. Also it will have a default font. The subject speaks about the content of the main document. So one needs to be careful in writing the subject that relates with the content. Thank you. MGK ",
