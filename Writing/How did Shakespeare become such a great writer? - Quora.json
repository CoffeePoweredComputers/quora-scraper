            "answer_text": "The full story is a bit more complicated! Shakespeare did enjoy considerable success and fame in his lifetime and if you want a short, light-hearted read on how to \u2018startup like Shakespeare\u2019, I have a blog post on this here. However! The question of how Shakespeare was transformed into \u2018England\u2019s National Poet\u2019, is the focus of a critically-acclaimed book by foremost Shakespeare scholar Michael Dobson. It is not disputed that Shakespeare fell out of fashion during the restoration period. In the hundred or so years between Shakespeare\u2019s death and the early-to-mid-eighteenth century, his plays fell into relative obscurity and were even lost altogether - needing to be rewritten from memory and pieced-together fragments. When Shakespeare was mentioned by restoration-era critics, it was usually to criticise what they saw as his lack of moral virtue and his low-culture taste for dirty jokes and endless punning. He was labelled a \u2018rustic\u2019 - a polite euphemism for an uneducated country commoner, notable only as an example of folk culture. As the eighteenth century progressed, however, Shakespeare began to enjoy a revival that would in time see him elevated to a status far beyond what the man himself experienced during his lifetime. This growing interest - approaching idolatry (or Bardolatry) - would coincide neatly with the growing romantic movement, to which the concept of natural genius was central, and was fuelled by effusive praise from literary heavyweights including Samuel Johnson and Voltaire and the famous actor and theatre manager David Garrick. By the Victorian period, Shakespeare had become core reading for all schoolchildren and his complete works were widely revered as a secular, humanist Bible. The Victorians considered it their responsibility to educate the world in the English mould and Shakespeare was, naturally, part of that project and disseminated to all corners of the British Empire through that lens. In short, Shakespeare became a mythical national hero like King Arthur or Saint George and also an important symbol of British supremacy. This dramatically affected both the ways Shakespeare\u2019s plays were re-written and staged and the political and intellectual prism through which his work was received. It also meant that Shakespeare became necessary to English literature and culture in almost the same way that God is necessary to the Church: Until recently, Shakespeare\u2019s genius simply could not be disputed. So, when we talk about Shakespeare being a great writer with the status he has, it\u2019s important to remember that much of this greatness, or at least the aura of greatness, has been created by other people - either directly by revisions or interpretations of his work or indirectly by reinforcing his cultural status.

            "answer_text": "So one thing to keep in mind is that Shakespeare was not particularly prolific in comparison to those around him. 38 plays over 20 years isn't that many for what others were churning out, but he had a theatre to run and lines to learn, and a family in the country, so he didn't have as much time to just write. Nor did he have the same financial incentives as other playwrights of his time. But here are some thoughts on how - a lot of this is conjecture based on what little we do know. Education: Specifically the kind of education that students had. In addition to learning Latin, English grammar schools taught discourse - they would have to argue both sides of a topic, or take down a famous argument, or follow the logic of a famous argument and use it to argue something else. More than a poetical writer, Shakespeare was a rhetorical one (and I'm going to leave it at that - my master's thesis was on rhetoric and I can go down a rabbit hole really fast. But ask in the comments if you want more on that). Source Material: One of the things that everyone who teaches Shakespeare should teach their students is that Shakespeare stole pretty much every plot he had. That means he could spend much more of his energy on how to tell the story. For example: the story of the death of Julius Caesar was common (Shakespeare read it in Plutarch's Lives), but Shakespeare is the first one to make Brutus a hero rather than a villain. Role models: People make a lot of the Shakespeare-Marlowe relationship (see Shakespeare in Love) that wasn't really there, but what is so clear is that Shakespeare had Marlowe on the brain. And Marlowe knew how to write great verse. Marlowe dies in 1592 - at that point, Shakespeare may have written Richard III, but if he had, he barely had, and that was the only really great play he had written. So Shakespeare has a hero, and that hero dies young. Shakespeare is always trying to be as good as someone who can never fail, since he's dead. An ear for the common man: Most of the other playwrights in Shakespeare's time were university educated, London men. Shakespeare was a country boy with no Oxbridge degree. He lived in the country and in the city, and probably elsewhere (those damned lost years!). Shakespeare is credited with coining thousands of words. He probably didn't coin all that many, but he was the first to write them down.  Player: Shakespeare had to say the words out loud - his own and others - every day. After a while, you get a sense of what works and what doesn't. Financial: One thing that Shakespeare in Love got very right was how playwrights made money - they pitch an idea (or are hired to write a specific story), get some money on spec, turn in some scenes, get a few more pounds, and turn in the final script for a few more. Frequently, they had several folks going at a play all at once. However, Shakespeare spent most of his career as a sharer in the Lord Chamberlain's/King's Men. This meant he probably didn't get paid for the plays that he wrote, but he got a share of the receipts of everything. If he wrote a good play, he got more money.  Balls: One thing we don't give Shakespeare much credit for is that while he wrote only 38 plays of the thousands that were written during his career, he is pretty much the only one who wrote English History plays. And they were very well received, very popular (less so with the other playwrights). The pamphlet that marks the end of the lost years references one of the Henry VI plays, including a point that makes fun of it for expecting audiences to believe that a couple guys are an army. Shakespeare even references this later in Henry V, when the Chorus apologizes that a couple of actors with rusty rapiers are going to be all of Agincourt. But man, does it take some cojones to put that out there as one of your first forays in playwrighting. And it clearly caught on, as he wrote 9 more histories (and this is the one place where Marlowe followed Shakespeare). I'm sure there's a lot more that I'm neglecting right now. There's certainly more than we will ever know. Talent definitely has something to do with it. So does 400 years of editing. ",
