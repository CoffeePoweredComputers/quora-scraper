            "answer_text": "Absolutely! I have stacks and stacks of notebooks and printed pages clipped together or in files everywhere in my home!! I review what I\u2019ve written occasionally and see if I\u2019ve progressed as I desired. But mostly I keep them because sometimes when I am in the throes of writer\u2019s block I think about those stacks and stacks of stuff I\u2019ve written and think: \u201cwell I have done this before so I\u2019m sure I can do it now.\u201d It helps sometimes to just read what you have written before with an editorial eye and see what you would do differently now. I recently took a short story, made it the first chapter of a novel and now am working through some difficulties and may have to leave the story as it is and rewrite to make the first few chapters flow. But that is what you can do if you save all you writing. ",

            "answer_text": "I have always kept everything I wrote; yes even colleges papers. Over the years doing so has served as a way for me to look back and see myself. It\u2019s interesting to see how my opinions have changed over time and to read about some of the things, that I can\u2019t believe I was dumb enough to do. It can be entertaining, to say the least. A lot of my short stories have turned into published novels. ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: Do you keep old essays and papers? Yes, I still keep some of my notes written on pieces of papers, book and film reviews typed on office paper, essay exams written on blue books, and photocopied readings in college with the thought they might come in handy someday in my writing endeavors. I have them stored in a chest, and have been thinking of how to digitize them to save on space. ",
