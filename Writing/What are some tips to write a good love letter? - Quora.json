            "answer_text": "Dear Tara, My hand trembles once again as I recall this name and try writing this letter for the 18th time. 18 is a funny number. It's funny how certain phrases are enough to transport you back in time. To one particular memory, to one particular moment which you never realize on an ordinary day but on a day like this, it's all there. Etched so deep in you like it never went away. 18. The day I first laid my eyes upon you. Nothing felt out of the ordinary. It wasn't one of those scenes out of a romantic movie where I just look at you and realize that you're the girl I wanna spend the rest of my life with. Far from it, I didn't even notice you until you came up to me. Completely engrossed in my Murakami, the last thing I wanted was for someone to interrupt me from Murakami's magical world. But you did. You always were curious about the kind of books I read. My countless suggestions of books to try never worked on you but the sheer curiosity and the twinkle in your big brown eyes always made me happy when I shared about my book. It's funny how with time every memory slowly fades away, the memory of the surroundings and feelings which at one point was like a mild breeze perfectly synchronizing with my heart beat, the sun being the ray of light giving the hope to not get engulfed in darkness is turned into broken pieces of figments in my mind. I still recall the day, sitting across the lake which calmed our spirits when I first held your hands. Sometimes, I just wish I had a camera. To photograph that moment and never let it vanish. But our mind is a tricky little bastard. The feeling of nostalgia mixed with a sly smile still makes me remember your touch. Still makes me remember you. 20 years is no joke. A lot happens over 20 years. A lot did. With the change in time, you change, as a person, sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad. I wish life was more like a game where you could go back to the previous level and change your course of action to achieve an altogether different outcome. I wish you could do that. The funny thing is exactly 20 years back when you told me that you had to move away, I didn't realize the words. It never hit me. When it did, it was too late. Recalling the memories of 6 months, 20 years later sounds funny. It is in a way. For at that time, it didn't feel like it. The strange invisible armour which love gives you, this pseudo strength of nothing going wrong, I lost it. I believe somewhere you did too. The more I think about it, the more it comes hitting back. The first time you made me taste your cooked meat curry. How you had accidentally put on a little too much spice and fell on the floor laughing looking at tears streaming down my face from all the spice. The floor is still the same. The irony being a small tear rolling down as I sit on the exact floor writing about you. Don't get me wrong, I've not let my 20 years be a standstill constantly haunted by the past. I've graduated. Got a job. Recently got promoted but the strength of \"Everything's gonna be fine\" coming out your mouth followed by the small smile was everything I needed to be fine. Don't get me wrong. I don't wanna get back with you. I'm pretty sure you must be doing well in your life, found someone you love and probably have no single memory of me left, but a small part of inside still hopes that you remember. Not me but the memory. Memories are the only thing which remains constant when people change. You never realize the moment you are in right now might become a memory which you would keep pondering upon and wishing for it to last a little longer. I remember how before leaving, you told me to write to you. I should have. My sadness coated with my bitterness of not accepting the situation never gave me the courage to write. I even stopped reading my books. I hated you for snatching away the thing I loved the most. You didn't do it but in a way you did. I'm sorry to be making it like a riddle but today, just going through the old collection, I found Murakami. In it, I found a part of me, a part of you, a part of us, a hidden treasure suddenly coming out from in between the pages. I'd be lying if I told you I didn't miss you, I did and just those occasional nights, lying on the bed trying my best to sleep, my mind drifts back. For the one moment which it keeps on playing. Our first kiss. It was nothing special. It was clumsy, awkward and probably unexpected. We both had a hearty laugh about it. In a way, you never realize when even the most embarrassing and mundane of moments turns into a memory which becomes special. The reason for me writing is not to woo you back or be an unpleasant surprise in your normal life. I just want to show that I still held on to my promise. I'm not in any way the same as I was, I've grown a bit fatter, cut my long hair which you used to love, got a few more tattoos, but how I wish I could undo all of this and go back. I may sound selfish but I miss the person I was when I was with you. I can't explain whether it was a better version of me than what I am right now but that person somewhere along the way died out with only fading memory etched somewhere deep in my subconscious. You remember the promise we made to each other? I promised you that I'll never forget you. Maybe you think I broke that by not contacting you for 20 years but I know I haven't. I hope this letter finds you in good health. One last thing I have to ask, the same which I asked my brother a few years before his death from Dementia, Do you remember me? Love always Sahil. ",

            "answer_text": "For many, the act of penning a good old fashioned love letter still means something. Written word still has power. It still touches people. For writers and bloggers writing is therapy, passion, and creativity. For readers, it\u2019s escapism, entertainment, and enjoyment. We all seem to romanticize the concept of delivering our love through words. It almost seems impossible to keep such a loaded message compact, to say \u201cI love you\u201d and have the person be convinced. So it needs to be descriptive and must have some reason so as why you chose this particular medium to convey your feelings. Its preface of your letter has to be like: \u201cI make more sense in writing than I generally do in person. But anyway, you should hear or rather read me out, because it could be to your advantage and after however long it\u2019s been that we\u2019ve known each other, you can take five minutes to hear my side of it\u2026\u201d Then main body of your letter is heart and soul of you letter and for writing this part you must: speak from your heart.Add personal details.Admit feelings. Share emotions.Share things that only the two of you would know about.Remember to include the date and a special sign-off.Include some old pictures to onset cherish able memories.Close: Be extravagant. As much as you might mean it, don\u2019t end with \u201cSincerely,\u201d \u201cCordially,\u201d \u201cAffectionately,\u201d \u201cAll best wishes\u201d or \u201cYours truly.\u201d Remember, too, that if your beloved actually needs your name and address on such an intimate declaration to distinguish your note from the others he or she regularly receives, perhaps your relationship hasn\u2019t yet matured sufficiently for your emotions to be immortalized in ink. Still you can choose: \"Love your name\" Essay editing: The essay writer should proofread the essay after completion. Editing will help the writer to correct spelling mistakes and check if the content is repeated. Several hours later, read it aloud again and edit it again. I hope this is helpful! ",
