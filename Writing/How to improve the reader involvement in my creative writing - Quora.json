            "answer_text": "Although answers may vary widely, my personal experience has taught my that empathy is a vital element of any form of writing. If a writer desires to involve the reader, the text must leave room for the reader to be freely involved In the work. There must be an alluring sense of character in the writing as character is the auxiliary for empathy. Character is a metaphorical sum of man. People are inherently drawn to passion, and a well-articulated and personally crafted work resounds inspiration. Like it or not, one\u2019s personality enlivens one\u2019s craft; the matter is expressing it well. External attributions proposed as \u201c\u201ccharacter\u201d for purely cosmetic purposes distract and may disenchant the audience. A deeper, true sense of character comes from personal insight and dimension. If you have something important to express through the kaleidoscope of creative writing, it must be written. This means one may engage their audience with a premise as bizarre as one so desires as the key to involvement is how important and profound its roots may anchor. With framing the artist in the center, overindulgence is easily approached, however. The key is this: uphold what you want to express in your writing, not who\u2019s expressing it. If you truly believe in the importance of your writing, then stave off the urge to flaunt the artist. Personality will naturally ebb its way. The way to involve your readers in your writing is to involve yourself in it, tastefully and purposefully. ",
