            "answer_text": "Yeah sure, ON Weverse. There are many instances in which BTS have replied to their fans\u2019 questions and even praised them for some or the other thing. Let me tell you one instance: One Army wrote that she likes V more than her husband. So on this V replied, really and said something which I really couldn\u2019t understand. They can also get frustrated: One Army suggested V to marry her. Then V\u2019s reply was: \u201c Don\u2019t do/say things that can make your idol feel frustrated. Although he said that he was laughing on her suggestion but through his comment it was clear that he was angry. How savage! ",
