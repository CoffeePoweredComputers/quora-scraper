            "answer_text": "It depends on many factors. It depends on how knowledgeable are you about the topic, depends on how motivated are you on writing, depends on the format of the document, whether it is double-spaced or not. Also, since the metric is based on page, not on words, you can easily do this by writing short chunks of paragraphs. But based on experience, since I write blogs too, and blogs are just a cousin of essay, except written in a fun way, then I could estimate around 2\u20133 hours, provided that you are focused, away from any evil distractions (twitter). An hour from that estimate is allotted to gathering relevant information. Half an hour for outlining, and the rest is writing and editing your craft. ",
