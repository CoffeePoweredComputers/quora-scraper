            "answer_text": "I want to applaud you for seeking out ways to elevate your writing. It's a tremendous skill to have. Transitions serve as one of the most important elements of good writing (in my opinion). We generally wouldn't say something like:  I love riding my bike. I was hit by a car yesterday.  While we could certainly speculate that these two statements are related, we really have no idea if they actually are. Was this individual hit by a car while riding their bike? Or were they jaywalking and hit by a car in an intersection.  Without some sort of transition, we are left connecting the dots ourselves. While this is an extreme example, it does illustrate why transition sentences are so vital to written (and all other) communication. In fact, mastering the art of transitions is one of the best ways to drastically improve your writing. For that reason, it takes time and practice to do this quite well. You've specifically asked about transition words. While transition words definitely help to improve flow and readability, they serve more to the \"science\" rather than the \"art\" of transitioning.  If you really want to master transitions, consider those who are some of the greatest at this of all: comedians. A comedy routine moves from one topic to seemingly unrelated ones. Great comedians are able to do this without the audience ever mentally pausing and realizing it. That's because they've mastered the art of the transition. If you want to read more about this, see some real-life examples, and learn how to start doing it within your own writing, I highly recommend you read a blog post I published: It's Easy to Write Good Transition Sentences. We'll Show You How! I'm sure you will find it quite enjoyable and extremely informative. Kudos and best of luck on your journey to becoming a better writer! ",

            "answer_text": "I may not voice a majority view, but here goes: If an essay is well organized, with ideas that move and progress logically and smoothly, the transitions almost take care of themselves. Smooth transitions (paragraph to paragraph, I assume?) don't always require choosing a word from a list if the development is coherent.  Alternately, you might consider the transition list to be like training wheels.Learn, use the list, play with the list, and then drop the list as you become a strong writer. ",
