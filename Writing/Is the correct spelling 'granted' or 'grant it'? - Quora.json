            "answer_text": "You\u2019re comparing two different uses of the verb \u201cto grant\u201d. Both spellings are correct if used in the right context. If you make a request, that request can be granted. So you might use it like this: \u201cThe request was granted\u201d The verb is in pluperfect. In case of \u201cgrant it\u201d; it is not part of the verb. It just replaces the subject to be granted. \u201cIt\u201d is a pronoun. It does not belong to the verb \u201cto grant\u201d My guess is that you hear someone saying \u201cgranted\u201d that sounds like \u201cgrant\u2019it\u201d because of a locla way of speaking. But the spelling will still be \u201cgranted\u201d ",
