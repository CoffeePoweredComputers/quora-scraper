            "answer_text": "Been there and done that. Several times! My first major, serious suicide attempt (by which I mean that I was not ambivalent about dying and nearly succeeded at it) was by asphyxiation via carbon monoxide poisoning. I wore my favorite dress (unfortunately cut off me in the emergency room), took a pillow along with a couple other personal mementos, and left my suicide note propped up in the passenger seat. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I wrote, because in cases of suicide or attempted suicide, the police always confiscate the note. I remember that I did a lot of apologizing and begging for forgiveness over both how difficult I\u2019d been to live with and the fact I was choosing to leave this world. I asked for them to attempt to understand that I simply couldn\u2019t bear the pain and anguish of living anymore. I asked for a few of my favorite belongings to given to specific people and that my dog be well taken care of. I think I added a couple of lines from a poem I liked. Anyway, my parents never even got to read it because the police took it. My second suicide note was much the same except in that one I clearly expressed my anger towards a certain person and asked that they be investigated for the crimes they committed against myself and others. By the most recent attempt, I\u2019d finally gotten wise and left my note where a family member would find it later, instead of beside my body for the cops to take. I thought about looking for the note to add to this answer, but frankly I don\u2019t want to read it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty much the same. An attempt to explain followed by pleas for forgiveness and understanding. At the time the suicide note is written, the person is usually not thinking clearly and truly believes that they are doing their loved ones and the world in general a favor by taking themselves out of it.

            "answer_text": "Dear readers\u2026. I\u2019m fine\u2026. just answering a question. Question: If you were to commit suicide; what would your suicide note say? To whoever is reading this; please know that this wasn\u2019t me\u2026.. I\u2019ve been gone for so long I can\u2019t even remember who I am anymore. The pain of living the past 30 some years trapped in a body that isn\u2019t mine have taken their toll and the ghosts have come to play. I can\u2019t see any way past the pain on a road that\u2019s taken me from that bright eyed little boy to this path of being close what what I had hoped would be a beautiful woman. I\u2019m so sorry that I could help so many, but in the end I couldn\u2019t save myself when I needed to most of all. Mom; please please don\u2019t blame yourself for this. I knew it was hard on you the moment I told you that I came out to you, that you couldn\u2019t understand the changes that I was going through, the pain behind my eyes that told a story so close to dad\u2019s. You said I was strong, but in the end I just got tired of fighting and couldn\u2019t take it any longer. Please know that I love you and I don\u2019t hurt anymore. Whether there is a heaven or a hell or just nothingness awaiting me; you were the best mother I could have asked for. (Older sister); I know we never got along, and we tended to be at each other\u2019s throats half the time but know that I did care about you. Please help take care of mom through this, but remember to take care of yourself too. (Middle sister); You were the one that came to talk to me after my first attempt, and I always thought of you as my closest sibling. Between musicals and theatre and everything it brought me for feeling. It helped, please watch out for (her daughter) and help her to see that I\u2019ve always thought she was a great kid, even through all my groundings and firings of her. Take her to New York again for me since I\u2019ll never be able to go. (Youngest sister); I know you\u2019ve lived through pain, different from mine but still painful, please remember that you deserve love and to be cared for. Don\u2019t forget that as the years roll on; no matter how far away you are, you are loved. (Brother); you knew me as Scott for most of your life, and I know I gave you so much trouble throughout, between the teasing and the trouble and the yelling. I never told you this, but I always kept an eye out for a mustang that I would buy for you as a gift. If there\u2019s any money left over from my death I want you to get one for yourself. (Oldest nephew); you don\u2019t need any words from me, you\u2019ve grown from that adorable little baby that I first met so many years ago to a strong young man, you\u2019re the one I never had to worry about and as the years roll on, you\u2019ll grow more into your grandfather. Keep your chin up and remember that he\u2019s still proud of you. (Middle nephew); life has been hard for you, you never got the fair deal in life that you should have had, but you\u2019ve grown. My favorite memories have been helping you with your computer, There\u2019s that funny little one in my room that I called Jet, please take it and remember me when you play it. (Oldest niece); I\u2019ve watched you suffer, and I know my comments may have stung a little, especially about Supernatural. My first thought when I watched it was that it wasn\u2019t that bad, but I wouldn\u2019t tell you that. You are hereby permanently ungrounded and unfired. Please don\u2019t give up on your dreams, no matter where life takes you. I know that you never had a decent computer for posting your videos, so Schindler is yours. It was my main system for a long time, and its components will be enough to help you get out whatever you need to. Please remember to smile, and don\u2019t you ever forget that you\u2019re beautiful. I told you to listen to Shane Koyczan\u2019s \u201cTo This Day\u201d and reminded you that you need to look in that mirror again. I\u2019m proud of you for getting this far, don\u2019t be afraid to follow your dreams kid. (Youngest niece): I know I kept joking about selling you to random countries and the circus. Please know they were always with love and that it was just teasing. I always looked at you and thought what I might have been if I were born female. Don\u2019t you ever give up on life, your journey is still new and exciting. You\u2019ll find your place yet. (Youngest nephew); you\u2026 you were the silliest little one we had, between running before walking and your silly \u201cwounded deer\u201d crawl. Don\u2019t be afraid to break from your shell. Don\u2019t forget to have fun though and that you\u2019re loved. (Girlfriend); I am so, so sorry. You have no idea how much it meant to have you in my life. We did have our rough spot where I pushed you away, and yet you came back to me. I never deserved your love and yet you gave it to me. You showed me how beautiful I could be, you took a chance on me and brought me happiness unimaginable. That night in the gay bar was the happiest I have ever been, even though it was only a half hour before I made us leave, I nearly cried myself to sleep that night from happiness. No one will ever know how happy you made me. Every time we talked you saved me. My ghosts just caught up, make sure that little girl knows how much I loved her and that she\u2019ll go so far in life. You\u2019re the best mother she could ask for. You will love again, you\u2019ll find someone to give you all the love that I never could and you will be happy. Just remember that for a while, you were my love. This is the hardest goodbye, I wanted you to see me crying tears of joy at our wedding at Glensheen, and now you get to see me buried. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way, but you saw the same pain\u2026 please know I tried so hard for you, you bought me the borrowed time I needed to get this far. (girlfriends daughter); I have loved you since long before you ever knew how to speak; every video of you that your mother sent gave me a smile and a giggle. Even though you never got to meet me, I loved you as my own daughter. I was so happy to show you my ambulances in a video chat and wanted to show you them in person, but I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re headed for the medical field with how much you love ambulances and giving shots. I promised your mother you would get my second stethescope that I ever owned\u2026. and you\u2019ll still get it, but once you decide where you want to go in life, and when you do get into your field, there\u2019s a Littman Cardiology IV waiting for you. Please use it and remember that there are others out there that love you. There\u2019s also an old pair of trauma shears that are going to be yours once you\u2019re old enough. They served me well in the field, just as I know they\u2019re going to serve you. They\u2019re a little worn and may be a little scratched and dull, but they still have a long life to serve, and you still have a long life to live. I love you always little girl, just like I do your mommy and we both love you. (Boss); I know when you first had me joining you were concerned. Between codes and crashes you watched me grow to where you had me, and I know you were trying to get me ready to take your place. I know you told me long ago to not let this job consume me, but it did. Please know that your friendship and leadership was the best thing I could ever ask for. I would have literally followed you to the gates of hell and beyond. It will take time to put things right, but I know the service will still be in good hands as long as you\u2019re head. I don\u2019t ask for much, but please make sure that the next generation knows that they\u2019re not alone. (There are some people on here, but they\u2019d get their own personal messages, and I\u2019m not in the mood to give that out. I hope they know who they are, but if not, well hopefully they never need to find out.) Some final requests\u2026. Songs: We Are The Fallen- I Am Only OneEvanescence- Breathe No MoreIcon For Hire- The GreySixx A.M.- SkinChristina Perri- HumanSarah McLachlan- AngelBurial: Open casket if possible, I want to be dressed as Scarlett though\u2026. Its who I always longed to be\u2026 for my actual burial, please cremate me and scatter me at Split Rock or over Duluth, you know my heart has always been there. As for a head stone\u2026 you can place one for me in the cemetery but please put my name there as Scarlett Alexis. Afterwards, please stop at Fitgers and have a beer for me. I love you all and thank you for having me in your lives.  Well\u2026 now that I\u2019ve gone through all that, excuse me while I dry the tears. Please remember that if you\u2019re feeling depressed or suicidal to get help, there is a light at the end of that tunnel and its not a freight train. ",
