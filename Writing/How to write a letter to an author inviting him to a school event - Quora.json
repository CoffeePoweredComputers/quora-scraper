            "answer_text": "Being a writer, I guess, I can answer this one. The letter I\u2019d like to see for my invitation would not necessarily be the best formatted or the best edited letter. It should convey some important stuff like: Make it interesting by including how the students might be inspired by him. Some kind compliments on his books and appreciation of his previous talks will be a nice place to start.State the reason why do you want to invite him over for a talk. It can be anything like \u2018teacher\u2019s day\u2019 etc. but you need to exactly state the reason, why he/she would be the best possible person to do it.At last if there is any payment involved, make sure you make reference to the same. If possible talk this over with him on the phone or with his/her manager. Matters of finances and payments should be dealt professionally.At last some general advice. Just keep the letter max. 2 pages long and make sure that you use the best possible words and the grammar is correct. That should do the trick! ",
