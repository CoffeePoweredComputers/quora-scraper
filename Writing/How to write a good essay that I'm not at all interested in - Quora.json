Write about what you care about, and write to someone who cares.Good tips on esmart.org also If you have to write about your business but can\u2019t get started, pretend your husband wants to know what you do for a living. Write an email or write a letter to him. If you\u2019re writing a paper for school, imagine that your teacher is really interested in reading every word you write. Too much to imagine? Pretend that you\u2019re writing an article for your favorite magazine. Or pretend you\u2019re writing to your grandmother or your best friend or your long-lost childhood friend. If you can\u2019t find someone who cares about what you have to say, imagine someone who does care. For example, I care. Don\u2019t you feel better already? If the thought of writing an email or letter still makes your words bottle up, make a phone call. Leave a long answering machine message for yourself, and then type up what you said. Call a friend and have them take notes while you talk. Anything to let the words loose. ",

A way round that is to pretend to yourself, that you are explaining the topic to someone who finds it just as tedious as you do. (In my case, if I had to write about home renovation that\u2019s how I\u2019d feel). Given that success in this will help your studies, you can find motivation! ",
