By itself Space has no intrinsic meaning, because it is only half of Time/Space. Expansion of Time/Space after the Singularity creates the illusion of Space. However, it is a useful concept for us to use within our personal space. If we accept Time and Space as entities, them we can measure things within our Reletivity Bubble and their relationships with other, which seems to have some survival value. Aether is actually not that crazy an idea. The idea that something called \u201cnothing\u201d can actually exist is not proven. How can nothing be something? How can anything come from nothing? Therefore Space must be filled with something. And, in fact it is. All Space in our Space/Time reality is filled up. With Fields and Photons, particles and anti-particles being created and destroyed. That was Space\u2026 What does \u201cexist\u201d mean anyway? ",

            "answer_text": "No \u2014 just on average we usually experience it as three-dimensional. The main point here is that we can measure how some particles interact and then mark these events as coordinates in spacetime (t,x,y,z). For normal flat-space (no mass etc.) conditions, we can correlate these coordinates using some parameters (the speed of light, for example), in general relativity we \"warp\" them, in quantum mechanics they lose their \"precision\" and introduce the quantum spin to compensate our inability to constrain it to three-dimensional geometry only etc. Everything aforementioned points to that our notion of space(time) is not complete, so giving properties to vacuum or thinking of it as a predefined background is rather questionable. In my opinion, though. ",
