            "answer_text": "Hello there Mary Ann, The importance of quantitative research[1]in ANY scientific endeavor is that it is the the basis of the Scientific Method:[2] Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study of scientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by which that success is achieved. Among the activities often identified as characteristic of science are systematic observation and experimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formation and testing of hypotheses and theories. How these are carried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like these have been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity from non-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical form of scientific method or methods should be considered science (see also the entry on science and pseudo-science). As far as researching either SARS-CoV-2 or the disease COVID-19,[3] it is vital to use the Scientific Method.[4] This allows for use of the data obtained by other researchers after peer review, or not (though the \u201cnot\u201d option is rather \u201cover the top\u201d risky). To me, it is the only method to research, because the alternative qualitative research[5] is nigh pseudoscience based on personal opinion, apocryphal stories, cognitive bias and often fascinating statistical analysis. But then, maybe I\u2019m just a grouch.
