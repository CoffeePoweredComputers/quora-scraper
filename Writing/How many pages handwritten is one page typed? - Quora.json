            "answer_text": "There are two main factors. 1) How small your write 2) How you typed page is set up. I have a son that writes so small, I found that generally a page and a half of his handwritten was about 3 pages typed. But that is unusual. As Peter Bradley noted, you can usually expect around 250 words per typed page, if it is \u201cnormal\u201d sentence & paragraph structures. Statistically, the average handwritten page puts about 10 to 12 words per line. Depending on the white space between lines, etc. you will usually find a handwritten page will run between 100 to 150 words per page. But again, that is statistically so your actual may vary from that. If you want to know your average, I would first copy a good fill text, something like Lorem Ipsum (this may help: How-To Insert Lorem Ipsum Text Into Microsoft Word 2010 and 2007), and see how many words you end up with one one page.

            "answer_text": "This may be difficult to gauge because there are dependent factors such as font size, line space, font type and letter spacing. For example, I can write with my normal handwriting and fit around 200 words on a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper. Typing this, you can increase or decrease the font size, style, line and letter spacing and achieve varying word counts. #triniscribe on Instagram ",
