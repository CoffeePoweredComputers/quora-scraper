            "answer_text": "That's not possible. If you are talking about quality content, that's not possible. On the other hand if you are talking about these viral content websites like BuzzFeed, you can create more than 6 articles a day because almost all the articles are short and generic list articles. Some of these articles are also YouTube videos.  Now, if I am a content writer who is working for a similar viral website, I don't have to create unique content. I just have to copy trending ideas from social media websites and make a post of 500 words and I am done. It will take me around 3 hours to write 4 articles.  So those are 4 articles, what about videos and other things? I can easily search for trending videos and topics through twitter hashtags, Facebook trending corner and Google trends, and then copy and paste these videos directly to the website. It will require me some work but still I will be able to post approx. 4-6 videos a day.  In total, the number of articles that I could potentially post is ~8.  Now, if we talk about niche blogs, it is a different ball game. If you want quality, you have to compromise on the quantity. A single person cannot write that much articles in a day and hope to get any positive reaction from its readers.  A blog article requires at least 1 hour of research, 30 minutes of image searches and 30-60 minutes of post formatting and crafting. That's the reason why big blog websites like The Smart Passive Income Blog only have 1 article per day. That one article is long and brief. The author covers everything about the topic. The quality speaks for itself. ",

            "answer_text": "A content writer is susceptible to this kind of notion that he/she must write above 1000 words, especially for a startup on a daily basis. Let me tell you, the production of 100% unique content that\u2019s worth 1000\u20131500 words, takes time, energy, research & lots of concentration. It depends on the industry vertical one is writing for & style of content as to how long it takes to research & produce content that is proofread & ready to publish. Remember, there are two sides of a coin. If you are just asking about content in edit mode, then it might soar up to 2000\u20133000 words (again depending upon niche). And if it\u2019s about same-day publishing, then it might do justice to the writer if he/she can write 1500 words (on a given topic). The fact is, many content hiring companies do not understand the difficulty level of the task. It\u2019s not easy to produce a given number of words which shall be publishable on the same day. You need to an editor to help with editing part then. The greater the accuracy, the more research & concentration is required. On the contrary, a book talks about only one topic at a time, for example, it might be fictional or no fictional that requires at least 200 pages to announce itself as a book. Generally a novel might take up to 1\u20133 years depending upon topic, index, style, formatting, editing & publishing guidelines. Articles for web community, blogs & books differ like the moon & the sun. ",
