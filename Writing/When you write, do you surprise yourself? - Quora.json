            "answer_text": "Yes. I LOVE this question. I recently worked on rewrites for a series, Code Raven. I really enjoyed the process. Now, as authors, it\u2019s not our favorite thing to work on rewrites, editing, proofreading\u2026 actually I would like my work to miraculously be perfect at the first draft stage. But that\u2019s not the case. The series I was working on moved along quickly. Of course the usual grammatical errors showed up and things out of sequence, normal for me. But what surprised me more than anything, was how good the series is. I mean, I know my writing is good, but my story-telling is even better. I write mystery and action that keeps me excited. I fully live in my stories and get all involved in my characters. I can imagine every aspect of their lives. For example, all day today, between FB, WordWars and constant trips to the kitchen for coffee, I\u2019m working on Silk Road, a novel #6 in the Code Raven series. I was in Geneva, in this wonderful brownstone walk up, with my MC, a bibliophile spy, and his Bombay Cat with coppery eyes. I looked out his window with him, and tasted the caviar and vodka he served and shared with his cat. Wow, it was an amazing experience. If I get this excited in my action/adventure/international crime books, can you imagine how I surprise myself when I\u2019m writing steamy sexual encounters!!?!! If someone had told me how much fun I would have writing novels I would have started to write them and continued so much earlier in life. I\u2019ve found the perfect place to live my dreams. I travel the world in my books, and somewhat in my life. I live in Mexico and recently spent a month in Paris. In both places I have my characters living, working, and getting into delicious scenes and exciting encounters. So yes, today I\u2019m totally in awe of the way I weave a story. If I keep myself entertained, I imagine my readers are very happy also. Now all I need is to be read by a major influencer or a Netflix producer. My Code Raven Series would rock on TV or the big screen! Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "When you write, do you surprise yourself? Yes, I do. Writing is the way I communicate with myself and find out what I know. I am often astonished by what I know, what things I have known for years, decades. I am surprised by the clarity of my knowing, and by my occasional lucidity and wit. When I'm funny it surprises me so much I burst out laughing like I am not the one who conceived the humorous bit. At times, I experience writing like I am channeling. This happens when I am writing a book. Once I am connected to the place where the writing comes from, and given to the rhythm of the voice, I am possessed by it. It speaks in me day and night. On my way to the bathroom at four AM, I pick up dialogue where I left it at two. On my way back to bed, I tap out lines on my laptop. I wake at ten, and resume typing. \"The voice\" never stops. I carry a notebook in my car to scribble in at red lights. Not all of this \"channeled\" writing is good, but all of it is strewn with treasures, clues and signposts. Often, when I write Quora answers, I feel compelled by the topic for no discernible reason to myself. I feel like an infant desperate for a cookie with no words to ask. So I start making sounds, babbling, until I find my voice, get in sync with it, and unpack what I felt. Often, I am surprised by the content, and by the competence, like a baby stunned to hear itself say \"cookie.\" ",
