            "answer_text": "Le and La are definite articles, similar to saying the chair or the dog. I\u2019ve already written on how these words work in Spanish and it\u2019s not much different in French, however, I\u2019ll be adding one bonus word. The definite articles are used before the noun, such as the word the is in English. There\u2019s not too much difficulty, but you may be confused about when to use Le or La, and this is pretty straightforward as well.  Cover photo :>  First, you need to know the grammatical gender of the word in question. This is if the word is feminine or masculine, throughout my years of studying French I\u2019ve learned that if it ends with an E, it\u2019s most probably feminine. Dictionaries are always your best friend here, so use one if you\u2019re confused. Now that you have the gender, you just have to pick one. Le is used for masculine words while La is used for feminine words.  Oh but there\u2019s a catch in French, that bonus word I mentioned at the beginning. If the word starts with a vowel (you should already know those), you won\u2019t use either, and just go with l\u2019 instead.  If you\u2019re using the plural, however, drop l\u2019 and go with les. Les can be used for both feminine and masculine, as well as for words starting with a vowel.  Thanks for differentiating my answer, Zinedine ",
