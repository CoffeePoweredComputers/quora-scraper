It\u2019s actually a Snarry, in which Harry and Sev become lovers. But Lily is watching from the afterlife. Initially she is angry and still hates Sev but it gradually gets to the point where she\u2019s no longer sure which of the two she\u2019s more jealous over. It\u2019s *extremely* well written. ",
