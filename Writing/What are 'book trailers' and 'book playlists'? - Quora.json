            "answer_text": "Book trailers are little book commercials. They\u2019re meant to drum up interest. I don\u2019t think they work too well. Vanity publishers love to sell them as part of a package at about $2000. I think you could do it on the cheap and get about the same impact. Book playlists are often found in YA novels. They\u2019re curated selections of songs related to the story and characters. I read a novel called Black Box in the YA genre, and it had a playlist. I found it utterly stupid and pretentious. I didn\u2019t like the novel, though. It was very not my taste. (Specifics would be spoilers.) I make a novel playlist as I write, personally, but I wouldn\u2019t perpetrate it on the audience unless music selection was a huge element in the story. For instance, a one of my novels is set in a car. A woman who\u2019s engaged to one identical twin falls in love with his brother during a car trip to Indiana (from NYC) to fetch her cat back from potentially-the-Mafia. The music they select as they go is huge to their personalities and backstories and their emotional connection. If I gave anyone a playlist with a book, that\u2019d be the one. So, the trailers are promotional tools, and the playlists are \u201cextra goodies\u201d at the back of the book. I\u2019ve got a couple novels with recipes at the back, some with book-club questions and stuff, and a couple have playlists. It\u2019s all out there with the goal of making the book sell. ",
