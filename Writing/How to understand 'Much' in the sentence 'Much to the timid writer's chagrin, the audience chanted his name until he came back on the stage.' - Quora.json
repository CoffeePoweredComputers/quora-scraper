Rather than saying: \u2018The writer was a timid man, and so he felt pretty uncomfortable when the audience began chanting his name to bring him back on stage\u2019 - this writer has chosen to stress the \u2018chagrin\u2019 the subject of the sentence feels in a more concise, powerful way. This type of writing is an example of the flexibility of the English language, and how you can choose to depict situations in different ways.
