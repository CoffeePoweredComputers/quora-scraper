            "answer_text": "Honestly, I would say that it depends on several things. For one, what was the fight about? There are some fundamental things over which I would drop a friendship. Without going into what those are for me, is this the case for you? If it was, I\u2019d suggest making new friends with whom you do not have fundamental irreconcilable differences. Second, what was the tone of the argument overall? Were there things said that you (or they) can\u2019t get past? Basically, IS it repairable? Generally, I say that it\u2019s never a bad thing to make peace after an argument, but I can\u2019t say absolutely one way or the other without knowing a lot more. The fact that you are asking inclines me to think that it may be repairable, and worth the attempt. Just be ready for rejection. They may not be as prepared to forgive and forget as you are, although one would always hope that they are. ",

            "answer_text": "Try to repair things with one friend at a time. It really depends on the huge fight. What did you do? My friend had BPD and would have huge fights with my group at least 1 time every 6 months. We eventually all just got tired of his bs. It was too much of a burden to bear. His good times werent worth being around him during his bad times. He did so many f*ed up things. ",
