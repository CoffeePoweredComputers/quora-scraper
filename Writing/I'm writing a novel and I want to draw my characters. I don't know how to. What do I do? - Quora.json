            "answer_text": "A lot of people have suggested you ask an artist friend or an artist you know to draw your characters, but do keep in mind that art is a learned skill and a trade and a skilled artist should be paid for their work even if you have a close personal relationship with them. If you'e going to include the art in a published book, I would definitely recommend commissioning a freelance artist! I know Merwild has done this sort of work before, although their commissions are currently closed. Most artists do this kind of portraiture, but I would personally recommend the work of domirine, Marilyn Moats, C. Bedford, and Charlie Bowater. If you would like to license the design of these characters for your use only, I believe you would need to pay for that license as well. I don't think pictures would detract from your description or from the readers\u2019 ability to imagine them on their own; I've never had that problem as a reader or as a combination writer/artist. If you're looking to learn how to draw, it's a long and arduous process, but I can recommend a few resources in addition to those already listed by other answers: Istebrak: This YouTube channel is filled with tutorials and critiques, and Istebrak also does classes and private tutoring.Marco Bucci: Most of his videos are about painting, but they\u2019re short and sweet, and I\u2019ve learned several valuable lessons from them.New Master\u2019s Academy: They have a huge catalogue of instructional videos, although you will have to pay a monthly subscription fee in order to access most of them.Good luck!

            "answer_text": "I was precisely in your situation last year. I wanted to write my stories but also draw the scenes and characters. Unfortunately even my stick figures were too ambiguous. So I enrolled in a drawing class, and have since enrolled in other drawing classes. Now my stick figures look like anthropomorphic sticks instead of vague shapes. I am in the beginnings of my first serious novel, there are about 200+ drawings in the story, it is a learnable skill, trust me when I say I have zero natural talent. But as long as you are not too hung up on how much your drawings do not look like the master\u2019s of the craft, as long as they are recognizable, that is all that is required. You would be surprised how much the story matters and how well you tell it matters, and how little the drawing itself matters. Not that really great drawings are not enjoyable, because of course they are. But, you have not spent your life learning to draw, as I have not either. So what we have to do is to play on our strengths. Find a good story and tell it well. The rest is easy. ",
