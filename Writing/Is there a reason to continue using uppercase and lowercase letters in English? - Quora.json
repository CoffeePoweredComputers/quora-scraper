            "answer_text": "Like punctuation, capital letters are signposts indicating on-ramps, exits, distances, hazards etc. They help us navigate through the flow of words and minimize the amount of interpretation required for understanding. As an example does \"ma\" mean mother, or MA (Massachusetts,) or Mr. Ma or or M. A (Monsieur A,) or M.A. (Master of Arts.)     There are always going to be glitches in communication but use of upper and lower case, punctuation, and grammar minimizes misunderstandings.     The most important reason is that using upper and lower case is the norm that lets us communicate clearly, and if your child is not comfortable with the standards it becomes more difficult to function in our society. Once familiar enough with contemporary grammar, that child is free to use it or not as circumstances dictate.      Although e.e. cummings avoided capitals in his poetry, he used them in his prose. ",
