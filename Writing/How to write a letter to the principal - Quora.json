            "answer_text": "Very simply. First, keep it respectful. Second, identify the action you would like from your principal. How you begin will depend upon whether the principal knows your or not. Assuming the principal does not, introduce yourself. You might start with: \u201cDear Mr./Ms. - My name is John Doe. I am a senior here at Name of School High School. I am interested in pursuing a college degree at University of Choice. In order to further increase my chances of being accepted, I would be grateful if you might provide a letter of recommendation for me. Here are a few of my strengths that I believe have made me successful here. (Patience, hard work, etc).\u201d If you are requesting something else, you would place the request first and follow it by your reasons: \u201cDear Mr./Ms. - My name is Jane Doe and I am a senior here at Name of High School. I would like to request a change in cafeteria food, specifically the meatloaf. While this may seem like an odd request, there are serious reasons why I believe a change is necessary. (State your reasons). I appreciate your consideration in this matter. Best regards, Your name.\u201d Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Address the letter to the school by name: single space down one line and write the physical address underneath the school name (exact to the left corner margin used for the name) in the very top left corner of the page (in two-three lines, single spaced); drop down two-three lines to center a date on the page. Drop down two lines: underneath the date write Attention: name of school official (Mr. or Ms.), title (Principal); brief (a few words) subject title (line). Drop down two spaces to write salutation: \"Dear Mr/Ms\u2026\" Greetings, Principal\u2026\" \"Principal (name)\"; follow with a colon: not a semi-colon and do not use all capital letters. Either indent (tab) for paragraph or begin writing (best choice 1 1/2 line space) from the very most left edge margin. Double (2 line) space between each paragraph: indent tab and number points or (a) (b) (c) to attention\u2026 (I) (A) or 1. highlight pointsBullets \u2022 can be usedOr * Asterisk.Objects of interestIf the text exceeds one page, center a page number, -1- or -one-, two spaces below the last line of the 1st page paragraph (at least two spaces from (above) the very bottom. If a header function is possible, enter a header text name of principal/school, your name, date, subject: or enter this information across the top\u2014starting at left margin, single space to a second line (if necessary). And then drop down two-three lines to begin the first second page paragraph. It's easier if header function is available: if the letter exceeds a second page, the same process for a centered placed page #, manually written header is necessary: copy/paste is fast for header info and changing just a page number (such as from -2- to -3-). Repeat the exact same process/text/numbering for all pages other than the title on page -one- (-1-). Keep consistent paragraph line space and left to right margins. Otherwise: do not be a slimy CHUMMY CHUMP; be courteous\u2014do not write in intimate/personal nuances\u2014and polite, not preposterous. Do not make assumptions of knowledge: explain what, why, where, who, when, why and how you have decided to initiate communication. At the very last paragraph on the last page, drop down two-three spaces for a closing salutation, 'Sincerely' 'Respectfully' or\u2026 'By full knowledge of the penalties for Perjury'\u2026 And then drop down two-three spaces: enter a solid line for a signature over the top of\u2014single space\u2014a typed full legal name; single space one line down to write an address of the sender (letter writer). Single space one line: ema address/phone number of sender. The closing salutation and signature block can start at the left margin or be centered (in the middle of the page) of the last 1/4 of the page; don't forget to leave room for the last page number. If there's room on the last page\u2014above or below closing salutation or signature line block: below all of the letter's body text\u2014a photocopy of a (photo) student ID or driver's license image is acceptable, depending on the circumstance. [A helpful thing: enter an online search for \"example of a professional letter\" or \"example of a demand letter\"; typically, this will result physical images of examples that can be followed.] ",
