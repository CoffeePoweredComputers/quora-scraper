            "answer_text": "As you\u2019re a writer, platforms like Squadhelp, Upwork, Freelancer and PeoplePerHour - more and more businesses are outsourcing and it can be really great to work from home in your spare time and earn an extra income. Build relationships with people in the industry you want to work with and build a good rapport. This doesn\u2019t always have instant results, but it is 100% worth spending the time to do it. Maybe you like writing about pharmaceuticals or music - try to niche it down as much as you can as this will often get you more clients. Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses! ",

Log in create a superb profile, read up on how to do that and start applying for creative writing jobs on the website. I have done a few creative writing jobs and they are fun. Right now I am doing a review writing job which is easier. The point is to be flexible and work hard. Secondly always look to improve. Hope this helps. ",
