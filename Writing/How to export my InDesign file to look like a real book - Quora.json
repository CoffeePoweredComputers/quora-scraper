            "answer_text": "If your book is in one continuous document file, add a cover page with a blank page in front of the first page of text in the book. At the end of your document, add a blank page, then add another blank page to create the back cover on the last page. Export to PDF. Once exported, you can open it as a book. If using multiple documents to create a book, create a \u2018BOOK\u2019 under the document setup tab. This will save a booking box, as I call it. Add each single file document using the plus sign. For my books, I have a different document file for the cover, title page, intro pages, chapters, back cover. Once these are loaded into the book box (.indb / InDesign Book File) save this, then click on the top far right corner of the box to access the pull down menu. Ask the computer to save as a PDF & you\u2019re done! Even if you have just one entire document file, create a indb book to accompany it. Create this new book the same way as mentioned earlier; setting up a new book, under document set up. This allows you to be able to preflight it (to check for problems), and then package it for print. Packaging for print allows InDesign to create a folder of all the documents, fonts, and links used to create the document \u2014 and have this ready to hand off to a printer who is printing/publishing your book.

            "answer_text": "Well, there is the simple, low-tech method I\u2019ve used before: Design two pages of your book.Print out those pages.Pick a real book you have.If necessary, crop your printed pages to the same size as the pages in that book.Open the book and lay the two pages in it, covering the two exposed pages of the book, and tucking the pages into the center so they appear to be part of the book.Take a picture of it.Here\u2019s an example where I did exactly that. In this case, I was using Word, because it was a preliminary for our first book, and we hadn\u2019t gotten InDesign yet, but there\u2019s no reason why it wouldn\u2019t work with absolutely any layout or word processing program:  I did it on a black background, then increased the contrast in a photo editing program.
