            "answer_text": "Rage, rage against the dying of the light This line from the villanelle, \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night\u201d by Dylan Thomas, is my favorite line from poetry. It\u2019s been my gentle reminder of how one should not succumb into the seductive peace of death but instead, rage for the beauty of life. As a depressed person, this speaks volumes of what I wished I believed in. Many people come to me and tell me that life is precious, and that I shouldn\u2019t waste in a quick death. And that sucks to hear. Because in all of my experiences, I know that life is beautiful and magnificent. I\u2019ve seen it and felt it and experienced it. But you ask if you know that life is like that, why do you still want to die? Because I\u2019m frankly tired. I don\u2019t feel anything often. I\u2019m tired of feeling empty and not knowing what I\u2019m feeling. I wonder if I\u2019m faking my emotions or genuinely feeling joy. I lost contact with differentiating what is real in my emotions and what is not. I\u2019m tired of fucking up my life. I\u2019ve seen myself hurt so many people because of the choices and actions I make. And no matter how much I try to do the right thing where everyone is happy and safe, they end up hurt and it crushes me everytime. I\u2019m tired of being so confused about life and death. Whether it\u2019s all worth it of one side and the other. Not knowing which is the right choice and the choice that will make me truly happy. I\u2019m tired of losing people. Of hurting them and being abandoned. People say so empty words of reassurance but fail to commit at the end. I\u2019m tired of being lonely. Of staring that floor in the darkness of my room. Waiting for someone to text or call me. I want someone to care about me in their own choice and not feel obligated to do so. To love me and accept me. To hang out with me. To be the first choice! But no one will. I\u2019m tired of being a failure. Being defeated by the lack of motivation and the potential to be better. I am incompetent. I am weak at so many things. Poetry, writing, archery - these things I love doing, I lack the skills to be great at them. I am not knowledgeable. I am not anything worth being. And that is why Dylan Thomas\u2019s line resonates within me. So many people rage and here I am, giving up so easily. People are not so fortunate and here I am still living, wishing she was dead. A husk of a human. I wish to have that rage - that drive. But I don\u2019t. I love this poem not because I relate to the poem, but because it is something I strive for. Something that I wish still sparked something in my heart. Something that I wish galvanizes me into a refresh of life. I want to rage, rage against the dying of the light. I want to not go gentle into that good night. I want to live! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a woman who lived in my house, a few years ago, before I met my husband. She looks just like me. She has a lot of the same habits, some of the same friends. She even has the same name. But she isn\u2019t me. That woman never married. She never forgot who she was. Some time after I left my husband, I looked in the mirror and didn\u2019t recognize myself. I felt free, for the first time in years. But I was floating, weightless, into the unknown. When I think back to that moment, I think of a line from Derek Walcott\u2019s poem, Love After Love: \u201cYou will love again the stranger who was your self.\u201d Each rift, each heartbreak, makes us into strangers to ourselves. Strangers that we must learn to love, all over again. ",
