            "answer_text": "Some other answers have claimed that Urdu is an easy language to learn. I wholeheartedly disagree, and I am a native speaker from Pakistan. I have studied Urdu for 12 years and I continue to read, write and speak it to this day. I can say without a doubt that I still do not fully comprehend this language. There is a reason for that. In this global village of a world, where at one point in time, the sun never set in British empire, Urdu, like many other languages, is under attack from English and it is on the back-foot. As a result, even its native speakers don\u2019t use Urdu as much as they should and, as a result, are unable to articulate complex scientific or philosophic ideas in it. Having said that, I\u2019d say if you really want to learn Urdu, it is one of the tougher languages. All in all, it is moderately difficult to learn. It is harder than English and German but much easier than Chinese. Here are some factors to remember when trying to learn Urdu: Speaking When people say Urdu is an easy language to learn, they are talking about spoken Urdu, the kind used in everyday conversation. It is relatively easy as there is a limited number of words that you need to learn and you can get by by using them in your conversation in an Urdu speaking environment. Genders Like French and Arabic, in Urdu, all inanimate objects have genders, male or female. Newbies often struggle with them. Even seasoned experts like legendary poet Ghalib struggled with some words and debated whether they are male or female. Some Pakistani Pashtuns, who learn Urdu later in life rather than closer to infancy, often switch genders of inanimate objects and are often butt of well-meaning, light-hearted jokes. Many of my Pashtun friends have told me that it\u2019s because Pushto and Urdu have opposite genders for most of the same inanimate objects. Memorizing right gender for certain objects can be a challenge and, in certain situations, using wrong genders for inanimate objects can render one difficult to be understood. Accent A lot can be said about accent. I will keep it brief. To learn any lingual inflection, one has to realize and appreciate that some sounds in one language may not be present in another language. It is important, because otherwise you might try to replace unfamiliar sounds with the ones from your own language, essentially changing many of the words in former. It is imperative to make an effort to learn new sounds, their correct enunciation and to practise them. Same goes with Urdu. There is no substitute for practice. Reading and Writing When it comes to reading and writing, Urdu can be difficult on a whole new level. If your native language uses an Arabic based script (like Arabic and Persian), it will be much easier to understand how Urdu is written. Otherwise, you will have to learn a whole new set of rules and they are anything but straightforward. Urdu has, give and take, 37 alphabets \u2014 there is no one agreed upon number but 37, for most intents and purposes, is generally correct \u2014 and about a dozen diacritics. In any given word, some characters are attached to other characters and some are kept separate. There are no clear rules or at least none can be taught without extensive practice on part of the student. Once you know how to read Urdu, stretch your arms and crack your knuckles, things are about to get real serious. And you thought writing Chinese was difficult. Each word in Urdu can be written in roughly 4 to 6 different ways. Your hand will have to get used to curves and twists that will feel most unnatural if you haven\u2019t written an Arabic based script before. If you know how to write complex cursive scripts of roman alphabets, then you should be able to learn Urdu script (called Nasta\u2019leeque) much more easily. A wise man once told another wise man and I overheard which I will paraphrase. Do not tell your student something is easy. If he/she fails to learn after first few attempts to learn, he/she will get discouraged and will stop making any further effort. If you do not know a skill, it is difficult, and it will be so until you learn it. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically you can learn the Urdu language by being with someone who knows Urdu. Talk about reading and writing it takes years to completely know what you are doing. Khay and Qaaf is difficult to pronounce and learn, unless you go out of you way to find out the difference. Some people can never pronounce some of the words like ZANG(rust) they will always pronounce it as JANG(war). Like in Arabic there is not P so the pronounce all the words like B. I cannot park the car in that place to with they will say I cannot BARK the car in that place..Broken Urdu is common throughout the world. Hum udher jayiyey ga. meaning I will go there. but the fasi or refined Urdudan (person who knows Urdu well) will say it like this. Hum wahan jayeygay. Main wahan jaoonga. Hum udhar jaiyey gay. The pronunciation and the construction of the sentence make the difference. After speaking the person who know little Urdu will reveal his capacity of not knowing the language. After all said and done Urdu is the sweetest language in the world. It is a progressive language and words from different language is added to it every day it is a rich language and the language of the elite and aristocratic. Urdu also has different styles, like Deccani style and Delhi style. I speak in both the styles and I can switch from one the other with ease. Thousands of people speak Urdu and they say they are speaking Hindi. They are ashamed to say it as they think Urdu belong to the Muslims which is not true. Nafees or refined Urdu is very very difficulty to speak, write and read. All the members of my family speak fluent Urdu and do not know how to read and write so they write in Roman Urdu which means they write in English and the words are Urdu. It takes years to learn Urdu. I was educated in English, I had to struggled hard to learn Urdu on my own. It took me years. As I communicate is English all the time I have to keep up my knowledge by reading Urdu books and speak to distant relatives on the phone. ",
