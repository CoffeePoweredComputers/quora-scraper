            "answer_text": "Many reasons for wearing a mask is either to avoid judgements, watched and analyze the surrounding, protection for oneself and other various reasoning is to avoid also hurting a person. I\u2019ve worn many mask from being social parts of a deffirent person for many reason but to most is for personal reason in keeping others safe from the original me. A smask I\u2019ve worn when close to people are acting shy,friendly,talkative and mostly annoying to most,hyper and crazy that I always laugh at nothing, forgiving and a weakling due to being bullied. Another mask is for social gathering where I have to ask my inner demon self to use a deceptive action of formality and manners as being a royal to my other half is her being a perfectionist when fooling people that she have manners and ettiquite. My other half is well-knowledgeable in the art of deception and acting in formal social gathering as to even eating vegetable is what I hate and loathed yet she manage to teach me how to actually tolerate it to keep others from judging that they would actually think I would ever eat it so thats that they would only know I can stomach and tolerate whats infront of me. Another is the most dangerous and what I hide for protection for my family is my real self that is judgemental,conniving,heartless,saddistic,malevolent, and dangerously domineering. Its one of the thing that have been develop for too much bullying and repressing dark tendency and due to my demonic other half. This is far dangerous for there are various accident I released this part of me and caused more pain and almost killed and broke a student in this part of me. This part of me is dangerous for this side is more smarter to plan poisoning the other student at times in my school days and is empathetic at times to never show mercy and hard to make this part of me forgive others. This part is obsessed in fighting,killing,and other dangerous activities. ",

            "answer_text": "For me it\u2019s generally because I want to be socially appropriate and polite. If I didn\u2019t censor myself at times and instead just blurted out whatever I was feeling or thinking in a given situation, I might find myself in some trouble. Not wearing any type of facade would mean that I would be showing my true, unedited, unfiltered, real self in all social situations \u2014 and that wouldn\u2019t go over so well for a multitude of reasons. The way I see it, we ALL have to wear a social facade (at times) in order to act appropriately. We all adjust our social selves in response to changing social situations. We all routinely and regularly act in ways which we don\u2019t feel or say things which we don\u2019t mean or hide things which we feel all in the name of being socially appropriate. Showe me a person who does not wear a facade from time to time and you\u2019d likely be showing me a person who has no friends and not much of a social life. ",
