            "answer_text": "The angle of a staircase (sometimes also called pitch) depends on the space you have available for the staircase and from the steps and risers ratio. The ideal rise and run for stairs and the angle of the staircase are therefore connected. My reply is based on UK Building Rules for domestic staircases and it can be taken as general reference for normal angle, but you will need to check with your local building inspector the angle required by the Building Code in your area. As general suggestions The individual rise must be between 150 mm and 220 mm The individual going must be between 220 mm and 300 mm The Pitch of the stair cannot be greater than 42 degrees So for example on staircase of 2600 mm total floor height, The individual rise, can be no more than 220 mm so,the minimum number of risers would be 12, which is 217 mm (2600/12 = 216.6)the maximum number of risers would be 17, which is 153 mm (2600/17 = 152.9) As such, we would normally use 12 risers on this staircase, because that\u2019s the minimum number of risers, which will in turn result in the lowest amount of floor space being taken up by the staircase. However, with a individual rise of 217 mm, if we used the minimum individual going which would be 220 mm, the pitch would be 44.6\u00b0, which is too steep for the maximum 42\u00b0 pitch. As such, with a individual rise of 217 mm we must use a individual going of 242 mm, and with a individual rise of 217 mm and a individual going of 242 mm, we would get a pitch of 41.8\u00b0, which means the pitch would comply to domestic building regulations.

            "answer_text": "In US construction stair pitch (angle) is expressed as a ratio between rise and run (vertical and horizontal distances). For commercial construction the minimum ratio is 7:11 but 6:12 is often used (these are expressed as rise and run in inches which is why it\u2019s 6:12 and not 1:2). Lower angles are also used but the relation to the length of the tread and strides of various people gets complicated. Residential stairs can be steeper with a maximum rise of 8 1/4\u201d. I don\u2019t recall the minimum run and it may vary in different codes but it may be as little as 9\u201d in some places. It\u2019s steeper in part because it would take up too much space in multi-story dwellings to require 7:11 and public safety concerns are less. It\u2019s also a subject of lobbying by the home building industry as a shallower pitch would reduce the usable area of the house or increase the size for the same area. It\u2019s also hard to layout a longer run of stairs and all the existing home plans would have to be redesigned. ",
