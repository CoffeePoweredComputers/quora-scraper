            "answer_text": "There is definitely a chance that they store some personals, since Craigslist doesn\u2019t block the web archive in their robots.txt file. In a fast growing site like Craigslist, I would say that chances are more unlikely unless you post in a smaller city, where content stays up on the site for a longer time. Hope that helps. ",
