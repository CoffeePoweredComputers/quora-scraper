            "answer_text": "Is SNL actually biased? If you are referring to Saturday Night Live, then yes! The show is unequivocally biased towards funny. For decades, upon decades, they have skewered anyone who is remotely associated with politics and celebrity. They are particularly biased towards funny when it comes to roasting every US President since back to its origins in 1975. [1] They started making fun of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, and have made fun of every US President since. [2] They ridiculed George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.[3]  It all started when President Richard Nixon, in the 70s, decided to become the most corrupt president in modern history, with the Watergate scandal.[4] They never stopped making fun of President's Ronald Reagan, George Bush Jr., and Barack Obama. And Yes, the biggest, baddest of them all, President Trump, gets skewered too. For better or worse, that's the schtick of the show. They are known for political satire. Sometimes the shows are funny, and sometimes not; but that's what they do. If you think that the show is biased; then just don't watch it. But, if you can't enjoy political satire, then you are going to miss out on a ton of good laughs. Trevor Noah, Seth Myers, Bill Maher, John Oliver (Jay Leno & Jon Stewart in the past), are all hysterical. I really feel sorry for people who can't watch comedians and enjoy a good laugh; because they think a show is biased. Plain and simple, that's ridiculous and they are missing out on a healthy way to live by laughing.

            "answer_text": "Is SNL actually biased? Have you ever watched the show? Of course they\u2019re biased! However, their mockery, ridicule and vilification (under the pretense of comedy) is quite selective. They are biased against\u2026 President Trump? Of course.Hillary Clinton? Not at all.Barack Obama? Not at all.George W. Bush? Of course.Joe Biden? Nah.Mike Pence? Of course.While apologists will argue that SNL mocked Obama and Hillary, their level of \u201cmockery\u201d was shallow and mostly weak. Their weekly mockery of President Trump only surpasses their mockery of former President Bush. ",
