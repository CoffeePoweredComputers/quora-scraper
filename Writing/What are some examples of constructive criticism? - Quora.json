            "answer_text": "Top Examples of Constructive Criticism: How to Handle it Like a Pro Constructive criticism is one of those necessary evils in the workplace. It\u2019s what pushes you to become a better employee, and what you rely on to get the best out of everybody around you. Here are examples of constructive criticism. Scenario #1: Providing constructive criticism to an employee Perhaps one of the most common forms of feedback is a manager needing to offer a piece of constructive criticism to a direct report. This can happen in passing, or as part of a formal performance review. The important thing to remember here is that you\u2019re the one in the position of power\u2014which means this situation is already intimidating for the person receiving the feedback. Hearing that they\u2019re falling short in a certain area will naturally make employees question their job security, so you need to be empathetic and encouraging while still getting your point across. Do this by emphasizing that you\u2019re on the same side here. You can even take a more supportive position by offering to help them correct their behavior. The scenario: Your employee has a history of missing important deadlines. You need to remind them that they need to be on time with their deliverables, otherwise everything else gets thrown off track. What you want to say: \u201cI need you to get your stuff done on time. That\u2019s a pretty basic expectation that you shouldn\u2019t have any trouble fulfilling.\u201d What you should say instead: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve been late with your sales reports the past two months. I know that things get busy, but I need to see you improve with your on-time delivery, because not getting that information by the deadline really throws the rest of the team off track. Is there anything I can do to help you better manage your workload and ensure that you don\u2019t fall behind?\u201d Scenario #2: Providing constructive criticism to a peer This situation is common. But, it\u2019s also a little more awkward. It\u2019s easy to feel like it\u2019s not your place to provide feedback to someone who\u2019s at your same level\u2014as if you\u2019re overstepping. At the same time, you don\u2019t want to be the tattletale who runs to your boss at every single wrinkle or roadblock. Know that you absolutely can deliver constructive criticism to a colleague, provided you\u2019re able to do so in a way that doesn\u2019t come across as condescending or like you\u2019re trying to step in for your manager. To walk this fine line, take a friendly, more team-centered approach. You can even openly address the fact that it\u2019s a little uncomfortable, so that the recipient knows you aren\u2019t elevating your position above theirs. The scenario: One of your co-workers continues to interrupt you in team meetings. Every time you begin to chime in, they immediately cut you off with their own ideas. You don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re aware that they\u2019re doing it, so you decide to bring it up after a meeting. What you want to say: \u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t noticed (although, I don\u2019t know how you could miss it), but you always interrupt me in team meetings. Can you just let me speak before you jump right in with your own two cents?\u201d What you should say instead: \u201cHey, Lacy. This is a little uncomfortable, but I\u2019ve noticed that you tend to interrupt me when I\u2019m sharing my thoughts in team meetings. I know we\u2019re all excited to jump in with our own ideas\u2014and yours are always great! But, I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could let me get my own thoughts out before you begin speaking.\u201d I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Constructive criticism would be any critique that points out flaw without insult, that's not to say that the other person won't be offended anyway, but no need to say an idea is the stupidest thing you've ever heard(even if it is) because that doesn't offer chance for improvement. Ideally, you would point out a flaw and offer a solution, or at least enough feedback about what specifically is wrong so they can try themselves. Bad criticism: That\u2019s stupid.(rude) I don't like it.(vague) That\u2019s\u2026.. nice, I guess.(vague and placating) Avoid given criticism that is intentionally rude, vague, or placating. Even if it's hard not to, placating is the worst thing you can do because it gives them confidence without skill. It results in someone that never improves or grows because they feel like they don't have to or that they can't. (It's a little different with children, where you can encourage them just by giving them positive attention. So long as you don't overly praise them, there's a good chance they will improve naturally- but lessons definitely help if they show an interest in something) Good criticism: I like XYZ, but I think more examples about/of WRS first would make this stronger.(soft and specific) This is a little chaotic, but not beyond repair. Perhaps try focusing on one thing more consistency and use less variety.(tougher and specific, also encouraging) When attempting to give good criticism, it's important to be honest, specific, and encouraging. It can also help to avoid using \u2018you\u2019, as that can come across as talking down to them or can make them feel defensive. If you make them feel defensive there's a good chance that they won't take any advice you give them or they won't cooperate. ",
