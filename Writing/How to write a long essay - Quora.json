            "answer_text": "Firstly it's not the length that brings you marks or impresses the reader but it's the quality what you write. It depends on the type of topic. I'll share my thoughts if it's a general topic. Start boldly with the related aspects about the topic. Say, if the topic is Pollution (a very common topic during schooling) you could start with- With the advancement of technology, industrialisation, urbanisation, modernisation (and many more 'sations' ;-) ) have come up to a great extent. People's demands are changing and so is the environment. As every coin has it's two sides, these handy luxuries also play a vital role in the changing environment\u2026.. Continue for few lines and come to the actual topic of essay. Second paragraph is the introduction of the topic. Write down the definition or your understanding about the topic. Next jot down the important points like the pros,cons,types, statistics, preventive measures that includes do's and don'ts, etc in paragraphs. Try to write sequentially so first think what should be written first and followed by what. Lastly you may conclude by suitable phrases that gives an impactful end to whatever you have written. Remember, the start and end should be impressive and catchy and if it is then you have won it for sure.. ;) Hope this could help you a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "This works for a short essay, too. Pretty much any kind of essay, actually. The steps I usually follow are: Come up with a thesisCome up with several points to explain and defend said thesis (at least 3)Research and come up with citations for each pointWrite a hook sentence, then the rest of an intro paragraphWrite the conclusionWrite the body paragraphsRead over it to make sure it\u2019s coherant and complete and that the transitions make senseRead it over again to double check the grammarPut in parenthetical citations if needed/if not done yetWrite up the citation pageCome up with a good title (if needed at all)And then you\u2019re done. Steps 4\u20136 are just done in whatever order you come up with the words in. I usually do it in that order, but everyone is different. Each body should explain a different point, the intro should be one paragraph, and the conclusion should be one or two paragraphs. Also, stesps 7 and 8 should be done by other people, too, if possible. Peer edits are important and extremely useful. Good luck on your essay! ",
