            "answer_text": "If you want to write a clear essay then you need to have an obvious idea of what your topic will be. You should be as specific as possible with your topic, because unless your essay is supposed to be long then you should stick to the point so that your message is clear. If you want your essay to be well written, then after choosing your topic you should be sure to outline your essay using the tried and true structure of Introduction (with thesis), Body Paragraph to prove your point, and Conclusion. These are the two most important steps to write a clear and well written essay, beyond being able to hone your writing style to your own advantage. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written about this several times. So let me summarize. You start with a good story about the issue, some event to illustrate it. You then use journalistic style (the 5 Ws and an H) to describe these things: Why the issue is important. Why readers should care. What the facts are. What happened. When and where this took place. Is it timely? Does it have local relevance? Who is affected? How did it happen? Tie it up with a summary paragraph and you have a serviceable essay. ",
