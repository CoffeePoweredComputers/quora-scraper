            "answer_text": "\u201cIs it better to self-publish a book\u201d First of all, that depends on what you want to get out of it. Traditional publishing normally (though not always) requires more time and the assistance of an agent. For many authors this doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee any level of income, though there are several quite successful traditionally published authors. Many consider a traditionally published author to be more respectable, or authoritative. Sometimes your agent can play a dual role in helping you get media appearances or similar. If you want immediacy and more control self-publishing might be a viable option. You are pretty much on your own for marketing, including any media appearances you can finagle. You are on your own for writing, editing, formatting, cover art, and posting your creation to your platform of choice. Apple, Google, B&N and Amazon are the big players as self-publishing platforms. Most studies I\u2019ve seen point to Amazon as the 800 pound gorilla, with the bulk of sales. Obviously, if you don\u2019t have any of those skills, you can, and probably should, hire out help for your self-publishing project. The typical problem areas that have the greatest impact on your self-publishing venture are editing and cover art. An expert hand in those two areas can make a huge difference. If you were planning on making a bunch of money quickly you might want to reconsider. There are sales and marketing techniques that have helped several self-published authors to make money, get traditional publishing book deals, get movie deals and more. That goes way beyond this answer though. \u201cHow to do it\u201d Write. Write every day. A couple thousand words a day. Cut out the fat and keep it lean. When your book is done hand it to a professional editor. Trust the editor with credentials and experience. Hire a cover artist who totally understands your genre. Upload it to a self-publishing platform or a gateway to several (Smashwords, etc). If you are terrible at marketing hire someone to write your book description. Then sit back and enjoy what sales or fame come your way. ",
