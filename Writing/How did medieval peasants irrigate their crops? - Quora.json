            "answer_text": "The main difference in modern irrigation and early irrigation is early farmers routed the water along the contour of the terrain to the fields then we went though a stage where we modified the land so it sloped so the water could be routed with much less expense and cover more ground. Then we went to sprinklers on pipes moved by hand, sprinklers on self moving pipes and finally to drip irrigation. Each step used less water and produced more crop per acre foot of water. Laying out an irrigation ditch is easy once there is some water running on the ground. Fresh out of college with a Masters degree in Agronomy from Texas A&M my uncle got out a level to lay out an irrigation ditch on the Experiment Station at Wesleco Texas he hadn't set up the level before the Mexican working with him had 30 feet of ditch laid out by making a small break in the ditch with a hoe and leading the water where it needed to go by dig the ground in front of the running water out of the way. The running water slowly dug the ditch based on how deep a hole was dug in front of it. I drained my back yard that way using a water hose and nozzle that shot a stream of water to cut thought the high spots in the lawn. Once the lawn was flooded it easy to see what was wrong. When someone said ditch my uncle fell back into his role of combat engineer using the tools he knew how to use when faced with problem he hand\u2019t encountered before. He joined the Army as Second Lieutenant in the Engineers. When the war was over he had all the engineering he wanted and turned to long time family business, agriculture. He never said a word about it to anyone. He was just one of many men I knew that never spoke of what they did in WWII. ",
