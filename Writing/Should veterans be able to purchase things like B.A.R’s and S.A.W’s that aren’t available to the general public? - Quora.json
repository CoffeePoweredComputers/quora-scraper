Bad guys can only come into your house one-at-a-time.  The door is only so-big.  If you actually shoot the first one with a 12-gauge (or, really, ANY gun, including a .22) the clowns behind him will run like rabbits.  If the bad guys are coming into your house in a herd formation, they know you have a house full of either money or drugs.  ---or, automatic weapons.  If they know you have any in your house, they will just bide their time.  Around 2 pm on a weekday, when you & the Mrs. are at work & the kids are at school, and nobody is home except for the dog, the bad guys will stop by.  All they need to do is toss a Walmart steak in through the window, and your dog will help them carry your guns out.  Now you will have those guns on the street.  ---Pretty damn dumb to make that stuff available to the general public.  Bottom line is, if you make a weapon like that available to ANYONE, you just made it available to EVERYONE. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think that a blanket approval for all veterans should be allowed so my vote is a hard no. I do think that it would be smart to have some of the older weapons that have full automatic fire capabilities spread out among the general public for immediate access sort of like what the Israelis and Swiss have in place. What they have is basic common sense. That means then that we need to trust some of our military veterans and/or highly trained civilians who are assigned these weapons for national emergency defense needs. That would then mean that we need to come up with a program for selecting and training these people. But as for a blanket, give-all-veterans automatic weapons, I would say no way. ",
