            "answer_text": "Depends. So many writers, so many styles. So are you Proust or Carver? I am reading Dickens now and he can go on awhile in description of a trip aboard a wagon. It\u2019s wonderful. If you are describing a cardboard box you can probably do that in shorthand. \u201cHe kept all his belongings in a weathered cardboard box.\u201d You can see it and access the situation in a heartbeat. If it\u2019s important, give it some space. If you are describing two lovers watching a meteor shower, you can write pages about their closeness in the frosty air, the wind, the myriad of stars\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever tried to follow a long dry description in a novel? I have. And I\u2019ve had to go back and read it again because I couldn\u2019t comprehend the whole for all the needless, unnecessary details. My advice is to first write the entire description of your subject matter, including all the pertinent details. Now, it\u2019s time to edit. Pare away anything except what is essentially part of the subject. By essential, I mean if you were to leave it out, the subject would be incomplete. Some authors call it removing all the words except the right ones. Consider the description in terms of how you want to position the subject in the story\u2013\u2013read on. Give your description just the right character or flavor so that readers can close their eyes and see it in their minds. Because it\u2019s not the cut and dried use of words that can best describe a subject, but the emotions and feelings they evoke. For example(s): Describing your child asleep. Describing a piece of art or sculpture that moves you emotionally. Describing a beautiful landscape. Or the person you love. As a writer, you can\u2019t help but put part of yourself into the description. ",
