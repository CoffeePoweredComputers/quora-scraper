            "answer_text": "Thanks Nelson for the A2A, and sorry it took me so long (I\u2019d been off Quora for some time). Okay. the answers here are correct. But the story gets EVEN BETTER if you go down to the smallest detail. SO, how did we manage to translate a language which has no equivalent anywhere in world history (scholars to this day have no language group to attach Sumerian to), disappeared more than 2500 years ago in its spoken form, and was written in ABSTRACT IDEOGRAMS (not pictograms - the original pictograms were only found during later digs, when Sumerian had already been re-discovered)? Well, it\u2019s actually quite a complicated story. It goes back to inscriptions from the early Persian Empire, where ancient Farsi was written in cuneiform on monuments and sacred tablets. Scholars did those easily, because they had modern Farsi to work on (nowadays written in a derived Arabic script - right to left). So they managed to transcribe what was in effect a syllabic form of left-to-right writing. That done, said scholars soon discovered plenty of clay tablets in ANOTHER language, stored in Persian libraries, and in multiple finds spreading across Mesopotamia. Since these went back to the ancient empires of Assyria and Babylon, the scholars surmised, correctly, that the language was Semitic. That made things rather easy at that point: Semitic languages are based on quite a rigid system of stable tri-consonantic-roots. Besides, they\u2019re all actually quite close. So, based on the same syllabic system (one sign= one syllable, like in modern Korean) you could work out Akkadian based on knowledge of Hebrew and Arabic. So far so good. But as more and more tablets were unearthed, some really weird ones began to appear, in which a wide variety of unknown cuneiform combinations were strung together without rhyme or reason, apparently in inconsistent series of vowels and syllables. It seemed THERE WAS ANOTHER LANGUAGE UNDER THE OTHER LANGUAGE. But it remained, to all intents and purposes, undecipherable. That\u2019s when the scholars went back to school. Scribe school. You see, Sumerian was already a dwindling language in the heydays of Nineveh and Babylon, but it still was the language of science, priesthood and esoterism (basically the same thing at the time). So no qualified scribe could pretend to do without. But it wasn\u2019t their native language any more. So what did they do? They did what any intelligent foreign language scholar would\u2019ve done: they made up textbooks, bilingual ones. And bilingual dictionaries to boot. That\u2019s how the modern scholars understood how cuneiform had originally emerged.  The Sumerians originally used pictograms, but the necessities of writing on clay soon transformed the original pictures into stylised combinations of nail-shaped lines (hence cuneiform - from cunei, nail-shaped). Voluntary ignoring the original signification of each sign, it\u2019s some of the syllables that the Akkadian speakers used to transcribe their own language (Semitic languages need that to express grammar and vocabulary). For example, if you take the aforementioned \u201ca\u201d = \u201cwater\u201d sign in Sumerian, you can see it used as the first sign in the following Akkadian word for (gentle)man, hence:  Okay everyone? So it\u2019s lucky that the scholars found the dictionaries in the first place, because otherwise, the gap between Akkadian syllabic writing and Sumerian ideographic writing would\u2019ve been impossible to bridge. But today, we can actually read and understand Sumerian, and complete the missing passages of the Epic of Gilgamesh\u2019s Nineveh version, for instance, with some of the original Sumerian tablets. Ain\u2019t that amazing? I dig this stuff, and I particularly like it that the first modern day students of Sumerian got to learn it off the VERY SAME manuals that apprentice Babylonian scribes had used, 3000 years back, precisely for that same purpose. I told U it was an amazing story. Don\u2019t U think? ",

            "answer_text": "We read them. Cuneiform script was deciphered a long time ago. The first cuneiform language to be understood was Akkadian (in the Babylonian form). From there it was a comparatively simple step to understanding Sumerian since some of the cuneiform tablets turned out to be Akkadian-Sumerian lexica. Anyway, there are now grammars, glossaries, chrestomathies, and all the other tools for learning and reading Sumerian. Yes, the writing system is tricky owing to the polyvalence of so many signs; yes, Sumerian grammar is still imperfectly understood largely owing to its being a language isolate (i.e. there are no known related languages); but it can be read.
