            "answer_text": "Q: How can I write a paragraph describing a certain person\u2019s room? A: Disclaimer, this my be a lot of information to process. And remember, writing is an art and my art was just displayed for you to see. It might not make any sense to you. There isn\u2019t a correct way to do art. I hope there are more tips and answer. The question was asked and the answer, I hope you may receive. :) Firstly, start with the person. Are they real? Do you know them? What age or gender are they and have you been to their room before? Is there anything you remember if you\u2019ve been there before? Or are they actually fictional? Are they a character made up because this can be so much easier. Try putting their style and emotion (if there is any) into their room and blend that piece by piece with writing techniques (alliteration, metaphors etc.) into the paragraph. The person\u2019s views and hobbies will most likely be projected on their room, but it depends if they are a vocal person or not \u2014 if they want people to know what they think. However it is (because I don\u2019t know if they are a real person or not), you shouldn\u2019t forget to add descriptions of what is in the room. Furniture in the person\u2019s room and decorations. Do they have curtains, lamps etc? If their room is vivid, describe as such. Name the colours and pieces of upholstery every few times. For example, \u201cthe constant handprints stained the glass knobs of the oaktree wardrobe, turning them a faint brown.\u201d And give great detail so the reader can imagine themselves wherever this room is. Is the room always clean or messy or in between? Does lots of light come in? Is it comfy and warm or large and newly-renovated? What mood are you going for because you don\u2019t want to try and describe a happy, vibrant and lively room with sad adjectives. Lastly, what does the room mean to the person? Is it a place of dwelling or comfort? Where is it? In a chill suburb? Does their room show signs of age (maybe from cracked walls). All these points put together with maybe a little more advice will make the paragraph you want to write more enjoyable to read, I hope. s by other willing writers. (also sorry for typos, if there are any) :) ",

            "answer_text": "Their living room was a surprise to me. I had imagined that it would have been large, bright and airy, with light flooding the room through tall windows, with huge vases of tall, sweet smelling freshly cut flowers\u2026 lilies, irises and stock. A couple of matching but exclusive , very comfortable sofas with an assortment of silk cushions and hand woven rugs. Expensive copies of obscure artist's art, dotted around the Farrow and Ball painted walls, that is, a modern room. But what I actually saw was the complete opposite of my vision. The room was dark and gloomy, even though it was daytime. There was just one old sash window with a few cracks on the panes of glass.There were no flowers, but there were a few jars of pot pourri dotted around on top of dark oak furniture. There were two mismatched and lumpy sofas , most uncomfortable to sit on. Old blankets had been thrown over them. There were a lot of paintings on the flower papered walls, all of them cheap copies of Van Gogh sunflowers. However, this was a homely room, one in which I would be happy to stay for a long time ! ",

            "answer_text": "Even so\u2026 \u201cThe baron J\u00e4ppi's library was not very large, but its two long walls were full of books. Not everyone could fit in the bookshelf, and they were heaped elsewhere. Quickly saw that on the second page was a fiction and on the other side certainly a thousand kinds of non-fiction, covering architecture from animal science. Most of the books were about the history of art, culture and crafts. Most of the books were in order, but right next to his desk there were books mixed in, according to his needs.I paid attention to a small pile of red crystals on his desk, \"what are these?\" \"Ah, those little rubies. Waiting for me to get some idea of what to do with them,\" the baron said, as everyday as if he had said it had apple seeds. At the other end of the room was a large glass showcase featuring memories of his strange life, boxing gloves, small glasses, perhaps in memory of a fierce party, old medals from a long-lost state, and a tiny toy, perhaps of his childhood.There was a compartment on the wall, one that you can see in the printing press, and small objects lifted up on it like rubbish found on the street.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "This room must connect to the plot in some way, through the person who lives there, some secret kept there, or some distinguishing characteristic. Just as an example, if you can, take a look at Merlin\u2019s home in The Sword in the Stone. It\u2019s a fascinating place full of treasures such as you would expect a wide-ranging wizard such as Merlin to collect. If you can\u2019t manage that, there is a bedroom in my book Child of the Cloven Hoof that features a staircase that goes, so far as anyone knows, up and up and up forever. This magical staircase features largely in the plot. You can mention other, non-critical features of the room but keep them to a minimum. Concentrate on the meaningful, always. ",
