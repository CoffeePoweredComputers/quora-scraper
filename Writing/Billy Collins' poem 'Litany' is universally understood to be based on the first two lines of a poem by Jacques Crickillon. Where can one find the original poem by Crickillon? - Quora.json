It isn\u2019t that it is \u201cuniversally understood\u201d to be based on those lines, it\u2019s that Collins attributes the epigraph that begins his poem \u201cLitany\u201d to the Belgian artist and poet Jacques Crickillon, who would have written those lines, if he did, in French. Here\u2019s what Collins writes: \u201cYou are the bread and the knifeThe crystal goblet and the wine\u2026\u201d \u2014 Jacques Crickillon A search through the Google ebook archive for Crickillon using the words \u201ccouteau\u201d (knife) and \u201cpain\u201d (bread) yields the following from \u201cLettre \u00e0 Lorna\u201d Lui dire que la pierre, la fleur, le coquillage, le pain, le couteau, la barri\u00e8re du jardin est Lorna (\u201ctell him that the stone, the flower, the shell, the bread, the knife, the garden fence, is Lorna\u201d) Perhaps someone more familiar with the works of Crickillon could chime in?
