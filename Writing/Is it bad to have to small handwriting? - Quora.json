            "answer_text": "As another writer has mentioned, small writing is an indication of focus. But it depends just how small it is, and what you are doing, for example, for your job. If you are in a job where strong focus is required, eg computer programming, accounting etc, then small writing is excellent. However, if you are in sales or any job where you need to see the bigger picture, then really small writing would be a hindrance since it means narrow focus. And then there is really tiny writing: I once had a client who told me with great pride that he used to write, on lined paper, with 3 lines of his writing between each line, but now he only wrote 2 lines of writing between each line. It was neat, but so tiny that I needed a magnifying glass to read it. That is just too small. With that the focus becomes \u201ctunnel vision\u201d and the writer sees nothing but the exact pinpoint on which s/he is focused. So in summary - small is fine and shows good focus. Large means more of the big picture. And as in so many things in life, too much of a good thing becomes a negative. Overly large writing means lack of focus to the point of being scattered, and overly tiny writing means too narrow a focus to function well in life. Moderation in all things is good. ",

            "answer_text": "Einstein\u2019s handwriting was very tiny, indicative of a mind capable of extreme focus - capable of not being easily distracted. The larger the writing, the more easily distracted one is. Also - the more hedonistic - ever on the lookout for the next party. Having small writing is a clue to intelligence and capability. On the other hand, having tight focus can also act like steam inside a kettle. All that energy under pressure can result in explosions and bursts of temper, though this can be controlled with practice. So, it\u2019s not bad to have small handwriting. In fact, it\u2019s a sign of distinction and intelligence. Use your focus wisely - that\u2019s how great things get done by normal people - they focus and persist. ",
