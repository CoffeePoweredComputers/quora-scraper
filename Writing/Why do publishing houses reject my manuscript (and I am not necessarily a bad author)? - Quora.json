            "answer_text": "Major publishers usually have a keen sense of their particular audiences and what material consumers are more likely to buy. It takes a huge commitment of money and time for a publishing house to produce and market a book. They want a reasonable expectation that they can clearly identify a potential readers. If they miscalculate, they may take a big financial hit. In addition to assessing the writing craft, they measure their chances of winning in the marketplace. Because the competition is fierce, the writing must be exceptional. More than that, the idea behind the book must be highly marketable, at least from the manuscript buyer\u2019s point of view. Publishers are there to make money. At large publishers, the decision to buy a manuscript involves more than one person\u2014editor, publisher, production department, marketer, finance department. A writer\u2019s work must convince the whole team that a project is worth taking a chance on bottom line profits. Rejection of a writer\u2019s work does not always signal poor writing. However, most successful writers publish several books before they become publicly noticed, thus proving they are worth of royalties the publisher must pay. A good strategy for being accepted is to ensure you have written the best book it can possibly be, and then to be persistent in looking not only any publisher, but looking for the best fit for the material. Ultimately, that requires a lot of persistence. So, keep writing and perfecting and pounding the pavement for a buyer. For many writing insights, see our website, www.authorlink.com. ",

            "answer_text": "There are literally hundreds of reasons a publishing company may reject your manuscript, and I guarantee that none of them are personal. In fact, I probably have rejected anywhere from 80 to 90 percent of the authors I\u2019ve received queries from. Again, it had nothing to do with them personally. Some didn\u2019t have subject matter I was comfortable with publishing (I absolutely do not do anything with abuse unless it\u2019s horror, and even then, I\u2019m very picky). I also don\u2019t publish children\u2019s books or poetry. I reject most romance novels as well. There are publishers who specialize in each of those types of books, and some would be more costly to print for me than other publishing houses. Anything under 50 thousand words will often not be published by my company (though that\u2019s not a deal-breaker). Some simply get lost in the junk mail folder or in the thousands of emails we receive. These are just some of the reasons for the reasonably well-edited books. I have had plenty of queries from people whose books weren\u2019t well done or the premise was overdone. Sometimes the reason is subjective, but most of the time, we take a risk on what may or may not sell, and there are several times I\u2019ve lost money on a terrific book that was well-written with a fresh perspective but the timing was not right or nobody even knows why. Again, we have literally hundreds of things to consider when we take on authors, and small publishing companies stand to lose a lot more than well-established companies, so we have to be more choosy. Keep your chin up, get some critiques, keep working and keep submitting. ",
