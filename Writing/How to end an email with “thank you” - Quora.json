I wish I had a few contextual details so I could advise you in a more exact fashion, but there are many ways to go about it. If you want a response to a business matter, or you are making some kind of request, you could say, \u201cThank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!\u201d If you are simply expressing gratitude you might try, \u201cI really appreciate your help with XYZ. Thank you for everything.\u201d Or, if you are expressing gratitude and specifically want to encourage formation of a new relationship you might try, \u201cThank you so much for all of your help recently. If there is anything I can do for you, please don\u2019t hesitate to let me know. I would love to connect again. Perhaps for Zoom coffee or a socially distant drink?\u201d Just be sincere, be specific about what you\u2019re thanking the person for and perhaps how it impacted you, and your expression of gratitude should be received in the spirit it was given. Good luck! ",
