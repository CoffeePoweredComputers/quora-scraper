My PhD advisor tends to reply just \u201cThanks!\u201d almost all the time (he has excessively good manners\u2026). It\u2019s useful when I need a confirmation that he read my email and finds it helpful. It\u2019s weird, even annoying when I don\u2019t think anything in my email deserved thanking, or when my emails accumulated so he sends me 3\u20134 thanks briefly one after the other. And it makes me worry when I don\u2019t receive a thanks (for something I think deserves it) from him for an unusually long time. In any case it\u2019s still better than overusing sorry, which he also tends to do (though notably less than he used to\u2026 he\u2019s learning). ",

Taking the time to thank those even over email allows you to form better bonds with people over time. Such a an act may be a courtesy but also reflects your culture. Since you will respond to each email anyway, you may want to include a few more lines in your thank you message to help personalize your emails. ",
