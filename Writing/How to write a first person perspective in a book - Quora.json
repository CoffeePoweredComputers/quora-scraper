            "answer_text": "To write in the first person, use the pronoun I instead of he, she, they, et cetera in regards to the narrator. You have two choices now: first person present tense and first person past tense. Present tense means everything is happening in the present, and past tense is being told in the future. Example of first person present: I speak slowly - I definitely do not want to mess up my speech in front of everyone. Example of first person past: I spoke slowly - I definitely did not want to mess up my speech in front of everyone. ",
