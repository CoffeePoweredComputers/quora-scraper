            "answer_text": "I may not be a copyright expert, but I do know a few things. It depends on how much you relate it to Harry Potter. Using similar/same names? Having exactly 7 books, each one with basically the same plot? Yes, that\u2019s copyright. Going more vaguely though, if you\u2019re having a hero in a fantasy world sent off somewhere to learn more about their heritage, yet still save basically the entirety of their world? Making up your own ways of saving people? That\u2019s not copyright. I see Percy Jackson and Harry Potter as an example for the vague differences and similarities. I\u2019ll explain. Harry was sent to Hogwarts to learn about magic. Percy was sent to Camp Half Blood to learn about mythology and fighting (fighting/dueling is also taught at Hogwarts). Only magical people are allowed at Hogwarts. Only people born from a god is allowed at camp half blood. Harry is the ultimate hero among wizards, the same with Percy. Harry and two close friends, Hermione and Ron. Percy also had two close friends, Grover and Annabeth. I never finished reading Percy Jackson so there aren\u2019t too many more examples I can provide, but see? Two fantasy worlds, one main hero who was sent away and also technically orphans (since Percy technically isn\u2019t allowed to see his father and rarely sees his mother as far as I know). So, vague but similar ideas like this would be okay. But using very similar situations, names, etc. that could obviously be related back to Harry Potter would be copyright. Such as having a basilisk hidden underneath a school, having a tournament with other schools and having the main character be forcefully entered. There\u2019s plenty more examples of that but I think you get the point. ",
