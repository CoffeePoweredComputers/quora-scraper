            "answer_text": "I have been home brewing beer and wine for 30 years - sometimes with hedgerow fruit and some with the rather excellent kits that have got better and more foolproof over time. Some red wine kits are designed to be laid down to mature for several years but cost a bit more (btw \u00a370\u2013100 for 30 bottles\u2019 worth) I have become, through experience, rather good at it and have encouraged friends and acquaintances to do the same with great success - apart from one friend. He is a nice chap but is rather proud of his academic achievements that he frequently flaunts to make up for his lack of social graces. Consequently he believes that anyone not similarly qualified is unable to offer him any advice of any description. I did my best to point him in the right direction but he decided to only purchase the cheapest kits (he is spectacularly mean btw) and kept the resulting wine for many years in the belief that some sort of mysterious alchemy would occur while in the bottle. He proudly produces these bottles on occasion - the last time was an 8 year old bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and a 10 year old Riesling. The former tasted as cheap as the day it was bottled but was just about drinkable. The latter was worse than cooking sherry and I told him as much but he would not admit that, generally speaking, white wines are designed to be drunk young and seldom age well. Because I was the source of this information he ignored it completely and continues to plough his own contrary furrow to this day. Besides that tale of pride rendering a large amount of wine undrinkable I have found one instance where aging turned a sow\u2019s ear into a silk purse. While a student I made extremely crude (but quite drinkable) plonk from supermarket fruit juice (working out about 80p per gallon). Some worked extremely well e.g. Apple juice, Grape Juice and Pineapple juice but one was a catastrophe. This was the wine I made using orange juice. It was a white wine and upon completion it stank of rotten eggs and was very difficult to drink so we bottled it and forgot about it for about 4 years until one night there was no booze in the house, it was Sunday and all the off-licences were closed. Out of desperation we opened one of the long forgotten bottles but, instead of the expected reek of brimstone, it smelled very pleasantly of oranges and slipped down a treat. So time can indeed improve certain white wines but only those that initially stink to high heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Much of the wine sold is designed to be drunk within a season or two after bottling \u2014 and this is a good thing, since not many people have wine cellars able to properly age wine for a decade or more. This wine \u2014 without the acidity or tannin to stand up to aging is best drunk young. What are your tastes? Wine is a matter of taste, and if you never develop an appreciation for an aged Cabernet Sauvignon or pint noir, then the answer for you is likely no. In their youth, they will be too tannic and acidic, and aged they will lack the fruitiness you probably desire. That said, for those with the appreciation and the right wine as well, the transformation is sublime. I cannot even describe what happens, other than the awkward \u2018edges\u2019 of a great wine all round off and come together into something wonderful \u2014 perhaps like the gangly, awkward foal grows into a magnificent Secretariat.
