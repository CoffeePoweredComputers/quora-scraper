            "answer_text": "Interesting Question. I hope I'll do justice with it. If I could be a fictional character I would be him:  Please don't tell me you don't know who he is. It pains. He is my favourite SUPERHERO from Avengers. He is probably the most Powerful MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) Character. He is \u201cThe Thor\u201d, the God of Thunder, the Prince of Ashguard. I love Thor for everything. He is a gem. The man playing his Thor's role is Chris Hemsworth, the one of Extraction movie (in case you didn't know). Now look at his phower, yeah thats what I'll say, Phower. Not power.  He looks better with beard\u2665\ufe0f and best with long Hair.  OMG! I'm a huge fan of his looks and phower (he isn't on Quora otherwise Quora had a Billion downloads, I guess).  Look at his costume. Attractive! And his long golden hair is \u2665\ufe0f  Oh man, his smile is so so precious. He's standing like a Mountain with his best friend, his hammer. Comment the name of his hammer if you are a fan of him too.  His love, wholly into him, ready to break your jaw. Better stay away from his boyfriend (partner in crime)\u270c\ufe0f. They both look adorable together!  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d be a Goddess of Asgard. I\u2019m Hela, Goddess of Death. (Hey, it\u2019s my Hebrew name with the letters re-arranged) I\u2019m not Loki\u2019s daughter or adopted sister, I\u2019m just a Goddess in of my own right. I am Queen of Niflheim, a land of peace and joy. Although some of those who loved war can go to Valhalla, most choose to remain with me in the land of peace and scholarship, those who fought because they had to. Although many fear me, I\u2019m actually a lovely goddess with red brown hair, and eyes as blue as the summer skies. I greet every soul who comes to me, and let them find their lost loved ones. \u201cShalom,\u201d I tell them. Hello and peace. Loki, that trickster god comes to find me. \u201cHelp me in my schemes, Death Goddess,\u201d he whispers in my ear. \u201cAnd I shall help you in your solitude.\u201d I smile. \u201cProve it.\u201d He does. I help him\u2026.a little. ",
