            "answer_text": "Here are some freelancing tips: 1. Use a contract on every project If you\u2019re just beginning to learn how to freelance, let me help you avoid making one of the most common mistakes I see. Use a contract for EVERY client project. But, don\u2019t get bogged down in finding the perfect contract. Starting off with a template is okay, as long as you remember to keep making improvements along the way. Too many freelancers get caught up in the details of contracts, and it\u2019s ultimately wasting a lot of time that should be spent making money. All you need for the time being is a general agreement that covers some basic, yet important terms that both you and the client need to agree upon. In its simplest form, your contract terms should cover: \u2022 The work that you produce is original and not plagiarized. \u2022 The client\u2019s proprietary information stays confidential. \u2022 Your payments terms. (How much you\u2019ll get paid and when during the process.) \u2022 That once the client accepts the completed work, they accept full responsibility for any further processes in which the work is used (e.g. printing, putting the logo to use, etc.) \u2022 You and the client have the right to terminate the services, and what that entails for you both. Having some basic terms in place for every project will help protect you, but more importantly, will help inform the client of how you work. I\u2019ve put together a general freelance contract for you to work off of. It\u2019s not intended to cover every type of situation, but it can help get you started. View my sample freelance contract \u00bb Once you have your contract, your client can then physically print, sign, and return, or digitally sign. I\u2019m not a legal professional nor does the sample above cover every situation. If things are starting to take off and you\u2019re making large amounts of money from a single project: Then you might want to get a legal professional involved to craft a specific contract for the job. 2. Always get a down payment One of the biggest issues you hear about freelancing is not getting paid on time or getting stiffed by the client. I\u2019ve luckily never experienced this, but that\u2019s because I follow a simple process when starting a project. To guarantee payment 100% of the time, you must require a down payment. For all projects I take on, I require 50% upfront before I start any official design work, and I make this clear to the client in our preliminary discussions and in my contracts. If the client has an issue with this, then that should raise a red flag. There is a chance that they have never contracted for freelance services before, but it should still raise your guard. Explain that this arrangement is a protection for both parties and that the project can\u2019t move forward without it. If they refuse again: Move on. They probably aren\u2019t someone you should be working with anyways. Once I\u2019ve received the contract signed and down payment, I\u2019m good to go on starting the work. Then before I deliver any workable files, I require the final 50% payment. I do this so the client doesn\u2019t take what I\u2019ve created, cancel the project, and run. So before you\u2019ve fully been paid, don\u2019t send any master files or designs in full resolution. By putting these simple practices into your process, you can guarantee that you\u2019ll never be ripped off. 3. Don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cno\u201d Saying no is hard, especially if you\u2019re like me: Generous and want people to feel happy working with you. You don\u2019t want to disappoint anyone, so you offer to help any way you can, not really considering the strenuous load it\u2019ll put on you. No matter what you do, you\u2019ll disappoint someone. Whether it be the client because you\u2019re unable to deliver halfway through the project, your family because you\u2019re working long hours, or yourself because you\u2019re so stressed with the work you\u2019ve chosen to take on. So you must get comfortable with turning down work if it\u2019s ultimately not for you or your availability. To help determine if you should take on a project, ask yourself these questions: \u2022 Do I specialize in the work that\u2019s needed by this client? \u2022 Why am I taking this project on? Is it a commitment I should be making? \u2022 Why am I adding that project to my plate? The worst thing about taking on everything that comes your way is that your plate may end up full, but with all of the wrong commitments. You\u2019re stressed, anxious, and the worst part: Now you\u2019re left with no room to take on that golden opportunity. You can\u2019t say yes to your ideal client if you never say no to the wrong ones. Next time you get a project, don\u2019t just reply with a yes: Really consider the opportunity, ask yourself those questions above, and proceed with a conscious decision for your future and wellbeing. 4. Focus your freelance business If you\u2019ve followed my writing for a while now, you\u2019ll know I share quite frequently about focusing your freelance business and the importance of it. I continue to share this tip because I regularly get message after message from freelancers who seem to be stuck. They can\u2019t find enough work and they struggle to get their name out there. By focusing your brand identity and the type of projects you take on, it\u2019ll make everything much easier for you: From marketing to charging higher rates to actually delivering the work. Pick one or two services to specialize in, and only take on work that falls into those categories. Then turn down the rest. Once you\u2019ve decided on the services you now specialize in, be sure to translate that into your personal brand. Reword everything on your website for those keywords and phrases, only showcase that type of work in your freelance portfolio, and start producing content around those services to prove your expertise. All of this is a byproduct of marketing, which in turn will drive traffic and new freelance projects your way. 5. Showcase the work you want to take on This tip goes hand in hand with the previous tip of focusing your freelance business, but I think is a topic worth elaborating on. Many freelancers make the mistake of filling their portfolio with work just to show that they have some sort of skill in design. But most often, the work just comes off as all over the place, and will only do your portfolio a disservice. There\u2019s a difference between a freelance business portfolio and a school portfolio: Your freelance portfolio should only contain the work you specialize in and want to continue accepting via client work. The work can consist of past client work or even personal work. Have you ever heard someone say, \u201cDress for the job you want, not the one you have?\u201d Well, when it comes to your portfolio, you want to present work that aligns with the freelance jobs you want, not necessarily the projects you currently have. Let\u2019s say you specialize in logo design: If that\u2019s what you want to be known for then you should only showcase logo projects in your freelance portfolio. That\u2019ll be what attracts and helps potential clients decide to go with you over another freelance designer whose portfolio might be all over the place. 6. Be transparent with your clients As a freelancer, your business is just you running it inside out. That\u2019s something you must be proud of, so don\u2019t hide behind a facade: Be the name and face of your business, because your business is you. From a client\u2019s perspective, if I were to hire you to provide a service, I would want to know who I\u2019m giving my money to. So be sure to inject who you are into your brand. You can shape that however you\u2019d like, but the key is to be personable. Also, when a client is interested in working with you, be transparent in conversing with them. If you only take on freelance opportunities part time, let them know. Otherwise, you could run into a situation where expectations are misaligned and conflicts pop up as a result. If they\u2019re going to hire you, explain to them how your process works. Show your interest in them and their business, then break down what they can expect by working with you step-by-step. Being transparent isn\u2019t a weakness, it helps build trust and confidence, and can be what seals the deal in a proposed project. 7. Write, write, write This is the most important tip I can give you to take your freelancing to the next level: And that\u2019s to write. I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good writer. Writing is the doorway to getting your name out there, having clients find you, and to truly grow yourself as an individual and freelancer. I personally don\u2019t think I\u2019m a great writer, and you can only imagine how I felt about my writing a year ago. It comes with practice. I owe everything I\u2019ve accomplished this past year to my writing. Everything I do\u2014whether it\u2019s a blog post, a newsletter, a book, a video, or an email to a client\u2014it all starts with writing. If you want a complete rundown of why writing is imperative to your freelancing, then I highly recommend you watch this video by Sean McCabe: It All Starts With Writing Hopefully, after reading this post you\u2019ll check out Sean\u2019s video and be convinced that you need to start writing immediately. 8. Focus on the now Watch your feet so you don\u2019t trip while looking at the end goal. You know where you want to be one day, so focus on what you can do now to end up there. Too many freelancers get hung up on envying those they aspire to be. If you wish to have a reliable client base, a product that can help supplement your income, or if you don\u2019t want to have to rely on a single client to make a living, then what are you doing today to make that happen? Make a daily to-do list with small tasks that you can easily complete by the end of the day. Progress is progress. And if you start taking it one step at a time towards your long term goals: The sooner you\u2019ll get there. 9. Know your numbers A lot of freelancers handle themselves like contractors when they should really be viewing themselves as small businesses. Just because you work from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a business owner, and every good business owner needs to know their numbers. Such as: \u2022 Business revenue (How much do you need to make per month to live?) \u2022 Site traffic (Where is it coming from? What\u2019s your most popular content?) \u2022 Link conversion rates and content interactivity (What calls-to-action are working? What pages aren\u2019t getting views and need to be removed altogether?) \u2022 The amount of time you spend on certain types of business activities (and how much you\u2019re estimating and/or charging for) Knowing these numbers will shed light on the areas that are working for you and what areas need improvement. For example: Take a look at your monthly revenue. Find out where your business income is coming from (what clients, type of projects, passive income), and focus more on those areas that are producing the most results. If you\u2019re steadily earning $100+ a month selling products on your Creative Marketshop, then consider producing more items to sell. See where most of your traffic is coming from or what type of content is most popular, then do more of that. Another example: If you\u2019re getting a lot of traffic from a guest post you wrote, reach out and write another guest post. 10. Split your income for taxes and savings If you\u2019re serious about freelancing, then start separating your income and savings. For every dollar I make that\u2019s business related, I split it up like this: \u2022 12% to Business (for business-related expenses) \u2022 16% to Business Taxes (this will save my butt when it comes tax time) \u2022 12% to Personal Savings \u2022 What\u2019s left over goes into my personal checking for living expenses I\u2019m not saying this is the way to handle and split your finances, but it\u2019s what works for me. What\u2019s important here is putting a minimum of 16% of every dollar earned towards taxes. It\u2019s the same concept of an employer taking taxes out of your paycheck. Once it comes tax time, you\u2019ll then use this savings to pay what\u2019s due. (I recommend paying quarterly, so you\u2019re not dealt one large payment in April.) ",

            "answer_text": "A few years ago I read an article about how freelance bookkeepers could earn $60/hr and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh my ass off. Being an Accounting major who worked with business owners daily (Commercial Loan Officer), I had an inside view of how much bookkeepers \u201cactually\u201d made\u2026 And after seeing this article (from a former CPA), I chalked it up to another scumbag that was just trying to sell some info product that didn\u2019t work. A couple months went by and I didn\u2019t think much of it, until the day I was unexpectedly let go from my job and had to figure out another source of income\u200a\u2014\u200aasap. After a few days of searching and looking for the best option to dig myself out of this hole, I remembered the article I\u2019d read a few months back\u2026 And even though I was still hesitant, I didn\u2019t have any other options, so I decided to take the leap and become a freelance bookkeeper. To my surprise, I was able to make a decent amount of money off bookkeeping right away ($35/hr)\u2026  But it took me a total of 3 weeks to realize that I couldn\u2019t do this much longer, as I absolutely HATED crunching numbers (funny to say for an accounting major). This led me to doing more research and that\u2019s when I came across an article that talked about a writer who was making $125/hr. Now this really made me LOL as it was crazy enough to hear that a \u201creal job\u201d like bookkeeping was able to make $60/hr, but a fake job like \u201cwriting\u201d? There\u2019s no chance in hell those hippies could make that much. At the same time, I was intrigued to learn more, mainly so I could uncover the lie\u2026 And well, 3 years later, as I write this article\u200a\u2014\u200aI can honestly say that I turned down 3 writing jobs this morning, all at a rate of $97/hr. Why in the hell would I do that? Short answer, because I can\u2019t handle anymore clients. Long answer, because over the years I\u2019ve learned a few small tweaks that help me stand out from the \u201cstarving writers\u201d, and instead, able to make a good living off writing. Trust me, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a Hemingway either. Do I have skills that produce results? Absolutely, but so do a lot of other writers out there\u2026 And the only thing that differentiates me from them is the strategy I follow, which I\u2019m going to give you today\u2026 Starting with: Higher rates = better clients One of the hardest things for me to understand in the early days of freelance writing was how charging low rates is actually the dumbest thing you can do to get new clients. Not only does this cause burnout and do more harm than good, but it also tells clients that you don\u2019t value your work\u2026 Which means the good clients won\u2019t want to work with you, and since we have to find somebody who\u2019s willing to pay us for our work, that usually ends in you working with a bunch of shitty clients\u2026 Which always leads to burnout, stress, and future articles about how being a freelance writer is the dumbest thing you can do. Know what I mean? Good, now that you know, I need you to go back to the drawing board and start increasing your rates. That\u2019s not saying that you should start charging $125/hr so you attract the best clients, as you still have to be SOMEWHAT practical\u2026 But if you\u2019re reading this article, I bet there\u2019s some room for you to raise it. To give you some idea of where you should be, I started landing an endless stream of writing clients when I was charging $45/hr (and that was when I had like, 2 weeks of experience)\u2026 But experience isn\u2019t the only thing you should take into consideration, as you also need to look at your skill. Because clients pay for results, not proper grammar I always have to laugh when I look at other freelance writer\u2019s profiles as the main \u201cbenefit\u201d they talk about is how they know how to write grammatically correct articles. Something about how they have an English degree from some fancy university and have a command of the english language, which is great, but again\u200a\u2014\u200aclients don\u2019t pay for good grammar\u2026 They pay for good results. If I had to pick one thing, I\u2019d say this is the biggest disconnect between freelance writers and good clients as writers think clients want fancy language, when clients know they just want results. This is important for many reasons, but one of the easiest ways to overcome this issue is by simply picking a skill that they can actually measure. What do I mean? Think about it from the client\u2019s perspective. Very few clients are going to pay top dollar for a proofreader as they don\u2019t think they\u2019re getting that much value out of it\u2026 And at the same time, a lot of clients won\u2019t pay a lot of money for bloggers either. That\u2019s not saying they\u2019re not out there as I\u2019ve seen plenty of people make money by doing so and I\u2019ve personally made $45/hr as a blogger myself, but that\u2019s nothing like the rates people will pay for skills that directly make them more money\u2026 Such as: Landing page copywritersEmail funnel copywritersSales page copywritersAd copywritersAnd any other form of copywriter that essentially serves as a digital salesman on paper\u2026The takeaway: There\u2019s 2 important lessons that any writer can take from this, and that\u2019s: Think about how much value your skill bringsAre you a proofreader that simply ensures there\u2019s no typos in the client\u2019s blog? Don\u2019t expect to become a millionaire anytime soon. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a sales page copywriter that creates a digital salesman that keeps ringing up sales.. Then forget about hourly pricing and start looking at value, because it doesn\u2019t matter how long it takes you to do\u200a\u2014\u200ait matters how much value they\u2019re getting off your work. 2. Learn how to show what benefit you bring to the table The other side of this is always remembering that it\u2019s your job to show the client what you can do for them. I see this mistake way too often with any freelancer, where the think it\u2019s the client\u2019s fault for not seeing their worth\u2026 And even though that might be true, playing the blame game has never benefited anybody, so stop crying and start learning how to show your worth. But remember, some clients can only pay so much The last thing I really had to learn on my journey was that some clients simply can\u2019t pay your rate. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the best copywriter in the world who knows how to show your benefits and create an irresistible offer, if your target market can\u2019t pay your rates\u200a\u2014\u200athen you might as well headbutt a brick wall (figuratively, please don\u2019t actually do that). How can you avoid this dilemma? Position yourself to attract a certain target market. One that not only needs your service, but can also pay your rate\u2026 And to give you an example of this, when I first started as a Copywriter, I positioned myself as a Copywriter for Tax Firms. I did this as I knew all established tax firms had enough money to pay my rates, but I also knew the number nerds (I can say that as I\u2019m one of them) hardly ever know how to market, so when I can produce results and get them lifetime clients\u2026 Then well, $97/hr is chump change compared to the amount of revenue they\u2019re making over the years, a win-win for both parties. Long story short\u2026 Writers don\u2019t have to starve. I don\u2019t care how many bad clients you\u2019ve had or what you want to say about \u201cluck\u201d, there\u2019s plenty of writers who\u2019ve been able to make a good living\u2026 And the only thing that separates them from you is a good strategy.
