            "answer_text": "Charles Dickens would certainly top my list. I\u2019d also add William Thackeray and George Elliot (actually Mary Ann Evans, but it was hard for a woman to get published in those days). Other well known Victorian writers are the Bront\u00eb sisters, Emily being perhaps the most famous for her Wuthering Heights, but Charlotte should not be ignored for her fine novels Villette and Jane Eyre. I\u2019d also recommend Anthony Trollope who wrote a whole series of novels collectively known as the Barsetshire chronicles. (The first one is called The Warden, and is a fine example of his writing.) And one should certainly not neglect Thomas Hardy, whose novels Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles and The Mayor of Casterbridge are excellent examples of his writing. ",
