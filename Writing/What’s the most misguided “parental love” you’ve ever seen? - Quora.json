            "answer_text": "The most revolting parent-child interaction I ever witnessed was in Burlington, Vt. This couple was visiting from New York and they had a two year old daughter. They were standing outside in the pedestrian mall and the father was bending over talking to the daughter and saying, \u201cmommy and daddy want to go into this kitchen store. Is that okay with you?\u201d Sorry folks. But letting a two year old run your life and asking a kid for permission to do something is more than I can handle. ",
