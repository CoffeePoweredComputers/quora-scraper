Any advice would be helpful! So, here\u2019s some things. If you don\u2019t already have a writer friend to talk shop or correspond with\u2026 that is a MASSIVE help. More so, if you can join a group where they motivate you to be productive. A good group is hard to find\u2026 but when you get one it just makes the experience less isolating. I have my Auth-mentors space (Auth-mentors) which I\u2019m hoping to get writers hooked up with groups\u2026 there\u2019s also a lot of good writing articles in there too. One secret is DO NOT tell your story idea to anyone. A piece or a part but never the whole idea. Part of the storytelling push is TO TELL THE STORY\u2026 if you let it out, so to speak, it reduces your own urgency to get the story written down. Talk freely about story bits you have committed to page\u2014 but keep mum about what you haven\u2019t written yet. Set milestones for yourself. Give yourself rewards for hitting them. Make every day productive. If you can\u2019t write, edit or brainstorm, or read about writing craft\u2026 as long as your scheduled time is just about writing. Make yourself a reading list of books in your genre. Get inspired. Be creative!  ",

            "answer_text": "First. What are you writing? Fiction, non-fiction. If its fiction, what genre? If nonfiction, what is your expertise. In either case put your answer in GOOGE and read all you can about your topic. Those articles will recommend books, training closes, and methods. All this should take a few years. In the meantime, write. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s good. One last thing. If you are doing this for money or notoriety you will likely fail. If you are doing it because you have something in your heart that you must say. NEVER stop. ",
