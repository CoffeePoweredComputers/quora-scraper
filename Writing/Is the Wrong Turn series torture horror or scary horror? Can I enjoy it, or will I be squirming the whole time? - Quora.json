            "answer_text": "The first Wrong Turn is gory but still pretty good. There were scenes I did feel myself rooting for the characters and scenes I felt fear for them. However the rest of the series is more of torture porn then horror. Props for Wrong Turn 2 for killing what everybody thought was going to be the main girl really early on in the movie. The other films go more downhill and unless you only want to see people die in gross ways, its not worth seeing. In the fourth one it turns into a sex cult. It just isn't good. ",

            "answer_text": "The Wrong Turns series is actually a little of both. There are a bunch of scenes where people are killed slowly and in extremely painful ways, but there\u2019s also a lot of scary imagery (Monstorous faces, shrieking, wild jump scares, etc.). These are basically your standard textbook horror movies. They are gory, goofy, and have hilariously bad narratives. So if you like that stuff you will like this. But if you have an aversion to gore or \u201cscary\u201d images you will definitely be squirming. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that some of these movies are just a tad bit nastier than most horror movies. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Is the Wrong Turn series torture horror or scary horror? Can I enjoy it, or will I be squirming the whole time? Ans: It is a torture horror. You will surely enjoy it if you enjoy blood and gory movies. You will not be squirming, there are some good terrifying scenes but in some scenes, you'll find yourself laughing at the death scene of a person. It uses alot of jump scares, a lot of adult content, a little profanity and a lot of blood. Overall it is a series worth watching. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "The series starts out as suspense of being stalked mixed with gory scenes when the cannibals catch and kill someone ( ala The Hills Have Eyes ). The subsequent movies devote less run time to building the suspense and become more focused on the torture and kills. The forth goes into the mystery/ investigation of the family\u2019s origins\u2026 but then the series goes back to being kill and torture centric. ",
