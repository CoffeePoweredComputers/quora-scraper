            "answer_text": "Being an amateur writer myself, I can empathise. I'm going to assume that you dedicated yourself to writing this book simply because you wanted to tell a story; a story that you absolutely could not keep to yourself. You wrote this story because it needed to be told. I hope that's the reason you began writing it in the first place and not because you were looking to make money, or dreaming about becoming exceptionally successful.  However, it's completely understandable to lose motivation when you don't get the kind of feedback you want. Back when I was in seventh grade, I used to write these novellas, but I'd get no appreciation. It kind of demotivated me. However in due time,I came across this amazing ebook sharing website called 'Wattpad' (link: Wattpad - Stories You'll Love) I began posting my stories and poems here, however crappy they were. And eventually I became a serious writer. Wattpad has tons of teenagers just like you, who love to read and write. What you need is someone who will read your book and tell you that writing those 2,00,000 words wasn't a waste of time. You might think right now that that's not what you really want. But trust me, you do.  I used to abandon writing projects. But then I began working on this novel in ninth grade and around five people told me that they couldn't wait to read more. Compared to other books and novels out there, it was quite less, but still, it was encouraging. Today? I've finished two novels, and am currently working on my third one. All of them are on Wattpad, and they haven't been published. I'm not earning money or anything, but writing still makes me happy. Why? Because people tell me that reading my book made them cry, or made them really happy. They tell me it changed their life. And I think that's the best thing ever, to impact people. Write for yourself, and write to make an impact. Success is secondary and will come in due time. What you need is someone appreciating your work and telling youthat you are a great writer. You need some motivation. So, what are you waiting for? Go to Wattpad  and create an account, and start posting what you've written. Give it some time and you will recieve the appreciation you deserve. Then you can start publisher hunting with a renewed energy. What's important if that you must believe that your book is special. And if you need some external appreciation, then why not? There are millions of people on Wattpad waiting to do just that. All the best, and don't lose hope! Anyone who spends a year writing 2,00,000 words must be pretty damn talented and dedicated. You're going to get published soon! You just need a bit of determination, patience and self confidence. x ",
