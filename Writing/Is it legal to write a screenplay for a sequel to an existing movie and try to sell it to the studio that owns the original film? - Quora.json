            "answer_text": "It is indeed legal. Others have spoken to the questionable wisdom of doing so. In truth they are correct: it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to even present your version of the story to anyone with any power to get it made. Not only will they immediately open themselves to the risk of lawsuit by you if anything in their version of the sequel even remotely resembles anything in the script you can legally prove they asked to read, including things which are core and central and non-original to the premise. But they\u2019re also well-aware of the extreme unlikelihood that anything in your screenplay is worth their time, much less that risk. Big properties are written by dozens and dozens of screenwriters, all people who are working at the top of their game. Your being able to contribute anything of value is about the same as my joining a game of pick-up basketball with current NBA all-stars and expecting to contribute anything of value to that game. In that perspective, however, remember this: if you write an all-original spec screenplay, your odds of getting it made into a movie are really not all that much higher than your odds of selling that sequel to that studio, truth be told. I have heard reliably that for those NBA-all-star-level screenwriters that 90% of their work comes from assignments, not from spec work. So is it worth it to write your sequel version? As a writing exercise, if you\u2019re passionate about it - it\u2019s worth it. As a writing sample, if you\u2019re passionate about it and if your chops are at a professional level - it can\u2019t really harm you. As a pipe dream lottery ticket, well, it\u2019s less-likely than your winning the Powerball this weekend, but if you wanna buy that ticket, go for it! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In fact, so-called \u201cspec scripts\u201d for existing TV shows are a common exercise and portfolio item for writers trying to break into the business. Good luck trying to apply that to a film studio without having an agent or direct contacts with a creative team that\u2019s ready to produce your movie; movie studios tend to be a lot more picky and discerning about who they source for projects and actively avoid unsolicited scripts. You\u2019re a lot less likely to sell Marvel a script than you are to take an original script for a public domain character like Robin Hood and shop it around between a lot of different studios. But this is common enough practice. ",
