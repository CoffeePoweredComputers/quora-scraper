            "answer_text": "There are hundreds of platforms out there for developing websites. However, as per stats reported by Forbes, it\u2019s WordPress websites that make up for about 15% of the top 100 websites across the globe. Also, WordPress boasts nearly one-third of total active websites. This, however, may not be enough of a reason for you to zero in on this platform. Hence, we present you with some of the best reasons why you should hire a WordPress Web Development Company. Responsive Web Design A website is not only for people who use computers. It is also meant for mobile users. There are many free tools available in the market, which can offer you attractive Websites. However, the question arises: are they responsive when your users open them on mobile? Only an expert team of WordPress Developers can build you a Responsive Website.  Rich customization Various templates and plugins are available for free for WordPress Websites. However, not everyone can make the most of them in order to give you the best performance. Therefore, you need a deft team who would realize your vision to turn them into requirements. Only an experienced WordPress Web Development Company can build you an intuitive and customized website. Brand identity design A renowned WordPress Web Development Company would offer you logo designs, mock-ups, and other brand design services exclusively for your company. Needless to mention, they take your brand value to new heights. Hence, it is advisable to rely only on an experienced team of WordPress Developers. Customer-centric approach You can witness the customer-centric approach while working with a leading WordPress Web Development Company. Instant solution, premium output, and professionalism are the three most desired aspects of outsourcing to a Web Development Company. Hence, you should not compromise with the quality of your website by not relying on a reputed WordPress Development Company. Post-development support A number of issues sprout up once the Web Development is complete. Website updates, bugs, loading time are some of the worst ones. With an adept WordPress Web Development Company, however, dealing with them is not an issue. They ensure such issues are taken care of by their in-house WordPress Developers and Testers.
