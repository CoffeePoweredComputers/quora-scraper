            "answer_text": "You can only achieve this with VERY hard work and the support of an IELTS specialist. At 5.5 you are almost certainly being held back by a number of crucial factors, such as habitual grammar errors, reliance upon simple structures only and inadequate lexical range (vocabulary). There may also be faults in your essay structure, including paragraphing. I am an experienced and qualified specialist in supporting people to achieve the IELTS band level they need and can help you.
