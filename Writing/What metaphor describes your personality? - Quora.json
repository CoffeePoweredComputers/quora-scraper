            "answer_text": "A2A What metaphor describes your personality? Amy is an Autostereogram. At first glance, depending on circumstances and your vision, Amy may appear either extremely simple or overly complicated. However it is possible you just haven\u2019t figured out how to look, or what you are looking for, or what the appropriate distance is for you to keep from Amy specifically (close or far) to see her best images clearly. Austereograms can hold many interesting images, but they are slow reveals. The first image is not what you will eventually see. Not everyone can see the images in Autostereograms. Some viewers will only see a randomly dotted mess or alternatively an overly controlled and structured pattern. Like many things, what you see will depend entirely on your own perception. If you are patient and capable, Amy will reveal more images to you the longer you stay engaged in looking for them. Amy is very visual and also enjoys viewing all kinds of images herself. She would rather look back at something interesting than only be viewed. Please keep in mind if viewing an Austereogram is not a good fit for you, the effort may leave you cross eyed.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the fun a2a, Jessica! How did you know about my love of metaphors? ;) I would have to say the southern cross constellation aka Crux.  This is not so much my personality as it is my journey in life. What it symbolizes to me: The journey of self discovery\u2026 The shape of the cross symbolizes the cosmic axis between heaven and earth. My personal journey has been mostly about embodiment. I am the type of person who can get easily stuck in her head and disconnected from her senses. I have a tendency to dissociate which is a habit I formed early in life. I am constantly working on ways to stay embodied. The heaven-earth axis (cross) is where the mind and body converge. The stars themselves represent the divine light\u2026the spark of energy that is creativity, intelligence, love, and self awareness. Those are all of the things I seek. Finally, the song, The Southern Cross, by Crosby, Stills and Nash is my all time favorite song because of all of the awesome metaphorical language. Here are a few of the lyrics along with my metaphorical translations: \u2026In a noisy bar in Avalon (Distractions of life and other people) I tried to call you (the Self)But on a midnight watch (During my darkest hour) I realized why twice you ran away (Coming to terms with the reasons I have abandoned myself). \u2026Spirits are using me, larger voices callin' (What I seek is seeking me)What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten (The real me was never really lost)I have been around the world looking for that woman girl (Myself) Who knows love can endureAnd you know it will (Love Thy Self) \u2026When you see the Southern Cross for the first time (Self awareness)You understand now why you came this way (Understanding the purpose of my journey)'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a coming day (Coming home to myself, what could be bigger?) \u2026You will survive being bested, somebody fine will come alongMake me forget about loving you and the Southern Cross (Strangely, even this last lyric brings me comfort. It reminds me of the transience of all of this. Soon enough, the spirit that embodies me today will be on to something new and the form that I call \u201cme\u201d today will be history.) ",
