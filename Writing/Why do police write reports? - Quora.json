            "answer_text": "To let the prosecutor, and the accused, know what the officer\u2019s evidence is going to be, to have a record of the incident that others can access, and to help them remember if the case goes to trial (which generally is a year or more down the line). Here in Canada, specifically in British Columbia, the process for a criminal charge begins with the incident. The police do their investigation \u2014 sometime, the police officer is the only witness, so there\u2019s not much to investigate \u2014 then they either arrest the offender or release him. He can be released unconditionally, or on his promise to attend court on a specific date. The officer then writes the police report, and sends that to Crown Counsel along with whatever exhibits are available at the time. That might include photographs, witnesses statements, or other things. If police haven\u2019t released the offender, then they write their report immediately and send it to Crown Counsel (that\u2019s like your A.D.A.) The Crown decides whether or not to formally charge the offender, and if they are charged, then there\u2019s a bail hearing. The offender, who we now call the accused, either is released or held in jail without bail until the case is concluded. If the police have released the person themselves, then they will take a day or two longer to write the report, and submit everything to Crown. Crown has a copy of the offender\u2019s Promise to Appear, and knows they have to make the decision to charge or not by that date. In Canada, as in the U.S., an accused person is entitled to disclosure of the Crown\u2019s evidence against them. The police report is the most important piece of evidence that the Crown has, as it is a record not only of the police officer\u2019s evidence, but a summary of what all the other witnesses are going to say. Police reports can make our job as prosecutors easy, or, if poorly written and organized, it can make our lives very difficult. Either way, even though the police report itself is not evidence (the testimony the police officer gives in court is the evidence) the police report is an integral part of the criminal justice system.

            "answer_text": "Ever watch \u201cLaw and Order\u201d? Police are only the first step in the legal process. Think of an assembly line, building cars. Without the frame, you have nothing to bolt the engine, fenders, body, or other parts on to, right? Police build the frame. A crime is reported. The responding officer starts taking information. Who, What, When, Where, Why, and any other details that flesh it out. In many cases, that report is enough. If further work needs to be done, detectives might handle it, generating Supplemental reports, or it gets kicked back to the officer, who investigates further, and does the Supplement. Each victim generates an Initial Investigation report. And Property Loss report, and Witness Statement reports. I had one stolen truck report that went twenty pages, and then the accused confessed, generating a thirteen page confession, which I also had to write, as he dictated it. With side paper, it was about forty pages for one truck. I handled an identity theft case, covering actions the accused bragged about across the US. Contacting banks, businesses, I was able to reconstruct the last two weeks of the guy\u2019s life before I caught him. It was in the hundreds of pages, taking me a week to file the case. Ten months later, after Florida decided they were ready to try him, I was supposed to fly down to testify. Instead, he pleaded guilty, and given how crowded their prisons were, get time served, but credit for five years in prison. On paper, he did five years. In reality, he did about seven months in Florida jails, the rest being in NJ, fighting extradition. ",
