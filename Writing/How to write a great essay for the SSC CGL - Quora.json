            "answer_text": "In SSC CGL descriptive plays a very important role as it could be the game changer in getting dream post or getting job when you are 10\u201315 marks short till tier-2. Essay carries 50 marks out of 100 which have to written in the word limit of 250 words (+-10%). For preparing good essay you need to have decent knowledge and content: There is a book called \u201c151 ESSAYS\u201d by Arihant publication. Read this book to get an overview of general topics and use that knowledge to form your essay. Make a list of all the trending topics or you can easily get that from various YouTube channels and telegram groups.Start reading newspaper on daily basis especially the editorials because reading them would make you familiar about how to approach while writing an essay.Join various telegram and facebook groups meant for tier 3 preparation. Here you can post your essay and get them evaluated by fellow aspirants. Also you can get number of essays on same topic, so good amount of content on same topic would be there. Generally SSC asks essay on general topic like in 2016- Earthquake, 2017- Demonetization, 2018- Importance of education. So you don't have to do anything special but some sincere writing practice to write good content in limited words. So now coming how to approach which i follow: Always try to divide the essay into 3 parts i.e introduction, body and conclusion and amalgate them into 250 words. For example i have written a essay on \u201cChild Labor\u201d keeping these facts in mind (although i crossed the word limit :D)  In intro write few introductory points about the topic or start with a beautiful quote if you know which is relevant to essay topic.In body of the essay talk about reason, causes, effects etc. Substantiate all these with facts like any law, article, example etc. associated with topic.Finally in conclusion talk about initiatives taken, way forward etc. to end the essay on positive note.No need to write essay in flowering language because simple english words that are appropriate as per essay will also do.Although i haven't followed in above essay but always write essay in the same sheet format as provided by SSC in exam i.e the box format.  Always take some time before writing an essay (SSC provides you enough time in descriptive exam). Read the topic, recall all the points you know about the topic, write rough points with pencil in the backside of sheet (don't forget to rub them) and now accordingly write your essay. Doing this thing will keep you on track while writing.Finally BE CAREFUL while reading instructions mentioned in the question paper and fill all the details very carefully. In case of SSC you need to he extra careful.Be calm and compose because SSC provides you enough time to attempt 2 questions and good amount of practice can fetch good marks. So Work Hard, Stay Motivated and All The Best :) Image sources: Google, telegram and my mobile gallery. ",

            "answer_text": "Essay is a personality test where you get an opportunity to portray your thoughts without having the fear of facing any examiner/interviewer. I have always liked writing Essays. Stood first in west zone English Essay writing competition(Respresented Army Public school Delhi cantonment), had scored amazing marks in UPSC CAPF(Assistant commandant) exam, won many prizes in my current department too. Now coming to the question how to write a good essay. Preparation is essential(I never did this preparation as i had the habit of reading The Hindu and Times of India). How to do some homework. Prepare a list of macro topics that you feel are very important. This thing will help in writing any Essay on earth. I will list out some macro topics for you. Employment- Hot topic these days. Gather all the relevant datas from google search engine. Role of education(vocational education), Government policies in the field, whether higher education is upto the mark, can education lead to employment? Placement from colleges, loopholes in the education sector, then are these loopholes addressed by NEW education policy 2020(This will itself be a macro topic Education)? Challenges faced by employment sector after Covid-19(big layoffs by private sector), Solutions/steps taken by the government and any step suggested by you(this will fetch you 10% extra marks).Education- Learn Education from British Era to current Education policies, Role of women in education, Education for the disadvantaged, Gross Enrolment Ratio, Education at primary, secondaryand higher education, challenges faced, vocational education(Gandhian principles of DPSPs), RTE act, Beti bachao beti padhao, sarva siksha abhiyam, Education and literacy inter relation, Reservation in Education, Employment amd education, Pros and Cons of New Education policy(2020), Learnt the meaning of \u201cEducate a woman, educate a family\u201d, Emphasis on local language while learning(Gandhian ideology), etc.Women- This is the most important topic for any exam. Important points that you should keep in mind- Literacy rate(Highest to lowest across the states), Sex ratio, Infant mortality rate, MMR(maternal mortality rate) GER, patriarchal mindset, Preference of boy child over girl child, Policies of central government in every field(Education, workplace), crime against women, inequality at workplace in wages and respect, Role of women in leading the state/nation(New zealand is a good example). You can write any essay on women if you know 15\u201320 such points.Environment- Climate change and Role of India. Paris agreement/Rio summit etc, Clashes between developed and developing countries, Why do we need to consider climate change in policies? Sustainable development? Sustainable development goals(Remember these SDGs by heart as they help in writing a good essay), Different types of pollution, plastic pollution is a hot topic(Marine environment), Role of US/China in combating climate change.Technology- Artificial intelligence- Give very good examples. From using google Assitance/Siri to robotics, it has a wider range.Economics- This will be a bit difficult essay to handle. I will discuss this some other time.Philosophical thoughts- Gandhi, Ambedkar are important personalities.Learn 4\u20135 good quotes on each macro topic. This will help you in fetching good marks and will increase interest of the examiner.How to write an essay- Start/Intro-The biggest question is how to start an essay and grab the complete attention of the examiner. There are two ways to start an essay. First is write a beautiful quote on the topic of the essay and go ahead by writing an introduction. Second is quote a real life example. For e.g You need to write an essay on education\u2026A maid comes to my house. She manages to earn 5,000/- month but she has four children and not all have access to education. She manages to send her two sons whereas two daughters are unable to get education. This will address many problems of the society including education. Our country will be really free when every child will have access to state sponsored quality education. Then, write a quote by either Gandhi ji or Ambedkar. Then comes the body of the essay. Include three to four paragraphs. Where you will write Pros/Cons/causes/Effects of the topic. Make sure you include knowledge of sub topics of macro topics mentioned above. This will also include various steps taken by the government in this regard. All the schemes concerned and constitutional principles(Read Preamble/FRs/FDuties/DPSPs for this) will help you in writing an effective essay. Conclusion- Positive conclusion. Always. All the best. Good wishes from Igniting Aspirants. ",
