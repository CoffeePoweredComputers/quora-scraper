            "answer_text": "Every discipline has their approach to writing without plagiarizing. If you are writing an essay meant for colleagues of similar interest then you will have numerous examples of how to do it published in journals of that discipline. The time honored approach is to \u2018reference\u2019 ideas that you have gleaned from your reading or listening by quoting direct copies of language such as \u201cIn the beginning was the word \u2026\u201d (John 1) or by paraphrasing that idea while giving credit to its author. Most readers will know that the prior quote is from the Christian bible but you are helping the reader by telling them more exactly where to find that idea or quote by listing the source at the end of your essay in a bibliography. The protocol for those references are passed on by tradition among writers who want to distinguish their own new ideas, which they are sharing in the current writing, from old ideas that they have inherited from past thinkers, writers as well as their own past writing. This is followed religiously to help the reader unless you want to confuse the origins of the idea and be labeled a plagiarist by a reader who knows the origin. So you can plagiarize yourself by repeating an idea in multiple articles without telling the reader when you first came up with the idea. When writing an essay for a general audience (such as in a newspaper article) the rules are a bit relaxed without a formal bibliography but one should still attribute ideas not your own to an original author, such as \u201cMartin Luther King assured us that \u2018We shall overcome!\u2019 and started us on a path to social equality.\u201d The idea that we are on a path to social equality may be an idea that you are asserting in this essay as your observation, but you gave credit to MLK as an important earlier stimulus in that direction. This \u2018Popular Essay\u2019 form still requires that you not lift text or ideas from other writers or speakers without giving them credit. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the volume of information available on the internet, it is difficult to write an essay that does not contain text from some of the billions of sources. In academia, there are several ways around the problem. First, after completing the essay, use a plagiarism checker such as Grammarly\u2019s function or TurnItIn\u2019s fantastic array of functions. A second way is to cite the source if you are quoting someoneone. A third\u2014and less honest way\u2014is to change the text in the plagiarized material. However, be forewarned that the plagiarism checkers will compare styles of the author and the suspected plagiarism. If the writer\u2019s tone and style do not match the balance of the document that you plan to submit, the good checkers will highlight the suspected plagiarism. In this event, prepare for negative consequences. In brief, there is no \u201cfoolproof\u201d way of writing an essay without some part of the text having been written before. The key to this problem is to do your best and not rely on the thoughts and words of others unless you are using them to make a point or to analyze the content of the \u201clift.\u201d This note is written by a university professor who takes the additional step of asking students to submit two papers that I use as a benchmark to see how well they write. Most of the suspected plagiarism results from the inconsistency between the sample papers and the ones submitted later. I do this for all of the courses taught. ",
