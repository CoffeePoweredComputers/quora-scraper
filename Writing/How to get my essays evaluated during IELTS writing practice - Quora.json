Before you start writing your essays, go through the online resources that are available for free, take down tips and vocabulary. Not to be trapped in plagiarism, have a writing style of your own. Ensure your task response is adequate (answer all parts of the question/rubric). Your grammar should be reasonably good (particularly the Articles and Prepositions), use simple, compound and complex sentences, reasonably good vocabulary and collocations avoiding repetition of words and ideas, have appropriate connectors between paragraphs( 3\u20134 at least) and conclude by restating your thesis statement. This should fetch you 7+ without a doubt. All the best, ",
