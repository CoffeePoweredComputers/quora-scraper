So I\u2019ll give a straight answer. You\u2019re almost certainly not ready to write anything publishable. You\u2019re in the learning, discovering stage \u2014 a wonderful stage to be in. My God, looking back fifty-odd year, how I envy you! The things you\u2019ll discover! The connections you\u2019ll make! Now the advice. Read as much as you can. Think about how the things you read work as stories, but don\u2019t worry about how the pieces fit together. That will come when you\u2019ve absorbed enough. Same goes for movies. Watche them. Spend hours. Once Upon a Time in the West, Zorba the Greek, Casablanca, The African Queen, Lawrence of Arabia, Scent of a Woman, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, this year\u2019s big noise, whatever. Say to your self, \u201cOoh, I like that! Could I do that? How did they do that?\u201d Think to yourself, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t like that! That\u2019s not what I want to do!\u201d Vacuum it all up. There\u2019s a guy/gal in the back of your head making sense of it for you. He/she\u2019s wired for it. Trust him/her. The more you feed him/her, the more you\u2019ll have to work with when you\u2019re ready to write for real. When you think the guy in the back of your head is ready, write something. It may be crap, but don\u2019t worry. We all write crap at the beginning. Practice makes improvement. The trick is to keep trying. You never give up. No surrender. So on we go. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s three things I\u2019d like to say: Read. This may sound counterintuitive, but it helps a lot to read all kinds of books and get to know the writing styles of a great many people. Perhaps it\u2019ll give you some ideas too.Write. In the end writing becomes somewhat of a burden too. Writer\u2019s block is common. It is very good practice to establish a fixed writing routine. It\u2019s like practicing the piano - it might be dull and repetitive but in the end it pays off beautifully.Take your time. When I first started out writing I couldn\u2019t get more than one paragraph out before I began to get nervous sweats. It took me some time and a lot of writing to get comfortable in my own skin.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Taking your friends at their word, I have no doubt that you have great skill, and I also believe you have a great passion for writing. Yes, you should do as much writing as you can. However, consider this. I had a great passion for writing when I was 16 years old, and I had, what I thought, were great plots for fiction stories. Then I read something discouraging that said I would become much better after a few more years in school and after a million more words had been written. What a shock! College was many years off for me. But as time passed, it all made sense. In some years from now you will look back on stories that you had written or planned to write, and realize that that there are many, many more facets to the subjects you write about that you couldn\u2019t possible be aware of without exposure to further education, further reading, further experiences in life.

            "answer_text": "Having read all the answers already given, I will agree 100% that reading and writing are the two biggest things you can do to improve your writing. The only other piece of advice I can give you is to get involved in the online writers community. A good place to start is on YouTube. There is a lively writers community there. There are many traditional and indie writers who have published books that are offering great advice on how to improve your writing. There are many who are not too much older than you when they published their first book. So get engaged there and learn writing techniques. That is the one thing that will get you to the next level. You need to spend some time learning the craft of writing a story. This is really important if you look to write anything longer than a short story. If you plan to expand out into writing full length novels. Do yourself a favor and learn what it takes to make a page turning novel. I wish I had these resources available to me when I was 14. I would have saved myself a lot of time and frustration trying to write had I had a readily available resource on how to write a compelling story. ",

Read every genre, young adult, science fiction, sports stories, biographies, every thing, even poetry. Make sure each book is either a major award winner, a best-seller or a classic. Pay attention to how the authors use words, how they can make you see what they can, how they build excitement. Keep doing these things every day for the rest of your life. Take grammar more seriously. It is crucial to your writing. Your question has issues. It will be hard to become a writer with your current skill set. Haunt the library. ",

My 8th novel and my 10th book will come out this year. It is not easy. It is art. To do it well requires talent, study, dedication and work.
