            "answer_text": "What is compelling depends on who is being compelled; what is compelling for one might be irrelevant for another. That said, as I've reflected a bit on the topic and have seen it argued many times, I have certainly considered many arguments and found some more compelling than others (i have some footnotes as a comment). For veganism: To produce animal products, we need to harm animals. The harm inflicted upon the animals is generally far greater than the harm avoided through us eating meat, as meat is completely unnecessary to us in the western world given the availability of vegetarian nutrients. I think this is a solid base argument for why we shouldn't produce animal products in general (though there are exceptions). I can't really argue against this. However, an argument against the production of animal products doesn't necessarily translate into an argument against consumption of animal products; see 2.\"Against\" veganism: Due to how capitalism operates, the effect of so-called \"consumer power\" is itself nearly nil, and the advocacy of \"consumer power\" can be outright damaging, in depowering organizing that can actually affect things. This is to me a very solid argument against the political use of veganism, and the key reason why, after all, I'm not a vegan. To my mind, political veganism is basically like any other kind of \"consumer power\" movement; the effect of the veganism itself is nil, and by convincing people that \"voting with your wallet\" is something regular working class people can actually do, our ability to organize effective political movements is weakened.For veganism: In addition to the direct economical effects of not supporting the meat industry, veganism has the secondary effect of challenging the carnivorous culture in a way that isn't present in other forms of \"consumer power\" activism; buying fair trade shoes does nothing to culturally move us away from using shoes (thank the gods!), but not eating meat is a step to move us away from eating meat. This is also a solid argument, though I don't think it weighs as heavily as some think it does; I'm just not convinced that the effect on culture is that big, though I admit I can very well be wrong and will likely see in the years to come as to whether the rise in vegetarian and vegan diets are just a temporary trend or here to stay.Those are, to me, the three main arguments that are actually worth considering for someone in my situation (ie a Swede living in Sweden that has the ability to have a healthy vegan diet). There are also a lot of other arguments both for and against that I think can be rejected out of hand, or that simply doesn't at all mesh with my base assumptions. Some of the more common ones are: In favor: \"Humans evolved as herbivores, look at the other great apes!\": Incorrect, humans are naturally omnivorous, as are most of the other great apes to varying degrees. In addition, naturalistic fallacy. \"Meat is unhealthy!\": Without context, a useless statement. Meat can be unhealthy, so can vegetables. It's all a matter of dosage. \"*Insert baseless medical claim here*\": Get some evidence, then we'll talk. Against: \"Humans need meat!\": Incorrect, humans are are fully omnivorous and today we can get every nutrient we need without animal products. \"Humans have always eaten meat!\": Appeal to tradition. \"Supplements are \"just a substitute for a healthy diet\" and/or \"unnatural\"!\": Naturalistic fallacy. \"Without the meat industry the animals would die!\": So do they with the meat industry. Only difference is now we breed even more to kill. There's a crapload more, but those are some of the ones that have been particularly common lately, from what I've gathered. ",

            "answer_text": "My main issue with veganism is that it completely ignores how ecosystems work. A sustainable ecosystem must contain many different species of animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and so on. They are vital to the long term health of the ecosystem.  The current method of farming, where you completely destroy a natural ecosystem, and then grow monocultures in barren earth with lots of pesticides and chemical fertilizers does work for a while, but it leads to heavy soil depletion, and it needs a lot of petrol and chemical inputs, so it isn\u2019t sustainable. To grow plants in a sustainable manner, you cant just have earth, water and sunlight. You need the soil to be alive in an intricate network of fungi, bacteria, earthworms, ants, etc. You need bees to pollinate, you need herbivores to break down the fibers to return the nutrients to the earth, etc.  Like imagine you grow some soy/wheat/corn/whatever. And then you harvest the grains, and eat them. What about the stalks? If you just leave them there, they will just dry up, and the field wont grow again next year.  If you want to harvest it all, grind it up, hydrate it, compost it, and then carry it back out and spread it, well that\u2019s a lot of work! Who is going to do it? Its too much work for humans to be doing it by hand unless we all do that all day everyday. You can use a tractor and petrol to do it, but again, it isn\u2019t sustainable. Or you can use something like a cow, that will go around and eat all of that cellulose that is indigestible for humans, and chew it up, and spread it all over the place in easy compost, and then have some beetles go around and spread it and compost it even more, and then earthworms etc, and now you actually have a cycle where nutrients are accumulated over time, instead of having desertification. And you get delicious, nutritious food from the process. And yes, the cow dies at some point, and so do the beetles, earthworms, bacteria, fungi, birds, etc. But they also get to live. Unlike in the plants + pesticides + no animals scenario. In which to be fair, a lot of small animals still get to live for a while, until the pesticides kill them.   Should we stop having huge amounts of animals, warehoused in tiny spaces, and fed on grains and antibiotics? Of course. But lets not kid ourselves, and pretend that anything plant based is awesome, that palm oil is vegan so its good, and so on. There is a large population of boars living in the forests next to here, and since the forests are too small to support their natural predators, some hunting keeps their numbers down, and allows the ecosystem to remain in balance. And then I eat their meat. Not all plants are grown the same way, and not all animals are raised the same way. Trying to simplify things down to plant=good meat=bad, that\u2019s a skewed vision of things that is not helping.  ",
