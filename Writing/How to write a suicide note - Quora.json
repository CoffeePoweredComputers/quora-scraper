            "answer_text": "Explain your pain. My first draft to my kids is 5 pages! I couldn\u2019t believe how much I had to say. It\u2019ll end up being 10 pages. A suicide note - a long letter - is really, really hard to write, but it is a must. The main point of writing is it makes you think. If you write from a deep down perspective, it might just ease the pain, and lessen the anger, of those you leave behind. It might even change your mind. Writing is cathartic. My challenge, and yours might be if you decide to go through with this, is to rationalize how my mental pain and my life long emotional agony has defeated the other side of me they know: dad, grandpa, accomplished man who struggles a bit with depression but always makes people laugh. The dark side is constant anguish and anxiety, and an indescribable pain that is as real as a sharp knife stabbing me over and over and over - every single day. Despite a lifetime of shrinks, therapists, pills, and prayer, the dark side won. Plan out your suicide if that\u2019s your only option. In your letter tell your survivors that you read, researched, sought help, took medication, prayed, and yet there are no options. Plan everything - suicide is the most important thing you\u2019ll do to your body and to the world around you - so do it right. What happens to your stuff? Who is going to find your body? What secrets do you want to take with you to your grave? There are lots of questions to answer. LostAllHope dot com has info on how to get help and, if you must go through with it, what the most effective ways of suicide, including a pain index. I hope you choose life. I have gone for the other option, but I\u2019m at peace with my decision. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no way you can make such a message \u2018good\u2019. The grief will be immense, whatever you write. You can of course go for eloquence and try to explain in detail what your feelings are and the reasons for choosing to end your life. Often, people are left behind with loads of questions. You can answer them. That might be slightly better for your loved ones than not writing at all. Only just, though. Here\u2019s a thought\u2026 Write to yourself. Write to your former self that you want to leave behind. Write warmly, with empathy and compassion. Explain how you understand the struggles that person who was you went through and compliment that former self for hanging in there, even when everything was black. Do not cover up bad decisions but also make an honest attempt and highlighting strengths. After you have written your letter, that past person is well and truly gone. There is now the new you, living in the present moment, with loads of options open to them. There really always is a choice to do healthy, loving and skillful acts. Always. You say you don\u2019t want help because it won\u2019t do any good. I don\u2019t believe you. I urge you to find help. Quora will help you by putting up information about organisations to contact. I vow here and now that I will personally help you find help if you tell me roughly where you live. And that is.. because we need you. The human race wouldn\u2019t be complete without you. I value you, including your pain. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, you are worthy of being loved, of being supported, of being you. Please find help. Please find the compassion inside you that will get you to say goodbye to the old you and start living as the new you. ",
