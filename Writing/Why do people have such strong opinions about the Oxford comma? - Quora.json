            "answer_text": "To start off, here's an entertaining little piece about the history of the term \"Oxford comma.\" Where Did the Oxford Comma Come From, and Why Is It So Important? | Scribendi I am 60 years old. I had never heard the term \"Oxford comma\" till my daughter started beating me over the head with it when she was in high school, in the early 2010s. Since, according to the piece, the term wasn't even coined until the late 1970s, that's not surprising. Back in my day, we were taught that the commas in a series replaced instances of 'and,' and that there was no need for a comma before the 'and,' because nothing had been taken away. That is, we were taught that the underlying form \"W and X and Y and Z\" abbreviates to \"W, X, Y and Z\" by a one-to-one replacement. If one has learned it with this reasoning, it feels not only stylistically wrong, but positively illogical to put in an Oxford comma. I argued this to my daughter. She, in turn, offered the argument that her teachers had used, that is so well known and oft repeated by the younger literati, namely, that sometimes, the Oxford comma is necessary for disambiguation. I told her that if I needed an extra comma for disambiguation, I'd put it in, but why clutter up a perfectly good series if one didn't have to? (The thing is, really, the Oxford comma isn't actually a series comma. It's a disambiguating comma that has to be in the pre-\"and\" position to do its work. It's like the parentheses you must put around 3 + 5 in the expression 3 + 5 x 7 if what you want is 56, rather than 38.) Well, my daughter didn't buy this, and we would go round and round. Finally, I gave up and started using the Oxford (pronounced as \"extra\") comma whenever I wrote to her. The thing is, we had both been given sensible reasons for the rules we had learned, and so believed that breaking our rule was an abomination. Of course, the more sophisticated, and correct, way of looking at such things is that the world and English are both sufficiently complex and ungovernable that rarely can one simply stated rule cover all eventualities in a satisfactory manner. Having said all this, I believe that many people express such strong opinions about the Oxford comma because it's become one of those team things, like whether the toilet paper should roll off the top, or off the bottom (the top), or whether the only right condiment for a hot dog is mustard, or ketchup. People love being on a team. In the case of commas, it's usually the same team their favorite English teacher belonged to. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello Bhin. I don\u2019t know why there is so much debate. There should not be any debate at all. This is actually the first time in more than a year that I\u2019ve heard anyone mention it. It is simply one tiny part of the punctuation section of one formatting style-guide. There are many style-guides (many universities and institutions issue advice on how they like articles to be formatted) and some of them suggest a comma should always be used before the \u2018and\u2019 when a list of items is made. Some of them don\u2019t suggest it. Some of them say it should be used where is helps to make the communication of the sense definite - when it removes ambiguity. None of these guides are \u201cincorrect\u201d or \u201cright\u201d - they are just suggestions as to formatting style. My opinion is that it\u2019s not usually really needed (a comma is a signal that a speaker will usually pause at this point and most sentences using \u2018and\u2019 in this way do not have a pause). However, there are sentences in which a pause would be used to handle a possible ambiguity - this pause would be signified by a comma. Simply (for a native speaker) use common sense and your knowledge of how a sentence sounds, and the rhythm of the language. For a non-native, it could be a little more difficult. There is ONE type of sentence in which a comma is a very good idea - this is a sentence which has a \u201clist\u201d consisting of a plural noun and two singular nouns, in that sequence. The president of the USA, Indira Gandhi and my parents like music. (no comma needed when the items are in this sequence). My parents, the president of the USA and Indira Gandhi like music. (Without a comma, this says that my parents are the president and Indira Gandhi) My parents, the president of the USA, and Indira Gandhi like music. (With a comma, this says that those four people like music) ",
