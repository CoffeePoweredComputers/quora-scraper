            "answer_text": "I write in the real world, which is very different than academia, so we have to write compelling pieces. We aren't writing for grades, we are writing to keep someone's attention; And if we can do that, hopefully communicate some sort of concept, idea or information. When I was going through school and writing essays, I was reading a tremendous amount of fiction, and noticed a dramatic difference in the styles of communicating. This made me think that academic writing, like essays, had no place in the real world. In fact, I would argue that while essays play an essential role in academics, you will find them very rarely in the real world. With that said, I've looked back on academic writing and try to apply some practical rules or guides that I use in the real world to them. The number one rule in real world writing is to keep the readers attention, like I said above. You see people here asking all the time how to write a compelling thesis, or how to write a compelling title, or just how to write anything interesting. This is actually a good thing, as if you imagine yourself reading a newspaper or magazine article, you don't get very far if it's uninteresting to you. Still, you got lured in by the headline. So quite simply put, the first rule I have is that I communicate information, and reveal something about the subject at the end of whichever structure is being written. I used the word structure to define a sentence, a paragraph, a chapter, a section or the entire work. If you think about each of these as having a front middle and back (start, body, end), regardless of what it is you're writing, all you have to do is put the most engaging portion of what you are saying at the front and the most important or insightful information at the end. The middle is to take you from the headline, or hook, and prepare you to see the end as vlid and supporting that claim. So you don't start a sentence with the information you are conveying, but rather lead up to it until the last few words reveal the idea or concept-with the reader suitably prepared to accept it. Then take that sentence and extend that concept to the paragraph. Now your first sentence is designed to make a claim, or to project an idea that catches the imagination of the reader, and wants to make them understand why that sentence is viable, or how the claim could possibly be true. In the course of the paragraph that that sentence lives in, or the middle as it were, you give the supporting claims or arguments, again starting with ones that are eye catching, or obtuse in order to be interesting, toward the beginning. Then toward the end of your paragraph or larger section of your writing, would supporting facts backing up those earlier claims or assertions, and letting the last sentence be the one that confirms or solidifies what you are actually trying to say with information or data that is as indisputable or truthful as you have. That last sentence of the paragraph has to nail the idea down, as you have set up the reader to accept that information with the previous sentences. That's probably a horrible way to explain it, but I don't have a formal definition of my concept. But it is actually quite interesting how it applies to everything from writing to PowerPoint. Let's say for example you only have a certain number of slides, or time available to you. You lay out the slides that you would use in a presentation and in your notes you determine what it is you need each one of those to accomplish or communicate as you work toward the end of the presentation. You do this remembering that the information presented at the very end is the information that they will mentally remember more than information that came prior. This is like you humming the last song you heard on the way to work, something like that. I hope this gives you some ideas! ",
