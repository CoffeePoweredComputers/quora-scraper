            "answer_text": "Do you need help with a short personal statement for graduate school? You\u2019ll find some useful tips here. It often happens that the university admissions process is cutting down the personal statement to less than 4000 characters (which is 47 lines in total). It\u2019s quite difficult to retain as much content as possible and at the same time stick to the character/word count, so here are a few tips which will hopefully make everything much easier. Avoid quotations and clichesRead your personal statement through and delete any clich\u00e9s \u2013 for example, \u2018I\u2019ve wanted to become a doctor since I was young\u2026\u2019. the same is with quotes: unless they bring true value to your personal statement, nevertheless, it\u2019s recommended to remove them. You only have 4000 characters to let the admissions committee understand who you are, so don't waste your time by plagiarizing someone\u2019s words.  2. Make sure everything is relevant Never lose focus by using the \u201cso what?\u201d rule. Ask this question to each sentence of your essay and see if the answer is adequate. Don\u2019t write too much odd information as it can put the reader out of your statement. 3. Use colour coding to see which paragraphs are eating up your characters It\u2019s an easy way to see where you are losing most of your characters to outline sections of your essay. 4. Watch your language Look for any irrelevant words in your text and decide whether it is better to rephrase something or change your writing style completely. 5. Polish your text and remove the last few characters Once you\u2019ve finished writing your statement, there are a few last things you need to do. Some of the \u2018and\u2019s\u2019 can be removed in order to make full stops shorter. Also, keep in mind that it isn\u2019t necessary to use names, for examples, hospitals, or volunteering places, etc. Cutting your personal statement down won\u2019t make it worse because universities know you can\u2019t describe everything in just 4000 characters.

            "answer_text": "To make sure that the candidates will write only about important stuff, and that the admissions officers can read every person\u2019s personal statement, the word count was introduced. When your personal statement instruction say that you must have specified word count, this means only words, without any other characters. But often the instruction specify character count. This can be confusing, because character count includes all the characters in your personal statement. It can be hard to manually count all of the dots, and commas in your personal statement, and it is a really time consuming process.
