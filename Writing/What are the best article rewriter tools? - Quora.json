            "answer_text": "In my opinion the best article rewriter tool is CleverSpiner. It is able to rewrite any text by changing individual words & phrases and it also rewrites sentences. The tool is highly accurate because it uses state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. The example of what this software is able to do is just below:  I was looking for a tool that is able to rewrite articles for a long time, because the tools I have found until that moment were inaccurate and slow. I could spend hours manually editing badly re-written text by such software. This software was different from other tools, highly accurate and fast, so rewriting any kind of text using it was much simpler and quicker. Actually, a completely automatic rewrite done by the tool is usually of the highest quality and 100% unique. You can compare if with free software you can find online. You will find that it is much better. If you wonder why, this is because free article spinners in most cases (if not in all the cases) use random synonyms replacing. This means that if a word has ten possible synonyms, the spinner chooses a random one. CleverSpiner is much better than such software. So the probability of choosing the right one is around 10%-50% for such words. This means that most of the words won't be altered correctly and that the content you get will not be not grammatically correct. This is great software because: It is quite fast - rewrites 500 word article in less than twenty seconds and uses NLP.It has a powerful text editor you can use to change synonyms and you can add your own synonyms.There are more than 6 different editor layouts from which you can choose from.It can be used on a desktop PC, a mac, or even on your phone because it is online software.It detects the right and wrong synonyms all the time.You can try the best article rewriter tool here. You will like it for sure. ",

            "answer_text": "The Best Article Rewriter Tool Is Seotool360, . . If you've ever tried to create content on a regular basis, maybe for your blog or newsletter, you might have an idea of how difficult it could be to produce high-quality articles frequently. It's usually time-consuming, effort-intensive, and requires top-level expertise including a good command of the English language. Yet, content is just so necessary if your online business must go places. Of course, writing your content by hand, sentence-by-sentence is the surest way to ensure quality and plagiarism-free work , but that usually isn't easy, especially if you are looking for quality results. One way to deal with this is to hire a professional freelance writer to help you with your content needs. But again, hiring a pro writer isn't cheap at all. So what should you do? Well, a much cheaper and quicker approach is to use an online rephrase tool. There are numerous benefits associated with using an article rewrite tool. Here are some: It's a great time-saver: Usually, it takes hours or even days to manually create a human-readable content. But with an online rephrase tool, you can rewrite an article in just a few minutes.It increases efficiency: You can produce a large amount of articles within a short time period, thereby improving productivity.It lets you have content whenever you want: An online rephraser tool serves as your \u201calways-on-duty\u201d content producer, giving you lots of content anytime you want.It lets you do SEO better: You get to run better search engine optimization (SEO) as you can power your campaigns abundantly with the content produced from an paraphrase online tool.It augments your skills: If your English language or writing skills are not that good, you can depend on an article spinning tool or sentence rewriter to serve as your aid.Here are some cues to help you make the best use of this free article spinner, especially per search engine optimization purposes: Start with a quality article. This means a unique topic or viewpoint on a very specific topic. The information must be valuable to a human reader. At this point in time, it is not possible for any software program to produce content that is engaging. If you start out with a low-quality article, the chances are high that the alternate versions are going to be even worse.Read through the rewritten article personally. Does it make sense? You may catch several suggested words that don\u2019t fit into the context. If you feel it doesn't read well, click \u201cRephrase Again\u201d for a new version. If none of the alternate words fit, try changing the original word to trigger new suggestions.We recommend running the final results \u2014 when you\u2019re satisfied \u2014 through our Plagiarism Checker tool just to verify it is unique enough to pass the plagiarism test used by search engines before you publish it on the web.To avoid spamming, we do not recommend using this tool to produce multiple versions of the same article. Not only is this penalized by search engines, but it offers nothing of value to your target audience either.If you've read the sections above, by now you should have an idea of what an sentence rewriter is, how it works, and why you should use one. But with the market being saturated with lots of spinners, which paragraph rewriter tool should you use? Well, you don't have to look any further because Small SEO Tools has got your back. Sentence Rewriter by Small SEO Tools is a reliable Paraphrase tool you can trust.

            "answer_text": "The article rewriter tool that I like the best is certainly CleverSpinner. It has adventage over other software because it uses AI so it is able to understand the meaning of the text and therefore rewrite it similarly as a human writer. You can see an example just bellow.  Isn\u2019t this a great quality? I also like that they offer Free 3-day Trial. Anybody is able to try it as see how good it is. It automatically rewrites a 500 word article in a bit more than 10 seconds. Doing the same job manually usually takes 30 minutes or 1800 seconds so this one can really save a lot of time,especially for people who need a lot of content. But it is the most important that the spun text, especially with version 2.0 usually passes CS test, and Google cannot even see it as spun content. Such as content can be used for links building as well as on money sites and qualitity is pretty good, as you saw in the example. It is much better than other article spinners with similar pricing as they do not get the right meaning of each and every word, so the rewrites sometimes looks funny/strange. It is of course much better than any free article spinner/rewriter I have tried. ",

So Here i will suggest you top paid article writers so everyone can use that. Top Paid Article Rewriter Tool in 2018: WordAl: WordAI, as the title implies, is perhaps the most well-known content spinning service. It uses the same smart technology that allows it to produce the quality that is readable and good enough to almost convince people that humans wrote it. There are two different modes for spinning content: \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cturning.\u201d Most users report that the latter option produces the most realistic results.When we looked at the results of both settings on the WordAI software, it did appear that the \u201cturning\u201d setting yielded the best, most realistic results. It also appeared that the uniqueness of the text was rated at around 80%, which is a high average for a spinner software. The site claims that their software is the \u201csmartest article rewriter ever,\u201d and they state that their software will automatically choose the right words and phrases and disregard those that do not fit well. This increases the ability of the software to adhere to what you need for your content once it understands the basic textual content. more details article spinner ",

            "answer_text": "The article spinner/rewriter that I like the best is definitely CleverSpinner. It uses advanced artificial intelligence in order rewrite and spin content. Also, the tool understands the meaning of every word in text, therefore it is able to rewrite it really well. It completely automatically rewrites text like the one below. In around 10 second it is able to spin a 500 word text. If you have done that manually it would usually take around 30-40 minutes or even more.  They offer a free 3-day trial so anyone can try it for free. The produced text is usually unique so it usually passes plagiarism test\u200es. In the past I had to manually spin my articles, and it really was waste of time as it takes a long time around 30-40 minutes to spin an article properly. There are a lot of free article spinners, but they are not really good. What I mean is that they do not choose synonyms properly so usually fixing the bad synonyms takes more time than rewriting it from scratch. The main reason for that as such software doesn't get the meaning of words as they do not use artificial intelligence. So the software is the best, much less time-consuming than doing the rewrites manually and way more accurate that free article spinners. You can use it to rewrite any kind of content for various purposes. For example, you can multiply your articles and then use it for your website promotion. It is often updated and considering it is on online software, you do not need to install it on your PC and you can just use from any operating system you like. And with free trial there is not room for error. ",

In my opinion, it is better to ask people\u2019s opinion and to search on forums or on the other platforms.  But if the text is not very big you can rewrite on your own: try to use some paraphrasing methods like changing the place of the subject and others parts of the sentenceanalyze text and define what is the main idea, try to build new text using itread the text and try to retell itCreating a paraphrase needs some time, so bother to prepare it in advance. Make a plan before writing and in this way you will save your time and you will also not forget to include anything. ",

A lot of them are totally free which means that you do not have to pay anything for them. So you can just try some of them and define which is better.  Rewriting is really necessary in some cases like these ones: when you luck for ideas and do not know what to write and what to make upwhen you want to highlight the well-known topic from another perspectivewhen your writing skills are not very good and you do not have enough time to improve themFrom my point of view it is better to do the rewriting on your own, it will be high-quality, coherent and interesting to read then. Good luck! ",

In such a case it will be better to rewrite text manually but if it is really urgent and you can't wait so the tools are the best choice for you.
