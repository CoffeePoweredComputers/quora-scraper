They have strong cultural values. 3. They are pioneers in technological revolution. 4. They have a saying in Japanese, forgive me if I misspell it.  Nanakorobi Yaoki, which means, fall seven times and stand up eight. And we have seen them do it in times of utter distress like Atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They rebuilt their nation from scratch. 5. I am an anime fan, and Japan is the birthplace of anime. ",
