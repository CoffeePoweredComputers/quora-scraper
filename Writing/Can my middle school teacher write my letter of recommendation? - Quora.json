            "answer_text": "You should look at the directions that the college provides with its application materials. Most colleges specifically require that you get recommendation letters from teachers who taught you an academic subject during grades 10, 11, or 12. Someone who taught you in middle school and whom you now talk to or receive tutoring from does *not* fit that description. Just read the directions and follow them. ",

I wouldn't advise you to use this individual as an academic reference. S/he could potentially be a character reference. Check with your high school college counselor to be sure. ",
