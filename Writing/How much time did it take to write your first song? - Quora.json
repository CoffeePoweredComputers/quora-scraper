            "answer_text": "The first song I started writing took almost six months to complete. But I wrote the second song within 2 hours. What happened is, I started writing the first song and then just left it after writing a verse. Then after a few months, a special person\u2019s birthday was about to arrive and I wanted to write a song for her. I procrastinated until the last moment but I ended up finishing the song just a few minutes before her birthday was about to start. I started writing at around 9:30 pm and finished it before 12:00 am luckily. It was good enough considering the fact that I was just a beginner and I wrote in a hurry. It\u2019s a few days later that I picked up the first song again and that finished it within a couple of days. The second song I\u2019m talking about is this one. You're My Paradise (Official Video) | PaRth I didn\u2019t pay much attention to the video part as all my budget was spent on recording and producing the song and I just wanted to get it done so that I can move on to writing other songs. It\u2019s been 8 months since I uploaded this song but I\u2019ve not been able to upload another one although I have finished writing many songs after that. Hopefully, I guess I\u2019ll be able to do so in the near future. ",
