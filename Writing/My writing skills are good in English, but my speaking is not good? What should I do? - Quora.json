            "answer_text": " My writing skills are good in English, but my speaking is not good?  What should I do? First, you should understand the reason for this. You have learned English the traditional way: remembering a lot of words as translations into your native language. Furthermore, you think in your native language when writing in English. Since you are not limited in time you have enough time to translate a sentence in your head from the native language into English and that is why your writing is good. But you can\u2019t use your skills for speaking because in the natural conversation there is no time for cross-translation in your head and that is why you speak very slowly and you don\u2019t understand spoken language because to understand it you should think in English. At this point is not possible for you to think in English because your native language controls the brain language map and all incoming information should be translated into the native language to become understandable. Unlearning is more difficult than learning because you have to overcome the created habits. We know very well that is easier to form a new habit than to overcome the old one. I will recommend developing a new habit of reading the text in English, listening to the recording and speak simultaneously with the recording. This method of simultaneous repetition will stop automatically thinking in the native language. It allows first repeating English phrases and then producing them automatically after multiple repetitions. Thus you will be able to develop a new skill of thinking in English and speaking automatically which you don\u2019t have now. Cross-translation is the main barrier most teachers ignore. When you cross-translate, you think in your native language while trying to speak in a foreign language. Without first resolving this issue of cross-translation, all other efforts will fail since it is impossible to think in the native language and speak in a second language. This explains why the success rate of learning a second language by adults is very low. The main problem is that traditional methods dissect the language into individual components and teach listening, reading, writing, pronunciation, speaking, and grammar separately. As the Learning Pyramid demonstrates, learning separate language components represent Passive Learning Method. What should you do if you don\u2019t know how to begin your sentence? Even after thinking for a while, you stop in the middle of a sentence, and can\u2019t continue because you don\u2019t know a word. If you produce awkward-sounding sentences because you don\u2019t know how to say something in a natural way, you often make mistakes and are not aware of them. Could we recommend multiple applications offering talking to the native speakers online for resolving these issues? No, I wouldn\u2019t, because you need more input, not more speaking practice. The multimedia comprehensible input, i.e. reading the text, listening to the recording and speaking at the same time, brings new word blocks to the learner which he first imitates and then after multiple repetitions will be able to produce automatically.

            "answer_text": "Hi, As in my experience it is clear that by reading you can improve your writing and by listening you can improve your speaking. And yes, sometimes it is good to listen to music but it is not working all the time. It is so better to listen to the ordinary people on YouTube who explain or introduce things to public and it is way better to listen to things you like and have some background knowledge about it for example; smartphones, cooking, fitness, etc. Find your interest and start listening to it then try to repeat the phrases that you got (mirror can be useful too). And of course the best way is to start using the language in communication, I mean try to speak with people in English even with non-native speaker because the important thing is that you should eventually use the language in the real life situation.
