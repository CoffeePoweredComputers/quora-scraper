            "answer_text": "It\u2019s probably the most common question I get. There seems to be some illicit thrill to the idea that a writer might write real-life people into a work of fiction, as if it were somehow illegal or immoral; as if we writers are secretly eavesdropping and recording everyday life in order to best represent our experience of the human condition. Sorry to disappoint: I make no secret about it. Eavesdropping shamelessly is my job. If you don\u2019t want to be in a book, stay in your house with the shades drawn. ",

            "answer_text": "All\u2026 The\u2026 Time\u2026 It\u2019s completely my own fault though - A lot of the characters in my novels are \u2018loosely\u2019 based on real people. Friends mostly, whose foibles I know and can write into the story - It gives me a \u2018leg up\u2019 on deciding what characters will do under certain circumstances. It also means that I can just wheel out a short story with \u2018their\u2019 character as the star, instead of buying them a costly Birthday present. However, certain people have started to expect this, and it can become a bit of a bind. I guess it\u2019s the price I pay for lazy characterisation\u2026 ",
