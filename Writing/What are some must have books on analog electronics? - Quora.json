            "answer_text": "I recommend this book for you > > > > > Principles of Analog Electronics In the real world, most signals are analog, spanning continuously varying values. Circuits that interface with the physical environment need to be able to process these signals. Principles of Analog Electronics introduces the fascinating world of analog electronics, where fields, circuits, signals and systems, and semiconductors meet. Drawing on the author\u2019s teaching experience, this richly illustrated, full-color textbook expertly blends theory with practical examples to give a clear understanding of how real electronic circuits work. Build from the Essentials of Math, Physics, and Chemistry to Electronic Components, Circuits, and Applications Building a solid foundation, the book first explains the mathematics, physics, and chemistry that are essential for grasping the principles behind the operation of electronic devices. It then examines the theory of circuits through models and important theorems. The book describes and analyzes passive and active electronic devices, focusing on fundamental filters and common silicon-based components, including diodes, bipolar junction transistors, and metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). It also shows how semiconductor devices are used to design electronic circuits such as rectifiers, power suppliers, clamper and clipper circuits, and amplifiers. A chapter explores actual applications, from audio amplifiers and FM radios to battery chargers. Delve Deeper into Analog Electronics through Curiosities, Key Personalities, and Practical Examples Each chapter includes helpful summaries with key points, jargon, and terms, as well as exercises to test your knowledge. Practical tables illustrate the coding schemes to help identify commercial passive and active components. Throughout, sidebars highlight \"curiosities,\" interesting observations, and examples that make the subject more concrete. This textbook offers a truly comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of analog electronics, including essential background concepts. Taking a fresh approach, it connects electronics to its importance in daily life, from music to medicine and more. ",

            "answer_text": "1.very basic book by Floyd , Electronic Devices Pearson 7 th Edition & Classical book by Milliman & Halkias  2.getting started by Forest Mimms(wonderful starter for any body serious about electronics) 3.Design with operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated circuits Sergio Franco (wonderful book , but for only serious and senior undergraduates in fourth year and must have book for post graduates working in the field of electronics.) 4.Fundamentals of microeletronics(Red book , this is undergraduate book) by Professor Razavi , (there are good youtube viodeos by Prof  Razavi which can be utilized while studying this book) 5.Finally after becoming Major in electronics or getting some  undergraduate degree in electronics and if you are interested you can read some more advanced text books  by Prof Razavi, Prof Rabaey on analog and digital electronics. 6.recently i found a good book by Prof Kikkert from James cook university on Board Level RF Design  you can try that from the NI AWR website. 7.finally you can get some help from google,youtube and India's NPTEL and USA 's MIT OCW  etc...
