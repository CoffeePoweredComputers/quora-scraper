            "answer_text": "Try to find previous participants - in your home country. Would you be the first to enter the Olympiad from your country - if not, contact previous participants and ask them your question. Their advice would be the voice of experience - what would they recommend to you? Google the name of your home country and 'philosophy clubs' and also 'philosophy teachers' - write a philosophy professor at the university nearest to your home and ask the question of that professor - the Internet should be able to help you find proper contacts - people who are familiar with the Olympiad to whom you can pose your question.

            "answer_text": "They now believe migraines are tiny strokes and that older adults also have mjni strokes that destroy parts of the brain that control decision making, which includes the mouth. Anger is one of the side effects of brain damage.As I get older, I get frustrated with ALL the skills that I am losing. I lose my glasses, my purse, my keys, my socks. I can no longer bend over very long without causing pressure on my breathing.I resent trying to remember all the DAMN passwords and programs. I get charged for programs that auto-update and auto charge ME.I fear scammers will get the best of me\u2026OR no one will protect me from scamming, abuse. It was hard work caring for my elders, will anyone do the same for me? AARP sent me another membership request letter. I had to stop my elder from sending his third membership payment in as many weeks!What kind of legacy will I leave? Will my daughter and son who have chronic diseases be okay financially with medical insurance so expensive?I just found out that the local YMCA says it didn't \u201cbegin\u201d until 2 years after I worked there\u2026AND that they didn't pay Social Security for me for TWO of the Five years I worked there\u2026although they took it from my checks.. I feel this Christian organization took advantage of me. Lots going on inside our heads, get it?",
