            "answer_text": "A few suggestions for avoiding physical mail spam: 0.  Realize that everyone organization -- for profit, non-profit, etc -- is going to narc you out to junk mailers unless they explicitly declare that they won't. 1.  I've contacted lots of organizations to ask them to stop selling my name and address to third party marketers.  I've called every magazine publisher that sends me publications to stop selling my name and address to third party marketers.  Others to call would include charities that you've donated to and companies that you've bought stuff from.   2.  To facilitate the opt-out process, I use Catalog Choice.  www.catalogchoice.org It's an amazing non-profit that offers a free service to help unlist you from all kinds of offers:  banks, credit card companies, catalog companies, political organizations, and non-profits.  If you make a small donation ($20) to them, they'll unlist you automatically from major national databases that feed junk mail marketers (the MailStop service).      They also offer a free app for the iPhone that allows you to send in a picture of your junk mail for de-listing via Catalog Choice.  Miraculous! You may find the app here:  http://www.itunes.apple.com/us/app/mailstop-mobile/id475403422?mt=8    Best of all, Catalog Choice will use its own legal staff to send a stern letter to any marketer that keeps on sending you physical spam 90 days after de-listing.  For free.  I highly recommend these folks.  I rarely ever receive junk mail thanks to Catalog Choice.   n.b. -- My only association with this organization is as a donor / subscriber to their premium MailStop service. ",

They can't say, come on, nobody gets aroused by mortgage refinance offers, and reject the form.Submit the form with the mail piece. It's now a violation of Federal law for the sender to mail you again.Details from the form follow:  Under the Pandering Advertisements Statute, 39 USC 3008, if you are the addressee of an advertisement, and consider the matter (product or service) that it offers for sale to be \"erotically arousing or sexually provocative,\" you can obtain a Prohibitory Order against the mailer. You apply for the order by submitting the entire advertising mailpiece (the original, NOT a photocopy) with a properly completed application (page 2 of this form). This is the extreme option.  Not nice to use this on a catalog that you once bought something from but no longer want. How can I legally (or quasi-legally) send junk mail back to its sender so that they must pay for it? ",

            "answer_text": "Though this doesn't solve the problem of its own, it helps you track the problem:Every time I give my address, I tack on a unique identifier. For example, my room number being (hypothetically) 1234, I would give Amazon \"Room 1234-101\", give my bank \"Room 1234-102\", give a conference \"Room 1234-103\", etc. and note down where and when I gave what identifiers. My dorm's front desk of course doesn't care that I tack on some numbers after my actual room number, and in the end I can figure out who exactly decided to leak my address to spammers. You could also try to give this method a shot, though I don't know if it will work or not (I've never tried):http://officeofstrategicinfluence.com/bulkmailer/ ",

If I have received a dozen pieces in the last three months, I would be surprised. Simply contact all of your creditors and anybody that you wish to receive mail from and have them send your mail to the new address. Then you can simply sort through the decreasing amounts of junk mail you do receive at home and discard it without looking at it. ",
