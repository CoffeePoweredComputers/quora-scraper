            "answer_text": "1. GETTING MORE TRAFFIC: Traffic! Traffic!! Traffic!!!. Much is been said about traffic and really, the importance cannot be over emphasized.To make sales you need traffic. And how do you get this? Well I would be handing out two tips that I personally use to get traffic to my gigs on fiverr. Firstly, create a website for your gigs or fiverr profile. Ordinarily, this is suppose to be a hard and strenuous task, but with services like Blogger. its been made so easy every kyle or Joe can do it. Once you have done this, you can use that medium to promote your website URL on Facebook and Other Social Networks. I prefer doing this to sharing direct link on social networks because the description box on social networks would not give you enough space to fully describe your gigs. And further more, they may restrict your use of keywords. But with a blogspot website, you would not only get free traffic to your blog leading to your gigs on fiverr from Google but also be able to describe using images and even post links to previous work done, how cool is that?. Secondly, use Google to search for your client. Don\u2019t wait around for them to come, go to them. For instance, you fix WordPress Error, you can search Google for \u201cHelp Fixing WordPress Error\u201d and you would be surprise how many people need your services. Once you find one on a forum or community, tell them you can fix it and put a link back to your fiverr gig or blog post that has the gig. 2. BUY YOUR OWN GIGS: This is my personal favorite tip which I have keep secret for a while now and finally decide to let to for every one to benefit. When you open a new gig, one sure fire way to own watchers into client is if there is a positive review on the gig. Else, every one keeps waiting for the other person to buy first. No body wants to waste their money and therefore would wait to see if the gig gets a positive review before they buy. So in cases like this, create two or three profile, purchase your own gigs and watch the sales rolling in. Someone follow this tip and three days later he made 15 sales. He even had to decline some because he couldn\u2019t deliver all in the speculated period 3. CREATE A FEMALE PROFILE: Sorry ladies, but research done by me has shown that female profile gets more visits and thus more sales. You don\u2019t have to be a lady to do this, just use a female American name and use Google to get a girls picture. This may seem unorthodox but it is a marketing strategy which when put into good use would bring a ferocious increase in your monthly sales. 4. UPLOAD MORE PHOTOS ABOUT THE GIG: Some clients may not want to go through the trouble of reading your descriptive description about the gig. I call them the \u201cI buy what I see clients\u201d. For such, the more attractive photos you have to describe you gig, the more sales you could make. So make sure your gig have at least three photos to describe it 5. PROVIDE THE RIGHT SERVICES: After following the tips above and you are not selling gigs that are wanted, then you may not make any sales. Don\u2019t get me wrong, all gigs are wanted, but some are in higher demand. Any gig you wish to sell should fall within the range of average demand to high demand. Do not sell low or below average gigs. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s quite exciting for me having the honor to answer this question! There are many ways from paid to free by which you can improve (rank) your Fiverr gigs and get yourself a multitude of sales far beyond you can imagine. While some people believe in outside-Fiverr promotion, a lot of people don\u2019t subscribe to the idea as they think you can get sufficient sales to your Fiverr gigs without really going outside it. In all, some basic things are essential to breaking even in your gigs. Starting from the point of setting up your gig to the point of getting your first sales you must pay 100% attention to the following: 1.) Your Gig Title: This is the first thing you need to get right to optimize your gig for better sales and for ranking well on the Fiverr search algorithm. Try to aim for a title that\u2019s highly eye-catching, not more than 60 characters, contains one of your primary keywords/tags (you write this in Capital letter for the purpose of emphasis). A good example is this gig Title: \u201cI Will Write Professional Article In 24 Hours\u201d. 2.) Gig Description: A good gig description should be able to answer the following questions: a.) Who are you? b.) What level of skills and experience you have in your line of service? c.) Why the buyer should hire you? d.) What the buyer should be expecting when he/she hires you? 3.) Gig Tags: This is another vital area of optimization that you must keep in mind when creating your gig. Gig tags are the keywords or phrases that the buyers or people searching for your gig on Fiverr type into the Fiverr search box. For example, a person looking for an article writer will enter words such as article writer, article writing, web writer, content writer, blog writer, etc. Try and include all relevant keywords in your tags so that when anyone tries to search for a service, you\u2019re offering on the Fiverr search box yours will be among those first ones that will come up. 4.) Gig Image: This is what epitomizes your gig. You can get someone on Fiverr to do one for you for five bucks, or you can design it yourself using a site called Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software. It\u2019s very easy to use and follow. Start by choosing the Fiverr acceptable dimension which is 550 pixel by 370 widths, and the rest would be a smooth flow for you. Once you are done, you can download the image and upload to your Fiverr gig. Take a look at some nice-looking gig image someone created on Amazingly Simple Graphic Design Software here seoarticleprof's public profile on Fiverr. 5.) Profile Photo: The simple trick here is to choose a professional photo of yours and upload to your Fiverr account. Don\u2019t use the image of an animal or another person, doing that could be against the copyright law or show you as a frivolous person thereby leading to your account getting banned. There are free photos you can lay your hand on Google. Simply go to Google and type \u201cfree professional image\u201d without the inverted comma. Once you enter the search term and you hit the enter button, you will see search results, click on \u201cImages\u201d to have only photos in your search results and after that, you can go further to filter your search by clicking on the menu \u201cSettings.\u201d From the drop-down sub-menu select \u201cAdvance Search,\u201d change the File type to \u201cJPG Files\u201d and Usage to \u201cFree to use, share or modify, even commercially.\u201d Once you do this, you should be good to use any image you lay your hand on at the site without infringing on any copyright law. Another thing you might though want to consider is, you can\u2019t use an image if someone on Fiverr has already used same. As soon as you do all the necessary editing work on the picture, save it and upload it to your account. If you need more inspiration as to how an eye-catching and professional profile image should look see one here seoarticleprof's public profile on Fiverr. That\u2019s all for this part. Now, I will go to the main talk on how exactly you can improve your gig. Note: The following ranking tricks I\u2019m about to share with you can only be implemented once you\u2019re done with the above setting guidelines. I'm going to be brief with you here as I have spent much time already on the pre-setting steps you are to take to get things up and running. You don\u2019t need to pay a dime to implement any of the ranking formulas I will be sharing with you, but you might want to fast track things by hiring someone on Fiverr to do them for you or if you think you wouldn\u2019t be able to do them yourself. Formula 1: Maintaining your ratings and positive review level. This is the first thing you need to do without wish all other efforts will undoubtedly end up in sheer futility. You must always ensure you keep having at least 4.5 or 5-Star review in your entire gig. In fact, I would advise you aim for the later (5-Star review). This is very crucial and will enhance your sale without even doing any serious promotion. The simple trick to getting a better buyer\u2019s review is by over-delivering and ensuring quality service delivery. No other side to this, believe me. Formula 2: Fast Turnaround Time. Always keep to the deadline for delivering your work. Ensure timely and clear communication with your buyers. Ask for clarification where necessary before starting the work and be available for their request any day any time. Formula 3: Facebook Account. As soon as you publish your gig, create a Facebook account and start sharing information about your gigs with your Facebook friends. You can go as far as creating a group and start sharing helpful information with your group\u2019s members, but you shouldn\u2019t overdo this as they mustn\u2019t feel they\u2019re being sold. Let them know they can get affordable services from your Fiverr gig and insert a link to your gig. You can use Google URL Shortener for this. Go to Google and search for Google URL Shortener. Formula 4: Forums The use of Forums in promoting your Fiverr can\u2019t be over-estimated. You should try this, and you will be surprised at the level of exposure you can get for your gig. There are many forums out there that you can join, just ensure you read their rules and know what is obtainable in them before you start posting. Another thing is you should not start promoting your gig right away, but you should first start to share helpful information through your comment on those forums. By doing this, you will be seen as an authority in your niche who they can willingly follow and who they can entrust with their hard-earned money. To get relevant forums to join, simply go to Google and type \u201cyour gig niche + forum\u201d e.g. Article Writing Forum. Formula 5: Blog: This is one my favorite methods of promoting my Fiverr gig. All you need to do is to create a free blog using Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free.. It\u2019s very easy to use, and you can also get people to do it for you on Fiverr if you find it difficult. Once the blog is ready, get some relevant articles around your gig and post on it for people to see your sample work portfolios. Upload as many as possible samples of your work to the blog and link it to your Fiverr account. This way, your buyers can easily get convinced about your skills and experience in what you claim you do on Fiverr once they land on your blog. Formula 6: Favorite: This is hidden secret of many top-rated Fiverr sellers, and as such you must not abuse it. By giving yourself favorite you can help increase your gig ranking fast on the Fiverr search engine. Go to a well-performing gig in your category, check the number of Favorites it has and give the same number of favorite to yourself (but you can't do this on a single day). The result for this though is not immediate but will manifest latest after 24 hours of implementing it. To locate the \u201cFavorite\u201d menu on your account, from the menu \u201cSelling\u201d click on Gigs and select \u201cPreview\u201d button from the drop down options that appear when you click on the down arrow at the very left end corner of the gig you want to rank. Tips: To start giving yourself \u201cFavorite\u201d, keep refreshing the page and stop refresh immediately the \u201cFavorite\u201d tab changes to red then click on the Favorite tab and the number will start going up depending on the number of the favorite you need. Formula 7: Tags: Another great trick to improve your gig is by going through the top-rated gigs in your category or gigs which are in the same category as the one you want to rank on Fiverr and see what tags they\u2019re using and just copy the same tags and title to replace yours. As for the title, you may need to modify your gig description to conform to the new gig title you\u2019re copying from the top-rated gig. I think with these formulas above you should be able to improve your Fiverr gig fast. Hope I have answered your question? Thanks Rasheed ",
