            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been blogging since 2009 and I can emphatically say that you can make A LOT of money blogging - much more than doctors, lawyers, techies, and bankers. It\u2019s largely because of blogging that allowed me to quit my investment banking job at the age of 34, three years after I started Financial Samurai. It took me 16 years to build a passive income portfolio that generates over $200,000 a year in income. But it took only four years to build the same income blogging in the personal finance space. Why? 1) Low barriers to entry. Depending on where and when you buy, you need $1 - $2M in capital to generate $50,000 in net operating income with property here in San Francisco. Same with buying dividend stocks that have a 2.5% - 5% yield. With blogging, it costs as little as $2.95/month to run a website and you get a domain name for free. If things don't work out, all you've lost is your time and a minimal amount of money. 2) Enormous demand curve. Financial Samurai can theoretically reach three billion people online through search engines, word of mouth, organic promotion, and advertising. However, in real estate, you can only lock in one set of tenants and raise the rent once a year. In the stock market, you are a passive investor with no control over dividend payouts or other strategic management decisions. With a retail store, you can only capture your neighborhood traffic. The internet is growing in usage and size every day. 3) Operating leverage. Because costs are generally fixed (hosting and domain registration), operating profits soar the more traffic and revenue you get. It's not uncommon to earn 80%+ operating profit margins as a professional blogger, depending on how much you pay yourself. Very few businesses can compare. Blogging Income Statement Snapshot Below is a real income statement snapshot from a personal finance blogger with 300,000 pageviews a month. He makes ~$150,000 a year from his website and then makes another $186,000 a year consulting.  Here\u2019s another income statement example from an established food blogger. Who knew you could make so much writing recipes and publishing pictures of your food right?  My main advice for those who want to start blogging is to be consistent and last for at least one year posting 2\u20134X a week. If you can do that, you will start to see momentum and wins go your way. Really think about your online brand. Once you build a brand, you will better be able to stand out from the crowd. Companies in your space will want to work with you. At some point, you\u2019ll be inundated with requests, meaning you can raise prices. Leverage the internet to be free. Don\u2019t let other internet companies get rich off you. Get rich off yourself! Here\u2019s my step-by-step guide to starting your own blog in under 30 minutes. Back in 2009, it cost me $1,000 to hire some guy to figure it out. Now it\u2019s so easy and cheap.

            "answer_text": "Yes, blogging is big business. Many so-called \u201cmommy bloggers\u201d are quite rich. Or at least, they make $200,000+ per year part time. I work in Internet marketing for a living (also called digital marketing). A few years ago I worked for an ecommerce company that sold essential oils, nutritional supplements and other health items. (So in other words, they only sold their products via their websites, not through conventional stores.) They had a few bloggers that they had \u201caffiliate\u201d relationships with; i.e. they paid the bloggers a commission every time someone that the blogger referred to them bought something. All of the bloggers were young to middle-aged women in their 20s to late 30s who were Midwestern moms. They talked about the things that they encountered in their daily lives, including what they fed their children, how they budgeted, their religion, etc. Naturally, they attracted a following of like-minded people. THEY ALSO MADE BANK! The year I stopped working at that company, we paid the top earning blogger over $200,000 in commissions. She also was an affiliate for products at other companies. If she made that much from just our company, how much do you think she made from all 5\u20136 companies that she was an affiliate for? There was another blogger who was younger and less experienced at blogging. She started with no following, and built her blog from the ground up. During the time I worked there (about a year), she went from earning nothing to $4000 per month in commissions. Again, we weren't the only company that she was an affiliate for. So how can you do that on your own? There's 2 steps to making money with a blog: Get traffic to your blogMonetize the trafficThe main two ways to get traffic to your blog are through social media and search engines. If your website ranks well for various search terms in Google, you can get thousands or even hundreds of thousands of visitors to your site every month! (This is called SEO.) Once you are getting steady visitors to your website, you want to get them on your email list. Every time that you publish a new blog post, you send out social media posts and an email to your list about it. Over time, this following can grow quite large, and quite lucrative. Monetize Your Traffic Here are the best ways to make money, in order of effectiveness: Sell your own products or servicesSell other people's products or services (as an affiliate or reseller)Sell advertising spaceSelling advertising is easily the worst way to make money. You're giving up space on your blog so that other people can sell their products and services. After they pay you, they\u2019re still selling their products at a huge profit. So why not just reap those same rewards yourself? Here's some math to whet your appetite. Your website gets: 100,000 visitors per monthYou have a product that 1% of them buys on a monthly basisYour profit on that product is $5 a pop100,000 x .01 x $5 = $5000 Believe me, this is a very realistic scenario. In the case of the ecommerce company that I used to work for, I created and operated the company blog. 4% of the visitors from the blog made purchases. (This is called the \u201cconversion rate\u201d btw.) If a first time visitor made a purchase, on average they bought $70 worth of product. So even if the blog only brings in 10,000 people per month, the company is still making $28,000 per month from it. (The blog brought in way more than 10,000 visitors per month.) That's why most companies have blogs. I'm not saying that any of this is easy. But people do it every day. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, the answer to your question is a definite yes. However, the difficult part is how to do so. Let's turn that question into a solution. With a significant variety of options to earn money online, a blog is a great choice to start with! Not only can you have fun doing so, but you can start generating income as well. The question is, how do people make a profit from the blog? I understand you might feel lost within the millions of ways to develop the blog and its content, but in truth, it doesn't have to be as difficult as you may think.  If you already have a blog, there are multiple ways to earn money from it, such as placing ads, having sponsors, freelance writing, doing affiliate marketing and so on. It's important to know when and how to reach the point where you can finally put these methods in action and be proud of gaining income by doing so. As mentioned, with a variety of options to earn income from a blog out there, you should analyze each one of them and find the ones that suit your preferences the best. Let\u2019s talk about some of the most popular ways: Affiliate marketing. It's an often-used method to earn money by blogging. It works in a simple manner - you promote the product of another company and earn a commission. A few ways of affiliate marketing with a blog is by writing articles, adding affiliate links, or even making videos. There are multiple ways, and the choice is yours. Ads. Another popular way is to place ads on your blog. Millions of people decide to use Google AdSense due to its simplicity. Since it's so easy to use, it's an efficient way to start earning income. However, you have to keep in mind that too many ads can drive customers away. Sponsored content. Eventually, along with the increasing traffic, companies are most likely to notice you and send you sponsorship offers. You might get a business proposal to share an article on your blog that is written by the sponsor or you may choose to write one yourself. Others simply ask to provide them with some exposure on your blog by giving links to integrate within the content you make. All in all, this is another great way to earn income. Freelance writing. After having built up an audience, freelancing becomes a great opportunity to continue what you are passionate about. Bear in mind that it requires some time, as to gain such job inquiries, you need to build a reputation. Feel free to make others aware that you are freelancing on your blog, so others know you are open for job inquiries. The important thing to keep in mind, though - the quality of your blog has a significant influence on success. If your blog takes a long time to load or it's not built well, people are going to leave, resulting in decreased traffic. Without traffic, none will see the work you do, the ads you are displaying, or reviews you've written. This will lead you to a loss of income. So, let's follow these steps and get our blog started:  With little to no preparation, a blog can go online in no time. What you need to do is find a niche you are interested in. Don't choose something you aren't much interested in just for the sake of its popularity. Keep in mind that you will have to stick with it. Writing about topics you are passionate about will inspire you, and writing will be more exciting.Decide how you are going to build your blog. Are you going to use a Content Management System (CMS)? There are multiple options to pick from. Don't rush and make sure that the platform you choose is the one that can bring out the most potential out of you and you feel most comfortable with it. CMS such as WordPress gives lots of freedom and capabilities to build a great website even for those who are beginners. There's also a possibility to use a website builder or just build it from scratch yourself if CMS is not of your preference!After deciding how you are going to build up your website, you will most likely need a hosting provider to have your blog online. Now, there are lots of options as well, so make sure to dig around and see which provider is best suited for you. It doesn't need to cost a lot, as the prices for the smallest hosting plan can be really budget-friendly. Although, it's essential to keep in mind that as the blog grows, so does the requirements for resources increase, and upgrading a plan becomes necessary.You need to pick a domain. Think of something easy to memorize. It can be related to your niche, name, or if you are developing a business, then a business name. Users should be able to easily memorize it, so the next time they want to visit a blog, they don't have a hard time remembering the name. Keep in mind that there are opportunities to claim a free domain with certain hosting plans, so keep your eye on it.Starting a blog is easy, but remember that earning income from it takes some time. Don\u2019t get discouraged and keep working hard! All that is left now is to actually get going and complete these steps! I hope this helps and drives you towards success, have a great day and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Starting a Money-Making Blog in 2018: New Method That's 100X Faster The Comprehensive 4 Section Guide  (Photo by Aditya Chinchure) If I were to tell you that there was a new way to start a blog that is 100X faster, costs nothing out of pocket and doesn't require any technical expertise to start, you'd probably think I was a crazy snake-oil salesman or something, right? Well it's the truth. It can happen so easily to you and provide you with automated income streams and the freedom to live your life the way you see bloggers and influencers doing it today. Here's how\u2026  Why start a blog in 2018 anyway? It's kind of an adage thrown around today that Youtube and video is \"King\" in terms of content creation. You have people like Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss, and Tom Bilyeu who have captivated hundreds of thousands if not millions of viewers through their respective Youtube channels. You might be thinking to yourself that blogging and content writing should be left with the corded telephone in the dumpster where it belongs. Research tells us otherwise, however.  (Credit | expresswriters.com) And all of this doesn't just apply to businesses/periodicals looking to spread content and capitalize on the financial gain. It also applies to: Non-fiction writers: Publishers are looking for a writer who doesn't just have a killer book that's ready to be spread to the masses. They are deliberate in the risk they take. They would rather bank on publishing and marketing a book that is coming from a writer with a loyal and viable audience. So much of this audience can be built from content creation through a blog.Lifestyle \"solopreneurs\": It seems every year, there is a new lifestyle blogger that is capitalizing on this industry and traversing the world and experiencing fulfillment in all of its glory. If you are a blogger that is patient, there are ways to utilize affiliate marketing to make a passive income as well as selling products (online courses, ebooks etc) to work towards the freedom you've always desired.So in reading this, you've probably been able to put yourself in at least one of the two categories. What should you do next? Purchase a domain and start your WordPress? Definitely not\u2026  Your Grandfather's way of starting a blog Years ago, the best way to start a blog was through WordPress. It had the best support, plug-ins, upstart and customization. This is evident with over a quarter of all sites being powered by WordPress. The problem? It's extremely complicated and labor intensive.  (When you have no idea what you're doing\u2026) You are going to need to go through the rigmarole of finding your domain name, setting up the site, hosting it, designing the proper theme, re-doing the theme, installing plug-ins, and choosing your niche (only to name a few required steps). Plus, on top of all of that, what if you've invested all of this money and found that your niche isn't popular, or worse, isn't profitable at all. It happened to me when I spent hundreds of wasted dollars into Wheresthefidelity.com that I still cringe when I look at it. At the end of the day, this line of thinking is setting you up for failure. There isn't a clear strategy. You are taking your thoughts, throwing them into the caverns of the internet and hoping they're received in kind. But there's a better way\u2026  Successful blogging of the future In order to illustrate this new strategy, I'm going to break it up into 4 sections: 1. Measuring Achievability:  (Photo by rawpixel) Making sure you are deliberate in your blogging approach. Is this a popular space? Does the audience us blogs to gather information this way? Is the audience affluent enough to exchange value for compensation? Not all niches are the same. According to Obstacle.co the 7 most profitableblog topics are as follows: How to Make Money Examples: Pat FlynnDarren RowseJohn Lee DumasPersonal Finance Examples: Michelle GardnerBusy BudgeterHealth & Fitness Examples: Thrive/StriveMiss Fit LivingFood Example: Food Blogger ProBeauty & Fashion Example: Alpha MinxLifestyle Examples: Survival DonBogotenPersonal Development Example: Talented UnderachieverThis isn't to say that there aren't other blogs niches that are both popular as well as profitable. This information does allow you to see if any of the listed niches coincide with your interests and you could legitimately see yourself writing about these profitable topics over the long haul. There are plenty of people that are probably interested in Bonsai trees, however, are you going to be able to convert the content of this subject into something profitable? Most likely, no. 2. Stealing Like an Artist: What are other successful bloggers doing in your specific niche? You are able to research what people actually talking about in your field and what is being desired by the audience. \"Good artists copy, great artists steal\" \u2014 Pablo Picasso When you have narrowed your selected niche that is both popular and profitable, what are the people doing successfully in this field? You might be thinking to yourself right now, \"Well shit\u200a\u2014\u200anow I have to spend countless hours going through countless blogs seeing what posts are working, what products are being sold, what affiliate links are brining in extra cash.\" While that might work\u200a\u2014\u200aalways understanding \"how the sausage is made\" is a viable tactic for any endeavor, there are tools in 2018 that will help expedite this process. Enter Feedly: Taken directly from Feedly's About page: \"Speed. Openness. Creativity.\" Feedly is an aggregate source of all the top blogs/periodicals/content sites and what type of niches are being followed by an audience:  Create a free profile and search desired niche | Shown here, tech When you are prompted with a list, simply travel to the site and do some research that will help you draw a conclusion of if the niche is viable or not. This can be done with anything\u200a\u2014\u200awhat does \"knitting\" bring you? What about \"Blogging\"? The possibilities are limitless in what to look up, however you are going to see that not every interest is something that should be pursued in order to build a sustainable and profitable blog. Buzzsumo: You've probably heard by now that headlines are 90% of the success of your blog being read (if you haven't heard this by now, probably time to get out from under your rock). So what headlines are working within your niche? A great tool to use is Buzzsumo. Again, from the website's homepage: \"Analyze what content performs best for any topic or competitor\" This is where you can steal the headlines that are working in your niche. Let's look at Lifestyle:  Searching \"Lifestyle\" we can see the headlines that have gotten 170k+ and 550k+ shares! Now, Buzzsumo is a paid service if you want all of the features. You can, for free, get a glimpse of what is working out there and it is a highly recommended tool. These tools allow you to do the diligent reconnaissance necessary to start building a successful and profitable blog 3. Testing Your Ideas Before WP:  (Photo by Micha\u0142 Parzuchowski) You are now able to use sites like Medium to test your blog before going headfirst with the investment of WP. This allows you to see what is working and what isn't. You're probably familiar with Medium (uhhhh\u2026 there's a 99.9% chance you're reading this on Medium right now). Now that you have your targeted niche and you have built up an arsenal of viable topics to write about (topics that an audience is hungry for) you now have the opportunity to write about these topics and test them out. Free Of Charge That's right. You don't have to go through the painstaking and costly setup that was illustrated above. Now, in a community of 60 million monthly readers looking for the content you are producing, you are able to present your valuable content to an audience without any financial skin the in the game. Medium allows you to \"tag\" your stories into the very niche you have been researching. You are able to build an audience on Medium and see what is working and what isn't. Furthermore, there are plenty of writers that are going to be leagues ahead of you on their journey to writing and blogging dominance. What have they been doing that is working\u200a\u2014\u200ain terms of content reception? Research and steal (don't plagiarize) from the writers in your niche and borrow from their headlines and content to help catalyze your speedy progression. 4. Switching to WP and scaling your blog to $1000/month (and beyond) In this article, I won't go over the intricacies of merging your Medium posts over to a well-designed and optimized WordPress site. Thankfully, the Legendary Jon Morrow of SmartBlogger has written a great piece on doing so. If you have reached this step, you have selected your profitable and popularniche, you have done your due diligence on gathering what works and what doesn't in terms of content generation in that niche, you have tested out your own content on Medium to learn the ropes and put in your time, and you have taken all that hard work on Medium and transferred it over to a WP site. How do you get the flood gates of all those dolla-dolla bills to start flowing in? That's why you started this whole thing, right? Well there's good news and bad news. The good news is, you've gotten past the hard part. The bad news? You're really at the starting line still. Now you have to go through: The education of generating trafficBuilding an email listMonetizing any types of products you have found work in the nicheThe Beginner-Blogger's Guide To Selling Their First Ebook.\nTips and strategies that if applied correctly can translate to your own success making $$$ through writing All of these things rolled into one are at least going to take 6 months to get the hang of, implement, and see grow. But that should offer you solace: Nothing worth doing is easy or quick Getting started is the hardest part. After that, you're going to find yourself on a journey that has the potential to change your life (I know it drastically changed my life\u200a\u2014\u200aboth spiritually and financially). 3 Bulletproof Steps To Earn Income With Your Writing in 2018\nI've earned more money this week than my first 1.5 years combined It's happened to me\u200a\u2014\u200ait will happen to you too, now that you are well equipped to start a blog. None of this is guaranteed, however. But do you know what else is true? You have a 100% guarantee of not getting any of this if you don't try. So why not try? Why not put in the handful of hours a week and see what you can build over the course of 6 months? One year? 5 years? There's only one way to know \u2014Getting out there and trying.  Hey there\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019m Jon I\u2019m a thinker, freelance ghostwriter and wine lover who writes articles about personal growth and psychological optimization.

            "answer_text": "Of course! Billions of dollars each year change hands between bloggers, audiences and third-parties (sponsors, advertisers, etc\u2026). Unfortunately, most blog monetization channels only work for the very top 1% of high-traffic blogs. For most, ad platforms like AdSense are actually one of the worst ways to monetize your blog. It\u2019s a hard way to make a living; you\u2019ll likely need 2.5+ million visits per year to earn even $1,000 per month (source). So what are the alternatives? Sure, you could try and get sponsors or affiliate partners. But for most creators without millions of readers, sponsor payouts are meager and unpredictable, and like ad networks, they put your income into the hands of someone else; someone who can cut that revenue off at will. The best, most profitable and most sustainable way to monetize your blog is by selling directly to your audience. If someone has been reading your content and getting value from it, then they already trust that you\u2019ll create things of value. So to monetize your blog, create something worth paying for. The simplest way to do this, for most bloggers, is to create and sell an online coursefor your readers. It\u2019s not easy (anyone who tells you it will be is lying), online, in 2018, it\u2019s easier than it ever has been. Here\u2019s how: Step 1: Come up with a profitable topic idea for your course There are three sources of inspiration I recommend for this: Look at what\u2019s already bringing you revenue. What are people paying you for?Survey your audience, asking them questions like \u201cwhat\u2019s your biggest challenge with [topic idea that you\u2019ve brainstormed]\u201d and \u201cwhat would solving this problem allow you to achieve\u201d (so that you can understand just how much of a burning pain the challenge is for them). I\u2019ve included 5 other questions to ask (and a framework for how many people to survey) in my online course guide.Find a gap in the market. Go on sites like Quora and Reddit, and, in the communities focused on your topic, search for terms that suggest that people are looking for a solution. Things like \u201chow do you\u201d, \u201chow do I\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m struggling with\u201d, etc\u2026 Step 2: Plan your course content When students pay you for a course, they\u2019re not paying you for information; they\u2019re paying you for a successful outcome. So when planning your content, start with that successful outcome and work backwards. What is the end result you want your student to achieve? When you build your outline, the answer to that question goes at the very top. Then, your first course module will reaffirm to the student why they\u2019ll be doing everything they\u2019re doing for the rest of the course. After that, break the end result down into the various steps that need to be taken to achieve it, and plan to build one module for each big step. Step 3: Create your course content The four primary content formats you see in online courses are video, audio, digital downloads (PDF\u2019s, worksheets, etc\u2026) and text. The \u201cgold standard\u201d for is video, and here\u2019s why: it\u2019s multi-sensory (students see andhear the content), and so it can be more engaging, more interesting and more \u201csticky\u201d than other formats. One report by Forrester Research suggested that when it comes to delivering information, 1 minute of video is worth 1.8 million words. For that reason, I recommend that you include at least some video content in your course. The complete guide to creating an online course has expert tips on how to produce content in each of the four formats. Step 4: Name your course After studying thousands of course names, we found that the most effective ones tend to have three things in common: Great course names are targeted, making clear exactly who this course is for. \u201cKnife Skills 101: Learn To Cut With Confidence\u201d is a much better name than \u201cKnife Skills\u201d because it tells the prospect what level of skill the course is meant for.Great course names are results-oriented, conveying the result that the student can expect. \u201cKnife Skills 101: Learn To Cut With Confidence\u201d is also a better name than \u201cKnife Skills\u201d because it tells the student what outcome they\u2019ll get at the end.Great course names are unambiguous, not using fluffy language or jargon that confuses the student and makes them think too hard about what the course is about. \u201cKnife Skills 101: Learn To Cut With Confidence\u201d leaves no question as to the course topic, whereas something like \u201cBlade Mastery\u201d might sound \u201ccool\u201d but isn\u2019t clear.Step 5: Price your course Course pricing can be a really complicated topic, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. I suggest a simple model of goal-based pricing. What is it that you want out of your course? Do you want to reach the highest number of people? Offer it for free.Do you want to make the highest total number of sales? Price your course low enough to make it a \u201cno-brainer\u201d (think under $30 in most markets).Do you want to earn the most total revenue? Price high. It\u2019s a lot easier to earn $1K selling a $1K course to one person than by selling a $20 course to 50 people.And that\u2019s it. You\u2019re ready to sell your course :) For a follow-up guide on how to increase course sales, see: Make more money selling online courses: The complete guide If you\u2019re looking for a place to host and sell your course, check out Podia.

            "answer_text": "Making money by blogging will seem hard for several reasons : #1 Unrealistic expectations Chances are you\u2019re thinking that your blog will make you thousands of dollars in a few months or so. It isn\u2019t your fault really, there\u2019s just too many programs that keep on boasting about their members earning thousands everyday or something. It creates a sort of false illusion that making money online, whether through blogging or what not is easy. The truth Making money online with a blog will require time and patience. Things will not happen overnight. It took me 7 months to make my first bit of money with my blog, I\u2019ve even seem some people take longer, there\u2019s one guy I know that took a year to make his first bit of money online. But u know what? The important thing is to never give up because that very same person started making a full time income 6 more months after that ! So this is what I want to point out to you, that if you\u2019re serious about making money by blogging you need to commit. Trying it out for one or two months just won\u2019t cut it, you\u2019ll just be wasting your time. #2 Lack of training and Internet Marketing knowledge Okay, so you have the passion. You\u2019re ready to give it your best and try to make your website a success. I\u2019m gonna ask you to slow down for a sec. Blindly working on your site can sometimes do it more harm than good. Why? So if you start your own blog naturally you would want to get high rankings on Google right? Well Google has a very complex algorithm that rewards good blog posts and punishes those that don\u2019t follow their guidelines. It is very possible that you tamper with something and eventually make your higher ranking posts drop in rankings. Working on your website is one thing, knowing what to work on is another. What should you do then? I highly suggest you get some Internet Marketing training, or even some search engine optimization training. Initially you should just try and absorb as much knowledge as possible. The field of Internet Marketing is extremely large with many different tricks and techniques. The more you know the more successful your website will be. #3 You may be focusing TOO MUCH on making money There are a lot of ways to monetize a website, advertisements, affiliate links, etc \u2026 A lot of beginners would get excited and just spam these all over their website thinking that the more ads or affiliate links they have the more money they\u2019ll make. See the problem with this is that Google doesn\u2019t like these kinds of behaviours. What Google likes are posts that are informative to their searchers. If you\u2019re spamming ads all around you can be sure that Google will drop your rankings down to rock bottom. In the end, you\u2019ll have tons of monetization but no traffic to help you make money. Do read up on some common beginner mistakes. Which brings us upon a very important point. If you want to make money with your blog, you\u2019re going to need traffic, targeted traffic to be exact. This means that if your blog is about pet products, you\u2019d want to attract pet owners to your blog. There is no point attracting people who aren\u2019t interested in what your blog has to offer. What should you do right now? Read up more and get more information before you do anything. The links that I\u2019ve provided should give you a good starting point. Do check out the training that I\u2019ve shown you, it\u2019s free and there\u2019s plenty of cool freebies there. Also, if you haven\u2019t already, install some analytic tools on your website like Google Analytics. These tools give you better insight on your blog and where it\u2019s performing poorly. You should really focus on getting your site up into optimal condition first before thinking about money. Really, once your site starts ranking the traffic will come automatically and then it should be fairly easy to make money with your blog. I hope I managed to help you out here, but of course one answer isn\u2019t enough to cover everything about blogging for money so if you have any questions don\u2019t hesitate to ask me. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can! You can make money from a blog. In fact, you can make money in so many different ways that the limit is really only your imagination. No joke. I'm not BS-ing you. That's the truth. Let me go through a quick list of the many ways you can make money from your blog. Method #1: AdSense This is the easiest way to make money from your blog. Basically, you apply to Google AdSense, and once you get approved, you just place the code on your blog and forget about it. The ads will show up that are somehow related to the content of your blog. It\u0081fs one of those set-it-and-forget-it types of deals. Now, don\u0081ft get too excited. Just because you have AdSense ads, it doesn\u0081ft mean that you're going to be rich off those ads. You have to have a lot of traffic to make real money with AdSense. Method #2: Affiliate links There are many affiliate platforms out there like ClickBank and MaxBounty. You can sign up for these affiliate programs and use their advertising materials and link to them with your affiliate think. When people click on these ads and they buy something or they enter their email address into a form, you make money. Again, pretty straightforward. Depending on how targeted your website is and how responsive your traffic is, you can make more money with affiliate offers than with AdSense. Method #3: Produce your own products This is my personal favorite. As you probably already know, the vast majority of people who visit your blog are not going to come back. That is simply the harsh reality of blogging. The best way to make money exploiting this reality is to create a mailing list. Maybe you give away a free book. Perhaps you give away free software or even an Excel sheet. Whatever it is you do, get people to sign up for your mailing list. Once people are in your mailing list, you send them updates and, soon enough, some people will click on the promotional links in your updates. It really would be sad if you were to waste your email list sending out affiliate links in your updates. You would make more money if you were selling your own products. Why? First of all, you don\u0081ft have to split the commission with somebody else. Second, you can craft products that address the specific needs of your audience. Third, you have a lot more control over the sales page and other conversion content for your product than if you were just simply selling somebody else's landing page. Do you see how this works? If you want maximum control, sell your own product. What If I Don't Have the Time to Blog? Even if you don't have the time to blog or you feel that you're not an expert in the topics that you\u0081fre thinking of blogging on, you can outsource blogging to a specialist. There are companies like Bulxter that produce high-quality content for dirt cheap. You can easily fill your blog with keyword-specific and value-targeted content without having to spend a small fortune. There are solutions out there. The key is to get started and to have a solid game plan. Remember as the old saying goes, \u0081gIf you fail to plan, you're actually planning to fail.\u0081h I wish you the best of luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I think it is because I am running three blogs right now. And, I am making money from them via my ebook promotions and affiliate links. I decided to write ebooks about my experience as a blogger over the past ten years to help beginner bloggers. I also maintain my blog (THE WITTY FREELANCER) and its about running your own freelance business.  My other blog is about famous celebrities (KYLIE JENNER GLAM PALS). Now, who doesn't like to hear the latest gossip about the 21-year old, billionaire cosmetics mogul Kylie Jenner and her Kardashian siblings? My blogs and ebooks have kept me busy writing and discovering new ideas for my content. However, there are times when I feel as if there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day to finish my writing projects. But, I love what I do for a living and most of all, I love making money.  With that being said, do some research on niche topics and create a blog. Write about 10 good articles, then learn how to monetize your blog. Depending on how you plan to promote, advertise, and sell your products or services will play an important part in how much money your blog can earn. There\u2019s a lot to learn about the blogging industry, but if you have a burning desire to write, then go for it. Bottom line, blogging [is] worth your time and effort if you've always dreamed of becoming your own boss. When one door closes, you can learn how to open another one for yourself. That's the greatest benefit that blogging enables anyone to do on their own, and it doesn't cost much to start up a home-based business. ",

            "answer_text": "Creating a steady income from a blog can be tough. You need to generate enough traffic and have a good product which offers value to your visitors. Plus, you also need to convey this value somehow to your visitors in a way they can understand. Traffic First Build quality content. Everything comes from your content. Shares, likes and rankings all come from creating quality content which offers value to your potential customers in some way. Ideally your traffic should connect potential customers with your products and service. If your content doesn\u2019t do this, it will be much more difficult to convert them into buyers. So make sure your content is a good match for your target audience - the people likely to want what you have. Subscribers Next When you have traffic flowing to your site, you still need to convert this traffic into sales. Most visitors won\u2019t purchase from a site on their first visit. They might not see that what you offer is of any value to them. Plus, they only have a few minutes to make this decision. Then they are gone, potentially forever. Capturing their email address is therefore a priority if you want to build a steady income from your visitors. Once you do this, you can build a relationship, offer more value, and showcase any products you have which can help them. A good benefit driven opt-in page or pop-up is a must in order to convert browsing visitors into serious buyers. Offer something for free on your website which gives massive value and which leads to your products or service. Selling Products To Your Subscribers Good products sell themselves. You don\u2019t want to ram products down people\u2019s throats. What do you do when a pushy salesman starts pushing products on you in a shop? Leave right!? So instead keep offering massive value to your subscribers through your emails. Offer discounts and explain what value your products and services can give. You want your customers to be happy with their purchases and purchase again. Repeat custom ideally - especially for a steady income. The Products You Offer Your Customers Are you excited about your products? You should be! Your customers should be too! If you\u2019re not, perhaps you should find some new products to use. Ideally, your products should in some way be connected with your passions and interests. Unless you would buy your products, why would anyone buy them from you? Ideally you should choose Subscription Affiliate Products because subscriptions offer more value to customers and more income for you. Choosing subscription products was the best choice I made for my blog. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t choose them earlier - well, maybe it was because they were more expensive to buy. But if you want a steady income from a blog, choosing subscription products is a no-brainer! A subscription product will pay you again and again for repeat custom. Just this one change can make a massive difference. Keep Going There\u2019s a point with blogging which eventually you start to generate a regular income. The \u2018tipping point\u2019 is where you start to see traction from your blog. It might be a certain number of daily visits or a certain number of daily subscribers. Until you get to the point where you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, it\u2019s a very long, lonely road blogging! When you start seeing sales coming in it\u2019s a magical feeling and well worth the effort. Remind yourself of all the hard work you\u2019ve already put in. Look at how you got the results you have and repeat the actions which led to those results. Once you start seeing actions which generate results, you\u2019re in a better position to repeat the process and start generating even more traction. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Blogging is profitable because this is a great way to get traffic from search engines. Most bloggers focus on Google, and this is a good idea because Google is the site with the most traffic on the internet. Blogging allows you to connect with your audience as well. If you help people with your posts, you will start building an audience even if you do not get tons of traffic from Google yet. Many top bloggers get traffic from other sources like direct traffic and social media. However, you want to target keywords and get ranked under relevant terms to your niche. The best long-term investment: Building an audience is always a long-term investment in any platform. But building an audience that actually reads your content and not just watching short videos or looking at images on social media has a much bigger value. SEO is a long-term investment as well. If you gain trust in Google, you will get tons of traffic for years. But there is a problem. It takes time. You may spend a year or two without making any money or getting ranked under any keyword that you have targetted. This is the reason why most people fail. They are not willing to play the long-term game. It's easier to get a few likes and clicks on Instagram for sure. It does not mean that social media is easy but the traffic from search engines has a much higher quality. It's perfect for many online business models: Traffic alone can make a huge difference on the internet. For this reason, many people recommend blogging for different business models. You can promote your affiliate links, make money with Google AdSense, make sales on your Shopify store, sell your own product, find clients for your freelance business, etc. It works for everything. You need the right strategy: If you don't have the right strategy, you will fail miserably. First of all, you need a domain name. I think that publishing posts from blogging platforms will not give you enough traffic from search engines. Next, you must target the right keywords. For example, many affiliate marketers target product keywords with less traffic but more chances to make sales. Google AdSense websites search for keywords with more traffic but they would not convert for a specific product. In my opinion, you need a different keyword strategy for each online business model. Create great content consistently: You must post content consistently. Some people disagree with that but these guys usually target high traffic keywords so they must create epic content. But for most bloggers, consistency works. Next, you need great content. At least, you need better content from your competitors. SEO: You must learn about SEO. It's not difficult. You will learn some basic rules of on-page SEO and if you keep working on your articles, you will get backlinks, shares on social media and exposure on other websites. The limit is the sky: I believe that there is no limit on what you can achieve through blogging. It has already created huge online businesses and there is a lot of potential. The best time to start blogging is now! ",

            "answer_text": " INCOME REPORT: HOW I MAKE A FULL-TIME INCOME BLOGGING Are you a blogger who has a dream of working from home? Maybe you feel as if the full-time blogging dream is a myth, or you feel it\u2019s impossible to achieve. That was once me. If you\u2019ve been following me for a while then you might have heard my story already. To give you some insight, essentially I am a college drop out who waitressed for 8 years prior to blogging. If you are a waitress then you know how frustrating that job can be. Sometimes it\u2019s impossible to make ends meet. Waitressing was a dead-end job for me, with no potential to take myself to the next level. Before I started blogging full time I was in a lot of debt (but hey aren\u2019t we all? or maybe it\u2019s just me!) I could barely afford my bills and I was lucky to have one meal a day provided by my job. It\u2019s safe to say I lived off of cheap fast food. Now I am not telling you this to make you \u201cfeel bad\u201d or to say \u201cwoe is me.\u201d I am sharing this with you to let you know that your current situation doesn\u2019t have to be forever. You don\u2019t have to settle for \u201cbarely making it by.\u201d I also share my story to let you know that you CAN be successful without a college degree. I was very skeptical to share my income report for many reasons. One reason is that the income I make is very personal to me and it\u2019s not something I usually talk about. BUT many of you were interested in reading it and I think it will help inspire those who are trying to blog full time. Especially knowing that you don\u2019t have to be a 6 figure blogger to be successful. CLEARLY I am not a 6 figure blogger. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say here\u2019s how to make 6 figures blogging in one year. Part of me is always skeptical about income reports because bloggers claim to make 6 figures in one or two years with no solid evidence to back what they say up. When it comes to income reports it\u2019s hard for me to believe them. If you\u2019ve been following me for a while then you know I am all about HONESTY and backing up my words with STATS. That\u2019s exactly what I am going to do. I don\u2019t make 6 figures blogging yet, BUT I do make more than any job has paid me in the past. Gone are the days of living paycheck to paycheck. AND GUESS WHAT? If I can do it, SO CAN YOU. I\u2019m just a college drop out trying to live a not so perfect life that\u2019s PERFECT for me. I don\u2019t need to make 6 figures to feel successful. So don\u2019t feel defeated if you don\u2019t make 6 figures your first, or even second year of blogging. It\u2019s a VERY HARD goal to achieve. With hard work and consistent strategy WHAT TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN MAKING MONEY BLOGGING 1. THE INCOME YOU MAKE ISN\u2019T THE INCOME YOU TAKE HOME Just like any job you need to pay taxes. (yuck I know) I am glad I knew this beforehand because if I didn\u2019t, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been prepared. All the money you make from blogging needs to be recorded and accounted for. I use Paypal business to collect most payments. If I use an ad company like Mediavine, they will send me a form at the end of the year to use when filing my taxes. Most companies will send you a form at the end of the year to use. You should also look into quarterly taxes. This will save you from any late penalty fees etc. It\u2019s a huge topic that I am no professional at. I suggest looking into talking with a Tax professional when filing to make sure you are doing things the right way. I also like to save 20%-25% of each payment I receive to be sure that I have enough saved for taxes. Sometimes I will over save which is great because it\u2019s like I am receiving a tax return! WOHOO! 2. DON\u2019T COMPARE YOUR HARD WORK TO OTHERS This is something I am trying my best to get better at. It\u2019s so easy to feel envy when you see another blogger talk about their income and how much they are making. \u201cOh, we started blogging at the same time and you are making 6 figures already?! Really?\u201d Honestly, don\u2019t hate and don\u2019t let the success of other bloggers make you bitter. Instead keep your eyes on your own prize and keep working towards your goals! Let the success of others inspire you and push you that much more. Because if they can do it, so can you! AND LIKE I SAID, you don\u2019t need to make 6 figures to be successful. Heck, if you are paying even one bill with your blog, that\u2019s pretty freaking awesome! How many people do you know personally who can say the same?! Keep killing it! 3. IT\u2019S HARD WORK TO MAKE MONEY BLOGGING I am not going to sugar coat a damn thing. You know how I am. Being able to make a full-time income from your blog is soooo much work. I laugh when people try to tell me otherwise. Sure, everyone\u2019s journey is different but there\u2019s no way (me personally) I would be making money from my blog without spending hours every day working at it. ESPECIALLY in the beginning! You can\u2019t just post blog posts and hope for the best. There is marketing strategies and so much more that you need to implement in order to make blogging full time actually work. So ask yourself, can you find the time to dedicate yourself to blogging full time? 4. IT\u2019S NOT A GET RICH OVERNIGHT THING If you are looking for success overnight you will not find it here. Yes, you might see titles like \u201cHere\u2019s how I made 6 figures blogging in 6 months\u201d that screams ALERT ALERT to me. Unless there is solid proof backing that sentence up, I am not believing it. A lot of bloggers will exaggerate to sell a product or to increase their views. (I get it) you can take from it what you want. Personally, I am only believing you if you got proof. You can\u2019t go into blogging wanting to make 6 figures right away because it\u2019s almost impossible. I have been blogging for almost 3 years and consider myself to have a pretty engaged audience and I do not make 6 figures. I have goals to get to that point but not there yet. However, everyone\u2019s journey is different. Just be careful what you believe is all I am going to say about that. ALRIGHT, SO NOW THAT WE GOT ALL THAT OUT OF THE WAY. LET\u2019S DIVE INTO MY BLOGGING INCOME! Source: Thebetteronline.Com ",

But that is nowhere near the norm and their hustle is on another level. And the fact is, most new bloggers only make it a few months before growing tired and quitting. When I started Invested Wallet in June 2018, by the Fall I already noticed many others who started around the same time as me had slowed down or quit completely. The reality is, there is no guarantee you\u2019ll make a lot of money even if you do everything right. You can make money, but it may take a year or maybe even longer. Many people have the impression they can get their blog up, create some content, slap some ads and affiliate links, and they are retiring on some island three months later. Or working from their camper at the beach. If only! Blogging is also tough and standing out can be a major challenge. According to some data from 2018 recorded by internetstats.com, there were more than 1,883,637,867 websites online. That doesn\u2019t even account for all the ones that post content then monthly, weekly, or daily! The competition is fierce! The other challenge is blogging is time-consuming. Think about all the pieces to this like establishing hosting, building your website, writing quality content every week, promoting content, and other marketing aspects (social media, email, etc.)  How to Make Money Blogging As I mentioned above, this is not to completely discourage you from blogging. It\u2019s important to confront the realities that just because you start a blog, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll make an insane amount of money. However, even with the amount of competition, the online world continues to grow and there is still room for you. While content might be shifting, it\u2019s also not dying off quite yet or really anytime soon. And you can make money blogging in various ways. Many of these eventually bring in some decent recurring revenue and you even have a chance to bring more than a full-time salaried job. Exciting! But pump the brakes if you are getting too hyped again and re-read my above sections to bring you back to the realities. Blogging is HARD WORK. But here\u2019s how to make money blogging. Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is simply promoting products that you link on your blog or within blog posts that when someone clicks and signs up, you get a commission. I like and dislike affiliate marketing and also cringe when I see blogs \u2013for lack of a better term \u2014 whore out their content to stuff affiliates all over. However, if you do it correctly, have a strategy, and promote products you actually believe in and fits with your audience, it can work out well for you. I currently only have a few and don\u2019t really promote them heavily. There are a few websites and blogs who are affiliate-based only and are crushing it. Even some sites recently have been bought out for millions because of how much affiliate revenue the blogs were bringing in. Pros: It can be easy income for doing little and as your site grows and ranks, that traffic all has potential to convert. Pending your industry, some affiliates have great payouts ($50+). Cons: Affiliates can shut down or change their pay structure whenever, dumping affiliates all over appears tacky and spammy, making money takes time and there is no consistency. Many affiliates pay very little too. Advertising Probably the most standard form of making money from blogging, is running ads. I currently run some basic ads on my site, although I was a bit reluctant at first. Typically, I think they sometimes disrupt the user experience if not targeted well and can slow a website down. I joined a specific network, which offers more tailored ads and better payments for running ads.This is something I\u2019d recommend over joining Adsense, which has terrible ad experiences and extremely low payouts. You can also sell ad space individually to brands, which can work too but may be more time-consuming. Pros: Little work involved, potential recurring revenue. Cons: Can disrupt user experience, income relies on your traffic growing. Sponsored Posts The idea behind this is working with a brand on content that promotes them or educates your audiences about their product or services. Sometimes the brand may write it or you may also write it, either way you charge them for this. I actually like this option and it\u2019s a great way to make money blogging. Typically, if you have a good audience and can provide value, you can charge a few hundred all the way to a few thousand to do so. However, you need to follow FTC guidelines and also ensure you follow Google\u2019s rules so your website doesn\u2019t get penalized and deranked. This has been my main source of income on the blog so far, but I haven\u2019t put much focus on on it either yet. These can also branch out into brand partnerships, which are longer commitments but can generate great income. Pros: Potential to make great money, not always as much work pending how you approach sponsored content. Cons: No consistent revenue when you are starting, a lot of spammers ask to do this for cheap.Doing this too much can turn audiences aways. Courses This has also been a popular trend among blogs and bloggers, is creating a paid course. These are a lot of work to set up, plus you need to ensure you actually are providing real value first. A lot of information can be found online for free and are things you can teach yourself. However, if you can provide value and you have an engaged audience, courses can bring in some good recurring revenue once they are published. Pros: Can bring in huge sums of money and can be on a recurring passive basis once courses are created. Cons: Tons of up front work, you need an engaged audience willing to pay, you need to prove you are an expert and have something worth to say. Selling Digital Products A great way to make recurring passive income is with digital products. Things you create that you have for purchase on your website. Think of items like ebooks, toolkits, documents, plugins, photography, etc. Here is some more about digital products. Pros: Low overhead costs, potential automated income, higher profit margins for you. Cons: You need to create something worth paying for, can take time to create, need an audience engaged enough to purchase from you. Contract Work If you focus on a particular blog niche, you may start offering your services and knowledge to other companies. For example, I can offer marketing and digital marketing services since that is my background, but doesn\u2019t always translate well since most of this site is all about finances. But a lot of bloggers actually make their first bit of money this way. Pros: Great earning potentials, can work on your time and availability, no commutes. Cons: No consistency guaranteed in revenue, can take time to find clients. Freelance Writing Another cool option for making money from your blog, is freelance writing opportunities that are paid. This may depend on your niche and many times it may not be paid, but this does happen. Your blog is a great content training tool and shows off your writing chops. You might be able to apply for freelance writing gigs or brands may reach out to you. Pros: another revenue source, expands your brand and personal brand reach. Cons: Not always easy to get paid writing gigs, not a consistence source of revenue to rely on. Selling Your Blog You\u2019ve heard the cool stories of former bloggers selling their websites for six-figures and then some! Again, this takes a lot of time and many factors in order for this to work in your favor, but it can be done. Marc over at Vital Dollar has done it a few times! But you can also buy, build up, and flip blogs for money too. Netting a few thousand dollars each time. Pros: You can get a nice lump sum or if you buy and flip can make decent money from that as well. Cons: Extremely time-consuming, you have to know how to build up websites so they are worth something in the future, even great websites have no guarantee that anyone would want to buy it. Finding a buyer takes time or you\u2019ll need a broker to help.  Can You Make Good Money with Your Blog? Absolutely you can, but you need to be realistic. Good money and blogging income reports you have read do not come easy and it takes a lot of work. But, the cool thing about blogging is there are multiple streams and ways to monetize your work and efforts. This besides additional opportunities you might get as well from being a thought leader in your blogging niche. Some bloggers also get paid speaking gigs and others have gotten book deals! It\u2019s pretty cool where blogging can potential take you. But even if you don\u2019t make money or turn blogging into a full-time career, you will learn a lot. For me, it taught me so much more about marketing and is also a great resume booster. When I had a music blog, many job interviews I went on at the time loved that I created something and grew it on my own. I think if you go in with the realities that blogging won\u2019t make you rich overnight or even in a year +, then you have a good shot of succeeding and making some money. And just because the odds might be slightly stacked against you, doesn\u2019t mean you should not give a shot. My best advice if you do get into blogging to make money, is ignore the noise and income reports.Stay focused on your blog and be patient. If you\u2019d like to learn how to set up a WordPress blog in a few steps and grow it, I wrote this post which might be valuable to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Absolutely. You can also lose (lots of VC) money from a blog. I view a blog just like any other digital publishing. Unit economics seem to be largely ignored when it comes to digital content creation but if done correctly a media publisher or blog can be profitable\u2026 Or they can easily miss targets and have to rely on VC funding\u2026 until it runs out. #1 - Content costs should scale with your revenue and audience growth. Some upfront investment on content until you\u2019ve proven you can have positive unit economics is obviously required. Get some traction + revenue and then scale. If I was running a blog with $50,000 per month in revenue and sponsorships I wouldn\u2019t spend more than $30,000 on content. #2 - Your average cost per post should make sense. Don\u2019t pay an avg. of $250 per post when you\u2019ll average 10,000 page views per post and generate $100 per post in revenue\u2026 people don\u2019t make widgets for $100 and sell them for $50. Content shouldn\u2019t be any different. Basic math should be a reasonable guide. #3 - Understand your revenue per thousand page views (RPM) what is a page view worth. I\u2019d also try and understand what an email subscriber is worth. #4 - Evergreen content is magical. It is okay to invest in slightly more expensive content that will continue to drive search traffic for months or years. Balance that out with less expensive content that also drive some engagement. #5 - The revenue will follow the audience. Focus on building a real, sustainable audience with topic focus. #6 - You should \u201cown\u201d as much of your audience as possible. IE email / newsletter subscribers, direct traffic, \u201cbranded\u201d search traffic and consistent search. Social traffic can be complete garbage or at best non-loyal users who will read a post and bounce. You should be building for long term audience and if you get social traffic as a result that\u2019s a win without much cost. I would much rather get 1 million visits from search and email each month then Facebook. If I had to start a blog today i\u2019d start with 1\u20132 posts per day and as traffic grows try and scale it to 8\u201310 posts per day using contributors. I\u2019d focus on consistently increasing email subscribers, direct + search traffic and revenue. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely \u2013 you can make a good living blogging, enough to quit your day job and even hundreds of thousands a year. Of course, it\u2019s not as easy as just writing a blog and waiting for the money to come in; it does require work, strategy and long hours. You need to first work at building a blog that gets a steady stream of traffic, that is updated regularly with new content and that gets engagement (comments, social media shares and so on). Basically, the process of starting to make money from blogging (adapted from my guide on how to make money blogging) is: 1. Create a blog and consistently write content that provides value to your target audience 2. Promote your blog so that you can build a strong, loyal reader base 3. Build up your readers\u2019 trust and turn them into email subscribers 4. Start making money from blogging with affiliate marketing, ads, products/services and so on. In terms of ways to make money blogging, there\u2019s a plethora of ways, really. One of the most popular ways is through affiliate marketing \u2013 where you promote others\u2019 products and you earn a percentage of each sale made through your blog (Amazon Associates is the most popular option here). But one of the best ways to make money from blogging is to build a small business on the back of your blog; you can create digital products, regular products, services and so on. For example, you could create an e-book, an online course or you could sell premium content. In terms of services, you could teach others what you know well through workshops, consulting or training.

            "answer_text": "You want to make money, right? Of course you do. Everyone wants \u2013 and needs -to make money. So you started a blog since you\u2019ve heard it\u2019s an easy way to make cash, but you\u2019re not quite sure how to actually make money doing it. Or maybe you already have a blog and you\u2019re exploring ways to monetize it. Few years back blogging was just another hobby but a lot has changed in past few years. This is 2016 and now blogging is one of the great online business that anyone can take advantage of. As a blogger, gone are those days, when blogger were dependent only on ADSENSE to earn money online, and now blogger have many more ad networks and monetization method, which they can implement and earn huge from our blogs. If you have been using those traditional methods of making money from your blog, it\u2019s time to give a new vision and revise your Blogging business plan. Make some new tweaks, changes for design and marketing of your blog. Work hard to promote your blog and integrate new ways to earn from your blog. New Ways to Earn money online from Blog: If you are using contextual advertisement and not making enough that ways, you should try moving to direct advertisement or affiliate advertisement. Apart from the traditional form of Advertising, work on other monetization tricks which works. Instead of just adding ads, work on adding value for your advertiser. It\u2019s better to have 1 high paying ad than 4 low paying ad units. Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesJust remember that if you are going to choose one of these avenues that you make it relevant and useful to your readers. A lot of bloggers make the mistake of assuming they are developing a product their readers need; listen to your readers first, and then create a digital product that will meet their needs. Affiliate Advertisement: Affiliate advertisement is one of the best ways to make money, since a single sale will make 10-100$ for you.Specially, if you are in the Blogging niche I suggest you, to look into WebHosting affiliates and SEO affiliates. Also, WordPress theme affiliate converts great. Referral Income: Most of advertisement programs like Chitika, infolinks and many others have pay per referral program. Depend on advertisement program you are using, you can look for referral program and refer your readers to that program. This will quickly add some quick dollar in your pocket. Make sure refer to that programs only which work. Though this will work on the niche which talks about make money online or blogging. Direct Advertisement: No doubt AdSense is best advertisement program for bloggers but again it has some limitations like you will not get paid 100% from advertisers and AdSense keep a great cut in between. If you manage to grab direct advertisements, replace AdSense with direct advertisements. Most bloggers entertain, educate, or somehow edify their readers Find a topic or niche that interests you, learn about it, and share what you learn in a unique, creative way. Solve problems, using your writer\u2019s voice! Build your own blog with a theme and content you can\u2019t wait to wake up to every morning! And keep reminding yourself that earning an income online \u2013 like anything worthwhile \u2013 is a long-term process. Many bloggers make money by play with types and sizes of ads There are so many ads to choose from! Banner ads, product images, text ads, in-text link ads, pixel/favicon ads, contextual links, eBook ads, exit ads, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. Incorporate the ad types and sizes that you dislike the least, let them run for a couple of months, and see if you make money. Remember that you may need over 1,000 page views a day before you make $100 or even $50 a day with your blog, depending on your niche and products. Paid reviews: Paid reviews are again a great way to boost your monthly income report. You can quickly make anything above 10$ for a small review post. I make minimum $500 from every review at ShoutMeLoud. Create and sell eBook: If you will notice the business model of most of the top internet marketer, most of them sell eBooks. For Bloggers like you and me, it\u2019s easier to create eBook by using your existing blog content. All you need to do is, pick a topic, compile an eBook on that topic and put it on sale on your blog or on Flipkart. All bloggers remember the concept of \u201ccompound interest\u201d Plant seeds now; they\u2019ll yield acorns and trees later! Some of my most popular blog posts \u2013 and highest sources of income \u2013 are articles I wrote a couple years ago. Making money blogging is a labor of love for the first two or three years. It helps if you have another source of income or a wealthy spouse to pick up the financial slack. ",

            "answer_text": "Making money by writing is probably the hardest and most uncertain ways of earning money. I have had many different kinds of jobs in the last three decades. I did some very hard physical works for the living. Writing is not hard work but turning writings into money is extremely difficult. I cleaned floors at a hospital. I worked as a dishwasher and sometimes as a bartender while studying at a university. I had a grocery shop for more than 2 years. I worked 14 hours a day and 7 days a week. I worked as newspapers delivery man. I had to deliver newspapers late night door to door. I have been working as a self-employed business consultant for the last 7 years. I can assure you, making money through writing is more difficult than all the jobs I mentioned above. You can easily start a blog but you cannot easily get traffic to your blog. Even you gent traffic what are you using them for! What and why will they buy something? On social media, you find many CEO, many Ph.D. holders than other places. You will find many who will show you easy ways to make 10 K or 20 K USD from your blog. If you follow these strategies, you may end up losing money. If you want to make money from your blog, you need traffic and monetize your blog. The best way to monetize is Google Adsense, that I did. There are also some alternatives providers of pay per click. Then you need traffics. It is extremely difficult to get traffic from organic sources (from search engines). You have to use referral sources and social media. You actively promote your blog everywhere, you will get traffic. It worked for me. If they go to your blog and leave within seconds, you will not earn anything. Give them something to engage for minutes. I don't earn a fortune but make 500 USD using a couple of hours daily. This is the way I do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can! Take this from a guy who tirelessly works on his blog. If you already love writing and putting content out there, then you are one step ahead of everyone who still has no idea what to write about.  Blogging is not a hard thing to learn. You just need to first follow several important steps and then start making money off of it.  The schedule of the process looks like this: Set up a blogStart creating and publishing contentMake sure you are being useful to your target audienceBuild engagement with your readersStart monetizing your readership visits through one or more of a variety of income streamsThis, however, is easier said than done. The truth is, you may really need quite a while to build your own good solid readership base. But, don't get discouraged. If you truly want your blog to work, you have to make it work. That's why - as mentioned above- first set up a blog that will capture your whole idea. Come up with a name that will be easy to remember yet will clearly point out the purpose of your blog. Then - write, write, write. If you are not good at writing, practice your writing, seek advice and improve your style. After that, visit some excellent blogs in your niche and analyze which topics do really well. That's exactly what you give to your audience as well, but with your own personal touch to each story. Target and enlarge your number of readers by promoting your blog and engaging your audience. Once you build something out of your blog, and people actually care about it, you should start thinking about making money from it.  Here are some ways you can make money through: 1. Advertising - start accepting sponsored posts on your blog, paid text links, accept video and podcast advertising, make competitions and giveaways and many more. 2. Services - offer your readers your own services such as design, coaching, consulting, freelancing, speaking, copywriting and more. Find what you are good at and put an offer out there. 3. Affiliate marketing - Sign up to affiliate networks and programs and make sure to promote your links continually. 4. Products - sell products on your blog such as apps, books, teaching materials, courses, merchandise and so on. 5. Other streams - Besides all the mentioned, you can also make money from donations and selling other blogs. Hope this was helpful! ",

            "answer_text": "The overwhelming answer here is yes. Thinking about it as a website, not just a blog will help you to broaden your money-making options. The difference here is that a blog is often stereotyped into being a trail of someone's thoughts. Having your own domain is what is necessary to monetize your efforts. While it is still more than possible to make money from this you are limiting your options. Instead, you can create a branded website that appeals to more people. You can still write about your life or your passion but having a site that stands alone on the internet will help you in the long run. Should you decide to write different types of content you can set up your website to display it as such, this makes it easier to navigate around for people that visit your site. This increases their visiting time which in turn improves your ranking in Google. This brings us to our next point. In order to earn money, you will need to direct traffic to your website/blog. There are several ways that you can do this: SEOLink BuildingGuest postingSocial media (Pinterest, Facebook groups, etc)Learning about these things will be valuable to you. Once you start posting content to your website there are several ways you can monetize this. Some of the most popular are: Display advertising (Google Adsense)Affiliate marketing (Amazon Associates, Share a sale, etc)Selling productsSelling downloadable items (pdfs, cheat sheets, etc)The first two options here are the easiest to implement. Google Adsense is fairly easy to sign up to. They will place adverts on your website and you earn when people click on the adverts. The work required from you is minimal. All you need to concentrate on is getting more visitors to your website. The second is affiliate marketing. Many retailers will have affiliate programs that will provide you with a link to their product which you put in your blog posts and earn every time someone buys the product. The most popular one of these is Amazon Associates where Amazon will provide you with links to their products. You could write reviews, how-to\u2019s, best of guides, anything that allows you to include products with affiliate links. How much money can I make? As a marketplace we sell websites that are monetized by advertising and affiliate marketing. The amount these sites are making can vary from a few hundred dollars a month all the way up to five figures a month! These sites are also very desirable to buyers. Because of that their sales prices might surprise you. Visit the Empire Flippers marketplace if you need any motivation. ",

Sell Digital Products If you would rather not advertise other people\u2019s products on your site, or if you are looking for another stream of income, consider selling digital products. This can include items like: eBooksOnline courses/workshopsImages, video, or music people can use in their own contentApps, plugins, or themesJust remember that if you are going to choose one of these avenues that you make it relevant and useful to your readers. A lot of bloggers make the mistake of assuming they are developing a product their readers need; listen to your readers first, and then create a digital product that will meet their needs. Affiliate Advertisement: Affiliate advertisement is one of the best ways to make money, since a single sale will make 10-100$ for you.Specially, if you are in the Blogging niche I suggest you, to look into WebHosting affiliates and SEO affiliates. Also, WordPress theme affiliate converts great. Referral Income: Most of advertisement programs like Chitika, infolinks and many others have pay per referral program. Depend on advertisement program you are using, you can look for referral program and refer your readers to that program. This will quickly add some quick dollar in your pocket. Make sure refer to that programs only which work. Though this will work on the niche which talks about make money online or blogging. Direct Advertisement: No doubt AdSense is best advertisement program for bloggers but again it has some limitations like you will not get paid 100% from advertisers and AdSense keep a great cut in between. If you manage to grab direct advertisements, replace AdSense with direct advertisements. Most bloggers entertain, educate, or somehow edify their readers Find a topic or niche that interests you, learn about it, and share what you learn in a unique, creative way. Solve problems, using your writer\u2019s voice! Build your own blog with a theme and content you can\u2019t wait to wake up to every morning! And keep reminding yourself that earning an income online \u2013 like anything worthwhile \u2013 is a long-term process. Many bloggers make money by play with types and sizes of ads There are so many ads to choose from! Banner ads, product images, text ads, in-text link ads, pixel/favicon ads, contextual links, eBook ads, exit ads, lions and tigers and bears, oh my. Incorporate the ad types and sizes that you dislike the least, let them run for a couple of months, and see if you make money. Remember that you may need over 1,000 page views a day before you make $100 or even $50 a day with your blog, depending on your niche and products. Paid reviews: Paid reviews are again a great way to boost your monthly income report. You can quickly make anything above 10$ for a small review post. I make minimum $500 from every review at ShoutMeLoud. Create and sell eBook: If you will notice the business model of most of the top internet marketer, most of them sell eBooks. For Bloggers like you and me, it\u2019s easier to create eBook by using your existing blog content. All you need to do is, pick a topic, compile an eBook on that topic and put it on sale on your blog or on Flipkart. All bloggers remember the concept of \u201ccompound interest\u201d Plant seeds now; they\u2019ll yield acorns and trees later! Some of my most popular blog posts \u2013 and highest sources of income \u2013 are articles I wrote a couple years ago. Making money blogging is a labor of love for the first two or three years. It helps if you have another source of income or a wealthy spouse to pick up the financial slack. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two fundamental ways to deal with proficient blogging: You could be an independent or utilized blogger for a setup organization or webpage, or you can begin your own particular blog without any preparation. Landing a position as an expert blogger is considerably simpler than beginning at ground zero with your own particular blog. The individuals who land a position with a built up organization can acquire a decent living immediately. Setting up and adapting (ugh) your own particular blog, be that as it may, takes significantly more work, such as beginning your own business. There's no genuine profession way or direction to construct desires in light of. How Much You Can Earn Compensations for bloggers differ generally. Glassdoor reports that bloggers earning ranges from $19K to $79K in a year, while other sources report that 14% of bloggers who acquire a compensation make, all around, $24K a year (or $33K for corporate bloggers). Likewise, autonomous bloggers can make anything from under $10 a post to $100 or more for a decently short post. 1,500 that are Pro Blogger reader have said that there are trying to earn money by blogging, it has been discovered that 9% earn between $10,000 and $1000 in a month and just 4% earn over $10,000. Be that as it may, by far most makes under $3.50 every day. The vast majority of these were written under two years of age, however. The amount you could make would rely upon a few variables, including how regularly you blog, the nature of your substance, how focused your theme is, and how viable you are at building a crowd of people and creating activity. In addition a liberal sprinkling of luckiness. A blog itself isn't by and large a business it's to a more noteworthy degree a phase for other pay streams. Your substance alone won't likely benefit. Rather, you'll need to get publicists, offer administrations like counseling or talking, utilize offshoot advertising to get a level of offers from joins individuals taps on your blog, or possibly offer items like eBooks or premium substance to really produce wage. Success Won't Come Quickly or Easily Try not to give this a chance to debilitate you, yet simply know it could take months, if not years, to begin bringing home the cash with your blog. The other the truth is you'll most likely need to item a huge amount of substance to produce important salary and that is a critical time venture. Composing no less than one post a day is ideal, yet that one post could take hours of research, composing, and altering, contingent upon the substance. It's diligent work. ",

            "answer_text": "Making money by blogging can be done 1 of 3 ways. First, ads. You won\u2019t make hardly anything from adding google ads on your site. They\u2019re essentially worthless for small websites. You\u2019ll be able to get ads interested when you reach around 60,000 minimum a month of unique visitors. Again, that\u2019s a minimum. Second, you can make money by blogging about products. Again, you have to have a good reader base, but if your blog is read by many, advertisers will pay you to give a review of their product. You also get a free product, which is a nice plus. Third, you can make money by blogging if you gain a side income from it. For example, if you build yourself a reputation in a field as an expert by blogging, you can capitalize on that by being asked to speak at places, sell your services, or even roll that cache over into writing a book or getting a job. But blogging is hard work! It can take 3\u20135 hours to write a quality article, several times a week, and can take years to build your audience. You\u2019ll need to interact with comments, become friends with other people in your space, and spend time learning about marketing and seo. How long it takes depends a lot on how much competition you have. Wanting to write a lifestyle blog? Good luck - there is a ton of competition. But if your field only has a few experts online writing, maybe something like speech pathology, then you could quickly build up an audience - if there are enough people interested in your subject. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s how to make money from a blog. Start a Blog In order to make money blogging you\u2019re going to need to have a blog. While this is pretty obvious it is also a stumbling block for many PreBloggers who come to the idea of blogging with little or no technical background. If that\u2019s you \u2013 don\u2019t worry! It was my story too and most bloggers start out feeling a little overwhelmed by the process of starting their blog. Start Creating Useful Content A blog is not a blog without content so once you\u2019ve set your blog up you need to focus your attention upon creating useful content. What you choose to create will depend a little on the topic that you choose to write about (on that note, most successful bloggers have some focus to their blogging whether that be a niche or a demographic that they write for). The key with creating content is to make it as useful as possible. Focus upon creating content that changes people\u2019s lives in some way will be the type of content that people will value the most and it will help people to feel like they know, like and trust you \u2013 which is really important if you later want to make money from your blog. Get off your blog and start finding readers As you create the most useful content that you possibly can it is easy to get very insular with your focus and spend most of your time looking at building your blog. Many bloggers have a \u2018build it and they will come mentality\u2019 with their blogging but this is a bit of a trap. If you want to make money from your blog you need to not only focus upon building a great blog but it is also necessary to get off your blog and to start promoting it. There are many ways to experiment with growing your blog\u2019s audience that I\u2019ve written in previous blog posts and talked about in podcasts (I\u2019ll share some further reading and listening below) but it is important to enter into all these strategies remembering that you should not just be looking for \u2018traffic\u2019 but \u2018readers\u2019. Start by thinking carefully about the type of reader you\u2019d like to have read your blog. You might like to create an avatar of that reader (sometimes called a reader persona or profile) to help you work out who you\u2019re trying to attract. Once you know who you\u2019re hoping to have read your blog ask yourself where that type of person might already be gathering online. Begin to list where they might be gathering: Are they reading certain blogs? List the top 3Are they participating in certain forums? List the top 3Are they listening to podcasts? List the top 3Are they engaging on certain social networks? List the top 3Which accounts are they following on each of these social networks? List the top 3Each of these places that you reader might already be gathering has opportunities to develop a presence whether that be by leaving good comments, offering to create guest posts or simply by being helpful and answering questions. With this list of blogs, focus, podcasts, social media accounts in hand you will have some good spots to begin to hang out and create value. The key is to build a presence, to add value, to foster relationships \u2013 not to engage in spammy practices. Build engagement with the readers that come With sustained focus upon creating great content and finding readers for your blog you\u2019ll begin to notice people visiting your blog and engaging with your content. At this point you need to switch your focus to engaging with those readers and building community. Respond to comments, reach out to those readers personally and do everything that you can to keep them coming back again and again by building a \u2018sticky blog\u2019. Look after the readers you already have well and you\u2019ll find they spread the word of your blog for you and help make your blog even more widely read. Having an engaged reader is also much easier to make money from. Start making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streams OK \u2013 the first four steps of starting a blog, creating content, finding readers and building engagement with those readers are important foundations that you really do need to get in place before you\u2019ll be able to build long term income for your blog. There\u2019s no avoiding that what we\u2019ve covered is a lot of work but if you do it well you\u2019ll be setting yourself up well and giving yourself every chance of being able to make money from your blog. With these foundations in place you\u2019re now ready to start attempting to make money from your blog but you do need to be aware that just because you have set up your blog, have content and have engaged readers that the money won\u2019t just automatically flow. It takes continued work and experimentation to make money from your blog. As you\u2019ll see there are quite a few options that bloggers have to derive income from their blogs. Advertising Income This is where many bloggers start. In many ways this model of making money from blogs is not dissimilar to how a magazine or newspaper sells ads. As your traffic and brand grows you\u2019ll find advertisers will be willing to pay to get exposure to your audience. While you need decent traffic to do a direct deal with an advertisers there are ad networks (like Google AdSense) that act as a middleman and enable smaller publishers to run ads on their blogs. This is where many bloggers start (I did too). Affiliate Income A recent survey of ProBlogger readers found that affiliate promotions was the most common type of income that our readers have. To put it most simply \u2013 affiliate income is when you link to a product that is for sale on another site (take Amazon for example) and if someone follows your link and ends up buying that product you earn a commission on that sale. There\u2019s more to it than that but this is another great place to start with monetising your blog as affiliate programs are easy to sign up for and if you have an engaged audience you will find they follow the recommendations that you make on products. Events While not something most bloggers do I have noticed an increase in the number of bloggers making money by running events. These range from big conferences and events like our ProBlogger Conference which hosts hundreds of bloggers every year right down to smaller meet-ups for a blogger\u2019s readers where money is made either through charging readers to attend or by finding a sponsor for the event. Alternatively online events or summits are getting more popular. Recurring Income Another growing category of income that I\u2019m seeing more and more bloggers are experimenting is recurring income streams (sometimes called continuity programs or membership programs). This is where readers pay a regular recurring amount (usually on a monthly or annual basis) for access to either premium content, a community area, some kind of service, tools, coaching (or some combination of these things). Promoting a Business Many brick and mortar businesses indirectly make money from their blogs by using their blogs to grow their profile and direct readers to their business. Services A common way that many bloggers make money is through offering services to their readers. These might be anything from coaching and consulting, to writing or copywriting, to design, training or other freelance services. Products While I started out making money from my blogs through advertising and affiliate promotions today my #1 source of income is through selling eBooks and courses on my blogs. These \u2018virtual products\u2019 take work to create but have been lucrative for me and many other bloggers. Products can of course take many forms and income virtual information products like eBooks or courses but also other virtual products like software, reports etc. The other type of product some bloggers sell is physical products. This is most common when the blogger has a business but sometimes bloggers also create merchandise (T-shirts etc) or other physical products to sell. ",

            "answer_text": " Anyone can make money online blogging. In this post, I\u2019m going to explain to you the 4 different ways to make money online blogging. Let\u2019s Begin Before I dive into the 4 ways I make money online I want to talk to you about the most important aspect of making money online no matter what route you decide to take: building an audience. If you can build an online audience then making money online would be easier for you. Without an audience (clients, customers, members), you have no business. The problem is that many people just don\u2019t know how to build an audience or don\u2019t put any focus on building an audience. Instead, they concern themselves with blog appearance, Twitter and Instagram posts posts, and other small things that don\u2019t doesn\u2019t matter . You need to learn how to build an audience and that means getting traffic. If you can get traffic to your site then the whole world begins to open up for you. It\u2019s great that some bloggers will tell you that you don\u2019t need much traffic to make money and they aren\u2019t wrong, but if you can get a lot of traffic everything becomes much easier for you. If I have a blog that is getting 100,000 page views a month that means that I\u2019m probably getting at least 50,000 people to the site (most blogs will do between 1.2 to 1.4 pages per session). That means I have to try and get some small percentage of those people to buy something from me if I really want to do well. If I can\u2019t get them to buy something then (in some cases) I have ads running on the site that will make me money anyways. With a decent ad network, like AdThrive or Clickbank, 100,000 page-views should net you between $800-$2000 a month. As the number of people visiting my site increases, the chances of me making more money increase. That should be easy enough to understand with one caveat. The traffic just can\u2019t be random traffic. It has to be traffic that is interested in what I\u2019m writing about. It\u2019s a pretty simple formula but for some reason, many bloggers (and other website owners) don\u2019t put a lot of time in figuring out how to get traffic to the sites. Make It Easy With a Good Niche Now, let\u2019s address something else which is going to be bad news for some of you. If you want to make money online then I\u2019m not going to tell you to follow your passion. Instead, I advise you to do stuff that has been proven to work. If you like the idea of starting a blog and you are having an issue figuring out the niche you should go into then you should check my post on top 10 profitable blog niche idea in 2019 There really is no reason to try a different niche for your first blog. I\u2019ve spoken with people that want to start blogs on the topics they are most passionate about and they assume that they will do well simply because they believe other people love the topics as much as them. Wrong. What people love are things that make their lives easier and better. Why do you think how to make money blogs, personal finance blogs, and health blogs do so well? Don\u2019t hesitate to start a blog in a big and popular niche. The audience is already established in those areas so it\u2019s pretty silly to avoid them. With that being said let\u2019s dive into the ways that I make money online. 4 Ways To Make Money From Blogging I\u2019m going to surprise you here and say that one of the ways isn\u2019t by blogging. Nobody pays me to blog. However, the whole reason why I can make money online is because of blogging so if you want to make money online I suggest you get into blogging. Blogging is your marketing platform. Fancy marketing people like to call it content marketing. Blogging gives you the opportunity to build an audience which in turn gives you the chance to open up new revenue streams. Get this straight, blogging opens the doors for a ton of opportunities for you. So when you see other people talk about blogging, they aren\u2019t directly talking about how awesome it is to write a piece of content. They are talking about how blogging levels the playing field for individuals to be able to reach thousands or millions of people similar to a bigger company. That might be a small technicality but I wanted to get that out of the way. 1. Ads This is the second easiest way from a technical standpoint to make money online because you don\u2019t have to do much to get them set up. If you use one of the ad networks that I mentioned above then they actually do all of the work for you! What you do need though is a shit ton of traffic for this to be effective. By this, I mean at least 30,000 page views before you even want to consider putting ads up on your site. However, ads are the most passive way to make money online. Your only focus is to get people to continue to come to your site which can be challenging in its own right. As of May 2018 I do about $15,000 a month in ad revenue. 2. Affiliate Marketing This is the easiest way to make money online from a technical standpoint because you don\u2019t have to do anything but post a link on your site. That link points to a manufacturer of some product that will pay you every time someone purchases from them. For example, if I run a car blog and I sign up for an affiliate program with a car parts shop, I can link the different car parts that I like on my blog and when people click on the link and purchase from the car parts shop I get a cut. The commission that you get is totally dependent on the affiliate program. There is no status quo. Percentages can range from 4% to 90%. However, making money with affiliate marketing is a lot harder than people present it. You might think that all you need to do is put a link on your site and then watch the money flow but that isn\u2019t the case. You have to do a lot of upfront work to convince your audience that they want/need a particular product. If you can\u2019t do that then your links will just sit there without any click. 3. eBooks Writing EBooks is another strategy of earning money from your blog and you can make them simple or as complicated as you want. The easiest way to sell an Ebook is to simply write it in some type of word processing application (Word, Pages, or Google Docs) and export it as a PDF. There you go. You now have an eBook that the world will enjoy. eBooks are a great starter product for many bloggers because everyone has the tools to create them. Some people believe that your ebook has to be super long for it to be successful and I\u2019ve seen 4-page ebooks do well, the amout of pages does not affect your sales. It\u2019s completely dependent on the subject matter and what problem you are trying to solve. If you don\u2019t even want to set up your own website you can go directly through Amazon\u2019s Kindle Direct Publishing to reach millions of people instantly. Of course, you are dealing with a lot of competition but I know authors that make over $40,000 a month with their Kindle books. 4. Online Courses This is one of the most lucrative ways to make money online when you have an audience. To make $1,000 with ads (on a good ad network) you need to do between 70,000 \u2013 250,000 page views a month (remember it depends on the niche). That\u2019s a lot of people! To make $1,000 with affiliate marketing you might need to sell a couple dozen/hundred items. With online courses, you can make $1,000 by selling just a couple (dependent on price). Out of these 4 methods, online courses are both the most technically involved and the most time-consuming. More Ways to Make Money Online These aren\u2019t the only ways to make money online.

            "answer_text": "Starting a new website or blog is super easy. You can create a free blogging account at Blogger or WordPress, or go with a complete site of your own. This is what I recommend. All you need to do is register a domain name, set up web hosting and then install a free copy of WordPress. You will also have a lot more opportunities to earn money with your own blog versus creating one on WordPress or Blogger\u2019s free hosted platforms. Once you\u2019ve gone live with your site, you can then start writing content with the focus of monetization in your mind. At the same time, if you want to improve your blog, it\u2019s all about the content creation and content promotion plans you have for your site. These are the two most important things to remember. CONTENT CREATION - Only create great content that provides real value and is better than what\u2019s currently already out there. Google your competition, see what type of content they have, then create something better and be sure to include stats and visuals when possible.CONTENT PROMOTION - With over a billion active websites and blogs online, there is already way too much content out there. Without the necessary content promotion, your site is just going to get lost in the mix. You need to continually promote your content to new audiences.To better explain all of the above and how you can use such methods to increase traffic on your own site let\u2019s cover the many components that go into a great marketing and branding plan to grow a website or blog. Not only will content creation come into play, it\u2019s also how much effort you put into your content promotion as well. In the world of blogging, this can be done in a number of ways.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d How much money can you make? We're talking about north of one million dollars. In fact, websites like ViralNova have sold for a million dollars or more. Blogs sell for six figures pretty much every month. With that said, it's also very easy not to make any money from a blog. It all depends on how you set it up. The key here is to find the right niche. How do you know you find the right niche? There are five factors you need to look at. You have to get all of these factors right. If you miss out on any of these, chances are your blog will fail. Factory #1: Personal interest You have to pick a topic category or niche that you personally are interested in. How do I know that I am truly interested in a niche? I ask myself a very simple question. If I can talk about this topic without any expectation of getting paid, this is probably a good topic. I probably am personally interested in it. Factor #2: It must have enough search volume every month Go to Google AdWords and use their Google Keyword Planner tool. Type in topics related to the list of niches you came up with using Factor #1. You would notice that some keywords get a lot more searches than others. Focus on the keywords that get a medium amount of searches. This means that they don't have too much competition, but they have a decent amount of traffic. Delete from your list all other interests that have very little traffic. Factor #3: Commercial value Using Google Keyword Planner tool, look at the CPC rates or cost-per-click valuation of the keywords related to the niches you are researching. You would notice that some have a high cost-per-click value while others are very low. Pick somewhere in the middle. This way, you can increase the likelihood that you will get a niche image that you're personally interested in, has decent demand, and you can make quite a decent amount of money from. But you have to always factor in number 4. Factor #4: Search for competition level Now that your list of keywords is getting shorter and shorter, we\u2019re going to apply another filter. Type in those keywords into the Google search box. Google will tell you how many pages are competing for that search term. This is common sense. Do not target keywords that have too many competing pages. You're just making things harder for yourself. It's going to be very hard to rank for a niche when there are hundreds of millions of competing pages for that keyword. Factor #5: Look for social media popularity Type in your remaining keywords into Facebook\u2019s open Graph Search or into Twitter. If you notice that there\u2019s already a decent amount of content on those social media platforms and they get a lot of shares, likes, and favorites, then you know that there is enough of a social demand for these topics. You should stick with those. Why? You can easily reverse engineer the most viral or most popular existing content in your niche. Why is this a big deal? You don't have to come up with a topic by yourself. You already know what is viral. You already know what sells. So, find these topics and simply rewrite them. The secret to good rewriting is to only do it if you're good at it. If you\u2019re a lousy writer, or you\u2019re unmotivated and you can't do it quickly enough, hire an expert writers like Gene Eugenio and others who could do it for very little money. So, do yourself a big favor. You have to be prepared when it comes to blogging success. You can't just jump in with both feet and expect to make six figures. It doesn't work that way. You probably will discover in the worst way possible that blogging is real work. ",

            "answer_text": "You might not be too impressed at first by some of the figures you see online (we're normally talking pennies), but that\u2019s the nature of monetising a blog \u2013 the more readers and clicks you get, the quicker your pennies will grow into pounds! Affiliate linksAffiliate links are links that you can weave into the text of your blog that allow you to make a small commission every time a reader clicks through to a site and spends money.The links will lead readers to the website of a brand, and the money you receive is to say 'thanks' for sending some of your lovely readers to their site (or being 'affiliated' with the brand, so to speak).The key is to be authentic and genuine with this - write reviews/articles with your honest opinions and don't encourage your readers to buy something if you don't think it's a good product.Sign up to Affiliate Window - a huge affiliate network where you can promote thousands of brands and services instantly!AdsYou can bring in some dough by offering space on your blog for brands to advertise themselves to your readers.For example, banner ads run across the top of the page, and sidebar adsare (you guessed it!) the ones that run down the side of your blog content.You can charge for these in one of two ways. PPC (pay per click) means you'll get a set payment for every one of your readers who click the ad, while CPM (cost per thousand \u2013 M being Roman numeral for thousand) means you'll negotiate a set payment for every 1,000 \u2018impressions\u2019 the ad http://gets.As mentioned, the rates of PPC and CPM can seem low, and quite often they are low \u2013 but the more readers you acquire, the higher the clicks (and remuneration) will be!Selling newsletter spaceIt's also an option to charge a brand for either advertising space or a mention in your weekly/monthly newsletter (if you have one!).However, you\u2019ll need to build up a decent size mailing list for brands to consider this.Advertorials and sponsored contentAdvertorials are essentially adverts in the form of an article or blog http://post.So for example, say Adidas bring out a new swimwear line, and your blog is a popular women\u2019s sport fashion blog. Adidas might offer to pay you a set payment in exchange for, say, 500 words plus four images of their products in your blog post.They\u2019ll even throw in a couple of affiliate links so you can earn some extra cash on any clicks, and to top it all off you get to keep the swimmy the sent you!Advertorials are the easiest way to make money fast, but in order to be approached, you need to be worthwhile to a brand.That's where having a strong, niche audience comes in handy (because readers of a women's sport fashion blog are way more likely to want to buy something from Adidas' new line than readers of a generic fashion blog).Social media postsIf you have a strong social media presence (in fact, some people make an entire blogging career just through Instagram alone!) then you\u2019ll be very attractive to brands. You can charge per post/re-post and the fees can be surprisingly high.You\u2019ll just have to work hard on building your followers first \u2013 your 'social proof' (or how many people follow you on social media) is seen by brands as proof that readers will like what you post about them, too.Guest bloggingOccasionally, members of the press (or even brands who have a blog of their own) will get in touch if you\u2019re a particular authority on a certain topic, asking you to make a little cameo appearance on their website.For example, if you\u2019re particularly knowledgeable on cooking on a budget, a newspaper might get in touch and ask you to contribute some budget-friendly recipes to their cooking magazine.This is where establishing your niche and honing it comes in handy! Become an authority on your topic and the opportunities to make cash will eventually flow in.Working with an agencyBelieve it or not, blogging has become so popular in the world of advertising that agencies exclusively catered to pimping out bloggers to big brands have popped up all over the shop.Working with an agency can be lucrative and offers you security, but you\u2019ll need to have a really decent following to be scooped up in the first place.Agency fees are also incredibly high, meaning only the biggest brands will be able to afford working with you, and smaller independent companies will be scared off.Depending on the kind of blogging business you're aiming for, this may or not work to your advantage - to use the example of ethical fashion blogging again, signing up to an agency would probably prevent you from working with small independent designers.Sell digital productsIf you have skills or advice to offer, another option is to charge a fee for access to eBooks, video tutorials, courses or Future home of workshops.in order to make this option work, you need to be able to show you\u2019re extremely good at what you do, or that your content has proven to be incredibly valuable. This isn't Easy Soft can be pretty difficult to convince online communities to pay up, as there's a tendency for people to think everything online should be free of charge. Worth a try though, right?Use your blog as a stepping-stoneUsing your blog to promote your own business or even land yourself a job is another (albeit indirect) way to make more cash with your blog.If you're one of the growing number of students starting their own business or selling stuff online, your blog is the perfect platform to promote what you have to offer (although don't go in too hard, or you'll put readers off).You can also use your blog as a sort of online profile to build your credibility that will ultimately get you a good job. Think of it this way: your blog is like your own small business in itself, and by showing potential employers that you can do this successfully, you're showing that you've got an entrepreneurial mind, and know how to achieve success with it.",

            "answer_text": "Yes, you can. There is tons of bloggers that makes hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. It seems crazy but it's true, but there is a catch. Making money blogging is simple but it's super hard. It's true that there is thousands of successesful bloggers but there is even more unsuccessful ones. You see starting a blog seams to be really easy and it basically takes about 10 to 15 minutes (I wrote an article on my blog on How to Start Blog you can check it out) but that's only the first part of the long marathon. The biggest reason in my opinion why people win or fail is consistency. If you see top bloggers in almost any niche, they have simple action plan that they follow. Usually that plan consists of writing blog posts every week (in some cases even 2 or 3 times a week) after that promotion on selected social media channels and etc. Unsuccessful bloggers on the other hand post from time to time and basically play with the blog and don't look at it as a business. And it is simple to understand why, it usually takes more than half a year to start earning from your blog and you have to work super hard for half a year without any income. It's frustrating to write a blog post and see that it was read only two time's, but you simply have to believe and do your job. As I wrote before making money blogging is simple but it's super hard and sometimes frustrating, but if you ask me it's definitely worth the try (: - Hope this answer helps you to better understand blogging and start your own blog (; ",

            "answer_text": "Whether we like it or not, Digital is going to be the future. The global ad Industry is Expected to be over 700 Billion Dollars and of it 50% would come from Digital Media Ad Spend. According to the report published under \u201cThe Battle of \u2018Big\u2019 versus \u2018Small\u2019 by Zenith, it is specially mentioned the growth rate of Mobile Internet which is at a Positive Compound Annual Growth rate (CAGR) of 20.7%, far exceeding any other media medium. So its safe to say the Advertising Industry is booming at a rapid rate for a foreseeable future and Digital Marketing is on its forefront with Mobile internet as its rising superstar. As as the question is concerned, Digital Marketing where the money is at for people who have the necessary skills and expertise. So lets explore some of the ways someone could get into Digital Marketing and make some money.  World Class Blog Guideline: First lets get the reality of it out of the way. This one is doable, but extremely difficult and time consuming. There are few reasons for this, the success of a blog depends on a few aspects; *SEO Ranking of the Blog *The Loyal Following As in terms of SEO, it is very difficult to Rank in 2019 if you are going after generic topics because there are plenty of active blogs who have been there for a very long time so SEO is something that keeps getting difficult day by day. This is the first challenge the Blogger must solve, to have a water tight SEO plan (basically you better know what your doing, or get someone else who knows what they are doing) The way to do this is by going after a very small niche and to be THE expert on that particular niche by providing valuable content. Only through this you will create your \u2018 Loyal Following\u2019. This is the desired outcome for any blog. Once you have a following you are going to be exposed to various forms of income generating avenues. Some income generating ways are passive. Remember the important thing here is to gain traffic and build a real following to your Blog, so if you are looking for a way to make money from tomorrow morning stop reading this because this is not for you. We are in it to for the long term. Finding a Niche \u2013 Select something that your passionate about, look at the broad industry and the information on it, select a subsection on that industry that you are interested to explore about. Then do a search on \u2018Google Trends\u2019 on keywords, you can try several keywords on and see the growing popularity of the search term. Then go over to \u2018Google Keyword Planner\u2019 and see the other search terms for your subject. If you are willing to go one step further then you can use paid tools like semrush, Serpstat and Raven Tools These will enhance your research ability so I highly recommend use them at least for a trial period. Select the Blogging Platform \u2013 This is the software that is used o manage your blog. The most famous of the Blogging Platform is WordPress, which I highly recommend. But there are alternatives like Blogger which is a free platform. Selecting a Domain Name \u2013 This is a very important step as it will be the first form of viewer visibility. You have to decide whether your creating a personal brand, informational site based on the keywords that you focus. Some of the best bloggers in the world like Yaro Starak, Perez Hilton and Ryan Robson have all built their blogs using their name. This could be highly profitable as they can use their names in various forms of online and later on many offline money making streams such as Conference Talks, Workshops etc. Build Your Personal following \u2013 This is not about just creating content for the sake of it, but its about understanding your Target Audience and create the \u201cRight Content for the Right People. \u00b7 Find out the Pain or Pleasure points of your Target Audience \u00b7 Have attractive Titles that have the specific search terms in it, so they click on it \u00b7 Be active on research to make sure that you are updated on the points of interest for your Specific Target Audience. \u00b7 Be the expert or the educator of the subject Another important thing to consider is not to be the Salesman and push for Products and Services too early in your blog. Concentrate in trying to be the Authority of the Subject first, after that people will beg you to create products for them to buy. Everyone buys but no one wants to be sold. So focus on Content Creation based on the value you deliver to your Niche Target Audience.

Here are the stats from yesterday for my blog:  Short answer is, yes, you can earn money from a blog and you can earn big-time. Making money from a blog highly depends upon your topic selection and content quality. I work just 2\u20133 hours on my blog, but I work at-least 5\u20137 days on just 1 blog. That\u2019s my strategy. 1 optimised and well researched blog article has a potential to earn more than Rs.3L a month ($4000+) This is one of the best time to get into creating your own blog. I started with this blog just 4 months ago and I haven\u2019t worked a lot on it. If I have to say how easy it is to buy things now, I bought these just to try them out. No need, didn\u2019t give it a second thought:  If everything goes well, I soon plan to buy this, my dream setup:  (Macbook pro + Extended Setup + Magic Keyboard :D) Either way, I know people who have 2\u20133 blogs each making a more than decent amount. Why wouldn\u2019t that be? One can have an online blog in a matter of 10 minutes, its that simple now. I worked on a guide recently and have shared my research there. It talks about everything one needs to get started with a money making blog. If you want to read it, I have a link in my profile, do give it a read. Its something you would regret not reading. (only if you are serious) If you have any questions, feel free to reach out in comments, I\u2019d be glad to help. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "In short, the answer to your question is a definite yes. However, the difficult part is how to do so. Let's turn that question into a solution. With a significant variety of options to earn money online, a blog is a great choice to start with! Not only can you have fun doing so, but you can start generating income as well. The question is, how do people make a profit from the blog? I understand you might feel lost within the millions of ways to develop the blog and its content, but in truth, it doesn't have to be as difficult as you may think.  If you already have a blog, there are multiple ways to earn money from it, such as placing ads, having sponsors, freelance writing, doing affiliate marketing, and so on. It's important to know when and how to reach the point where you can finally put these methods in action and be proud of gaining income by doing so. As mentioned, with a variety of options to earn income from a blog out there, you should analyze each one of them and find the ones that suit your preferences the best. Let\u2019s talk about some of the most popular ways:  Affiliate marketing. it is the most popular way to earn money online, in fact, you a have a blog with a little bit of traffic visiting it every day it can be a great source of earning if you don't know what is affiliate marketing it works in a simple manner you promote the product of different people and get a commission when somebody buys it. affiliate marketing is a great way to earn money online even I earn millions of dollar last year doing it you can sign up for A free training if you want to learn affiliate marketing and earn millions like me here https://rebrand.ly/zmillionaire  Ads. Another popular way is to place ads on your blog. Millions of people decide to use Google AdSense due to its simplicity. Since it's so easy to use, it's an efficient way to start earning income. However, you have to keep in mind that too many ads can drive customers away.  Sponsored content. Eventually, along with the increasing traffic, companies are most likely to notice you and send you sponsorship offers. You might get a business proposal to share an article on your blog that is written by the sponsor or you may choose to write one yourself. Others simply ask to provide them with some exposure on your blog by giving links to integrate within the content you make. All in all, this is another great way to earn income. With little to no preparation, a blog can go online in no time. What you need to do is find a niche you are interested in. Don't choose something you aren't much interested in just for the sake of its popularity. Keep in mind that you will have to stick with it. Writing about topics you are passionate about will inspire you, and writing will be more exciting.Decide how you are going to build your blog. Are you going to use a Content Management System (CMS)? There are multiple options to pick from. Don't rush and make sure that the platform you choose is the one that can bring out the most potential out of you and you feel most comfortable with it. CMS such as WordPress gives lots of freedom and capabilities to build a great website even for those who are beginners. There's also a possibility to use a website builder or just build it from scratch yourself if CMS is not of your preference!After deciding how you are going to build up your website, you will most likely need a hosting provider to have your blog online. Now, there are lots of options as well, so make sure to dig around and see which provider is best suited for you. It doesn't need to cost a lot, as the prices for the smallest hosting plan can be really budget-friendly. Although, it's essential to keep in mind that as the blog grows, so does the requirements for resources increase, and upgrading a plan becomes necessary.You need to pick a domain. Think of something easy to memorize. It can be related to your niche, name, or if you are developing a business, then a business name. Users should be able to easily memorize it, so the next time they want to visit a blog, they don't have a hard time remembering the name. Keep in mind that there are opportunities to claim a free domain with certain hosting plans, so keep your eye on it.Starting a blog is easy, but remember that earning income from it takes some time. Don\u2019t get discouraged and keep working hard! All that is left now is to actually get going and complete these steps! I hope this helps and drives you towards success, have a great day and good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Let me explain this to you. You can\u2019t earn money from blogging, technically. Because, you are using the visitors on your website to earn. So, it doesn\u2019t matter if it is a blog or another website that offer other services. However, to earn online from a website, there are several ways. I\u2019ll list them one by one for you. Stick to your seat and read the whole answer.  You can easily make $$ using these given steps. Because these steps don\u2019t depend upon your website age or anything like that. But. They depend on one thing. Your website\u2019s traffic. So, if you have enough traffic and a trust-able audience on your blog, you can pick up any of the following steps and get paid to blog. As I always say (other guys in some kind of online business say the exact same thing). PATIENCE is the KEY to SUCCESS. There are a couple of ways that you can try to squeeze some money out of your new website. 1. AFFILIATE NETWORKS Affiliate marketing is totally the best way to earn some money without actually doing anything. Yeah, and I mean it. Now, What is Affiliate Marketing? Simply put, a person buys any product from your link and you get a commission out of it. That\u2019s what affiliate networks are for. It\u2019s not that complicated. Just sign up for an affiliate marketing website and generate links for products that you want to place on your blog. Then, if anyone makes a sale using that link, You\u2019re Gold. 2. PUBLISHING EBOOKS If you are not comfortable with the promotion of other products, you can always promote your own. But, what will you sell? Ebooks are the best and easiest to start with. If you have precise knowledge about any topic, you can surely write 5000 words about it. Just 5000 words? Yes, just 5000 words. Remember, Ebook is not a novel. It\u2019s just like a Black Hole. Small, but packed with information. Once you get to know what is your audience\u2019s taste, you can create an ebook regarding that topic and put it on sale. If you are new, you must limit your price to 50$. But, once you get enough sales, you are free to raise the price. 3. DEVELOP A COURSE Don\u2019t want to write 5000 words? We\u2019ve got another idea. You can create your own course on various sites. They can be free, but as you want to earn some money, you must put a price tag on it. This is also like selling your content, but instead of writing, you have to create detailed videos and presentations about any topic. Make sure that they are informative and educational. 4. WRITING AS A FREELANCER If you are deeply into writing but also don\u2019t want to write an ebook, you can try this method to get some money. Working as a Freelance writer will provide you with money. But, you have to create a reputation among the writers first. There are many websites that offer freelance jobs, you can sign up to one or two. But, you won\u2019t get regular work unless you get positive reviews. And remember, A blogger can be a freelancer but a freelancer can never be a blogger. By the way, that\u2019s not mine, I read that on some random website on the internet. 5. PUTTING SOME ADS (The General Way) This is probably the most famous way to get paid to blog. Almost, all of the bloggers use this as their secondary income source. And, you should do too. The working of Ad networks is simple. You put some ads on your website. Whenever a visitor clicks on an ad. You are paid for it. You can sign up to any Ad networks that you want. But, everyone has their own conditions and paying terms. 6. DIGITAL TRAINING Don\u2019t confuse Digital training with Online Courses. They are different. If you are an expert on some topic, why not help and consult others regarding that. That\u2019s the fact. Digital training means to coach and train others over the internet. If you have got a huge audience and vast knowledge, you can give it a go. There are just two steps to start Digital Training. First, find your audience and their taste. And second, Promote yourself. You can do it either by making videos or just by showing some ads.  So, these were the main and trust-able sources to earn money through a website. Be patient and you\u2019ll rock. Be hasty and you\u2019ll lose everything. Read more at Get Paid To Blog [The Ultimate Guide] [2019] . Upvote if informative. Happy Blogging. ",

            "answer_text": "7 Top Tips to Make the Most Money from Your Blog You don't have to have thousands upon thousands of page views each month for your blog to make considerable money. You just have to use the following 7 tips and best practices that guarantee you get the most money-making potential from your blogging efforts. 1 \u2013 Be Active on Social Media If your blog covers professional occupations and topics, you need to be on LinkedIn. Self-published authors find creating Facebook groups for their books helps them develop a following. Get on the top social media sites and interact with people regularly. It won't take long for you to find out which sites should demand most of your attention, and that is where you need to be active. Provide links back to your blog on these sites. 2 \u2013 Pay for Traffic Free, generic traffic is great. In the beginning, you may want to spend some money on advertising to prime the web traffic pump. Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter all offer different types of advertising models that can help you send consistent traffic to your blog without spending a lot of money. 3 \u2013 Network with Other Bloggers in Your Niche Google and other search engines like to see who you are networking with. It is important for them to know that you regularly send traffic to other blogs in your niche and that they send traffic back to you. Networking with other blogs similar to yours can pay off handsomely with traffic and improved sales when you practice the following tip. 4 \u2013 Write Guest Posts on Other Blogs Why would you want to take the hours needed to create an amazing, quality post and then give it to another blogger? A lot of bloggers simply don't have the time required to run their web properties properly. When you offer to write a guest post for another blogger, they allow you to link back to your blog. A single guest post can deliver substantial traffic, and this practice also increases the perception that you are an authority figure in your field. 5 \u2013 Make Your Content Easy to Share Blogging platforms have social media share widgets and plug-ins that you should be using everywhere on your blog. If you take the time to create a really great blog post, make sure it is easy to share so that you can get as much exposure as possible. 6 \u2013 Only Publish High-Quality, High-Value Posts Never mail it in. Don't publish garbage. If you only have a few minutes to whip together a blog post, wait until later when you have more time. Always publish high-quality, high-value content that solves big problems and answers big questions for your audience. 7 \u2013 Build an Email List If you don't start building an email list on your blog from day one, you may keep putting it off for months or even years. This is a huge mistake. The wealthiest and most successful bloggers will always tell you their email list is their most valuable asset. You absolutely, positively must be building an email list on your blog. Pls upvote if you like. ",

            "answer_text": "I managed to make almost $6500 from my affiliate blogging network last month so you can definitely make money from blogging still. The main problem that I see with people is that they expect to be able to make money quickly from blogging and this is not the fact with many people giving up early before their articles have a chance to even rank in Google and start to pull traffic to earn them an income.  The image above is the traffic analytics for one of my affiliate blogs that I started in August 2019 and as you can see, it takes months for your traffic to grow. The dip around March/April 2020 is due to the virus outbreak and search habits temporarily changing due to people panicking but as you can see, the general trend of traffic growth for the domain is increasing week on week. That particular domain made me around $1700 last month and I also have this video on Youtube going over how that particular domain has managed to make me $14,000 in only ten months too. Many people that I see seem to give up on their projects after two or three months and as you can see in the traffic analytics above, that simply is not enough time for earning an income from blogging. In my experience, the Google Sandbox effect is real and you can see it in those analytics where it takes months for my articles to rank in Google and get traffic. I have multiple affiliate domains and to date, every single one that I have made has shown this same effect of taking months to pull traffic. I have also made a number of friends in the blogging space too with all of them reporting the exact same thing for their domains too. I have this video online too that goes over what you should realistically expect if you are a brand new blogger for the first six months of your blogging journey. It goes over a realistic look at the amount of work that will be involved as well as the time that it takes to actually get traffic as well as the income for each month as it passes. Too many people get into blogging thinking that it is a quick and easy process and it really isn\u2019t so I would highly recommend you check that video out for a bit of a reality check. I also see a large amount of people who claim to be blogger but seem to get little to no traffic saying that getting into blogging to make money is the wrong reason. I totally disagree with this as I find money and financial freedom to be an excellent motivator and it has definitely helped me stay consistent with my own projects to grow them to the level that they are at right now. The thing is, you have to realize that different types of blogs will earn you a very different income per 1000 visitors to your website. An affiliate domain like the ones I build specifically target buyer intent keywords such as \u201cbest pen for engineers\u201d and usually earn me anywhere from $80 to $130 per 1000 hits. On the flipside of this though, due to the higher income potential, the competition for these keywords is usually higher making it a pain for people new to bogging to get into. On the flipside of this, there are informational keywords such as \u201cHow to change the ink in a pen\u201d. Although these will likley earn you much less, as low as $3 to $5 with something like Googles Adsense display ad program or around $20-$25 per 1000 hits with a premium ad network such as Mediavine or Adthrive, the competition is usually much lower. This often makes informational keywords the easiest option for go for initially as they can be easier to rank for and usually also have a higher search volume too. In addition to this, if you find the right informational keywords you can sometimes earn a similar amount for your initial time investment in the article to a buyer intent keyword due to the higher search volumes and lower competition making them easier to rank. For example, say you rank a buyer intent keyword that brings in 100 hits per month, it might make you $10 per month for that article. If you rank an informational keyword that brings in 1000 hits per month, it may also make you $10 per month due to the higher search volume offsetting the lower income per 1000 views. Now, you have to know how to choose your battles to maximize the chance of your article actually ranking in Google and pulling you traffic so I would highly recommend that anyone looking to make an income from Blogging checks out this answer I made to another question on here. I basically go over a solid keyword research method as well as how to set articles up that I have used to scale my projects to being able to earn a personal best income of $344.83 from my own blogs to date as shown in the Amazon Affiliate Dashboard screenshot below.  In addition to this, implementing some basic on-page SEO techniques such as how to keep your page load times as fast as possible is well worth the time and effort in my experience. This answer that I made to someone else's question on here goes over the methods that I implement in my own projects to keep my page load times as fast as possible to help improve my own on-page SEO to try and help my articles rank higher in Google to get me more traffic. As I said back at the start of the answer, I made close to $3600 last month from my money site network and I am currently working on growing it to over $10,000 by this time next year. I am documenting the process on my YouTube channel sharing updates on my progress as well as other tips and tricks that I pick up along the way if you want to check it out. ",

            "answer_text": "Just like with any other product or service that generates income, you need to focus on providing value to your readers. The more value you provide, the more income potential your blog will have. Step 1: Create a target audience. The first thing you need to do is figure out who your target audience is. It\u2019s best to focus on an audience that you can personally relate to. This will make it easier for you to be more creative and offer the most value when it comes to creating content because the topics you write about will be your forte. Step 2: Create tailored content. Once you have your audience figured out, do some research and learn about their problems. At the end of the day, people will only read your content if it\u2019s valuable and solves their problems. Additionally, try to make sure your content is as unique as possible. Readers will appreciate this as you\u2019ll be the primary source for information related to the topics you write about. Also, there\u2019s no point of creating duplicate content just for the sake of it as it\u2019ll negatively impact your blog\u2019s SEO which will cause it to lose traffic over the long run. Step 3: Monetize your blog. Once you have a good stream of traffic coming into your blog, it\u2019s time to think about how to generate revenue from it. There are plenty of ways to do this depending on who your audience is and what type of products and services they\u2019re most receptive to. You can display ads on your blog with Google AdSense, sell affiliate products with Amazon Associates, etc. Best thing to do when it comes to ads is to test, test, test. For instance, displaying too many ads on your blog may deter your readers. You want to find the right balance through A/B testing. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to make money blogging, I\u2019ll explain how bloggers make money.You don\u2019t have to be a big blogger who built an impressive company to make money blogging. Necessary steps to make money blogging Whether you are a beginner or have been blogging a while, here are the basic steps for making money with a blog: 1.Start a blog If you want to make money blogging, you must have a blog. The 6 basic steps to start a blog Decide what to blog aboutChoose a blogging platformFind a hostPick a domain nameInstall WordPressDesign & use your blog!Can I start a blog for free and make money? This is a common question and the answer is yes. However, I would caution you against it. The reason is, when you use a free service, you don\u2019t have full control over your blog\u2014the free service you are using does. This can be risky, especially if you will rely on your blog for income. A self-hosted WordPress blog is my recommendation and can be started for as little as $5-$10 a month. 2. Create useful content Once you have a blog, write useful content. Draw from your expertise & experience. Write informative posts and articles about your chosen topic. Make your content excellent. What should I blog about? If you\u2019re stumped, here are ideas for posts readers will respond to: Solve a problemRelieve a fearTeach something newExplain how to reach a goalEntertainIn order to make money, you must have blog visitors. But in order to have blog visitors, you must have content worthy of a visit. 3.Build relationships with others on social media and around the web At the same time you are creating valuable content, start building genuine and sincere relationships with others on social media and around the web. Which social media sites should I use? With so many social media sites, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. My advice is to think about where your target audience hangs out on social media and start there. Is your blog for moms of preschoolers? Facebook and Pinterest might be best. Is your blog for business executives? LinkedIn and Twitter are probably safe bets. Other than being active on social media, here are more ideas: participate in Facebook Groups, comment on other blogs or join forums. Find or start a mastermind group. Reach out to people in your niche by tweeting them. Find people who could use the information you provide. Get to know them, interact, be friendly and helpful by offering no-strings-attached tidbits of your expertise. The word about you spreads best through people who know, like & trust you. 4.Establish a strong platform Keep growing in the knowledge of your craft so the content you produce gets increasingly deep and valuable. Use your blog to get exposure, build authority, gain trust and be helpful. In addition, use this time to think about the type of reputation you want to build. How do you want others to see you? How do you want them to experience your site? What do you want to be known for? This is all part of your branding. 5.Choose your income streams Once you\u2019ve started your blog, created some excellent content, built some relationships and given thought to your branding and reputation, start thinking about ways to generate blogging income. There are many ways you can do this.I will outline 5 main types of income along with many specific ideas for each. Things you should know about making money blogging Much of the money bloggers make doesn\u2019t come from blogging directly. A blog is a platform or online home base. After proving their trustworthiness, bloggers use their blogs as springboards to launch other products & services that bring in income. Examples are e-books, books, speaking gigs, products, e-courses, etc.If you want to make money blogging, it takes time, creativity and hustle\u2014a lot of all three\u2014but it\u2019s absolutely doable.Each blogger has a different combination of income streams. There is no \u201cright\u201d way and that\u2019s the beauty of it. There are endless possibilities. Find a combination that works for you or make up your own.Income streams ebb and flow, so successful bloggers are constantly exploring new ways to make money. The key to making good money as a blogger is to have multiple streams of income. Even small trickles of money coming from various sources over time can add up.The best way to start monetizing is to let it happen organically. Hopefully, you are blogging about something you enjoy. As you grow, monetize (make money) in ways that would most suit you and your audience. Blogging about fly fishing? Sell your services as a fly fishing guide. Blogging about being a preschool teacher? Sell preschool curriculum.",

Now You are thinking, How to start a blog or website?Starting a blog is easy today with many platforms you can start free or paid (but I definitely recommend to start with paid blogging to have Domain name and to download WordPress, where you can blog without Coding skills. Second thing you need to do is a writing skills or even hire other (but it is better if you start it with yourself) or maybe you can hire someone to create a website for you and someone who will run it and maintain while you don't do anything and Earn from it through AdSense. It sounds easy but not, honestly it takes time to learn it for 2-3 months but its not that hard and you can do it yourself.You see many people do it and earn 4 digits and up to 5-6 digits in Dollars monthly from it! (In Coming Year we will release a Complete step by step how to start a Profitable Blog for FREE in it's first month of launching so better be updated with us. We never lie about it and definitely do it without you or with others interested people.)You can start a blog for just as low as $50 dollars below and earn hundred to thousands of dollars from your first 3 months from it.

Also, Amazon or Alibaba or Lazada that are earning from a Online Ecommerce Shop. Sky is the limit for many business or services to offer.Now, think of something you can offer without spending money and write all of them and create a feasibility studies and see if it's already in the market or never been on a market. Try that thing you are thinking right now for free to 1 person and check what is his or her reaction about it and feedback.

            "answer_text": "Yes you can. Melyssa Griffin earned $283,680 for December 2016 from her blog (this is her last income report). Pat Flynn earned $184,000 from his blog in June 2017. Matthew Woodward earned $22,600 in July 2017. Abby Lawson earned $41,700 in December 2016 (her last income report). Great, isn\u2019t it? The downside is that it takes a lot of time ( some say at least 1 year) of strategic hard word to have enough good traffic to earn your first buck. So, don\u2019t just jump in there to be a millionaire. I have a blog (liveabusinesslife.com) and know from experience that running a blog is such a pain. From your blog\u2019s hosting, design and architecture, to content curation and amplification (I have a guide on this), social media management, keyword optimization (my guide on this) and SEO, you need to spend a ton of time to learn and implement the tactics and then make the right changes without complaint. This is a long way my friend, but possibly it changes your worldview to that of an entrepreneur: strategic planning, hard work, and the ability to change when needed. Let me count the ways you can make money from your blog: Doing affiliate marketingSelling your own products (ebooks, courses, coaching, etc.)Selling ad spacesAccepting sponsored blog postsGet membership feesPromoting your freelance career (writing, designing, programming, etc.)I don\u2019t know any more than this, but there might be some other creative ideas to monetize your blog. Remember, before you start your blog, be sure you know your niche or at least are willing to do lots of research on it otherwise you\u2019ll end up frustrated. Take care, ",

            "answer_text": "The most popular ways to monetize blogs are : putting display ads from networks like - adsense, adthrive etc. This is the most common form of blog monetization. All you need is a good traffic and page views on your blog to maximize this option. In today\u2019s time and age, though it is easier said than done. Also, you can sell space on your blog to display specific ads from advertisers who contact you directly out of the adnetworks. Simply put, through adnetworks, you got no say no what ads display on your site. But with the other, you know what product is displayed.Selling affiliate products on your site is the other option to earn money through blogs. It is similar to the concept of recommending a product and earning a commission for the same. For an instance, you are a big fan of Gamebox. So, on your gaming blog, you describe all about Gamebox and suggest the audience to make a purchase. When they actually buy the gamebox following your links to the product that initiated from your blog. That is when you earn a commission. Amazon and clickbank are the popular sources for affiliate marketing. Although, most of the e-commerce platforms have their own affiliates set up. You can team up with any company whose product you use and like and would want to recommend on your blog to earn a commission. With my experience, companies are more than willing to partner with bloggers to promote affiliates of their products/ services. I refuse more than I accept requests for affiliate marketing on my personal blog.The other option is to have your own products/ services on your blog. That typically includes - consulting; digital instant downloadable products like - books, software and courses; membership sites and of course non-digital products that are shipped manually to a postal address.Depending upon one\u2019s blogging and technical skills one can chose to monetize their blog the way they find it feasible. Though for any kind of blog, content is the fodder. That is true even for blogs that are not monetized and are just an extension of hobby pursuits. Stress more on content writing to be successful with blogs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are actually several ways one can make money by starting a blog. In the video below, I share 7 different strategies that you can incorporate in order to build an income through blogging.  However, I do want to ask this question\u2026 Out of all of the business models out there, why choose to blog? Because understand that to be a successful blogger, you have to be a great content creator and marketer. Meaning that you need to be able to create top quality articles with great writing, images, search engine optimization (SEO), etc. in order to get ranked and found. You need to be able to capture leads, send the emails that lead to offers. Plus, you need to really market your blog posts on other platforms. I see far too many people get into blogging because they think it\u2019s the best way to earn money online. But it\u2019s challenging (especially if you don\u2019t like to write) and it takes a lot of work without getting paid for a long time. Most people aren\u2019t writers but then force themselves to become one when they start a blog and then quit really quickly because they realized they actually don\u2019t like writing and creating content. And that\u2019s AFTER they spend money to start their blog. So before launching your website/blog, my suggestion is to write 15\u201320 high-quality articles over the next 30 days or so in the specific niche that you\u2019d create your blog around. Be sure to research how to rank with SEO and understand what it really takes to be a successful blogger. Then, if you find out you don\u2019t like writing or it\u2019s painful, then you\u2019ve just saved yourself a bunch of time and money. If blogging isn\u2019t for you, definitely look into other ways to earn money online which I share in this video\u2026  There\u2019s a ton of other options to choose out there that may be better suited for your skills and goals. Think about this\u2026 To make money online, know the fundamentals\u2026  Okay, so to generate sales, you need targeted traffic and you need some sort of offer. Well, are there other ways to get traffic to an offer other than blogging? Absolutely. Blogging, creating content like videos or social media posts are just different strategies to attract traffic and drive them to an offer. But here\u2019s the path for most bloggers and why it\u2019s harder to make money\u2026 The get a domain and website\u2026 They spend weeks and months to write content to hopefully get ranked on the search engines\u2026 People come to the blog and they typically are asked to opt into an email list\u2026 And then the email marketing and offers are made. If you learn how to run paid traffic, for example, you can just get people right to your landing pages and on your email lists and make offers. Sure it costs money. but you can find out if it works quickly without spending all of that time writing and you can scale it faster. Anyway, that\u2019s just to help you paint the picture of whether blogging is really the right vehicle for you if you want to make money online. But hey, maybe blogging is your thing. But like I said, just write a bunch of articles in a specific niche first and see if you actually enjoy it enough to do it long term. But if you really want to make money from your blog, you really have to take the time to study marketing. Best of luck in your blogging/business journey, Dan Lu ",

Though there are many other Advertising networks like Chitika, Infolinks, and Media.net | One of the largest ad-tech companies worldwide the thing is they do not show ads relevant to your content and the payout is also very less. Google Adsense ads are relevant to your content and your blog. Google Adsense can be the best way to earn from a blog if you have a very very high traffic and an awesome content. 2. Do Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to earn money from Blogging. You can easily monetize your blog using affiliate links in your blogs.

Now you can place these affiliate links into your blog or website. You can add it directly or make use of the different ad formats like banner ads. Now let us assume you have written an article in Samsung Galaxy S8 and have placed the link of the same in your website between the content and If anyone buys that mobile after visiting the advertiser's e-commerce website through your link then you will get a commission or some percentage of the product's total cost. There are many affiliate marketing networks on which you can sign up and start earning from them. Amazon is considered the best affiliate network. It is called as Amazon Associates. There are many other affiliate networks that you can easily find on the internet. Some of them also offer 50% commission for each sale through your link. Isn't that cool? Let us say someone buys a product of 20000 from your link, then you get 10000 directly to your account. :) You can try Clickbank and ShareASale. We will soon write a well-researched article on the 5 best affiliate marketing networks for bloggers. 3. Sell your own products E-commerce: For example, if you have a business and you have a shop or some products like ladies footwear or clothes etc..you can make use of digital marketing and can use your blog to increase your sales. You can place details and Ad formats of your own products. This will definitely increase the sale of your products. Number of people will come to know about your business. They can see all the products directly on their PC or laptops. And if they like them they will place the order. You can add an online payment system to your blog. People can save their time and you can increase the outreach of your products. And if everything goes well you can get orders from your own state and even from other states. So what are you waiting for? 4.

            "answer_text": "Making money through regular blogging isn\u2019t the same as it was a year and even 10 years ago. When Medium and Quora started to really take off, there wasn\u2019t any need to start your own WordPress. To get attraction from google (readers) on this two mentioned platform is much easier than on your own blog. For example, if you write a good answers on Quora, you can get on Google and Bing searches results much quicker than with your own blog. Another thing that has helped me to generate almost 1000 leads a day was when one of my posts went viral on Quora and they added it to the daily digest. Quora Digest is an email sent by Quora which contains answers which Quora thinks you might like to see. Sure there are people who make money through regular, old fashioned blogging. But if I would start my online business today, I would definitely choose to generate leads through Quora or Medium. I love that on Quora you just give short answers. And get feedback much faster, than making one long post on a WordPress blog. After making almost 20 posts on WordPress, I felt exhausted. Because no one was reading them. But instead of Quora, after 20 answers I have written, I received tons of comments. And 1one of 20 posts went viral and got over 100 000 views. There is no reason for me to continue to write on WordPress. In my free case study, I show step by step how you can use free traffic sources to generate leads and convert them. Proof Here is insights into my stats. One of my posts went viral just overnight and got over 155k views!  P.S. Here is a link to the post that went viral.

As a 13-year veteran blogger making six figures a year, I\u2019ll explain how bloggers make money. By choice, I work part time and I don\u2019t have a team (well, unless you count my teenage daughter who does a few data entry-type tasks on the weekends). In other words, you don\u2019t have to be a big blogger who built an impressive company to make money blogging.  This post contains affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, if you click through an affiliate link and make a purchase, I may make a small commission.  Necessary steps to make money blogging Whether you are a beginner or have been blogging a while, here are the basic steps for making money with a blog: Start a blogCreate useful contentBuild relationships with others on social media and around the webEstablish a strong platformChoose your income streamsNow let\u2019s cover each of those steps in more depth. 1. Start a blog Clearly, if you want to make money blogging, you must have a blog. If you don\u2019t already have one, no worries. Here are easy instructions explaining how to get your blog up and running. Can I start a blog for free and make money? This is a common question and the answer is yes. However, I would caution you against it. The reason is, when you use a free service, you don\u2019t have full control over your blog\u2014the free service you are using does. This can be risky, especially if you will rely on your blog for income. A self-hosted WordPress blog is my recommendation and can be started for as little as $5-$10 a month. Related: How to Start a Blog (includes step-by-step instructions for setting up a self-hosted WordPress blog) 2. Create useful content Once you have a blog, write useful content. Draw from your expertise & experience. Write informative posts and articles about your chosen topic. Make your content excellent. What should I blog about? If you\u2019re stumped, here are ideas for posts readers will respond to: Solve a problemRelieve a fearTeach something newExplain how to reach a goalEntertainIn order to make money, you must have blog visitors. But in order to have blog visitors, you must have content worthy of a visit. Related: How to Decide What to Write About 3. Build relationships with others on social media and around the web At the same time you are creating valuable content, start building genuine and sincere relationships with others on social media and around the web. Which social media sites should I use? With so many social media sites, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. As I explain in this post, my advice is to think about where your target audience hangs out on social media and start there. Is your blog for moms of preschoolers? Facebook and Pinterest might be best. Is your blog for business executives? LinkedIn and Twitter are probably safe bets. Other than being active on social media, here are more ideas: participate in Facebook Groups, comment on other blogs or join forums. Find or start a mastermind group. Reach out to people in your niche by tweeting them. Find people who could use the information you provide. Get to know them, interact, be friendly and helpful by offering no-strings-attached tidbits of your expertise. Word about you spreads best through people who know, like & trust you.

Establish a strong platform Keep growing in the knowledge of your craft so the content you produce gets increasingly deep and valuable. Use your blog to get exposure, build authority, gain trust and be helpful. In addition, use this time to think about the type of reputation you want to build. How do you want others to see you? How do you want them to experience your site? What do you want to be known for? This is all part of your branding. Related: 13 Branding Tips Plus My Top Piece of Advice 5. Choose your income streams Once you\u2019ve started your blog, created some excellent content, built some relationships and given thought to your branding and reputation, start thinking about ways to generate blogging income. There are many ways you can do this. In the rest of the post, I will outline 5 main types of income along with many specific ideas for each. 5 Ways to Make Money Blogging Cheat Sheet  This post is thorough so I\u2019ve put together a cheat sheet for quick reference. It\u2019s free to Useletter subscribers (the Useletter\u00ae is my weekly email packed with extra, up-to-date tips about social media, blogging, making money online, etc.) Want the cheat sheet?

A blog is a platform or online home base. After proving their trustworthiness, bloggers use their blogs as springboards to launch other products & services that bring in income. Examples are ebooks, books, speaking gigs, products, ecourses, etc.If you want to make money blogging, it takes time, creativity and hustle\u2014a lot of all three\u2014but it\u2019s absolutely doable.Each blogger has a different combination of income streams. There is no \u201cright\u201d way and that\u2019s the beauty of it. There are endless possibilities. Find a combination that works for you or make up your own.Income streams ebb and flow, so successful bloggers are constantly exploring new ways to make money. The key to making good money as a blogger is to have multiple streams of income. Even small trickles of money coming from various sources over time can add up.The best way to start monetizing is to let it happen organically. Hopefully you are blogging about something you enjoy. As you grow, monetize (make money) in ways that would most suit you and your audience. For example, blogging about knitting? Sell knitting patterns. Blogging about fly fishing? Sell your services as a fly fishing guide. Blogging about being a preschool teacher? Sell preschool curriculum.Related: 12 Things to Do Before Making Money Online (the practical nuts, bolts & legalities of making money online) Streams of income used by bloggers Following is a list of income streams bloggers adopt, broken down into five main categories: AdvertisingAffiliate MarketingDigital ProductsPhysical ProductsServices Unlike many of the other categories, advertising is all about generating income directly from your blog, website or other digital asset(s). Display Ads Display ads are graphics or images similar to billboards or ads in a magazine. Typically they are positioned on your site in the sidebar, header, footer or within your content. Sometimes they are referred to as banner ads. Ads on your site are meant to complement your blog\u2019s content, making them attractive and relevant to visitors. Advertisers hope that your visitors will then click on those images to explore and purchase the products or services they offer. Display ads are often provided through ad networks. Ad networks are companies that connect advertisers with publishers (bloggers). Ad networks act as a middle man between advertisers and publishers, negotiating partnership details between the two. The ad network takes a cut from the partnership profit. Ad networks are attractive to many bloggers because they take the hassle out of display advertising. Some ad networks, like Google AdSense, are relatively easy to get into and are easy to set up. Other ad networks though, are selective in who they accept. Examples of ad networks are Google AdSense, Blogads, BlogHer, Beacon Ads, Federated Media, Sovrn, (formerly Lijit), Media.net, Rivit and Sway. There are many more, so once you get involved in your niche\u2019s community of bloggers, you\u2019ll soon hear of others. Can you really make money with Google AdSense? This is a very popular question, and a good one. Google AdSense is probably the most popular ad network. No doubt you have seen Google AdSense ads as you have surfed the web. Adsense ads come in various shapes and forms. Sometimes they are images and sometimes they are text. They show up in sidebars, headers, footers, within posts and anywhere else website owners choose to display them. Adsense is a good place for beginning bloggers to start if they want to pursue display ads because it\u2019s so easy to set up. However, if you want to make really good money with Google AdSense, you either have to be in a unique niche in which advertisers will pay a lot of money for clicks on their ads (hard to find), or you have to have a lot of traffic (hard to get, especially for beginners). For these reasons, I don\u2019t recommend AdSense (or display advertising in general) as the main pursuit for new bloggers. Tips: To apply for Google AdSense or other ad networks, contact the ad network via their website (choose one from above).If you want to get an idea of pricing and traffic for popular blogs, sites like Beacon Ads and Federated Media are places you can do that.If you\u2019re using CPC/PPC ads (cost per click/pay per click), check out Google\u2019s recommendations for best ad placement on your site. It\u2019s important that your content doesn\u2019t get drowned out by ads. Google has indicated sites with too many ads above the fold may be penalized in search. If you\u2019re not sure what above the fold is on your site, use this tool.As always, experiment. Experiment with ad placement to get the right combination on your site.Further reading: Jason from ProBlogSchool explains ad networks in great detail in his post Ads 102: How to Make Money Using Ad Networks. Private Ads Private ads are similar to display ads in that they also come in the form of buttons or graphics and usually appear in the sidebars of blogs. They are unique in that there is no middle man (ad network) to negotiate the partnership. Partnerships are arranged directly between a blogger and an individual, small business or company. Initial contact can be made by the blogger or by the advertiser. Be clear on what\u2019s expected by both parties. Not sure what to charge? Look around to see what others in your niche charge. You can often find this information on a blog\u2019s advertising page or media kit. Don\u2019t just throw up an advertising page and expect advertisers to come calling. Go to them. Not sure how to do that? Find other blogs like yours that are your size or slightly larger. See who is advertising on their site. Contact those companies and ask if they\u2019d like to advertise on your site too. Create a pitch and make it a win-win. Check out iHeartOrganizing\u2018s advertising page as an example. Tip for private ads on your blog: If you have ads in your sidebar, keep them full. Instead of displaying a blank box with \u201cAdvertise here\u201d fill it with an affiliate graphic (see Affiliate Marketing below for more). Crystal Paine puts it well when she says, \u201c[Blank ad spots] scream, \u2018My advertising space isn\u2019t valuable enough for people to want to buy so I instead have this big blank box!'\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the EXACT strategy I\u2019m using right now to make money from my blog. 1 ) Repurpose long-form blog posts into Quora. Every blog post that starts with \u201c7-Steps\u2026 or 3-Ways\u2026\u201d is repurposed into a question that I can answer on Quora. This helps me leverage time by taking one blog post and answering 3 or 7 questions at a time. This is how you collapse time. 2 ) Fill our your Quora profile so it\u2019s clear and there\u2019s a link to your blog or website. I use my blog to share long-form content which is highly effective since nobody really wants to write. 3 ) Traffic from your blog leads into a funnel. This is key. I am very intentional with my blog and email marketing to help bring my readers on a natural journey to the next level where they become customers (they ascend my value ladder). This works incredibly well when you over deliver and provide a ton of value. Give, give, give. 4 ) Google Adsense - this is great for website monetization. Although it will take time and a crap to of content once your traffic grows you will start attracting ads and you can leverage it to make passive income. 5 ) Promote Affiliate links - do this only for products you truly use and care about. Affiliate income is a great way to earn extra cash on a monthly basis. 6 ) Sponsorships - Once you have hard traffic numbers you can pitch companies to promote posts on your blog and you\u2019ll earn extra cash for sharing the company\u2019s message with your tribe (similiar to Instagram influencers). 7 ) Be Consistent - The more content you put out on a consistent basis the more successful you\u2019ll be. The law of probabilities states that at some point your platform will blow up if you stick with producing high quality and quantity content. Yes, it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s worth it.

            "answer_text": "Good question, Hello I am Kailas Mistry. A Blogger, affiliate Marketer i can give you answer of this question very well. Blogging can be one of the best option to earn money. But, before going in to further details let me tell you friend this is not a get rich quickly scheme. Just like any other skill it also requires time. Blogging is combination of Art and Science. It requires serious efforts, hard work and a strong willpower to learn new things. As there are many things which you might have to learn for blogging such as, Basic knowledge of HTML, Content creation or writing content marketing, SEO etc. It\u2019s a whole new journey. If you are good at handling computer then ok otherwise all these things can feel overwhelming. Let us move towards your question can you earn money with the help of blogging? So my answer is yes. Money can be made or earn money with the help of Blog. In fact there are thousands or even lakhs of bloggers who earn money via blogging by doing it full-time. There are various ways to monetise a blog. But today i am going to tell you two most popular and superpower-full ways to earn money one by one. By Taking Approval of Google Adsense- This is one of the best methods to start earning money for beginners or a newbies. The requirement is only of few things like you should have your own blog or a website, you can also monetise a blog on Blogger which is free blogging platform of Google. You have to Publish 20\u201325 unique plagiarism free articles. And those articles should be SEO friendly. Once your site gets approval for Google Adsense then you are eligible to display Advertisements on your website, so that people who will click on those ads and you can earn money. This is first methodBy doing Affiliate Marketing through your Blog- This can be another big passive income source if you do it properly. Affiliate Marketing in short is a process where you sell someone else\u2019s products or services to your website audience and if you made a sale you get a commission. There is no need to have your own product. There are three parties involved in it. A)Advertiser or Product owner company B)Affiliate means you who is going to sell that company's or person\u2019s products and C)Customer or your audience who will buy products from you. But again to become a successful affiliate Marketer you should have a strong fan following or a Audience or Traffic on your blog. To bring high traffic there is need to to serve your audience with a top quality content that can help audiences to solve their problems or increase their knowledge. If you want to learn affiliate marketing you can google it, there is huge information available on internet. Or you can also do a course on Affiliate Marketing. There are many successful affiliate Marketers available on internet who teaches affiliate Marketing at very competitive price. Its like onetime investment and lifetime benefit. So i have tried to give you honest answer to your question that too without any kind of promotion. I hope it will help you to start your blogging journey successfully. Regards ..Kailas Mistry",

If you choose to use the link I could earn a commission (even a commission of 100% would still be $0.00) Start A Money Making Blog I have written numerous answers on this platform and just about all of them could have been a blog post. And, to make money on the blog all that I\u2019d need to do is add a link to where I either provide training or customized help for a fee. Blogging is a communications tool just like a website, an email, or any other form of communicating. In the beginning of Blogs it was used by business people as a way to humanize their offers. So much advertising and promotions are: This is the greatest mouse trap ever, it makes getting rid of your rodents quicker, more efficient, less noticeable blah, blah, blah\u2026 But, then they would write a blog about how Helen down the street had just bought one of these greatest mouse traps and has now gotten rid of her husband (or any thing that related to personable experiences). Now, blogs are replacing traditional websites. At least one of the vendors of the site hosting or posting facilitators has so many add ons that it doesn\u2019t make sense not to use them.

            "answer_text": "From the first day I launched my blog, All About Self Employment, I positioned it to make money. And so can you. Here are the most common ways to make money with your blog: Sell Product. Whether you use an ecommerce plug in to add a physical product or you sell a digital product, like an ebook or a course, using your blog to drive buyers to your products is a smart way to monetize your blog.Become an Affiliate. Partnering with companies that appeal to your target audience is a great way to generate passive income while you continue to add useful content to your blog. There are a few tricks to adding affiliate ads and links to your blog, though. So, be sure to learn from the experts and take a course or two. I highly recommend Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing. The instructor of the course routinely earns over $100K/month with her blog.Advertise. Allowing search engines to place ads on your website is another popular way to make money with your blog. Be careful about where the ads are placed, though. You don\u2019t want readers to become frustrated by the ads and exit your site before they read your inspiring content.Review Products. This is similar to becoming an affiliate, but when your blog specializes in product reviews, large companies may supply you with expensive products and also pay commissions for the product sold from your blog.Sponsored Posts. If you include a media kit as part of your website, companies may reach out to you and pay you to either write a sponsored post or publish the one they have already written. If your target audience aligns with their target audience, it is worth it for companies to pay to get in front of your audience.Once you choose one or two ways to monetize your blog, take some courses, do a lot of research, talk to some experts, and dive in deeper to master those ways.

            "answer_text": "There are 5 main ways bloggers make money. These are called income streams. Each of these 5 main income streams has many possibilities too. The idea behind \u201cmaking money blogging\u201d is to start a blog to establish yourself online, then branch out. As you read through the list below, you\u2019ll notice a lot of the actual money-making doesn\u2019t happen directly on a blog. But I\u2019ll explain more in the next section. Advertising & sponsored contentAffiliate marketingDigital productsPhysical productsServices1. Advertising & sponsored content Companies want to get their product in front of potential customers. They may be interested in advertising on your blog if your readers are their ideal customers. Here are ways to incorporate advertising into your blog: Display ads \u2013 Graphics in your sidebar, header, footer or within your content. The simplest to start with is Google AdSense. Once you have more traffic, I recommend Mediavine or AdThrive.Giveaways & reviews \u2013 Companies provide you with free product (and hopefully monetary compensation) and you highlight that product on your blog.Sponsored or underwritten posts \u2013 Companies pay you to write posts mentioning them or their product.Newsletter / video / podcast sponsorships \u2013 Advertisements in emails or mini commercials in videos or podcast episodes.Advertising is easy to start, making it a popular income stream for many bloggers. However, it\u2019s not nearly as lucrative as it once was and it requires a lot of traffic to be truly profitable. Also, it runs the risk of frustrating your readers (ever been on a site only to be assaulted by the ads?) and making your site look cheap and unsophisticated. Therefore, it\u2019s not a top recommendation of mine. 2. Affiliate marketing As an affiliate marketer, you promote someone else\u2019s product or service to your readers. You link to that product or service using your unique affiliate link. When, someone clicks through that link and makes a purchase (or completes a desired action set by the company), you earn a commission. There are thousands of affiliate programs to join. Some I participate in: Self Publishing 101 \u2013 An excellent online course for people who want to make a living writing.Amazon Associates \u2013 Get paid when readers purchase Amazon products through your links.WP Engine \u2013 The host I use to run my own site.Bluehost \u2013 The host I recommend to new bloggers in this post.Amazon Influencer Program \u2013 A different Amazon program which gives you your own Amazon shop like mine here.Target \u2013 I love Target.Affiliate marketing is one of my favorite and most profitable income streams. You can highlight products or services you use and love without having to do the work of creating or maintaining that product yourself. I talk about affiliate marketing in much more depth in Affiliate Marketing: The Ultimate (Free) Guide. 3. Digital products Many bloggers create and sell their own digital products. Digital products are great because they don\u2019t require inventory and can be distributed quickly and easily. There\u2019s no overhead and low risk. Examples of digital products bloggers create: Ecourses \u2013 Teach others what you know and sell it over and over again. Example: Self Publishing 101.Online classes or workshops \u2013 Teaching, but in a live setting.Ebooks \u2013 Self publishing is very profitable for many. My first digital product was an ebook. Tell Your Time: How to Manage Your Schedule So You Can Live Free launched in 2010. It still sells every month.Premium Content \u2013 Content others must pay to access.Membership sites \u2013 A mixture of teaching and community.Photos \u2013 Many photographers sell their photos online.Audio or video \u2013 Create music jingles, voice overs or video clips.Apps, plugins or themes \u2013 Great for those who love code.4. Physical products Some bloggers sell physical products. Some examples: Books \u2013 Many bloggers have become traditionally published authors due to their blogs.Handmade Products \u2013 Are you a maker?Manufactured Products \u2013 Many bloggers find a manufacturer to make their idea a reality.Retail arbitrage \u2013 Can you find great deals? Turn around and sell them at a profit on sites like Amazon or Ebay. Example: Hustle at Home Mom.In-person conferences, classes or special events \u2013 The exchange of something tangible (money) for a ticket to an in-person experience.A surge of bloggers have started selling physical products the last few years. It can be profitable, but can get complicated with manufacturing, keeping inventory, shipping, returns, etc. Some bloggers reduce the hassle of producing physical products by dropshipping or through POD (print on demand). 5. Services Some bloggers use expertise related to their blog topic and get paid when others hire them. Services can be offered locally or virtually. Examples: Speaking \u2013 Many bloggers find speaking gigs as a result of the platforms they build on their blogs.Virtual assistance \u2013 Read my post How to Become a Virtual Assistant for my experience & lots of ideas.Freelancing \u2013 This is offering a service to clients and is similar to virtual assistance.Organizing, decorating, cooking \u2013 Some bloggers provide in-person services to their local readers.Offering a service is an excellent way to make money quickly because startup costs are low, little to no inventory is required and you get paid for a skill you already have. The downside is, it\u2019s not scalable; you only have so much time. You can only earn as much as your time allows. Put another way, you\u2019re trading time for money. How does a blog fit into those income streams exactly? Good question. It\u2019s surprising to some, but the highest earning bloggers don\u2019t make most of their money directly from their blog. Sure, they might make a little income from ads or sponsored content on their site, but for most, their blog is simply a convenient place where their content lives. Their content positions them as an authority on their topic. Then they use their authority to sell products to their readers, like books, courses or physical products. Even though most income might not come directly from a blog, having a blog is important because you can control your message and have a place where you are findable (is that word?). Also, it\u2019s the best place to build an email list. How can I start making money blogging? There are 3 main steps to get started: Start a blog. Establish yourself as an authority by creating excellent, useful content about your topic.Choose income streams related to your topic.Interact with others online to keep your blog top of mind.Goal: make your blog the go-to resource for your topic. As people visit and seek your advice, you will make money through your various income streams. Let\u2019s break this down. First, once you start your blog, focus on building a solid library of at least 10-20 blog posts. Make sure they are helpful and meaty. Remember, your goal is to become the go-to resource on your topic. In other words, make your content on the topic better than any one else\u2019s. Second, figure out which of the 5 income streams above are natural extensions of your posts. Implement them one at a time until you find the ones that work best for you. Third, build relationships on social media, in Facebook Groups and wherever your ideal readers hang out. Don\u2019t just promote your own stuff, be a helpful part of the conversation. People will eventually check out what you have to offer. Can I start a free blog and still make money? Yes. However, I would caution against it. Why? When you use a free service, you don\u2019t have as much control over your blog \u2014 the free service does. This can be risky, especially if you rely on your blog for income. A self-hosted WordPress blog is my recommendation and can be started very inexpensively. Extra tips to make money blogging Use as many income streams as you can reasonably manage. Diversification is key.Excellent content is the key to long-term success. There\u2019s no way around it.Each blogger has a different combination of income streams. There is no \u201cright\u201d way and that\u2019s the beauty of it. There are endless possibilities. Find a combination that works for you.Don\u2019t be a clone of another blogger. Find an unique angle.Successful bloggers don\u2019t start a blog just to make money. Instead, they blog about a topic they truly enjoy and can write about indefinitely. They let the money grow out of that topic organically.",

            "answer_text": "5 best ways to make money from your blog/website  Before reading this, I believe you already have a blog/website with some amount of traffic. If you do, then read on but if you don\u2019t, then you have to learn how to create a blog/website and how to gain traffic to your new blog/website. Making money from a blog is not easy for a newbie but it eventually pays off on the long run. So, you have to be patient enough before you start making good amount of money from your blog/website. You can make money from your blog/website in five (5) major ways. These five ways are best ways to make money online from your blog/website. they are as follows:1. Ad Networks: Once you have a blog with good contents and decent amount of traffic, you can register with advertising networks such as Google Adsense, Media.net, Infolinks, Revcontent, Chitika, Clicksor, Adclickmedia, etc. These ad networks will put adverts on your blog or website and you will be paid each time somebody (your blog/website visitor) clicks or views the advertisement. The highest paying and the most trusted of all the Ad networks is Google Adsensewhich is owned by Google.2. Affiliate Marketing: This is another sure way to make decent money from a blog/website. Affiliate marketing companies are companies that sells their products online and when you register with them, they will put their products on your blog/website visitors clicks on any of the products on your blog/website and buys the product (s), the affiliate marketing company will pay you a certain commission.

It is not a must that these companies or people will contact you, you can contact them and convince them to advertise their business on your blog for a certain amount and for a certain period of time. Here, you cut off the middle men (Ad networks, Affiliate networks, etc) and run the adverts directly on your blog/website. The adverts can be a text ad or banner ad.4. Selling your own Product/Services: You can sell your own products/services on your blog/website. This is a very nice way to make money online. There is hardly any successful blogger who doesn\u2019t sell something on their blog. You can sell Ebooks or physical products on your blog/website. If you have a great idea about something which satisfies a need, you can write it down, make an Ebook and sell it online on your blog. If you also have a nice service you can provide to your site visitors, you can put it up on your blog. For instance, if you know how to create a website or blog, you can display an advert on your blog/website with reference to blog or website creation. Some of your site visitors may be interested and contact you to build a website or blog for them and you can then charge them a certain fee for your service.5. Sponsored posts/Reviews: Here, you can charge companies or businesses to write posts or reviews about their products, services or businesses. This is very simple. It is like another form of advertisement. You contact these companies/people (or they contact you) to write a sponsored post or review on their products/services and you charge them a certain amount for it. It is that simple.Remember: Before you can start making decent amount of money from your blog/website, you need to be very patient (a patient dog eats the fattest bone), very determined and dedicated to the success of your blog/website. If you lack these qualities, you are more likely to give up. Reading other blogger\u2019s success story can motivate you. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming you have a blog, you will want to make sure that blog is professional. That means you own your domain and are self-hosting. STEP 1: DECIDE WHAT YOU WILL BE WRITING ABOUT Before purchasing a domain or getting started with your blog, first decide what you will be writing about. You can write about just about anything, but it\u2019s best to write about a few topics rather than cover a wide range of topics. STEP 2: CHOOSE A PLATFORM TO START BLOGGING ON To start a profitable blog you will want to get yourself geared up on the premium version of WordPress (also known as www.wordpress.org) and find a hosting company. I recommend Siteground but you will have to do a little research to figure out what is best for you and within your budget (although Siteground is very affordable). STEP 3: BEGIN BLOGGING Once your site is all set up, you will want to begin blogging. You will have to blog quality content at least once a week, but I recommend aiming for two quality blog posts per week. STEP 4: MONETIZE YOUR BLOG There are many different ways to make money blogging. If you want to start a profitable blog, there are several areas you can explore in terms of blog monetization: Sponsored postsAffiliate linksAmazon AssociatesClickBankLinkShareAdsGoogle AdsenseInfolinksChitikaMedia.netOnline storeSelling courseSelling ebooksThe best way to make money will depend on your blog and your niche. You will need to start blogging in order to determine where you will be able to make the most money. If you have a blog with tons of traffic, you could potentially make lots of money through affiliate links and sponsored posts. If you have a very loyal readership, you could make money through affiliate links and products that you sell. If you decide to go the sponsored posts link (which is where companies pay you to write posts about their products) you will need to get yourself a media kit and start pitching companies. There are tons of companies that work with bloggers - you just need to research those within your niche. You can also check out my guide to starting a profitable blog. I have a free guide to pitching companies that you can download. ",

            "answer_text": "Each of the thousands of blogs out there has a specific audience, which is why blogging is not only effective, but also a good way to make money. While the vast majority of bloggers don\u2019t make money with their blogs, the fact is it is more than possible to do so if you invest the time and energy it takes to turn a blog into a money-making project. The following are just a few tips to help you get moving on taking your blog\u2019s potential to the next level. Find a Niche The most important thing you need to do before you even get started thinking about ways to make money with your blog is to establish a niche for yourself. Making money with a blog is all about captivating an audience on a regular basis and getting as many hits as possible. As a result, you need to have an idea on your hands that will not only bring in traffic, but keep people coming back as well. In order to write a well put-together blog, you need to have a decent amount of experience and knowledge regarding the niche you choose. One way to choose a niche that might serve as effective is to make a list of the hobbies and interests you hold that you are most knowledgeable about. Going down the list, try to pinpoint what might be a good candidate for blogging material, crossing off what you don\u2019t believe will work. Work with Ad Networks The primary way to make money with a blog is through advertising. If you can advertise for a company that offers a product or service relative to the focus of your blog, you\u2019ll have a very good chance at being able to bring in money on a daily basis. There are a variety of routes to take, as you can choose between direct ad sales, selling affiliate products or ad networks such as AdSense. The best way to make money with advertising is to incorporate as much advertising into your blog as possible without it seeming like overkill. Note that there is a fine line between too much and just enough advertising, making it crucially important to pay attention to the balance of your blog at all times. Don\u2019t Give Up Easily One thing that most people who get into blogging for money don\u2019t realize is that it can take quite a while before advertising starts bringing you revenue. After all, building a reader base doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and this has a huge impact on how well your advertising will work. Don\u2019t give up too easily, as over time these techniques tend to snowball into a scenario where one can make quite a bit of money. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll look back on the slow days and laugh about how worried you were at the time. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf you have a garden and want to make money from it, the first thing you do is to make sure that your garden is beautiful enough and worthy of making money.\u201d Similarly, if you are thinking of making money from your blog make sure that you have an awesome blog with quality content that people would really want to read. For this make certain that you are writing about things that you really want to share with people. The minute you lose interest in what you are writing, it gets reflected in your work. So stay committed to your blog. Once this is done we have a variety of ways to make money from it.  ADVERTISING. One of the oldest methods to make money from the blog is to run advertisements on your blog using ad networks like Google AdSense. But if you have a considerable amount of traffic to your blog, you can easily choose to make deals with advertisers who will be now willing to pay you for reaching out to your audience. You can even write reviews of some products in your blog in exchange for money or freebies. There are plenty of ways in which you can convert your blog as a platform for advertising to make a lot of money but whatever you do understand that people still come to you for your blog. So never let the advertisers steal the charm of your blog. AFFILIATE MARKETING. As an affiliate marketer, you can make money by endorsing products on your blog. All you need is to insert the affiliate link that they provide somewhere suitable in your blog and you\u2019ll get paid for each sale that happens through this link. But again remember that your followers are your friends and therefore recommend only products that you yourselves trust. MAKE AND SELL PRODUCTS. You can also try making products related to your blog and as you have become credible now, people would love to buy your products. You could introduce physical products like books, hand-made products, and manufactured products or even digital products like e-books, online classes, e-courses etc. If you have a business, you can then use your blog to market your business, a content marketing strategy that is very effective and active currently. PAID PLANS. You also have an option to start a paid plan or a membership plan in which you provide premium contents to the members. You can charge them monthly or annually according to your wish for such plans.  You needn't concentrate on just one of the above methods. Experiment with everything or even with a combination of these and stick on to whatever suits you best. ",

Here are your income stream options: Ads (page view, PPC, etc.)Sponsored Posts: Brands reaching out to you to promote their content, usually offering to pay $X depending on the size of your audience and reach.E-store: Tapping into your reader base to then sell a product.  For example, if you blog about fashion, then you can sell your own necklaces in the store part of your website/blog.Donations: A large number of bloggers have a paypal account setup with a donation button on their site.  You'd be surprised how many people donate to their favorite content creators.And then here's how a popular blog can benefit you in the long run: Blog Leads to Job: Influential bloggers have been known to be picked up by bigger sites (Buzzfeed, Huffington Post, Business Insider, etc.) for lead roles.Salaried By the Platform: Say you're blogging for Buzzfeed, pending your influence they might put you on payroll like any other job. (I say pending influence because sites like Elite Daily have hundreds of contributing writers that get paid nothing.)Selling Your Blog: It's common for smaller, popular blogs to be eaten up by larger ones.

I\u2019m often asked how to make money blogging so want in this article to lay out some basic steps that I see most bloggers who make a living from blogging go through.  Here is how to make money from a blog: Set up your blogStart creating useful contentGet off your blog and start finding readersBuild engagement with the readers that comeStart making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streamsSounds easy doesn\u2019t it! On some levels the process is simple \u2013 but you need to know up front that there\u2019s a lot to each step and below I\u2019m going to give you some pointers on each including some further reading. Here\u2019s how to make money from a blog. 1. Start a Blog In order to make money blogging you\u2019re going to need to have a blog. While this is pretty obvious it is also a stumbling block for many PreBloggers who come to the idea of blogging with little or no technical background. If that\u2019s you \u2013 don\u2019t worry! It was my story too and most bloggers start out feeling a little overwhelmed by the process of starting their blog. If you need a little help I would highly recommend you check out my article How to Start a Blog in which I run through the steps you need to take to get up and running. It\u2019s really not as hard as you might think! Further Reading on starting a blog: How to Start a Blog 2. Start Creating Useful Content  A blog is not a blog without content so once you\u2019ve set your blog up you need to focus your attention upon creating useful content. What you choose to create will depend a little on the topic that you choose to write about (on that note, most successful bloggers have some focus to their blogging whether that be a niche or a demographic that they write for). The key with creating content is to make it as useful as possible. Focus upon creating content that changes people\u2019s lives in some way will be the type of content that people will value the most and it will help people to feel like they know, like and trust you \u2013 which is really important if you later want to make money from your blog. Further Reading on creating content: There are thousands of articles and podcast episodes on ProBlogger about how to create content. See our latest stuff in the content category on our blog and on the podcast. Also check out some of these popular articles on different aspects of creating content. 3. Get off your blog and start finding readers As you create the most useful content that you possibly can it is easy to get very insular with your focus and spend most of your time looking at building your blog. Many bloggers have a \u2018build it and they will come mentality\u2019 with their blogging but this is a bit of a trap. If you want to make money from your blog you need to not only focus upon building a great blog but it is also necessary to get off your blog and to start promoting it. There are many ways to experiment with growing your blog\u2019s audience that I\u2019ve written in previous blog posts and talked about in podcasts (I\u2019ll share some further reading and listening below) but it is important to enter into all these strategies remembering that you should not just be looking for \u2018traffic\u2019 but \u2018readers\u2019. Start by thinking carefully about the type of reader you\u2019d like to have read your blog. You might like to create an avatar of that reader (sometimes called a reader persona or profile) to help you work out who you\u2019re trying to attract. Once you know who you\u2019re hoping to have read your blog ask yourself where that type of person might already be gathering online. Begin to list where they might be gathering: Are they reading certain blogs? List the top 3Are they participating in certain forums? List the top 3Are they listening to podcasts? List the top 3Are they engaging on certain social networks? List the top 3Which accounts are they following on each of these social networks? List the top 3Each of these places that you reader might already be gathering has opportunities to develop a presence whether that be by leaving good comments, offering to create guest posts or simply by being helpful and answering questions. With this list of blogs, focus, podcasts, social media accounts in hand you will have some good spots to begin to hang out and create value. The key is to build a presence, to add value, to foster relationships \u2013 not to engage in spammy practices. 4. Build engagement with the readers that come With sustained focus upon creating great content and finding readers for your blog you\u2019ll begin to notice people visiting your blog and engaging with your content. At this point you need to switch your focus to engaging with those readers and building community. Respond to comments, reach out to those readers personally and do everything that you can to keep them coming back again and again by building a \u2018sticky blog\u2019. Look after the readers you already have well and you\u2019ll find they spread the word of your blog for you and help make your blog even more widely read. Having an engaged reader is also much easier to make money from. 5. Start making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streams OK \u2013 the first four steps of starting a blog, creating content, finding readers and building engagement with those readers are important foundations that you really do need to get in place before you\u2019ll be able to build long term income for your blog. There\u2019s no avoiding that what we\u2019ve covered is a lot of work but if you do it well you\u2019ll be setting yourself up well and giving yourself every chance of being able to make money from your blog. With these foundations in place you\u2019re now ready to start attempting to make money from your blog but you do need to be aware that just because you have set up your blog, have content and have engaged readers that the money won\u2019t just automatically flow. It takes continued work and experimentation to make money from your blog. I\u2019ve written many articles here on ProBlogger on the topic of making money blogging and will link to some suggested further reading on the topic below but let me share a few introductory words on the topic first. There are Many Ways to Make Money Blogging One of the biggest misconceptions that I see bloggers having about monetising blogs is that they have to do it in one of a handful of ways. The reality is that there are many ways to make money from blogs. A few years ago I decided to sit down and list all the ways that I saw bloggers making money from their blogs and created this \u2018money map\u2019 (click to enlarge). How to Make Money Blogging Note: this money map was updated in September 2016. As you\u2019ll see there are quite a few options that bloggers have to derive income from their blogs. Don\u2019t worry though \u2013 while this map is quite overwhelming at a first glance there are a few main \u2018clusters\u2019 of income streams that you might want to focus upon rather than all the specific ones. This is where many bloggers start. In many ways this model of making money from blogs is not dissimilar to how a magazine or newspaper sells ads. As your traffic and brand grows you\u2019ll find advertisers will be willing to pay to get exposure to your audience. While you need decent traffic to do a direct deal with an advertisers there are ad networks (like Google AdSense) that act as a middleman and enable smaller publishers to run ads on their blogs. This is where many bloggers start (I did too). 2. Affiliate Income A recent survey of ProBlogger readers found that affiliate promotions was the most common type of income that our readers have. To put it most simply \u2013 affiliate income is when you link to a product that is for sale on another site (take Amazon for example) and if someone follows your link and ends up buying that product you earn a commission on that sale. There\u2019s more to it than that but this is another great place to start with monetising your blog as affiliate programs are easy to sign up for and if you have an engaged audience you will find they follow the recommendations that you make on products. While not something most bloggers do I have noticed an increase in the number of bloggers making money by running events. These range from big conferences and events like our ProBlogger Conference which hosts hundreds of bloggers every year right down to smaller meet-ups for a blogger\u2019s readers where money is made either through charging readers to attend or by finding a sponsor for the event. Alternatively online events or summits are getting more popular. 4. Recurring Income Another growing category of income that I\u2019m seeing more and more bloggers are experimenting is recurring income streams (sometimes called continuity programs or membership programs). This is where readers pay a regular recurring amount (usually on a monthly or annual basis) for access to either premium content, a community area, some kind of service, tools, coaching (or some combination of these things). 6. Promoting a Business Many brick and mortar businesses indirectly make money from their blogs by using their blogs to grow their profile and direct readers to their business. 7. Services A common way that many bloggers make money is through offering services to their readers. These might be anything from coaching and consulting, to writing or copywriting, to design, training or other freelance services. 8. Products While I started out making money from my blogs through advertising and affiliate promotions today my #1 source of income is through selling eBooks and courses on my blogs. These \u2018virtual products\u2019 take work to create but have been lucrative for me and many other bloggers. Products can of course take many forms and income virtual information products like eBooks or courses but also other virtual products like software, reports etc. The other type of product some bloggers sell is physical products. This is most common when the blogger has a business but sometimes bloggers also create merchandise (T-shirts etc) or other physical products to sell. ",

I make good money doing this, I had no experience when I started, and in the grand scheme of life, I started making money very quickly.) So if your burning questions was \u201cis blogging REALLY profitable?\u201d the answer is a resounding YES \u2013 it sure can be!)Bogging for profit is a ton of freaking work. I know there are people out there who claim to be making a fortune in ten hours per week, but let me assure you \u2013 I am not. I work at LEAST 40 hours per week and often far more.Starting a blog for profit is kind of like that; you have to be willing to work (almost) this hard, at least at first. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I don\u2019t ever want anyone to accuse me of telling them that starting a blog would be easy money. But has all that work been worth it? Oh, you better believe it! (THIS POST PROBABLY CONTAINS AFFILIATE LINKS. OUR FULL DISCLOSURE POLICY IS REALLY BORING, BUT YOU CAN FIND IT HERE.) It\u2019s pretty easy to get sucked into the \u201cHow to start a profitable blog in 10 minutes and earn $5000 / month while you sleep!\u201d articles that you see out there. But the thing is, those articles leave out some details \u2013 they do this on purpose so that you go ahead and start your blog RIGHT NOW, without giving it any thought \u2013 so the writers can earn commission on hosting sales. Many bloggers earn so much money from hosting sales with their how to start a blog tutorial that they hardly even need to try making money anywhere else on their blog. You CAN make good money from blogging. I\u2019m making GREAT money blogging, and anyone could do it! It\u2019s just that there\u2019s a little more to it than throwing up a website and watching the cash roll in. I want you to go into blogging for a profit with your eyes open \u2013 ok? When you start a blog you shouls always blog about your industry and niche because you want to become known as the authority in your industry. You make money from a blog by monetizing it. That means if your an affiliate selling someone else\u2019s product your write about the product and then you put in a link to the product. Usually your blog is on a website and you can make money from your website by using banners to promote products. ",

I have known people who have left their full-time job, travel the world, spend time with their family, write content about their topic of expertise and in these ways make a living. Here are a few ways in which you can monetize your blog- Affiliate Marketing - It is a form of advertising in which a user is paid a certain amount (commission rate) on every lead or a sale. As a blogger, you can select which services or products you want to promote and you can promote them on your blog page. You can sign up with E-Commerce sites like Amazon and Flipkart for their affiliate marketing programme, you can choose particular products and promote them on your blog. Every time a reader buys that product you will get a certain price as a commission for recommending that product on your blog.Sponsored Posts - If you frequently write content on your blog and have a lot of readers/followers, you can approach product/service based companies/startups to advertise about their business on your blog posts. You can charge the company per word and this can be permanent advertising for companies. If your writing is good enough and you can give a good conversion rate, companies will pay you a huge amount of money for this sponsored posts.AD networks - You can join an ad network like Google Adsense and display their ads on your blog. There are a lot of ad networks available in the market, you can select the one suitable for you. The payment you receive is based on factors like Cost per Click, Cost per thousand impressions, etc.Direct Advertising - You can directly sell spaces on your blog to people who are willing to advertise their product or service on your blog. You can negotiate the rates with the advertiser and approve their advertisement if you consider the product/service suitable with your target audience. You can also create a separate page on your blog in which you can introduce yourself, talk about your blog and also display the ad charges and space.Sell your Expertise - A blog is a very good platform for selling your own expertise. One of my friends is a fashion designer and he writes about the current trends in the fashion industry. He advertises his own dress designs and he also gives online designing tutorials to other people, so he advertises that on his blog and he has received a terrific response. Apart from giving valuable information to his readers, he has also managed to sell his dress designs directly.Content is the key, write good content and do it regularly. In this way, your followers will keep on increasing which will serve as a motivation and provide you with a lot of options for monetizing your blog. ",

            "answer_text": "This really varies. Some blogs never make money, and aren\u2019t written in order to generate a profit. Other blogs can make money, but it takes work. First and foremost, you need to write about something people care about, in such a way that is engaging enough that you build a devoted readership. I can\u2019t stress this enough. There are all sorts of money-making techniques you can use (which I\u2019ll discuss shortly), but if you don\u2019t have quality copy that is optimized so it rises high enough in SERPs that people see it, success is very unlikely. Affiliate Links: Almost anyone can incorporate affiliate links into a blog. For example, if I write a blog about tea, I can sign up with Amazon Associates and mention all kinds of teas, infusers, etc. You can do this in the form of a review, for example. However, you need to be honest so that you don\u2019t lose credibility with your readership.Advertising: PPC ads/banner ads; some bloggers don\u2019t like to include them, as it makes their blog look too sales-y, but it is another possible income streamSell Your Own Content/Products: If people like your blog, they may want to buy your eBook, a white paper, etc. If you are using your blog to promote your business, they are more likely to buy your products, thus helping you to increase your company\u2019s revenue.Create a Paid Members-Only Area: This can appear on the same site as where you host your blog. For a monthly fee, people get access to exclusive content, and perhaps a forum where they can communicate with other members.So, these are just some ways you can make money blogging. If you Google \u201cHow to Make Money Blogging\u201d, you\u2019ll find even more ideas. However, your primary reason for blogging shouldn\u2019t be to make money. It should be to offer something of value to your target audience. If you focus on that, and basic SEO principles, then making it a profitable endeavor will be that much easier. Good Luck! ",

I started GoBloggingTips\u2026in mid-2014\u2026 Grew it to $300/month blog in 2015. Yes took a lot of time. I dropped out of the university in mid-2014. Now it\u2019s 2018, and I\u2019m earning a lot from GoBloggingTips (now BloggingX - rebranded to aim 10x), say mid-4-figures in dollars. And also, I have my agency and several blogs. This is my story. We recently did a poll on how much bloggers are earning money blogging in our community.  153 people participated in the poll. 60.78% of the people make less than $100 per year9.8% between $100 to $1000 per year12.42% between $1000 to $5000 per yearSo, it may mean that 83% of the people who have a blog find it hard to make enough money from it to make it a profession. It roughly follows the 80\u201320 rule: 80% of the blogging income to made by top 20% bloggers (as you saw in the first poll)80% of the income made by the top 20% is by the 4% bloggersAnd it goes onPS: Half of your success depends upon the niche you choose, don\u2019t commit the mistakes I committed earlier.

The way to do this is by creating blog articles with original content answering the questions your clients are asking you on a regular basis.  If they are asking you these questions face to face or over the phone, I guarantee they are searching these questions online.  This will bring up your site when these questions are searched. If the clients question is answered on your site, they will feel as if they are in the right place for the service they are interested in. This increases sales dramatically.     ",

So the question is then, What do I do to start making money blogging? Here\u2019s My Suggestions The first path to making money blogging is deciding what avenue you want to make money. This seems elementary but it is helpful in knowing what type of audience to build. Step 1)Picking How You Want To Make Money Do you want to make money: *Selling coaching or courses you create *Selling physical products *Through donations from places like Patreon *Affiliate Promotions *Etc Once you define the market you want to profit from you can narrow down where you will look to grow your audience. Step 2)Grow Your Audience Once you know what type of audience you want to serve find them, put solid content in front of them, and offer them a reason to become a member of your site. You can get subscribers through: *Quora (easy and quick. I add about 125 subscribers a month this way) *Guest Posting on other blogs and sites *Social Media Promotion to relevant groups *Appearing on podcasts *Speaking at summits *Etc If you want this to be effective only put the best responses/content/thinking you have out there. Don\u2019t put listicle markety crap out there. Be specific, give advice they can use that you know works, and develop personality so they can like \u2018you\u2019 as a blogger. Step 3)Develop relationships with influencers This is huge. You need to get your foot in the door with the right people. The easiest way to do this is: -Be a fan -Sign up for their mailing list -Use their advice and get results from it -Offer a testimonial that explains the results you got from it to the blogger -Constantly add value to them These relationships can lead to you getting introduced to new bloggers and leaders who can help you. This will grow your social influence, reach, and list at 10X the speed you can manually. Step 4)Sale This is where you can profit from your blog. The biggest question here is, \u2018How soon can I start selling?\u2019 It depends. Michelle Schroeder of Making Sense of Cents started quickly and scaled up in a couple years to nearly a million a year. The answer lies in your objective. Is your blog going to be an ongoing business or do you want it to be extra cash you can spend? You also have to look at the profitability of the avenue you choose. Affiliates can put up new links as you fit your needs. Courses can be launched evergreen, quarterly, etc. Coaching you can limit access to every month. I suggest building for at least a year. This way you can develop relationships with influencers, your list, and deliver value before delivering value tied to cost.

Here are the basics you must understand before we move further: Young people making a full time income with their blog\u2026 They didn\u2019t start writing to make money - Crazy! They are in because\u2026They love writingThey want to share their knowledgeThey are improving day after dayIf you\u2019re in to make a quick buck, don\u2019t start a blog.Everyone using adblock these days. You aren\u2019t making money by showing ads on your website. You must have your OWN products! Or selling someone else\u2019s productsDon\u2019t expect to make money during your first year. It\u2019s not going to happen.No more blahblah, let\u2019s dive into the action! The only way you can make money on your blog these days is you creating a product. Most people are busy creating \u201cmastermind courses\u201d, you know the typical 997$ product on how to sell 997$ products. Well, I believe this isn\u2019t the road we should take. Instead of creating a product people buy once\u2026 Why don\u2019t you build a membership website? Instead of selling a 59$ fat loss guide. You sell a 19$ membership to your fat loss program. Updated every month - or week - so it\u2019s wroth the deal. And because you are showing the content to many different people, you can actually get away with it fairly easily. Always write the program one month in advance, and you won\u2019t have any problem using this strategy. It\u2019s about the long term. Not the short term. Now, if you still can\u2019t make money on the internet. This is probably the belief stopping you from achieving this goal. ",

            "answer_text": "200 Daily Visitors per day mean you roughly get 6000 visitors per month or so. My rough estimation is that you would get around 10,000 pageviews per month so let's take a look at some available options. First up you should apply for Adsense which has around 2 Million Publishers and trusted worldwide. Also if you are also interested in offering space for native advertising then apply for Buysell Ads too. To earn the maximum amount of money from these ads is to position them around the site strategically. Target places where you will get around maximum impressions, click throughs with less disturbance to real content of the site. If you are interested in contextual ads then try out Infolinks too. Secondly, you are blogging about a specific niche then that would most likely have some products that you could recommend to people, well that's where Affiliate Advertising comes in. Make an account on Amazon Associates or Ebay Partner Program etc and start displaying ads and giving people referral links to increase their sales. You get around 10% commission on that. This one is relatively tricky and would require either a high volume of traffic or a group of people that really trust you and are willing to spend. You could also ask a local E-commerce Retailer if your blog is about local products and targetting only one country. Thirdly, you could do paid reviews for Manufacturers, Developers and so on. Same goes for sponsored posts too, There are bloggers who allow that too. Fourthly, is Paid Video Courses, Premium Memberships for awesome content. If you have cool content that can help out your readers, then you should try this out too.  And finally, you could offer services to your readers in setting up their relevant products in the niche you specialize. Like you are a great webmaster and blogger, you could help people in building up there own websites and more. There are many other ways too but these are the ones that come to my mind for now. Hope this helps a bit :) ",

Think about the place where people swarmed, either it's TV show, sports events, urban market, they all have the same buying/acting intention. Let say if a person can bring average profits of $20, how much do you think with 1000 of people? Yep, there where the money lies, calculated and shared between the publishers and the advertisers.

And I stopped it after 2 months because I wanted instant results at those times\u2026THIS WAS MY BIG MISTAKE. If I continued \u2026I would make thousands of dollars every month now. We need to learn the blogging first. And.. We need to deliver best content and start developing step by step. It takes around 6 to 8 months to make a best monetized blog if you spend atleast 4 to 5 hours day. You need 10K rupees in pocket, good internet connection, a personal laptop /pc. And never ever spend your whole time on these blogging. Because social media always comes to secondary. Do your own job, and make your primary income source and make free time of 4 hours every day and start developing it (you need to sacrifice your sleeping hours) Once you started making money from your blog constantly then you can leave your primary job. On blogging : we can make money through\u2026advertising, product selling, affiliate or even raising funds (if your content is really touching to readers heart and something useful for them) One of my friends is making around 8 Lakh rupees / month on blogging and digital marketing. He worked more than a year. And I am sure if we spend our Time on developing it\u2026it definitely pays you back . Remember, don't spend all your time on it.. You will get nothing. Make your primary income source + and start developing a best blog. Before all these, you need to spend to learn about BLOGGING in a right way. (It takes around at least 1 month to learn) and I am sure, in your journey you will learn many more things while developing it. Never expect instant result.. If you need lifetime earnings, you need to spend at least few months without expecting anything. ",

            "answer_text": "I built (and sold) a large technology blog that, at its peak, was driving more than half a million monthly readers and paying my bills.  What revenue sources you go with will depend on the type of blog you want to build. Here are some possibilities: Advertising: If you can attract an audience, you can monetize that audience with advertising. The online advertising industry is in a weird transitional state right now, so you'll want to do your research to make sure you know what you're getting into. The stereotypical banner / text link ads aren't nearly as effective as they once were, so the real upside is going to come from direct partnerships with brands. This video from Gary Vaynerchuk is an oldie but goodie that you'll definitely want to take a look at: Making advertising work for you requires that you look at the relationships not as you trying to monetize your blog, but as your clients trying to reach their marketing goals. How can you help them? Affiliate marketing: This phrase has become synonymous with the sleazy Internet-marketing guys who withdraw their life savings in Benjamins, take an Instagram pic, and put it back in the bank. You know the ones I'm talking about. But it doesn't have to be sleazy. Affiliate marketing, with the proper disclosure and transparency, can be an honest, lucrative way to simultaneously provide value to your audience and build a business around your content. Just be sure to use your best judgement and make yourself aware of the applicable laws in your area. Create a product and sell it. Once you have an audience, figure out what they desperately need and sell it to them. Be careful not to half-ass anything, though\u2014this is your reputation and your legacy, so make it count.Use your blog as an engine to drive your main business forward. In the vast majority of cases, a blog is not a business in and of itself. But if you have a business selling widgets, for example, you can use a blog to become the authority on all things widget-related. It's called content marketing, and if you do it right\u2014by providing epic value to your target market\u2014it will propel your brand and sell your products.Other opportunities: As Nicolas Cole mentioned in his answer, often by simply blogging your heart out you will come across other, more fruitful opportunities where you can profit indirectly from your blog. Blogging is a great way to showcase your expertise, and if you're looking for a job, it can really set you apart from the crowd.",

            "answer_text": "I totally understand your question because I experience the same thing in my blog. The real problem with blogging is you don\u2019t get results until around 6 to 18 months. Regardless of whether you use Google, Facebook, Quora, or link outreaching to build your credibility and traffic, they all take TIME to bear fruit. Take a flywheel for example. Getting it to roll takes a lot of work and push to make its first few turns. But eventually, if you continue to sustain your efforts, it will speed up really fast with less work. The same principle applies to blogging. A word of advice: If you plan to pursue blogging, make sure you\u2019re willing to delay gratification for about 6 to 18 months until you start acquiring a steady stream of traffic, which you can then convert to sales. And one more thing, attend the right Internet marketing training so you won\u2019t waste your precious time on the Internet. Go to real experts for advice. How to know if he\u2019s real? He understands the hardships because he experienced it himself. But the most important thing, you must take consistent action. You can watch the best training out there, but if you don\u2019t take the right amounts of sustained effort, no progress will happen. That\u2019s all the advice I can give.

            "answer_text": "There are several ways to make money using blogs. Here, let me share with you what works best for me - affiliate marketing. Assuming you have not started anything yet and you are totally new to the world of blogging, let me run through with you the process of building a website that generates revenue. Before you earn money, you are going to first be focusing on creating your niche website and the working to get traffic to your website. Without a website, without content, and without traffic, the MONEY doesn't happen. Task #1: Understand the Make Money Process There are MANY different ways that you can earn money online and many different ways in which you can build an entire business. My preferred way is affiliate marketing - an automated (not fully) niche site that generate revenue.  There are more than three billion internet users (the audience) and these people are looking (searching) for things all the time. They are looking for information and to buy products. That is where you are going to come in with your website and help these \"audiences\" by offering them information about what they are looking. You will be helping these people and earning revenue in the process. Task #2: Finding Your Niche Your online business should not feel like a day job. Earning money online should be fun, and it is fun. This all starts with choosing a niche that you are interested in and will enjoy working with. The more you enjoy doing something the less it feels like a job and the more productive you are going to be. Your niche could be anything, but at the core of your niche selection it should be something that you \"like\". Something you enjoy. Something you can talk about. Something you want to learn about. Further reading: Hot and Trending Niches and Ideas for Affiliate Marketing In the simplest form, a niche is really a group of people looking for stuff. When you select your niche, you want to avoid being too broad with your niche selection. What people fail to understand is the fact that there are millions of people looking for stuff online within what seems to be the smallest of niches, but they really are not. A few things that you should understand about niches are: (1) You are going to be writing content within your niche(2) You are going to be communicating within your niche(3) You are going to be choosing products to promote within your niche(4) You need to enjoy helping people within you niche.(5) Your first niche PROBABLY won't be your last (so don't worry about it being perfect)(6) Any niche can become a \"full time\" successful business Task #3: Build Your Website Having your own domain name is ideal and gives you a huge competitive advantage when it comes to succeeding online. For example, if you owned your own domain it would look something like this... yourwebsite.com For example, if your niche was \"Macbook Air Cases\", your domain name would be: macbookaircases.com And your website name would be: Macbook Air Cases You can use WordPress blog and host it on Bluehost. Task #4: Finding Ideas from Keywords You have likely heard the term \"keyword research\". This is the act of finding keyword phrases that are relevant to your niche and deciding whether or not it is appropriate to build content around that particular keyword. This is going to be the \u201croot\u201d of all your search engine optimization success, so we are going to be tackling keywords here before we get into creating content. A keyword is simply a word or phrase that people search for in the search engines. Every time you do a google search you are entering a \"keyword\" into the search box. Ultimately, the goal of your keyword research is to find keywords that you can get rankings in Google, Yahoo, and Bing with, all while attracting a relevant audience. You will be using the keywords that you find in this lesson to build content around. This will lead you to search engine rankings and traffic to your website! Each page you create will be targeting a keyword... 100 pages targeted 100 keywords = 100 potential Google rankings. This can and will lead to mass amounts of traffic and those that follow along with this training are going to see their traffic continue to go up with every \"keyword targeted\" page or post that they create on their website.  Remember, Google and other search engines are around because of CONTENT and if you can deliver quality content (that targets low competition keywords), you will be able to get great rankings! The simplest way to do it is through Alphabet Soup Technique - Using Google Instant to Find Keywords. Well, it\u2019s a simple technique that you can use with a little help from Google. Actually, we\u2019ll be using the Google Instant feature that occurs automatically when searching for anything using the Google Search Bar. Have you every noticed that when you place a subject or question in Google search, that Google automatically populates your search menu with similar or related searches that you\u2019re looking for? For example, I type in \u201close body fat\u201d into the Google\u2019s search bar. Google Instant will automatically populate my search with the top search results that are similar to my keyword or keyword phrase. The way the Alphabet Soup Technique works is by.. 1.) Take your blog post topic or keywords that you would like to investigate, and put it into the Google search bar. 2.) Then add the letters of the alphabet, one at a time, and see what is actively being searched for on Google. You can also add a letter and go through the alphabet at the beginning of your keywords to see what Google Instant comes up with. Or you can use a question at the beginning of your keyword phrase starting with.. WhoHowWhatWhenor WhereThen you will see a whole new series of keyword phrases that you can potentially use as keywords for your next post on your website. Task #5: Create Quality Content Content is going to be the \"meat\" of your site. Content will be the difference between getting lots of traffic becoming an authoritative site, and you not seeing much in the way of results. Plain and simple, content leads to rankings in search engines and rankings are going to lead to your website traffic and revenue! Google, BING, & Yahoo LOVE Content! These are the top 3 search engines and make up over 98% of searches online. Want to know how you can leverage these search engines and get mad traffic to your site? The answer is: Quality content. The most important aspect of any content, whether it is text or video is that it is created with the reader in mind. Real people are reading this content so you want to deliver something that is relevant and interesting. When writing content you want to keep in mind that you are writing it for people, not just for Search Engines :) Being original, candid, and building your personal brand is the best way to succeed within any niche, so please make sure you do put some effort into creating your own content. There is nothing wrong with getting some concepts or ideas from elsewhere to incorporate in your page as this will save you time. Refrain however, from copying and pasting other people's work as you will lose ANY chance of ranking if you have duplicate content on your site. People are going to be navigating on our website, they are going to be reading our content, and they are going to be buying from us based on our recommendations. They are going to be engaging in discussions, they are going to be sharing our content on social networks, and they are going to be trusting us and our brand. Don\u2019t lose sight of this, I see it all the time where people get so lost in the process of what they are doing that they dehumanize their website to the point where no visitor would get any value. It is all about the EXPERIENCE you create.  Task #6: Find Affiliate Programs to Promote Google \u2013 the easiest way to identify relevant affiliate programs, simply insert your keywords into the search engine and you may find products that suit your niche.AdSense Ads \u2013 many of the AdSense ads appearing beside Google search results, someone's blog, and even on your own blog are likely to be products with affiliate programs attached. It is sometimes worth checking out the ads (don't click the ads on your own blogs, you will be penalized) to find out the potential affiliate partners. Very often, you will be surprised to find some great affiliate programs that you might not know.Affiliate networks \u2013 there are quite a few affiliate networks around that list many affiliate programs. Most of these have search functions to allow you to type in keywords and find promotions relevant to your niche. Check out MarketLeverage, Clickbank, and Commission Junction.TIPS: I agree it is not easy to stand out on the market as there are millions of bloggers out there. However, it is still possible for a newbie to make a sustainable income online by choosing the right niche. Alex Founder of ManagingYourFinance.Com ",

I\u2019m often asked how to make money blogging so want in this article to lay out some basic steps that I see most bloggers who make a living from blogging go through. Here is how to make money from a blog: Set up your blogStart creating useful contentGet off your blog and start finding readersBuild engagement with the readers that comeStart making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streamsSounds easy doesn\u2019t it! On some levels the process is simple \u2013 but you need to know up front that there\u2019s a lot to each step and below I\u2019m going to give you some pointers on each including some further reading. Here\u2019s how to make money from a blog. 1. Start a Blog In order to make money blogging you\u2019re going to need to have a blog. While this is pretty obvious it is also a stumbling block for many PreBloggers who come to the idea of blogging with little or no technical background. If that\u2019s you \u2013 don\u2019t worry! It was my story too and most bloggers start out feeling a little overwhelmed by the process of starting their blog. If you need a little help I would highly recommend you check out my article How to Start a Blog in which I run through the steps you need to take to get up and running. It\u2019s really not as hard as you might think! Further Reading on starting a blog: How to Start a Blog 2. Start Creating Useful Content A blog is not a blog without content so once you\u2019ve set your blog up you need to focus your attention upon creating useful content. What you choose to create will depend a little on the topic that you choose to write about (on that note, most successful bloggers have some focus to their blogging whether that be a niche or a demographic that they write for). The key with creating content is to make it as useful as possible. Focus upon creating content that changes people\u2019s lives in some way will be the type of content that people will value the most and it will help people to feel like they know, like and trust you \u2013 which is really important if you later want to make money from your blog. Further Reading on creating content: There are thousands of articles and podcast episodes on ProBlogger about how to create content. See our latest stuff in the content category on our blog and on the podcast. Also check out some of these popular articles on different aspects of creating content.

(Hint: The Answer Might Surprise You)21 Ways to Write Posts that Are Guaranteed to Grow Your Blog10 Ways to Switch Your Brain to Writing Mode When Working From Home3. Get off your blog and start finding readers As you create the most useful content that you possibly can it is easy to get very insular with your focus and spend most of your time looking at building your blog. Many bloggers have a \u2018build it and they will come mentality\u2019 with their blogging but this is a bit of a trap. If you want to make money from your blog you need to not only focus upon building a great blog but it is also necessary to get off your blog and to start promoting it. There are many ways to experiment with growing your blog\u2019s audience that I\u2019ve written in previous blog posts and talked about in podcasts (I\u2019ll share some further reading and listening below) but it is important to enter into all these strategies remembering that you should not just be looking for \u2018traffic\u2019 but \u2018readers\u2019. Start by thinking carefully about the type of reader you\u2019d like to have read your blog. You might like to create an avatar of that reader (sometimes called a reader persona or profile) to help you work out who you\u2019re trying to attract. Once you know who you\u2019re hoping to have read your blog ask yourself where that type of person might already be gathering online. Begin to list where they might be gathering: Are they reading certain blogs? List the top 3Are they participating in certain forums? List the top 3Are they listening to podcasts? List the top 3Are they engaging on certain social networks? List the top 3Which accounts are they following on each of these social networks? List the top 3Each of these places that you reader might already be gathering has opportunities to develop a presence whether that be by leaving good comments, offering to create guest posts or simply by being helpful and answering questions. With this list of blogs, focus, podcasts, social media accounts in hand you will have some good spots to begin to hang out and create value. The key is to build a presence, to add value, to foster relationships \u2013 not to engage in spammy practices.

Build engagement with the readers that come With sustained focus upon creating great content and finding readers for your blog you\u2019ll begin to notice people visiting your blog and engaging with your content. At this point you need to switch your focus to engaging with those readers and building community. Respond to comments, reach out to those readers personally and do everything that you can to keep them coming back again and again by building a \u2018sticky blog\u2019. Look after the readers you already have well and you\u2019ll find they spread the word of your blog for you and help make your blog even more widely read. Having an engaged reader is also much easier to make money from.

Start making money from the readership you have through one or more of a variety of income streams OK \u2013 the first four steps of starting a blog, creating content, finding readers and building engagement with those readers are important foundations that you really do need to get in place before you\u2019ll be able to build long term income for your blog. There\u2019s no avoiding that what we\u2019ve covered is a lot of work but if you do it well you\u2019ll be setting yourself up well and giving yourself every chance of being able to make money from your blog. With these foundations in place you\u2019re now ready to start attempting to make money from your blog but you do need to be aware that just because you have set up your blog, have content and have engaged readers that the money won\u2019t just automatically flow. It takes continued work and experimentation to make money from your blog. I\u2019ve written many articles here on ProBlogger on the topic of making money blogging and will link to some suggested further reading on the topic below but let me share a few introductory words on the topic first. There are Many Ways to Make Money Blogging One of the biggest misconceptions that I see bloggers having about monetising blogs is that they have to do it in one of a handful of ways. The reality is that there are many ways to make money from blogs. As you\u2019ll see there are quite a few options that bloggers have to derive income from their blogs. Don\u2019t worry though \u2013 while this map is quite overwhelming at a first glance there are a few main \u2018clusters\u2019 of income streams that you might want to focus upon rather than all the specific ones. 1. Advertising Income This is where many bloggers start. In many ways this model of making money from blogs is not dissimilar to how a magazine or newspaper sells ads. As your traffic and brand grows you\u2019ll find advertisers will be willing to pay to get exposure to your audience. While you need decent traffic to do a direct deal with an advertisers there are ad networks (like Google AdSense) that act as a middleman and enable smaller publishers to run ads on their blogs. This is where many bloggers start (I did too). 2. Affiliate Income A recent survey of ProBlogger readers found that affiliate promotions was the most common type of income that our readers have. To put it most simply \u2013 affiliate income is when you link to a product that is for sale on another site (take Amazon for example) and if someone follows your link and ends up buying that product you earn a commission on that sale. There\u2019s more to it than that but this is another great place to start with monetising your blog as affiliate programs are easy to sign up for and if you have an engaged audience you will find they follow the recommendations that you make on products. Further reading on affiliate income: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money with the Amazon Affiliate Program10 Popular Affiliate Programs for Small and Medium Sized Blogs3. Events While not something most bloggers do I have noticed an increase in the number of bloggers making money by running events. These range from big conferences and events like our ProBlogger Conference which hosts hundreds of bloggers every year right down to smaller meet-ups for a blogger\u2019s readers where money is made either through charging readers to attend or by finding a sponsor for the event. Alternatively online events or summits are getting more popular. 4. Recurring Income Another growing category of income that I\u2019m seeing more and more bloggers are experimenting is recurring income streams (sometimes called continuity programs or membership programs). This is where readers pay a regular recurring amount (usually on a monthly or annual basis) for access to either premium content, a community area, some kind of service, tools, coaching (or some combination of these things). 6. Promoting a Business Many brick and mortar businesses indirectly make money from their blogs by using their blogs to grow their profile and direct readers to their business. 7. Services A common way that many bloggers make money is through offering services to their readers. These might be anything from coaching and consulting, to writing or copywriting, to design, training or other freelance services. 8. Products While I started out making money from my blogs through advertising and affiliate promotions today my #1 source of income is through selling eBooks and courses on my blogs. These \u2018virtual products\u2019 take work to create but have been lucrative for me and many other bloggers. Products can of course take many forms and income virtual information products like eBooks or courses but also other virtual products like software, reports etc. The other type of product some bloggers sell is physical products. This is most common when the blogger has a business but sometimes bloggers also create merchandise (T-shirts etc) or other physical products to sell. Other Income Streams There are of course other forms of income that bloggers experiment with. Some include asking for donations, syndicating content to other sites and lastly selling their blogs. Multiple Income Streams Most full time bloggers make money more than one way and end up with multiple income streams. Diversifying your income in this way not only is smart and helps you spread the risk from having all your eggs in one basket but it also speeds up the journey to going full time. I learned this lesson the hard way after having most of my income coming from one source in the early days but after a bit of a bad experience began to diversify my income streams (read about that here) \u2013 it was one of the best things I ever did! Today I make money from around 12 different streams.  This didn\u2019t just happen overnight though \u2013 read about how I added them one at a time here. Update: I more recently reported on how I made money blogging in this income report. Direct or Indirect Income? One last little distinction in terms of income streams\u2026. Some bloggers make money directly \u2018from\u2019 their blog while others make money indirectly \u2018because\u2019 of their blog. Direct Income \u2013 when I started making money from my blogs it was through \u2018direct\u2019 income streams. I put AdSense ads on my blog and promoted some products on Amazon as an affiliate and the more readers I had the more income began to trickle in (it really was a trickle at first). In time as my traffic grew this income grew and I was also able to experiment with other direct forms of income such as selling advertising directly to advertisers. Indirect Income \u2013 later on in my blogging journey opportunity has come for \u2018indirect\u2019 income streams. As my blogs and profile grew as a result of my blogging I was able to sell my services as a speaker and consultant and was offered the opportunity to author a book with the publisher Wiley. Later I was able to start an event for bloggers which also made money. None of this income came directly from the blog \u2013 but rather it came \u2018because\u2019 of my blog. While the way that I make money blogging is a combination of direct and indirect income many bloggers focus upon one or the other.

Essentially, you get paid a small amount if someone clicks on an ad you put on your website.Affiliate Marketing: this is a great way to monetize your blog. You join an affiliate program related to your niche, then embed links to the products/services offered by your affiliate program in your blog posts. Affiliate programs often pay a commission on each item sold/referral to their service. It can be very lucrative. The key is targeted traffic. You need to find programs that your audience is interested in. You can also rank for keywords related to your affiliate programs in search engines. This requires keyword research and a basic SEO knowledge.You can sell your own products. Make a product that is usfeul to your audience. Develop a training system that you sell. Package information in e-books . You take home a huge percentage of each product you sell, because it\u2019s your product.I made $220,000 in 2016 off of 36,000 visitors to my rideshare blog, this was entirely through affiliate marketing.

There are also a number of ways to make money from them. Big business has become invested in them. For advertisers, the bigger blogs are basically \u201cmini communities\u201d that provide them with targeted buyers. This is why you see ads on all of the celebrity gossip blogs and stuff. Interestingly enough, though, this is also why all of the major and smaller brands (that create both physical and digital products) are part of affiliate networks and have affiliate programs. The job of an affiliate marketer is basically to promote a company\u2019s products or services to the masses. The reason companies are willing to pay us is because we save them money on advertising costs. When we promote their products, they don\u2019t have to. Plus, whenever an affiliate makes a sale, the person that purchases a product from us still gets up on the advertiser\u2019s list, so they can promote future products and services to them. Besides all of this, there are entire company\u2019s that don\u2019t do anything but create products and services for marketers to use to promote things online. Amazon is the world\u2019s largest online retailer, and it does BILLIONS of dollars per year! It\u2019s safe to say that blogging and making money online is here to stay.

When someone clicks those ads, Google pays you. The pay per click varies from niche to niche. Gambling niche may pay out more, programming niches may pay less. For Adsense to work for you, you need to have lot of traffic. Because without visitors to your site, who will come and click? An Amazon affiliate site lets you promote products that are sold on Amazon on your website. You write a review about a product, do link building and when a visitor clicks on a product from your site and lands on Amazon and buys something(any product), you get a commission. This can range from 3\u20138% of the product price. Building an Amazon affiliate site is easier compared to building a pure Adsense niche site. ",

Lastly and most importantlyoc, you need to be patient to get approval.Your blog should get regular and enough traffic to generate clicks on Ads to get money.You should remember that , for earning money you need to have large traffic base everyday and large number of clicks because one click fetch you very little or negligible amount of money (depending on the clicks from different locations).So don\u2019t think that you will become rich overnight or in a day or week.

            "answer_text": "Simply: good, relevent content for the best relevent readers. The other extra readers or followers are a bonus. Use your networks - social, professional, family and friends. Clients too if you have them. It's the numbers you have of people accessing your blog which makes your blog a potential moneymaker. The focus of and the quality of your blog must attract regular, repeat readers. Give your readers the opportunity to interact with your blog, to contribute via comments, surveys and direct questions that invite a response. Manage all interaction with your blog as though it were part of job and responsibility as a credible blogger. In short, learn more from your readers than to do from yourself. Include images, add quotes with links to the sources of them. (Give credit where credit is due all of the time) The same applies to video links that may or may not be your own productions. Collaborate with other SUITABLE bloggers. Explore together and share together, but not with another blogger who does and focuses exactly on the same angle as you. You must both of all of you contribute something different or differently from one another. Otherwise you are each trying to duplicate just one blog for sharing. Don't lose the identity of YOUR blog. Your blog is you. As for monetising your blog, think local. Human face to face contact involves time and money on your part to realise a shared objective between you with your blog and a potential supporter, sponsor, or advertiser. Analyse those potentials before you contact them. Think of them as being much busier than you! So have a 30 second presentation of what you and your blog are about, a two minute presentation of the same. At the same time, learn from the failure of you presentations: Learn to develope your anticipation of the questions potentials are going to ask following your presentation. If you don't, they'll ask, and if you don't have the answer enough times, it's the perfect reason for them to say no to you. ALWAYS follow up with thanks for their giving you the time to approach them. And again after the face to face. If an approach fails, find out why because they initially gave you time. So you must have done something right to get it. Discover why you weren't able to capitalise on that opportunity. Failure has its rewards in the future. Others here will advise you about programmes, apps and systems. However, in all respects interpersonal skills should not be underestimated. Not even in this technological phase of communicating. People are always people and they have emotions that influence their impressions and the decisions they make. Finally, an important question that all new, and potentially great bloggers ask themselves is, How much do I ask for? The simple answer is that time is money. So, the minimum amount is to cover any of your financial expenses involved with the entire development of your blog. The next phase will be to cover the cost of your time involved in the maintainence of your blog. At some point you will have a credible history of the development of your blog and its achievements, milestones and what you have better in mind for its future; and the future of your new potentials. Your blogs future is its history of progress. Enjoy tangable, demonstratable progress related to the great effort you put into your blog. And good luck, which is another invaluable ingredient to your success. I hope that helps in some small way. ",

OR You can start your own website by purchasing domain name and web hosting. You can also start a free website but remember free websites are not legitimate enough for people to trust your site. Now about the money part on your website: If you start getting enough traffic then you can apply for Google Adsense which would place ads on your site and pays you for per click.Once you reach $100, you can withdraw the amount directly to your account.(Don't ever try to cheat Google by clicking on your own ads, they would ban you from their servers) Secondly, you can affiliate with sites like Amazon and Flipkart and let them place their links on your site, if anyone who clicks your link and purchase an item on your referral link, you would get a commission. But remember \u201cContent is the King.\u201d Anyone would only like to view your posts if their quality is good enough.And you should be thorough with your niche so you can answer the questions put up by the viewers.This would ensure them coming back again and again.

Blogs are a fantastic way to make money because of the following that you create. People are interested in your voice, that\u2019s why they read your blog. They\u2019re interested in your opinions on whatever niche the blog is in, so any time you recommend something to do or a product, chances are, the readers will like it too. For example, if your blog is travelling, you could find affiliate programs that are traveling based, maybe find offers for affiliates and things of that nature. You can always contact companies too, if you have a decent sized following, and ask them if you can be their affiliate. Companies will most of the time say yes, because it benefits them to have you, as much as it does for you to have them. I also recommend checking out Google Ads to look into putting ads in your blog. The key here is to not be too \u201cspammy\u201d with your ads, otherwise it devalues your whole website and viewers won\u2019t appreciate it. Concentrate on ads that will benefit your viewers. You can contact companies for ad space as well and charge them pay per click. If you have a wide following, companies most likely will contact you as well for ad space and to be an affiliate. Cheers.

There are many of them now a days and the most popular among them is Google Ad-sense. For second source of income, you can get sponsors. Sponsors might be a college, or a coaching institute. It might be any other institutional body as well which will get benefit if they advertise on your site. The third source of income you can generate through your blogs is through affiliate marketing.

            "answer_text": "Here are my best tips on maximizing your profits for each blog post. Do Your Research - Find out what blog topics are working for other people and write posts that meet those interests as well as topics that you think would work well. Do your research so your post will be filled with the most helpful tips, and do some testing on your own so you have original content to share.Write In Depth - Short posts don\u2019t work well most of the time. People want one-stop-shopping for all the information they need, and Google tends to rank post with 2,000+ words at the top of the search results most often.Create Products - Rather than writing blog posts to earn affiliate income all the time - as most bloggers do, create your own products. You\u2019ll be earning 100% of the profits, rather than sharing them with other people.Market - Your job is only 50% complete when you click \u201cPublish.\u201d The other 50% is marketing. Share your post in as many places as your can. Create multiple Pinterest pins for each post. If people don\u2019t respond to the first pin, they might to the next. I created 10 pins for a post that I was sure was going to be a winner. Social shares when through the roof, and Pinterest set me an email reporting the substantial success of two of them - 22K shares in about a week!I created 10 pins by changing the colors, designs, and slightly varying titles. Then I posted the pins over the next week to Pinterest. As I post them, I also scheduled them with the TrafficWonker Pinterest pin scheduler. Today that post has 2.5 social shares!

If it is about your business, then you can generate leads and have more customers to buy your products or services, hence making you more money. Most businesses rely on blogging to get at least 80% of their customers. Blogs make money also from affiliate programs. You can put affiliate links from Commission Junction (CJ), Amazon Associates, ShareAsale, etc on your blog and make money with every conversion from your blog. Blogs also make money from showing ads. You can directly charge companies/businesses to put ads on your blog or sign up with Ads Networks like Google Adsense, InfoLinks, Media.net, etc. As your blog visitors see these ads and click on them, you make money. The more traffic you have, the more you are likely to make. Here is how you can start a money-making blog that generates $10,000 monthly. ",

Blogging for money has become like so many other creative or publishing endeavors, in which a few big winners make money, but most are just dreaming.

            "answer_text": "There is no time stamp: focus + effort = $. One needs to build an audience. If primarily resorting to free blogging methods, it might take years before seeing meaningful results if you don\u2019t work at it. It will require constant focus and time commitment to the blog, social media and building significant back links to rank and attract a larger audience. SEO One needs to focus on their niche audience and not run to far astray. Blogs should be targeted to a niche keyword so that Google search engine will identify that keyword to your blog article for SEO. In other words, so the blog content is search engine optimized. Social Media One needs to repost blog content to social media platforms, use hashtags and be on top of the social media networks for that niche. Recently I came across a study showing that Instagram got 58 times the engagement of Facebook by using winning hashtags. That stat surprised me. The idea was to copy and paste those winning hashtags that had significant audiences akin to their niche and into their campaigns. Monetization One makes money by promoting affiliate programs or a content course that one has created as well as AdSense. One can try to promote an affiliate program via a cost per click or cost per impression to see if that affiliate offer converts. Unless you\u2019re skilled in this, I don\u2019t recommend it unless you have a big budget since there is a bit of a learning curve. Email Capture: One can create an email capture page for that offer and follow up visitors with a non-ending autoresponder series to other affiliate offers. Within the autoresponder, one can offer unique, high-quality helpful visitor information and even direct attention to something helpful within your blog. Collecting subscribers is a way for building your customer base and enriching their experience with your blog content. ",

            "answer_text": "Bloggers use a number of different techniques to monetize their websites. Here are a few examples;  1). Advertisement Bloggers place advertisements on their blogs. Although revenue per click is very low, if your blog generates a substantial amount of traffic it can be very profitable. However, with too many ads you risk annoying your users. 2). Affiliate Marketing This is where you refer the user to a product from a third party, such as Amazon. If the user purchases the recommended product you receive a small percentage of the revenue. This is in my opinion one of the most profitable techniques, especially if you can recommend high price items. 3). Offering a Service If users are getting value from your work then why not charge additional services out. Many bloggers turn into paid consultants on their niche. If you have a solid loyal user base then why not offer additional content for a cut. There is no clear winner in terms of monetization strategy, what method works best is unique to the blog. Often blogs will implement multiple monetization strategies and that can be valuable. What is important is you do not spam your users with monetization, build a user base based on quality information and then slowly implement monetization. You will earn nothing without respecting your audience. Hope that helps. I am happy to answer any additional questions you may have. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the request to answer: How lucrative can blogging be? I\u2019m not sure this is the best way to ask this question. The simple answer is with a blog you can make millions, but equally it can leave you out-of-pocket once you have paid for your web hosting and domain name along with all the extra\u2019s that creep in. The real question is how do you make real money from blogging. There are many blogs, course and big ideas out there. But the simple truth is you also need to have some luck on your side. A second blogger can replicate all the actions taken by a successful blogger. But if their content is not as engaging, their images not as enticing, or they don\u2019t hit the right niche at the right time they will not have the same level of success. I am not trying to put you off blogging; I love my blog. I am just trying to keep it real. This is my approximation of the success of blogs (not based on any hard data because there isn\u2019t a lot out there). Less that 5% make millions. About 20% make a living. So that leaves about 40% making pocket money of some sort. The final 40% never making a penny (this will include people who have private blogs and those who chose not to monetise and those who do a few posts and give up!). ",

In case you succeed in making some money, you will not scale that up unless you are serious. I\u2019d say, Yes! you can make a lot of money if you do it right. There are several people on the internet who make good money blogging. Some of the well-known bloggers make anywhere between 10 lac to 30 lac per month!. The best part of blogging is that there is no heavy investment like other businesses. But, don\u2019t start blogging just because you got to know how much bloggers make per month and you will do the same. It takes years of experience, efforts, sleepless nights, experiments to reach this level. All, I am saying is, you can make a really good income blogging but you have to be serious and consistent. ",

You never know which one of your website or a single article is going to become a hit on social media or search engine Google.  1 Single article is enough to make a huge amount of money. However blogging is not all about making money from advertisements.  You can have your own products to promote but you need an authority over your website niche. If people trust your website then they will buy your recommended products too. Your product will make more money than any advertisement scheme.  If you are serious then start blogging and keep learning about SEO, Keyword research and various ongoing methods used by people to get organic and social media traffic. It will take a bit of time but once money starts rolling in, it will be profitable. ",

If you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s possible to have a bright future as a blogger, the answer is yes! But, you need to be diligent and innovative for that. When as part of the CareerNinja team, I spoke to the famous blogger Aashna Shroff, she said that professional and widely-read bloggers make 3-4 lakh per month. You can make a few thousands a month if you have an initial few thousand followers, which will only increase over time. The scope is great if you choose to write about technology, travel, fashion, food and lifestyle. But, if you write about a lesser-known space like parenting or pets, you can make it big there too provided you produce unique content. Today, a blogger can earn anything from a few thousand to more than a lakh for a couple of posts.

There are bloggers that do very well and there are those who fizzle out after starting because they lose interest and don\u2019t have the drive to follow through. \u201cProfitable\u201d is a subjective term as well. To many, it means a few hundred dollars or less a month, some thousands, others over $100k a month. Profitable essentially indicates you make more than your expenses, so you need to think about how you\u2019ll define profitable for you. Blogging alone won\u2019t make you money (unless you\u2019re being paid as a blogger on someone else\u2019s site). You need to offer some sort of product or service that people are willing to pay for. That could be an e-book, membership site, affiliate products, physical products, coaching, webinars, etc. In order to sell, you may want to consider starting a business like an LLC. I\u2019d say that\u2019s the smartest thing to do, but many people start out not taking that step just to see if it will work out first and if they have the staying power. Hope that helps you.

They key is to use effective methods to get ad clicks or views from ad elements on the page. These can be standard banners or native ads. Displaying ads is only one option of many, but its easy for most to do. Here is a trick anyone can use on a blog to increase earnings. What you will need to do is create a custom landing page for your blog posts. Each landing page will have a button to take readers to the content page. This is a transition page to use for displaying various ads (banners, affiliate ads, or CPA ads). You can then add any type of ad elements you want to the landing page. Footers and slide out ads are a great option. Just make sure any elements you add to the page will not cause your site to get a Chrome Abusive Experience flag. ",

Also check out marketing firms who specialize in technology - they often need writing help. However, you have to establish that you can blog about highly technical subject matter, and that may require you to set up your own site and blog about your niche to prove you know your stuff. Selling your services for $5 - $20 per blog on sites like Fiverr is a waste of time. Think about it, $5 is less than the hourly minimum wage, so a 2-hour blog will net you $2.50 an hour. You\u2019re bottom-feeding from bottom companies who aren\u2019t looking for quality. If you prove you have the skills, you can earn anywhere from $50-$100 per hour. ",

It usually requires your blog to have a sizable audience in order to make money directly through ad space or affiliate commissions. Also, what you blog about certainly limits how much you can generate through the blog. For example, a business blog might make a lot more than a blog about hamster clothing. ",

But it becomes easy when your blog have thousands of daily visitor. Well, I am sharing my own experience. Google makes easy to make money through a goal and I think everyone knows this. You can place various Google Ad Units on your blog you can earn by getting impressions. But it is not easy when you blog is completely new. Because the earning from Ads depends upon the mainly Visitors. Google gives money depending upon the Ad impressions and clicks on Ads. If talking about Google, generally gives approx in between $1-$3 per 1000 impressions but I cannot say about money per click because it may vary per every Ads. Talking about my blog last month I got several clicks but the CPC was only 0.7 that means for example if I get 20 Ad Clicks it becomes 0.7x20=$1.4 That\u2019s why everyone says Content is King. Give best articles and get more viewers. ",

Let's say that I'm a baseball coach and I sell training programs on \"how to hit the ball 100 feet further in 30 days or less\", I'd look for questions people are asking about baseball and just share my knowledge. I'd help as many people as I can and in doing so, 1) I feel good about myself and 2) people will start to see me for the expert that I am. People that are looking for extra help might reach out to you by using the Facebook link in your Quora profile, and from there you continue to build the relationship and help them further by offering your products/services. It's probably not the fastest way, but it's the ONLY way to maintain a sustainable business because your customers are your life blood. Hope that helps! ",

If you have a capital then you can check what industry, or niche you want to blog about, which can earn more money, then you can easily hire content writers. Or back to the first scenario, if you are the writer, you can easily create an affiliate account, and time to time promote links. Your next option would be setting up an AdSense account and get paid when someone clicks. There are many ways you can make money out of blogging, in 2018 when concurrency was booming, i began writing articles about it, and some got real traffic. So yes, just look into what you would like to write about, and what can you put on the table beside others! Then watch it all happen! ",

The blog where I wrote the most doesn't have ads. It happens in a month or two or three sometimes, but hey, you are getting something when you are not even doing something. So, ofcourse blogging gets you money. Just don't do it for money making though. Because, normally, it might still take at least a few months to get your blog going and gaining traffic, so you cannot really expect it to make money within the first few months itself. Things may vary, but this is what is to be expected in the most common scenario. Write great content. Share it often. Find more ways to write and share more often. If you are useful, you will grow for sure. Just be useful. :) ",

Once you start receiving traction, you could consider placing ads on your site, through Google's AdSense, or you can also sell ad space to brands and organisations. Especially after you start gaining an audience, you can also consider using platforms like BuyMeACoffee and Patreon, where creators like you can receive donations from your supporters. Selling your products through your blogs is also an option. Alternately, you can use affiliate marketing strategies, where you can sell products of other brands through affiliate links as well as create sponsored content. ",

Advertisements can also be put up directly by contacting any business and asking them to pay a fee for displaying their advertisements. Also there is a Amazon program where you post links and if any purchase is made using those links you get a commission. There are other similar services too.

Everybody is trying to start a blog. Or a vlog. Or an Instagram page or whatever else. Because it\u2019s so easy to get started. There are just no barriers to entry whatsoever. But that\u2019s also what makes it harder to succeed. The easier it is to get started on something, the more competition there will be. The more competition there is, the more professional the market becomes and the longer it will take you to become good enough to make it. Blogging, like anything else, takes time. You need to learn the necessary skills. You need to have a proper business model in place. You need to slowly build up multiple income streams. There is so much to learn with blogging. So either you take it seriously and push through the hardships, or you let it be. Because if you are not willing to go all in on this, then you have no chances of winning. ",

It\u2019s much better to make even five real and deep connections. In many ways, social media has taught us to think that numbers are important. But this is not true. At the end of the day, you can\u2019t talk to a number. What\u2019s truly meaningful about the internet is that, behind the screens, we are all just normal people seeking genuine human relations. And same goes for everything else. Take your time. Honestly, what\u2019s the rush? There\u2019s a time and a place for everything. When you are by yourself, delight in your peace of mind. Listen to your inner dialogue; breath. Cherish the little moments with your friends, with your pets, with your loved ones, with your family, children, etc. Always give your best So, this is today\u2019s lesson: Whatever you do, do it good. Don\u2019t put only 50% in it. Always, always, always give your best. You\u2019ll find out that, sooner or later, this is how cool things come to your life. It may take some time, but it will be rewarding at the end. Finding your true passion, building up your tribe and offer people some unique, entertaining and useful content will get you far.
