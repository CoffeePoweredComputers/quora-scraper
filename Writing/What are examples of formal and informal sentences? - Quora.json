            "answer_text": "some examples \u2014 The main difference between formal and informal sentences has to do with the choice of vocabulary. Informal language uses colloquial expressions and slang more often. In ordinary conversation, most people speak informally. Formal language is reserved for business writing, or elevated occasions when someone is expected to speak in a more dignified way to show respect and decorum. Formal: That child is distressed. Informal: That kid is freaking out. Formal: He\u2019s an attractive man. Informal: He\u2019s a hottie. Formal: I\u2019m short on funds. Informal: I\u2019m broke. Formal: That\u2019s very unfortunate. Informal: That sucks. Formal: She\u2019s a difficult person. Informal: She\u2019s a bitch. Formal: I\u2019m pleased to meet you. Informal: Hi, how\u2019re you doing? Formal: Good-bye. Informal: See ya. ",
