Suppose you hear only the 1000 answers part & you writes 1500 answer. THIS MAY NOT WORK. When you write an answer, make sure that you gets it reviewed. The most important thing is to avoid repeating same mistakes again & again. The Answer should be not redundant.  I enrolled my name in a program called EDENIAS: STEPS (Daily Mains Answer Writing Program) and I am totally satisfied with this program, the program covers entire syllabus in 3 months by daily answer writing and best of best evaluated copies are provided within 72 hours, if someone is looking for any Answer Writing Program, I would suggest for this program.

Another method is ask your seniors if they have some time to cater to review your answers and get the feedback. Another method, write your answers on digital platforms like INSIGHTSIAS, IASBABA and let them have corrected. Or better is join some telegram/whatsapp group and post your answers and ask members to scrutinize it. Finally, shell some money and join some test series. They will evaluate your answer and send you synopsis and remarks. Any of the above method works. Use the trial and error method and chose wisely. Cheers!! Peace out!! ",
