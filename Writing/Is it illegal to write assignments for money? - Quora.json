            "answer_text": "From perspective of writer (who gets money): Unethical? Definitely Illegal? I can\u2019t say 100% unless there is a written rule or policy of a university or college who will punish the writer (they can punish only if he/she is still a student). Now a writer could argue he is entering into a contract of service with the customer(or cheat for general public) student of taking money in return of providing service by way of writing a ghost assignment. However even this contract can easily be deemed invalid due to Section 23 of Indian Contract Act because the object of contract doesn\u2019t seem lawful at all and it could be termed against public policy also of promoting honest education among students. Section 23 in The Indian Contract Act, 1872 From perspective of assignment submiter ( who pays to get assignment): Unethical? Definitely Illegal? Yes, because even if there is no written policy it is assumed that a person submits his/her own work so getting it done from someone else will fall under cheating. At the least you are cheating against those who submit their own assignment. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Although, you could say that you do assignments for your gains (grades, in usual cases), and the process is fulfilled when instead of getting grades, you demand monetary gains. As far as I know, every institute has a plagiarism policy. So whoever you're doing this for, would get in trouble and so might you. But like they say, it's not illegal until you're caught. Good Luck!
