            "answer_text": "There are as many prospective answers to this question as there are writers in the world. Some writers spend many hours planning out a \u2018map\u2019 of their plot and a detailed analysis of their characters before putting pen to paper, or more likely, fingers to the keyboard. When they do make a start, productivity likely varies from day to day, week to week and month to month. As for me, I tend to daydream about my stories without locking them into a rigid structure from the outset. Then, I simply start writing! To me, that\u2019s the key to the whole writing process. No matter if I\u2019m in the mood or whether or not my muse has appeared to inspire me, I sit my butt down at the computer desk and plunge right on in. I write every day but not always on the same project. I tend to have a number of interesting creations on the go at any one time with one of them playing a starring role, and therefore getting more air time\u2026so to speak. But getting right down to the nitty gritty of this question, I have to say that on good days (when inspiration has lighted upon me like manna from heaven), I can easily churn out 1000 words of a novel in just over an hour. And when my muse dictates the pace, those 1000 words tend to turn out really well, which puts a smile on my face. When I go to edit them later, they rarely require much editing. On other days, when my brain is sluggish, it\u2019s an effort just to start typing. I open up a new word document or add another page to the current one, and pick out my sentences laboriously. It might take me an hour to churn out 400 to 500 words that I may or may not later delete. So, although I understand the questioner wanting a nice neat figure to answer the question of how long it takes me to write 1000 words, I\u2019m afraid reality prevents me from supplying one. I can only give broad parameters - that writing a hundred (fairly decent) words can take me anywhere from one hour to three. Blog: www.killingmesoftly.co ",

            "answer_text": "With journalism or some other style of writing where I\u2019m getting paid for the job, about an hour and a half. But with writing on spec, as that\u2019s what a novel pretty much is, I tend to do a few things that slow me down considerably. First, I tend to write 800\u20131500 word chapters that can be self-contained, almost like short stories, where the beginning of each chapter ties to its end. Second, I don\u2019t just free-write like a monkey on a typewriter. I stop pretty much after every few sentences, checking word choices, checking previous chapters for continuity, fact checking, and basic editing. I\u2019m not a believer in editing the novel after it\u2019s written. I want to edit it during. Third, I plan out how that chapter is going to go, through notes and in my head, pretty much a full day or so before I commit to it. Then, I want to finish that chapter in one sitting. So, if I am inspired and ready to start that ~1000-word chapter, from first word to last word, it will take me about 2\u20133 hours. I make sure that I will have such a block of time, that will be uninterrupted, to pull it off. I try to listen to music I\u2019ve heard 10,000 times, and pretty much the same handful of musicians, to keep in rhythm and not get distracted. Anyway, that\u2019s too much of an answer, huh? Writers writing about writing can be a tedious thing! ",
