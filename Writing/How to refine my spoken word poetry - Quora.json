A list of concrete things works better than a list of abstractions (like \u201clove,\u201d \u201chate,\u201d etc.). Any word that has an image that goes with it (like \u201cbarn\u201d or \u201cbird\u201d) is a concrete word. Also, make sure to use strong verbs (like \u201cHe zipped up his coat.\u201d) ",
