            "answer_text": "Can language exist without (grammar) structure? No, it cannot. (That's the short answer, read on if you need more) Language, the 'opposable thumb' for the brain! So why not an 'easy language' that doesn't have dull, boring 'grammar'? Why couldn't we just let sounds mean all the good in life and agree not to talk about bad? Why? Well, to demonstrate start with our grammar-less language's first word, let's call it 'yes' Now we call another word into being, and call it 'food', with me so far?  And one final word, to demonstrate the absolute requirement for SOME form of grammar, call it 'no'. Words, in solitary use, or SOUNDS, need no grammar, because they SHOULD be context-relevant. Words used with OTHER WORDS immediately develop problems, to wit: 'food yes' means a) you have food b)I have food c) I want food d) none of the above e) all of the above? And that's only using TWO words and disregarding dozens of other meanings, all of which become more complex with the introduction of 'no'. Humans use word-order, tone, context and more as grammar, precisely because humans are (beyond? above? more developed than?) capable of complex thought, far exceeding the capability of grunts and gestures to convey. American Sign Language and Signed English BOTH have grammars, although radically different. Polish Notation and Reverse Polish Notation are both parts of the 'grammar' of mathematics. C++, HTML and Ruby-on-Rails have grammar, and sloppy thinking can result in unworkable websites ala AHA. Think of 'Excuse me...' (flat tone, moderate loudness) and 'EX-CUSE me?' (sharp, loud voice with shocked or angry face) as compared to 'Ex-cuuuuze ME!' (with mugging frown, grinning and other blatant comical gestures).  Any of the infinitely nuanced verbal creations, literary accomplishments and religious moral developments have used GRAMMAR, no matter which language they originated in, and all humankind benefited from Grammar!

            "answer_text": "This is a very odd question.  I'm not sure what is meant by \"language\" and \"grammar\" here, or if they are distinct as you define them. One of the most interesting ways to look at language (in my opinion) is to consider everything we say about grammar as only a flimsy and incomplete description of what we could potentially observe and/or an explanation of what we believe to be true about a language.  From this point of view, when we talk about the grammar of a language, we are doing something like discussing a (necessarily incomplete and not totally accurate) map of a place, and so your question would be like asking, \"Can a place exist if there is no map of it?\"  Not a very informed question...but maybe you define grammar differently. If you mean can languages work without some rule system to control the possible forms language takes, then, no, probably not.  Language is completely human centered.  It's about shared consensus and purpose among people, not how the universe works.  In my opinion, it's much more like a legal system or a national economy and not as much like math, physics or evolution.  If this is what your question was asking about, then no, I don't see how language could exist with no orderly, mutual conventions in place to guide people in acquiring and using it.   There's a reason lots of people talked about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnegans_Wake but very few people have ever read it.  If you don't use language within the generally agreed upon limits (the \"grammar\", among other things) other people don't believe they will profit from the communication, and don't engage. ",

            "answer_text": "That really depends how you define language. For most linguists, language, by definition, involves grammar. So the answer for them would be no. Other people probably have other definitions in mind when they say language, so for them, the answer might be yes.  Clearly, some non-human animals have the ability to communicate with signs. And humans who know nothing of each other's language can communicate usign signs such as gestures words, and facial expressions, but most linguists would say that this ability is only one element of a language. The answer really depends on why you are asking the question. ",

That\u2019s grammar!  I believe that if we didn\u2019t need to write a language, we would probably be able to get away without thinking about grammar. That is exactly how every child learns their language; they imitate their parents and family without thinking about the grammar. But later, when they start writing it, they need to learn grammar. Needless to say, whether we like it or not, every written language has a structure \u2013 some type of grammar. So, if you desire to comprehend that language in all its forms, including written, you will need to know the grammar. ",

Chomky's UG theory is the dominant argument and, related to this, it is our language ability that separates us from all other species.  In particular, it is the infinite number of ways in which we all can use language, which is, essentially, determined by language structure and rules, i.e., grammar.  In short, without grammar, we would have capacities for utterances only, which would place us back with the other species where they respond to sound stimuli only (a bird tweet, a dog bark, a tiger growl) and have no means to communicate in a such a way as to evolve, create, and develop.  Just think about this: how would anything in the world in which we live be possible without language?  Quora, the smart device I am using, my language/communication to you. ",

If there was no grammar available,  there would have been no fixed rule to tell where to place the different parts of a sentence - the subject and the predicate and thus,  I could have written the question you posed as \"language necessary for is grammar .

You can communicate by means of speech the way two people, who do not speak a common language have to make do with hand jestures and short words, etc.  It is a primitive form of language that strictly speaking has no rules.  But all languages necessary started in this way and developed complex grammar to relate complex things. ",

The question is logically ill-formed as it has an embedded proposition that language and grammar are two separate things. They are not. The question is a lot like asking if a tree can exist without being a plant, or if a wind can blow without air. ",

No. Language is kinda like a game, except it has a lot of practical use, like communication, Cognition, etc. But the bottom line is, it's not meant for one person, it's meant for a community. So if language had no rules it'd be impossible for the community to coordinate with each other and know what's happening. Same as with any game. ",
