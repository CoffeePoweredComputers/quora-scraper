            "answer_text": "Well, most people either have xx or xy. And all of the other chromosomes are the same between those two sexes. I guess you could say xx is more dominant because everyone has at least one x and all embryos start out developing female secondary sex characteristics. And I guess you could say that xy was dominant because even if you have an x and a y, the y will override the female secondary sex characteristics and they will form into male secondary sex characteristics.
