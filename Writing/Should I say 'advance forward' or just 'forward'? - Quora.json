            "answer_text": "Advance in this context simply means to move or bring forward. While advance does imply forward due to it's purposeful and goal getting nature, I think you should say advance toward whatever your advancing to. This implies purpose to the readers, and they will know where they are going. However, if you simply wish to say they are moving in the forward direction relevant to their own perspective, then say they are moving forward. ",
