You give up everything until there is nothing to be liberated; You and the body you occupy become one. They refer to this state of mind acquired through years of meditative practice as enlightenment, where you do not seek approval from others and do not have to prove anything to anyone; A state where everything becomes effortless, there is no more fighting or strain, just a calm realization of one\u2019s own soul\u2026\u2026Read more ",
