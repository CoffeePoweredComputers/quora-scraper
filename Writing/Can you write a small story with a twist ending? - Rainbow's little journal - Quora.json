            "answer_text": "Martin was having a usual day at work. Just like everyday, he got off work at 5:30 p.m and proceeded to catch the usual 6:05 train back home. The station was close to his workplace so he always went on a short walk while sipping coffee to kill time. The place was a small part of the sub-urb, filled with various alleys where one might find thieves trying to rob someone, perhaps gang members fighting out or even rapes. Martin however had encountered nothing of that sort. Nothing until today. As he took his usual round, he chanced upon a presumably empty alley where his eyes caught a hooded figure in a struggle with someone. \u201cHelp!\u201d, he heard. Now being a responsible citizen of the country he should have called the cops but the excitement of the situation and the chance to be a hero overwhelmed Martin. After all, what if he ran away by the time the cops arrived? He ran towards the source of the cries and found a boy in his 20s lying on the ground a few meters from him. The man with the hood had him pinned down. \u201cLet go.\u201d, he told the boy as he attempted to take the wallet from his hands.The boy managed to catch his eyes and said, \u201cHelp. Get him off me.\u201d Martin in a surge of adrenaline, ran at the mugger and tackled him just as he turned around. This led to the man to hit his head on the hard concrete and pass out. Martin then handed the boy his wallet and asked him to be wary of thieves. The boy thanked him and ran off.Martin called an ambulance for the man now laying unconscious on the ground. He didn\u2019t call the cops. It would take some time with the questioning. He wanted to be on that train home on time.\u201cWish you lived an honest life.\u201d, Martin told his body.\u2018There\u2019s an acute shortage of good people in the world lately.\u2019, he said. Then with a smile, he went about his way home. He was happy, he had become someone\u2019s savior.  Mary Collins was waiting for her husband to return. He was quite late. God forbid if he had been in an accident. Quite some time after he was supposed to come back, she heard the distinct knock he made when he came home. She hurried to open the door. \u201cGoodness gracious!\u201d, she exclaimed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d, she inquired of her husband. \u201cGot knocked out I did, on my way home. There was this pickpocket. I caught him and nearly took my wallet back but then his pal came and got me from behind. There\u2019s too many scoundrels these days. Can\u2019t wait for them to catch the thieves though. If I ever have the chance to meet even one of them, I\u2019ll make them regret ever stealing wallets.Bless the person who called the ambulance though. Wish he\u2019d come earlier. Could have helped me out. We need more people like him in the world. Wanted to give him my thanks but he already left. I hope I meet him one day too. Would love to express my gratitude to him.\u201d \u201cThis incidence sure taught me one thing though. Don\u2019t wear hoodies, you can\u2019t see who\u2019s coming from behind you.\u201d, the man said clutching his head where it hit the concrete. ",

            "answer_text": " Rishi and his sister Anita on a rainy day were strolling out in their grandfather's house. Both being 10 years of age were restricted from moving further away from the house. Regardless of this Rishi with an adrenaline rush stormed out to far away from house premises leaving his sister behind. An hour passed no sign of Rishi anywhere so Anita also moved to find his brother in the dark. The rain was twirling everywhere the sounds were making goofy noises like this is never going to end but the little girl in hope to find his brother was strolling here and there in dark forest full of rain. The little girl with her huge courage was moving forward with a frightened face but his brother was nowhere to be found. Losing her way she sat under the tree and slept there for rest of the night until morning when her grandparents found her and waked her up from her slumber. They asked her ,\u201dkid! what were you doing here all night ? \u201c Anita in a weakened state answered ,\u201dI was searching for Rishi as he rushed into the forest.\u201d Grandpa with a frightened face to grandmother Murmured ,\u201d but her brother died in car accident 2 years ago with her parents.\u201d \u2026.. **Clutter clutter*** So kids how did you liked the story, written by Rudra for the short story competition , said Ms Srivastava to rest of the class.

But, the feeling wasn't mutual. Her roomates used to complain about the eerie and uncanny feeling they got while being in the apartment. So, one by one, they all left, leaving Alice alone. She couldn't understand why all her roomates felt scared in her apartment. Dissapointed, she said to herself \u201cHow crazy can they all be! I've been living her for the past 169 years, but nothing seemed out of place. Strange folks!\u201d And then, her mom reminded little Alice to take her Schizophrenia pills. ",
