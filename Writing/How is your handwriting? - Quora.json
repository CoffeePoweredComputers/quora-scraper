            "answer_text": "This is how I write. I tried to imitate the world's most beautiful handwriting.  My name is C.M Ayaan pasha . And my name is there in the above picture.  The above picture is calligraphed by me and I used an ordinary 10 rs cello pen for this. Nothing in the above picture is printed. Every single design and word is contributed by me. At present this picture is in my College Notice board. Above picture consists of a sonnet . It was my first sonnet. In that sonnet, I described the qualities of my college owner in archaic style . I gifted this to my college owner on his 89th birthday.  The above picture is a leave letter written by me to my class teacher. If you write leave letter like this you will certainly get leave. :)  The above picture is calligraphed. It is about the announcement of winner in a painting competition. I did this using Faber castell ball pen.  The above picture is calligraphed with the help of Apsara pencil. It was a small gift for my chemistry lecturer given by me on her birthday. See, this is the magic present inside a pencil.  Above picture is also calligraphed with the help of Faber castell ball pen.  My fast handwriting in tests . I am the topper of my section in class 12 board exam.  Believe it or not, the above picture is also calligraphed by Faber Castell ball pen.  The above picture shows one of my simple handwriting styles. (Note: The quote is not by me )  I have written only one paragraph of the song.  Actually they are curry leaves :)  \u201cIndian National Anthem\u201d  I have written very beautifully with the help of pen which is in the above picture( Faber Castell). It costs 10 rupees.  Super costly doms pen , which cost 3 rupees . Pens which look cheap are not cheap in quality if we use them correctly. Finally hardwork, dedication and interest matters a lot. This is how I write.Please note that I have not used any Calligraphy pen. I haven't bought any. If you have a magical hand , then you don't worry about pens. As I mentioned above , even with a 3 rupees pen you can write very beautifully. Actually I had a normal handwriting during 10 th std. This was my handwriting when I joined 11th std. It was normal.  When I joined 11th std , I heard news about Prakriti Malla and viewed her handwriting. I was inspired by her. So from that day I used to practice 1 page handwriting every day till 2 months. Then I got a slight improvement in my handwriting. 2 months of hardwork gave me good results. After 11th during holidays I used to practice 2 pages every day with Prakriti Malla's handwriting in front of me as a guide. Then my handwriting was becoming very beautiful, everyone liked that change in my writing. See, I haven't wasted 2 years complete for just handwriting. *First 2 months ( when I was in class 11th) :::: spent 1 hr per day for practicing. (61 hrs) *After 11th ( During holidays):::: spent 1.5 hrs everyday for practicing. (1 month holiday) (45 hrs) *In class 12th:::::: spent 2 hrs every month for practicing. (24 hrs) I spent 130 hrs / 2 years ( approximately) , which means I spent 10.7 minutes every day from class 11 to class 12 for handwriting practice. We don't know, how many 10.7 minutes we waste per day? Just utilise it for your hobbies or some useful purpose. I didn't join any handwriting class, because I am from Rural area. I belong to Tumkur district, but not Tumkur city. I am from chikkanayakanahalli. I had only one print out of prakriti malla's handwriting, that single printed copy has made my handwriting beautiful along with my hardwork. My handwriting after class 11 ( Still I was not satisfied with this , I tried to improve it more )  I practiced writing in class 12th too. My hardwork helped me. I got fruitful result. Now everyone asks me whether I am free or not to write something for them. All my family members and teachers are proud of me. This is my story , normal handwriting >>> beautiful handwriting. Everyone know that Prakriti Malla's handwriting is the best in the world and now my handwriting is matching hers. 1). Prakriti malla handwriting ( Nepal girl with world's best handwriting)  2). My handwriting after class 12 i.e At present ( Inspired by Prakriti malla).  3) Another attempt to create more perfection. A)  B)  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO WRITE VERY BEAUTIFULLY IS \u201c WRITING BOTH *BOLD* AND *NON BOLD* LETTERS WITH THE SAME PEN AT THE SAME TIME i.e bold, non bold, bold, non bold *example is,  The above picture is the basement for amazing Handwriting. You have to write 4mm in bold and again 4mm lightly. For this type of handwriting, some of you may suggest me to write with a calligraphy pen, but it becomes calligraphy and I cannot carry calligraphy pen everywhere. My aim is to write beautifully with any kind of pen in any place at any time. If you want good handwriting, then just practice , practice, practice\u2026. You can write more beautiful than me. Don't think that beautiful handwriting is a gift by birth. If you have any suggestions, then please comment :) Thanks for reading :) ",

            "answer_text": "Messy. This is a very contradictory answer. I get compliments on my handwriting quite a bit, from teachers and friends. One of my friends has stated on multiple occasions that she wants my handwriting. My handwriting isn\u2019t eligible to teachers, however most of my class struggle to make out what I have written. My print handwriting is very ugly. That is not even debatable, I can\u2019t write in print. I always write in cursive. My handwriting is pretty basic, but it is considered unusual where I live. I am quite envious (I know jealousy is a bad thing) of my friends handwriting as it looks much nicer than mine and is easily read and understood. I will show you my maths notes and my music notes compared to my history notes and my geography notes (the latter are very messy and ugly in my opinion). Please remember that I don\u2019t really like my handwriting but I get compliments on it (no clue why really).   I cross out things a lot by scribbling, I know I shouldn\u2019t it\u2019s just a bad habit.  This is pretty much illegible (I can read it, but I think I have a bit of a knack for reading horrific handwriting).  Honestly it just depends on how much I like the subject and how much respect I have for it. Also it depends on wether we get specific nicely laid out notes to copy down or not. If you read this could you give me points on how to improve my handwriting! Thanks! EH ",
