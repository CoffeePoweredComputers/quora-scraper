            "answer_text": "What should you never say to a French person? Well, depends of who you talk to of course, but in general : \u201cFrance is not France anymore.\u201d That\u2019s not logic, and even if that\u2019s true to some extend, it can be upsetting, coming from wherever, abroad, within, or in oneself. \u201cFrance is always late.\u201d Socialists, backward and against economical progress, etc\u2026 That\u2019s clearly an offense here ! We are very proud of our national struggle which paved the way to the modern nation States formation, our culture, arts, litterature, scientific achievements, and\u2026 providence State, and no decent French will hear otherwise, except the ultra-liberals who we still mainly consider as sell-outs even if they are so visible in the majority of the French media\u2026 Media than they sadly control. \u201cFrance is not productive.\u201d Productive whaaaat ?? We built 300 nukes, space-rockets only behind the U.S.A and Russia, we made Alcatel, Alstom, Airbus, and competed for decades in GDP rise with countries much more liberal, with much more inequalities, and much less public services and redistribution than us. We are super-productive, and the French way was the epitome of a successfull People-oriented capitalist economy before neoliberals started to fuck with us until we fucked up ourselves in their wake. Thanks God for us, we didn\u2019t have the problems of Yugoslavia, our mirroring counterpart in the socialist World. \u201cIt\u2019s over for France, you\u2019re not important anymore.\u201d Agreed, but don\u2019t get confused : if the second part is partly true, the first one ain\u2019t at all. That\u2019s our Sovereign choice to bow out of our elite greeds and desire to hide from responsability, and our People gullibility. We can also stand the same way. France is actually one of the few countries in the World who can still have plainly its future in its hands. No one can really prevents us materially, not even the U.S.A or China. We are a nuclear Power quite autonomous in matters of military aparatus, have the biggest European territory behind Russia and Ukraine (and behind Russia only if we account our oversea territories : the sun never sets on France), enough arable lands to feed 100 millions of French, a quite highly educated population of 67,000,000+ inhabitants and would we chose to have a staunch natalist policy, we could climb quickly and pass Germany in 2 decades. We lack of sovereignly held industrial ressources, but still hold the defense and monetary system of a dozen of African countries which can provide them to us. Russia has the rest, and we could very well ally with it to its great pleasure. Would we orientate our nation toward the conquest of the stars, we\u2019d quickly catch up on both Americans and Russians, set foot on the moon and why not build a permanent base here, just for the glory of it. Especially if we decide to work with Russians, that can go even faster. And as our current importance, 200,000 French in the streets lead to 2,000,000 Worldwide. Would we reestablish conscription, the whole Europe would follow. Would we leave the E.U, said E.U would collapse in 2 or even 3 different blocks. Would we leave NATO for good and explain why, a few other countries would probably follow : we can now honour our alliances if we wish so. We can affect the whole course of Occident if we decide so. We can lead half of the European Union if we decide so. We could bypass Germany in the Russian courting race if we decide so : Germany can\u2019t escape the American orbit as easily as we can. Can we take the heat ? It\u2019s another issue, France is indeed not France anymore with our current oligarchy, but that doesn\u2019t mean we CANNOT remedy to that if we DECIDE so. It means that right now, we are in a limbo. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s over for France, and that\u2019s quite important. \u201cFrench are traitors.\u201d The Czechs, Poles, Harkis, Israeli and Serbs are entitled to call us that, for we sold them out or broke Historical alliances with them without a proper cause but our Leaders\u2019 cowardice. As we can call ourselves, at times. No one else really can. Going out of NATO command structure in 1966 or refusing to go in Irak, 2003, on falacious causes, were sovereign decisions in respect of our commitments, and we didn\u2019t breach any treaty nor alliance, only our level of commitment within them and beyond their letter. Coming back in NATO command structure was, similarly, a sovereign decision, a betrayal of ourselves somehow, and only ourselves. \u201cFrench are pussies.\u201d The debacle of 1939\u20131940 and the collaboration that followed was indeed a shame, but it can\u2019t be blamed on the People. The Political leadership and high military command hold full responsability. We lost a quater millions of soldiers in WW2, most of them trying to free our country and a few others with our allies. Beyond that fiasco we still tried to correct, French military History is full of battles, lot of lost ones, even more of won ones, may they were just wars or not. And that goes until today. From the skies mostly, true, with some special forces on the ground. But then the whole occident is a leaking pussy. \u201cFrench are weak.\u201d The Americans and Russians can legitimely consider it, and even they don\u2019t. The Germany can legitimately consider that \u201c1v1, they had us\u201d, but well, after wrecking twice the whole European continent in the last century, I\u2019d say their strength was the strength of the mad, and we French are much more reasonnable : we did not see ourselves as the Master-Race of Europe. Too much of that moderation led us to failure against such a foe, too much of the opposite led Germany to failure against a World of untermenschen as well. \u201cFrance is hypocrite.\u201d A lot of People will agree, me included, a lot of others will get pissed and some even infuriated, for they sincerely believe than we are good-doers or doing our best / what we had to do in a difficult World (Civilizationnism, WW2, Colonial Wars, NATO Wars). \u201cFrance became a NATO bully.\u201d That\u2019s my own line, don\u2019t steal it from me ! And if you do, I will gladly agree. But many of my countrymates will not, see previous paragraph. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE, DON\u2019T YOU UNDERSTAND ??? 8===D(_(_)8===D(_(_), basically. Frogs, cheese eaters, beret-baguette and this kind of caricatural qualificatives will make laugh a lot of People, me included, and deeply offend others. Get close before you go for this ! ;-)  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201couh l\u00e0 l\u00e0\u201d followed by \u201ccomme-ci, comme-\u00e7a\u201d :) Yes, people say it all the time, but not in the sense Americans assume. \u201couh l\u00e0 l\u00e0\u201d is just a very common exclamation, there\u2019s nothing sexual about it. It\u2019s like \u201cgosh\u201d or \u201cwow\u201d. As for \u201ccomme-ci, comme-\u00e7a\u201d, it means \u201cso-so\u201d, nothing more, nothing else. And people use it when they don\u2019t really want to make a strong statement about something. So saying both of these in the same utterance is just weird. Oh, and Paris is not \u201cromantic\u201d (as per the wiktionary, \u201cromantic\u201d means: An artistic and intellectual movement, stressing emotion, freedom and individual imagination, that originated in Europe toward the end of the 18th century). Paris, as most of European cities, is a town built on very ancient foundations that far predate what is known as \u201cromanticism\u201d. It\u2019s a city where the weight of history is evident anywhere you go. In this sense, it\u2019s probably easier to get your first kiss after walking the streets of Paris at night with your date than, say, coming from the nearest burger joint in Oklahoma\u2026 But that\u2019s it. Paris is also very crowded, not always as clean as we\u2019d like, and can be quite depressing, too. It does make for nice pictures, though. And please refrain from using \u201ccute\u201d all the time. The Eiffel tower is not \u201ccute\u201d (as a matter of fact, most Parisians thought it was a real eye sore when it was first built for the Exposition Universelle). Notre-Dame is not \u201ccute\u201d, either. It\u2019s \u201cimpressive\u201d (it took several centuries to be completed, and it\u2019s not even really finished btw), \u201cmassive\u201d, \u201cawe-inspiring\u201d etc. But not \u201ccute\u201d. Two more for the road: if you\u2019re British, maybe you shouldn\u2019t talk about Napoleon. There are plenty of other hot topics (eg. Which is best: wine or beer? Who has the best cheeses?). If you\u2019re American, please refrain from stating that you saved our asses in WWII. The French know it, and they will be forever thankful for that, but it won\u2019t stop them from criticizing the American way of life, nor the way America\u2019s foreign policy has an impact on the rest of the world (dicatorships in South America, and terrorism come to mind).
