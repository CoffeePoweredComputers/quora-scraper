            "answer_text": "(RAIN) Written by Courtney Slone (Flores) 09/2010 -The Rain; is it not vital to keep things growing? Does it not, pour out the Heavens abundantly overflowing? -Can it not stop traffic at the drop of a dime? Does it not slow down our days, as if to stop time? -Doesn't it soothe us to sleep on our dark and lonely nights? Is it not beautiful when it makes it's appearance with flashing lights? -Can it not wear away layers of things built up? Doesn't it have the power to move things, very abrupt? -Does a rainbow not appear after the Rain is gone? Doesn't it remind you of how special the Rain is all along? -The Rain; can it not tear down, sustain life and soothe all at the same time? Do we not thank God for the Rain, when we're in pain and asking for a sign? I wrote this while incarcerated for an acquaintance of mine named Lorraine AKA (Rain). I thought that you might gain inspiration from this seeing as it was written metaphorically speaking of the Rain but as an individual. I simply took what I know to be true about actual rain and and incorporated the way that a person might also do these things when perceived through an open mind. Stating simply that this person, Rain; is important and vital, beautiful and soothing, nourishing and special, she has an unlimited power source of love that wears away the hurts of the heart and captivates you with her presence slowing down time itself, she can be destructive but healing and so beautifully ugly that even at the center of her very being (the dreaded storm) she emits colors that are absolutely extravagant. I love working with metaphors, it excites my inner most being. I hope this has been of some assistance. Good luck on your journey with writing, it's one of the most fullfilling parts of me/my life\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Calm down, clear your mind, forget what you are, take a breath, YOU ARE RAIN !now write everything you wanna say or do as rain. Thinking makes it artificial. Poems are all about how you feel. For eg:\"If only I was rain, If only Lord Indra allowed me to break rules sometimes, I would have made world a better place,starting with showering in the right places where water is scarce and people are dying,And less where I accidentally bring my heavy weighted rival 'the floods'.Trying to use my lightening rod when someone is taking law into their handsMy thundering drum when criminals think it is their time,If only I was rain,I would have made world a better place.\"Something like this. ;-) :-) HAHA ",
