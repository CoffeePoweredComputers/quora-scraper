            "answer_text": "This is a question that is certainly up for debate but in my opinion: No.  There's a lot of writing out there that's no more than putting down required information in its most basic form. Text books, statistical books, academic papers, some science journals and so on.  Of course, some of all genres employ creativity when setting out their information in order to keep the reader's interest, but it's not necessary for all work and many writers in fields where it's not required don't bother with it.
