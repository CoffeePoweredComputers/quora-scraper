            "answer_text": "In fact, since it is more likely that you will be struck by lightning than you will be able to make a living as a beginning writer, writing while having a day job is something you will have to do. First, find a day job that doesn\u2019t suck. Something that doesn\u2019t make you wish you\u2019d have to have a root canal rather than go to work. Having a soul-sucking day job is going to make it much harder to write when you aren\u2019t working. Second, get everyone used to the fact that you are not going to be available to go out for drinks, get together for the big game, come over for cards, etc. In short, if you are serious, you are going to have to sacrifice your social life. You are also going to have to sacrifice some of what used to be your normal everyday pleasures\u2014like television or computer/video games. There is an entire 10-year swath of popular culture I know nothing about, because I had to do just that to get where I am today. Third, you will have to discipline yourself, because (a) you won\u2019t have a \u201cboss\u201d to make sure you are sticking to this and (b) this is how you are going to have to live your life if you actually start making enough money by writing to live on. When you get home from work (or before you go to work, some people do better writing before work, and some after) you sit down, you do your allotted number of pages for the day and you do not get up until you have finished. You do this, day in, day out, all day, every day, weekends, holidays, sick or well, without fail. You may discover that you can\u2019t be that disciplined. That\u2019s fine. Ninety percent of the members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America write on the side and their primary income comes from their day job. That\u2019s why I said first thing, find a day job that doesn\u2019t suck! ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with everything said here. As a student being my main 'job' over the last . . . sixteen years, it's been hard to find time to write. I started writing after I'd finished my homework and then got into the habit of making time to do it. I'd advise against the career paths of being a teacher (due to the current state of education at the moment in the US) or someone who essentially has to take their work home with them. This will give you more time to actually sit down and write. But the biggest piece is you've just got to find the time to do it. I know a lot of writers who, when they're out busy running errands or even at work, will use the voice memo function on their phones to mumble-down ideas and write them later/after work. It's a great way to keep things organized instead of having to fuss with carrying a notebook all the time like many writers do. ",
