Mainly, Technical documentation involves enriched information about the product being developed and this, in fact, would anticipate searching, finding and offering solutions to customer queries. Technical reports are much important as it helps users to quickly learn about the product with its stored information and promotes explicit customer experience.

            "answer_text": "Joe Devney has given a pretty good answer. I agree with everything he mentioned. To his list, I\u2019d like to add one more and equally important reason why good technical writing is important: preventing chaos. One famous case is what happened when two different teams working on the Mars orbiter could not get their measuring units right: \u201cNASA lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because a Lockheed Martin engineering team used English units of measurement while the agency's team used the more conventional metric system for a key spacecraft operation\u2026\u201d Click here for the whole story As a professional tech writer, from time to time I truly feel I\u2019m one of the few people standing between order and chaos :-) Besides of course helping us put food on the table, technical writing is also a profession that contributes to smooth and orderly flow of daily life by offering reliable solutions to technical problems.
