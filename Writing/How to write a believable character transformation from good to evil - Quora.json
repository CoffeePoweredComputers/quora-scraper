            "answer_text": "We only believe in people we can imagine being. This is literally how our sympathy works; when a baby is in pain, the mother\u2019s brain lights up in the same place - she feels the same pain. Imagination is having someone else\u2019s feelings. It\u2019s like ventriloquism - but instead of throwing your voice, you are throwing the reader\u2019s mind. This is important; it\u2019s not your voice, or your mind - it\u2019s the reader\u2019s. They need to feel like they are inside the ventriloquist\u2019s doll. And that is hard. Because not only is it a doll, but you are controlling it, not them. There are two ways to put them inside the doll, and create believability in a character: empathy and sympathy. Empathy is seeing the world from another perspective, through another\u2019s eyes, seeing a different world. Because we all live in different worlds, not the same. Sympathy is recognising a feeling or situation you have had, and imagining still being yourself, but in their shoes. You, in a different body and life. Example of empathy: I haven\u2019t been a depressed American woman in real life, but I have by reading Sylvia Plath\u2019s The Bell Jar. I imagined being someone else. Example of sympathy: I have been very cold and I have been misunderstood, so I felt touched by the ending of Frankenstein when the monster floated off on an ice raft, alone. I could imagine me being me, but in the monster\u2019s shoes. Sylvia Plath was writing about being herself - and wrote it well enough that I could be her. Mary Shelley wrote about being someone else, a monster, but not from a different, monstrous mindset - she wrote about feelings we have all had, like being cold or rejected or having a parent (a creator who made you). Mary Shelley had felt them, and so had I. So I could feel his pain. It\u2019s actually very rare for an author to both: Imagine being someone different who thinks differentlyMake the reader imagine being someone different who thinks differentlySo I wouldn\u2019t try. What writers tend to do - and what I would recommend - is to write sympathetically, not empathetically. Write about yourself - if you had a different life. Imagine you being in someone else\u2019s shoes, not you being someone else\u2019s mind: write from experiences that you have known, not ones you haven\u2019t. This is what people really mean when they say \u2018write what you know\u2019 - which is too vague to be helpful, and makes you feel like your life is boring and unreadable, so it\u2019s depressing too. Why are we writing and reading - if not to try a different life? Don\u2019t write your life - write about yourself having a different life. And here is the first of three important rules I can give you: 1 HOW TO WRITE BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS Don\u2019t ever write something because \u2018that\u2019s the kind of thing people like that do.\u2019 No it isn\u2019t: no one thinks \u2018I\u2019ll do this because people like me do that.\u2019 Only ever make a character do something you think you would do, if you had had their life. This is vital - and is the difference between the millions of average writers and the few good ones. It\u2019s vital because you need to create the illusion of agency. This is just my idea, but I think it\u2019s useful. The idea is this; for the reader to believe the character, they need to imagine it\u2019s them controlling it. They need to be inside the character, and feel like when they want the character to do something - that\u2019s what the character does. If they want them to do something else - the spell is broken. They don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re controlling the doll. The most exciting reading experiences are when you feel you are being a character, not just being in that situation but thinking those thoughts and making those decisions. If you do it well enough, the reader feels like they are thinking up all those clever things to say, or doing those daring things themselves - and they will love the book. Because they lived it. It sounds like an impossible trick: to make an audience think they are the ventriloquist\u2019s doll. But I call it illusion of agency because of a strange experiment. They tried making a box which contained a mirror that made people who had a limb missing - but could still feel one, a phantom limb - think they could see two limbs. When they saw the reflection move - they said they were controlling it. Agency -the feeling that we are controlling our actions - is a feeling, not a fact. So writers can create the effect. Still, to do all this with an evil character might seem hard. Actually, no. Good, happy characters are hardest to write believably. By far. \u2018Happiness writes white.\u2019 There is nothing to say. There are only a couple of authors who have ever managed. So again - don\u2019t. Do this instead: start with a good but unhappy character. This is much easier and more readable. But here is the second important rule: RULE 2: HOW TO WRITE EMOTIONS Never write about a character having an emotion, write about the world being an emotion. Never describe feeling sad, because that\u2019s not what it\u2019s like to be sad. No one thinks \u2018I am sad\u2019. They think \u2018The world is bad\u2019 or \u2018I am pathetic\u2019. If you are inside an emotion, you don\u2019t see it - you see the world through that emotion, like a pair of sunglasses. Emotions are not separate from the world - they are how your world looks. Note: people say \u2018I love you, but I\u2019m not in love with you.\u2019 We all know what that distinction means. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to say \u2018I hate you\u2019 in anger - it\u2019s only something you\u2019re feeling, not how you see the world, or a claim about how the world is. But it\u2019s very, very different, and much, much worse, to say these words: \u2018Look at you. You are disgusting.\u2019 There is nothing more hurtful than that. Because that is being in hate. So, remember: from the inside, feelings are thoughts. Depression is: \u2018life has no point and nothing will change\u2019. It\u2019s a belief about things. And anger is: \u2018the world is unfair\u2019. Again, it only looks like anger on the outside. From the inside, we always look out. And if we are angry, we see an unfair, ugly world out there. Love is: \u2018this person is all that\u2019s good in my world\u2019. It\u2019s a belief. You can\u2019t convince them not to think it. They can\u2019t keep loving them but stop thinking that - though some therapists seem to think you can. Their loving is thinking that. They don\u2019t love a person; they love the world lit up by that person. And fear the dark. That\u2019s something else worth remembering: people in love fear loss, angry people dream of a world that treats them better. Every emotion contains its opposite. And that is the key to writing storylines. Whatever emotional world we are in - we see somewhere different on the horizon. Somewhere we could be. So. Write a good character from a sad or angry view of life. Or any other negative view - maybe one you have felt strongly or often. Jealousy, guilt, whatever it might be. We\u2019ve all had something. Now the last bit. Transformation to evil. Well, the key is agency - making them do things you would do, that the reader will feel they are choosing as they read. And I think there is a trick to this, which is my last important rule. 3 HOW TO TRANSFORM A CHARACTER: There is only one motive in life. Evil people don\u2019t have a different motive to good people. We all want the exact same: happiness, freedom from pain, and love. Don\u2019t make evil people want to be evil, or be tempted by evilness, or even power. It happens a lot in fiction. It\u2019s not real. It\u2019s not engaging. It\u2019s not true. Make them want happiness and peace and love. We all do, inside. Whatever we do on the outside. That is the only believable motive. So all your characters should only want happiness. Even revenge fantasy - which is the most extreme kind of motive most people feel - is actually wanting love and happiness deep down. The most common revenge fantasy is our own funeral - and everyone who wronged you feeling bad for what they did. This might seem like enjoying their suffering. But remember, you are able to SEE your funeral. That\u2019s the important bit. So really - you are wanting to hear your enemies speak about you with love. You want to hear love. That\u2019s what it is really about. Even Hitler wanted to make the world better. He wanted to live in a world where everyone loved and admired him. Who doesn\u2019t? But for Hitler, it seemed easier to achieve that by popping endless pills to inflate his self-confidence, and to kill millions upon millions of people who would never love him - than to achieve it by becoming a better person. In life, as in writing: evil is easy, good is not. Just like exams are only easy if you cheat. So in summary I would suggest something like this: Write an unhappy good character. Write it seeing the whole world that way. Write about the character feeling trapped. They can\u2019t seem to escape their fate as unhappy. They are stuck in it. This will match the readers powerlessness, as a reader not controlling the events. So they won\u2019t notice how they are not making the choices - you won\u2019t spoil the illusion of agency. Instead you will trick the reader into feeling like they are inside the puppet - because the puppet can\u2019t pull its own strings. And it will make the reader itch for freedom. Then offer the character a hope. There is a method that could free him from unhappiness. Ideally make it so that they have one chance to take - or lose it forever. The reader will want them to take it - it\u2019s too frustrating to read about someone not taking a risk. It\u2019s disappointing. We want drama from a story. Good or bad. So when they take it - you will be able to write it like you mean it, and the reader will secretly be pleased with themselves - they wanted the character to take it and the character did. They chose bravery over cowardice - action over inaction. The reader will feel like they chose it. Well done them. But\u2026 that chance they just took\u2026 it might be an escape from unhappiness, but it also leads away from the world of being good. And that glimmer on the horizon: that\u2019s a flickering flame. The light at the end of the tunnel is the door to hell. ",

            "answer_text": "I would first get rid of the idea of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d in the sense that a character should be either wholly evil or wholly good. Even the best people we know have flaws, and even the worst people we know have some redeemable quality or something good about them. Nobody is wholly good or evil. That being said, if you want to take someone with predominately bad traits and write their arc so that they become good, have one of their flaws prevent what they want. They have to overcome something negative in their life in order to get it. You can also use a dose of their own medicine to teach them a lesson, and maybe this turns their internal logic on its head. There\u2019s lots of ways you can do it. Get creative. But most importantly, write their arc. Don\u2019t intend for them to go from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cevil\u201d. Intend for them to have an arc. Give them something they want, and put one of their traits at a crossroads with it. You\u2019ll quickly see the character come to life when you start fleshing out the arc and asking yourself how far they\u2019re willing to go to get it, and what they\u2019re willing to risk/change to do so. It can be addiction, loss, anger, depression, anything that acts as the catalyst. ",
