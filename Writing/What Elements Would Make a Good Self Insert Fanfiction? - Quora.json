            "answer_text": "A self-insert character should be: Realistic, with flaws and faults. Their reactions should be unfeigned and natural. In other words, if you have a girl from the 20th century set down in the The Lord of the Rings, she should not have magical powers, be instantly the darling of everyone or have superb archery and sword fighting skills.As unknowledgeable of the plot as the other characters. There are some self-inserts that work well with the SI knowing the plot up until the point where they were inserted into the story, but those stories acknowledge that this knowledge becomes less and less useful as changes are made. The SI should not share the author\u2019s omniscience.Facing their own challenges and obstacles. There\u2019s nothing worse than a SI who dismisses all difficulties with a wave of her dainty hand.A foil for the other characters. The best self-inserts I\u2019ve read have caused dilemmas for the other characters just by existing.Funny or amusing. While the very best SI I know of isn\u2019t either, most of the SIs I\u2019ve liked have made me laugh, either by their \u2018fish out of water\u2019 behavior or their quirks.",

            "answer_text": "Characterization. Especially characterizing you and characterizing the main characters of the work.A real story line. Not the same one as the original work, a real story line of your own unless the entire premise is that you do what the main character did, but better.Length. Most people don\u2019t care about a self-insert fanfic that\u2019s 2k. If you want people to notice it (I assume that\u2019s why you asked), you need to write a long work.Generally good writing. If you have good grammar and spelling, and you understand the original work, your work is more likely to be appreciated.",
