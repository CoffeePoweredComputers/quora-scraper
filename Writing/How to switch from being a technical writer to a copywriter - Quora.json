            "answer_text": "Most writers try it the other way. From copy to tech. Because of the attractive compensation. You'd probably have to take a big pay cut. And be prepared to prove your mettle. From scratch. Believe me, its tougher to do that. Any one with some basic writing skills can get away as a tech writer. Not so with copy. Copy has to sell. Tech documentation, well, not so much. RTFM right? Youd start with creating an attractive profile. Something that really piques the interest of someone in the agency. If they call you, don't blow it up with unreasonable expectations. If you are truly good at copy, they'd know. If not, hey, RTFM pays the bills! ",
