            "answer_text": "Types of Real Estate Investing Real estate investing comes in different shapes and sizes. I want you to understand your options so you can make the best decision for your situation. Here are the most common ways people invest in real estate. Home Ownership We need a mindset shift in our culture. Lots of people have the ambition to buy a home, but I want you to reach higher. The goal is to own that bad boy. Home ownership is the first step in real estate investing, and it\u2019s a huge part of achieving financial peace. As long as you keep paying taxes and insurance on your property, you don\u2019t have to worry about ever losing your house. You can stay calm regardless of the ups and downs of the real estate market, and it also frees up your budget to start saving for other types of investments. The fact is, paying off your home is one of the best long-term investments you can make. It won\u2019t increase your cash flow, but it will be a huge boost to your net worth by giving you ownership of a valuable asset. Pay off your own house first before investing in any other type of real estate. Rental Properties Owning rental properties is a great way to create additional revenue\u2014it could easily add thousands of dollars to your yearly income. Then, if you decide to sell, you could earn a nice profit. It all depends on what type of property you buy and how you manage it. The key is to always buy in a good location that has potential for growth. Hear me on this: While rental properties are a great investment option, being a landlord has its challenges. You\u2019ll face seasons when someone doesn\u2019t pay rent or you\u2019re in between renters. You also have to consider the additional expenses of maintenance, repairs and insurance. And then there\u2019s the time cost: When the toilet busts at 2 a.m., guess who has to come to the rescue? Yup\u2014you! Ever heard of Murphy\u2019s Law? Things that can go wrong will go wrong. So always buy rental properties with cash (debt is not an option), and remember to build an emergency fund that\u2019ll cover three to six months of living expenses. House Flipping Flipping a house means you purchase it, make updates and improvements, and then sell it\u2014all within a fairly quick amount of time. House flipping is appealing because it\u2019s a quicker process than renting out a property for years. In a matter of months, you could get the house back on the market and (hopefully) turn a nice profit. But just like other investments, there\u2019s a risk you won\u2019t make money on it\u2014in fact, you could even lose money. When flipping a house, remember that the key is to buy low. In most cases, you can\u2019t expect to make a decent profit unless you\u2019re really getting a great deal on the front end. Before you jump into house flipping, talk to a real estate agent about the potential in your local market. Flipping houses isn\u2019t always as glamorous as the HGTV shows make it seem. If you absolutely love hands-on work, then have at it! But make sure to budget plenty of time and money for the process. Updates and renovations almost always cost more than you think they will. How to Make Money Investing in Real Estate You can make money from real estate properties two different ways: appreciated value of the property over time and cash flow from rental income. We\u2019ll break all that down in a bit. But before we jump in, I want to make something crystal clear: You should pay for investment properties with 100% cash. Don\u2019t even think about getting into debt for a rental property, people! A 100% down payment takes debt out of the equation, lowers your risk, and sets you up to make more money a lot sooner.

            "answer_text": "Real estate works like this: You buy, rent or sell property and/or the rights to it. You do that with the intention of making money, or, if renting, getting the lowest rent you can as a tenant and the highest rent you can as a landlord. When you buy property, you get a deed. This is like the title to a car. You own it, and there is a record. When you sell it, the title goes to the buyer. Real estate transactions are in writing. They must be, to be enforceable. The principle most investors use is universal: buy low, sell high. Most people who buy property get loans, called mortgages. The terms of most mortgages are either 15 or 30 years. In most countries around the world, everyday people without much money are not able to buy property. In America, our democracy extends to real estate. If you can negotiate a deal, you can own any property anywhere in the country regardless of race, religion or ethnicity. You just have to have the money or credit to buy. Hope that helps. ",
