But I do have a five-line segment of a poem that I feel is one of the most magnificent that I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s from Thomas Gray\u2019s magnificent \u201cElegy Written in a Country Churchyard.\u201d (You know the old saying that if one has to guess the source of a popular expression or a book title or\u2026 then, it\u2019s probably from the Bible or Shakespeare. Well, to perfectly cover the waterfront, we\u2019d have to honestly also include Gray\u2019s \u201cElegy\u201d and Alexander Pope\u2019s \u201cEssay on Criticism.\u201d) Gray wrote this very thoughtful work about 1750 or 1751. In it he addresses all the advantages that certain people have in life. He writes about these four groups: 1 - The royalty (or those of high position) 2 - The powerful 3 - The beautiful 4 -The wealthy. Covenant, you have to admit, those four groups certainly have great advantages in life. Well, Thomas Gray pretty much evens the score when he wrote: The boast of heraldry, The pomp of power, And all that beauty, all that wealth e\u2019er gave, Await alike th\u2019 inevitable hour\u2026 The paths of glory lead but to the grave. That evens the score, doesn\u2019t it? ",
