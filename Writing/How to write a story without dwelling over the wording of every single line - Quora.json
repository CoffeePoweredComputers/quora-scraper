            "answer_text": "Practice and experience \u2014 by writing daily. At first, you almost certainly will labor over every line, and you should. This is how you hone your craft. But as time goes on, and you become more experienced, the writing will come more naturally. Your mind will intuitively know what to write. Eventually, although you\u2019ll still write and rewrite many lines, you\u2019ll trust yourself on the other ones. It\u2019s like when you first learn to drive a car. Those beginning trips are almost harrowing simply because there seems to be so much to pay attention to. You have pedals, a steering wheel, and instrument panels, and other cars and pedestrians and lights and signs. It\u2019s all too much. But over time, your attention (your conscious attention) increasingly narrows to what really matters. Your subconscious attention is taking care of the routine stuff. You don\u2019t need to think how far down to push the pedal; you just do it. Writing is like this. After time, a lot of it just flows and you develop a sense for which sentences and words to labor over. Thanks for the A2A \u2014 great question!
