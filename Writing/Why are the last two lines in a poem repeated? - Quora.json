            "answer_text": "IMO uneducated opinion\u2026 I think Frost may well have wanted to emphasize, in addition to what precedes the last two lines, same words repeated - \u201cMiles to go before I sleep\u201d, that: 1.) He wanted to really emphasize that he, like many of us may feel, we have many things we would like \u201cto do\u201d and finalize before we die, thus the repetition drives home this point\u2026. -or- 2. They may point to 2 meanings\u2026 perhaps: Two different types of accomplishments or experiences he wishes to do before he \u201csheds this mortal coil\u201d though he didn\u2019t write these particular words\u2026 I just thought I\u2019d throw them in. :-) p.s. I was unable to find who, when, and where the \u201cshed this mortal coil\u201d wording was first written and to whom it is attributed\u2026 as well as if in poetry, prose, or on a sidewalk? Just thought I\u2019d mention this coil-y thing. :-) p.p.s. - OK, so I\u2019m Not a Poet and I Really Know it. (rephrased a little\u2026) ",

            "answer_text": "It provides a sense of closure. It's for the same reason that Shakespeare often rhymes the last two lines of a blank-verse scene, for that sense of finality. For I have promises to keep And miles to go before I sleep And miles to go before I sleep. By repeating the last line, Frost not only gives strong closure to the poem, but also gives enormous weight to the repeated line. It becomes the root of the whole poem, the thing we have been digging for. ",
