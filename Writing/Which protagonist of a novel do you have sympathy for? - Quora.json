Primarily, losing a loved one, facing a difficult situation in life, losing a battle etc. are scenarios in which I feel sympathetic towards the protagonist. Harry Potter, Kaladin(from the Stormlight Archive), Severus Snape, Peeta (from The Hunger Games) are some of the characters for whom I have felt sympathy. ",

            "answer_text": "The first 50 pages, I thought Albert Camus' famous novel, The stranger, was actually a poor disguise for an insipid and quite frankly insulting philosophy about how we should react to societal norms and the moral dichotomy of black-and-white thinking that has always been so popular with wide audiences.  The protagonist, Mersault, was a pretentious and insensitive young man, whose sole purpose in life seemed to be narrating daily events with as much blandness as one can muster. Any other character in the book was, of course, presented through his eyes, so it's hard to tell if these people were really as flawed and pathetic as Mersault saw them. Here, though, I began to question my previous dislike.  Mersault's background characters were indeed sinister - a girlfriend obsessed with the idea of love, a neighbor who constantly mistreated his old dog, a violent and abusive friend who regularly beat his own girlfriend. However, Mersault never judges any of them, nor tries to stop the behaviour. He analyses and comforts each one, regardless of how \u2018badly' they behave. Mersault is quite indiferrent to strong human emotion, but that is exactly what makes him a truly impartial person and somehow, the personification of objective truth. People say that is what they want, but in all honesty, objective truth is cruel and more often than not, it deforms the people who try to attain it.  Mersault is not a sociopath, he does not desire to hurt anyone. In his best moments, Mersault shines with neutral kindness, the likes of which most of us only see in children - when his mean neighbor loses his dog and comes crying to the protagonist's door, Mersault promises to help him find his pet. No show of weakness is too uncomfortable for Mersault, a trait that eventually becomes his demise.  \u201c Mother died today.\u201d  The opening line of the novel has often been translated wrongly, with the 1946 version using the word \u201cmum\". There is little to no warmth in how Mersault speaks of his mother, explaining that they had long since run out of things to say to each other. The tragedy of a mismatched family of strangers, a peculiar maternal bond that never materialised is more common than people think. Families are often made up of people who have nothing in common with each other. Perhaps this is where Mersault's indifference is first nurtured.  The protagonist fails to cry at his mother's funeral and this is to be his crime. Make no mistake, Mersault actually commits a crime in the novel, but his lawyer candidly explains that no one could convict a white man for killing an Arab in this little idylic French colony in Africa. The same society that willingly condones racism is less forgiving of \"strange\" outsiders who do not like and are not moved by the same things as them. This is the irony of the book which Mersault bears until the end. For his truth, his otherness, he dies and refuses to pretend, even for his own salvation, to shed a tear at something he deems factual.  In his last moments, Mersault deeply scares the Catholic priest who offers him absolution - \"I had only a little time left and I didn't want to waste it on God\".  Mersault is unique; he recognises the thousands of millions of people who died as nobodies, forgotten in the grandeur of the world, passive and unremarkable and swallowed by time. Human history is nothing but a farce, a power play, a passing fancy and Mersault does not care if he goes down in history as a ruthless psychopath as long as he is true to himself.  Mersault is not bad and he is not good, but even if people want to pretend that moral standards have evolved since the Middle Ages, grey is one hell of an uncomfortable colour.   I myself have always desired to become a lawyer. I cannot help but sympathise with Mersault - if a person is different, reacts differently, does this mean he no longer deserves a place in society?   \" I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world.\" ",
