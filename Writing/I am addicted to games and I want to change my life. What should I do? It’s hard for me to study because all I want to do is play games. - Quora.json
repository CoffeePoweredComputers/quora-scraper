            "answer_text": "Though I've never worked with someone with a game 'addiction' before, I've certainly spent far too long playing Assassin's Creed and I've worked with people who want to change their behaviours for all my career. I think there are useful techniques that we can borrow from approaches to drug and alcohol dependency. First, you've got to figure out what is acceptable to you, and work out your goals from there. They can't be my goals or anyone else's but yours. Say you're spending four hours a day gaming and ideally you'd like to get it down to a couple of hours, three days a week. There is a clear start point and end point to your 'recovery journey'. Next, figure out what you're going to do instead of playing the game. There's no point to any of this if what you decide to do instead of playing is sit quietly watching TV. Because the console's right next to it, and you know your game is in the tray. Or at the computer if playing is only one click away. It's kind of like a dependent drinker agreeing to not drink and going to stare through the window of the liquor store instead. Are there any positive activities that you want to try? Gym? Cooking? Outdoorsy stuff? The void must be filled with busy-ness, so there's no room to think about that next achievement that you need to get. Being out of the house and away from the game is really important. Try hanging with people who don't game and aren't impressed by gamers. They already have the qualities you want to model. Have a chat with yourself about what rewards you feel when you get the achievements, and how ridiculous it is that 50 points doesn't translate to anything in the real world. Imagine yourself in a conversation years from now. The group is regaling their amazing life experiences, where they've been in the world and the fantastic people they met on the way. Imagine telling them about the rush of relief, success and power that comes when you get the full 1000 and how many times you've felt that. I can imagine their polite smiles already.  Now keep a track of your hours logged in a diary. Ask what mood you were in and why you gave yourself permission to break your agreement. Make small goals on the way to where you're going. Maybe first week agree to cut down to 3 hrs from 4. Then work on dropping a day. Another hour, another day etc. rewards yourself with cool experiences, not stuff, and definitely not a new game. The cool experiences stick with you forever, and give you something positive and meaningful to say in that future conversation. Stuff gets broken, lost, disappointing, obsolete and embarrassing, so won't keep rewarding you with a good memory and serotonin release when you think about using it. Experiences will. Another piece of advice is the 'all or nothing' approach - cold turkey. Sell your console, delete the game, snap the disc. It's a big ask, but some people can really do this. If you feel you can't, consider lending it to someone for a couple of weeks until you feel in control and have established rules. Any 'withdrawals' you may feel are temporary, safe and all psychological. With some substances, this can be very dangerous, as it's not safe to simply empty out alcohol receptors, for example. The dopamine receptors in your brain which are engaged when you play can be stimulated and filled with dopamine from other, real life achievements, you don't need substitution therapy.  We all need healthy balance. Too much of anything is not good for us. Escaping into a game is ace, I love it, and I have to apply these rules to myself. I keep an eye on the clock, I set myself a goal to achieve this session, and get the hell out. The worst thing that's happened to me is I've lost sleep because my bedtime was so late, and I didn't perform at work the next day to my best ability. Actually, no, the worst thing is completing a game in one session and feeling like I need a new game tomorrow. Because that really is problematic. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "Well first of all we tend to use the word \u201caddiction\u201d very casually simply to mean we really like doing something a lot, confusing the word \u201caddiction\u201d with \u201chabit\u201d. What\u2019s the difference? The real difference between an addiction and a habit is that a habit is something we do regularly and usually get some pleasure from. An addiction happens when the habit takes control over us, and even if we no longer get any pleasure from the activity we compulsively keep doing it. By definition if you truly are addicted to video games then there is nothing you can do about it, you have lost control over your life and you will need external help to change your life. You can ask friends or family or seek professional help if you are truly convinced that you are no longer in control. Assuming however you are not an addict you just enjoy playing a lot of games and are easily distracted by the instant gratification that comes from gaming as opposed to the deferred gratification that comes from real life achievements, then you might find this revision video helpful. It\u2019s about how to prioritise your life so that you can do what you have to do and still have time for what you want to do. It might help motivate you to study.  Another idea is that you could set yourself specific and attainable study goals and when you have completed those goals reward yourself with a specified number of minutes gaming. A lot of games these days have great parental control facilities which can be used to limit the times you can play the games. If not you can use a timer on your mobile to count down the minutes you have allowed yourself to play. This prevents you from losing track of time when you are immersed in the game. Another idea is to set yourself gaming days when you allow yourself to game and study days when you devote yourself to study. Hope some of these suggestions help and good luck with your studies. ",
