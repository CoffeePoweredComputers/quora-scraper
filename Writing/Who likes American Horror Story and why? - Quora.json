            "answer_text": "I enjoy it on a season-by-season basis. That being said, there are certain reasons I do or don't enjoy certain seasons. Things I like- The show is often very good at imagery and the production values are solid.It\u2019s fun to watch as a soap opera and trying to guess what will happen next week is always interesting.Solid acting from a strong cast that plays many different roles! Watching people play wildly different roles from season to season is great.Some parts of it are actually scary. I found a good part of Murder House to be quite creepy for some reason! In many ways I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever surpass the first season.Things I didn\u2019t like as much- Some of the writing feels forced and sometimes it seems like people do things that are very out-of-character in the show to get to a desired plot point. The latest season, Cult, was very guilty of this in my opinion.The pacing can be a little off. Some episodes seem like they have little forward movement in the story, where others take leaps and bounds. It feels strange when this becomes very noticeable.Although I don\u2019t have a problem with the political aspects of the show, sometimes it feels forced to the point of being a thinly veiled message rather than a story involving multiple realistic characters. Cult also dropped the ball here.The side plots can be interesting and fun, but without a central theme tying them together they just run all over the place. Asylum was terribly guilty of this- between Bloody Face, the aliens, the devil possessing Sister Mary Eunice, the Nazi doctor, and Sister Jude\u2019s moral ambiguity, what could have been an interesting plot became a jumbled mess that was impossible to satisfyingly conclude.I\u2019ll watch it, but I\u2019m a very season-by-season watcher. Honestly, most people are probably in the same boat. With so many different seasons, it\u2019s kind of difficult to like them all. I still need to watch Hotel and Roanoke, the former of which I hear is excellent, and the latter terrible. Who knows though, I might have a different opinion after seeing it for myself. ",

            "answer_text": "I have only seen the first two seasons. I keep trying to get around to watching more, but there\u2019s never enough time. It\u2019s alright. Not the best thing I have seen, but it is generally well written, has fresh ideas, great casting, good acting, and good production values. I think it does go on for too long. I would like the seasons to tell the same story in, say, six episodes. I feel there is too much fluff and unnecessary detours. It does drag on a bit. But overall I would say it is worth watching. ",
