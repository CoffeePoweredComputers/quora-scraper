Saying that, I may give give the client up to 100 extra words (if the article requires that). I am from Australia, and I know there are writers who charge less but I feel my work is worth it and I have no trouble getting that money. I am not a beginner, though. I charged much less when I started just to build a client base and get myself known. ",
