            "answer_text": "You might not die at all. Severed or severely-injured muscular arteries constrict, limiting flow, and with immobility or a little external pressure (lying on the arm, for example) clotting might occur before fatal blood loss. I remember reading a story of an American bomber crewman in World War II who, while operating as top-turret gunner, was struck in the shoulder by an explosive 20mm round from a German fighter. He was rendered unconscious and his arm was severed too closely for other crewmen to place a tourniquet, so they injected morphine into the area, strapped on a dressing and a parachute, and pushed him out of the plane (with the ripcord pulled) at 20,000 feet. He survived both his injury and the drop and was treated by German medical personnel in a POW camp. ",
