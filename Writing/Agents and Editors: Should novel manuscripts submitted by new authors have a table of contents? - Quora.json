The inherent structure of the story should enable the reader to smoothly move through the work. However, your fictional submission should include a strong summary or description of the story in the cover letter, usually no more than a single page. Think jacket copy. If a novel s very complex with many characters or intricate timelines, sometimes an author will include a cast of characters or a timeline. Authorlink\u00ae ",

If you\u2019ve done something clever like written a poem where each line is a chapter title, maybe \u2014but even then, I think it would be more fun to see whether the editor noticed what you\u2019d done. If the chapters are just numbered, then no, don\u2019t provide a table of contents. ",

For example, you might have a book about COVID; one reader wants to know about treatments, another wants to know about prevention, another about WHO stats. So you have a TOC to point out each chapter. None of that is necessary (or even particularly useful) with a novel. ",
