            "answer_text": "Congratulations! I don\u2019t know what to tell you since I\u2019m in a similar situation myself. I\u2019ve spent all weekend asking others how I should go about choosing which one to attend and they\u2019ve all recommended that I attend revisits before making a final decision. I\u2019ll just pass on what I\u2019ve been advised to you. On revisit day, you\u2019ll get to sit in on your host\u2019s classes, which will help you determine if the school\u2019s teaching style is right for you. If you\u2019re a person that prefers lectures over discussion-based learning, then Groton might be the better pick for you since they only use Harkness in some classes (to my knowledge anyways). It\u2019s imperative that you choose the school that is most congruous with your learning style. After all, you are going to boarding school to learn. The social aspect of it all is important as well. Revisit days will, again, help with this. Do you like the atmosphere of the school? Do you see yourself making friends? Will you be happy attending this school? Keep those sorts of questions in mind during revisits. You should also talk to your tour guide. I\u2019m not sure about Groton but at the end of my Exeter tour, I was given my tour guide\u2019s email address. I was told to email her whenever I had questions. She\u2019s been great help throughout the process and over the weekend, she told me the reasons why she yes to Exeter. I personally found this super helpful so maybe you should email your tour guides and ask them what made them choose the school they chose. You might find this helpful as well. Lastly, go with your guts. Hopefully, this is self-explanatory. Once again, congratulations! ",

            "answer_text": "First off, congratulations! If I were in your shoes right now, this is what I would do: Contact or call the admissions office and ask them if you could talk to someone from both schools who currently attend, preferably seniors.Ask them what the culture is like and the pros and cons of each school.Tell them what your interests are (if none, totally fine!) and see if the clubs, courses, or events they name sound funListen really well.Repeat steps with potential AlumniPlay with other personal factors (cost, financial aid, culture, etc.)Then DecideWhat I DONT recommend: Look up which school sends their kids to the most Ivy\u2019sLook up successful alumniLook up who became a billionaire and where you're more likely to be oneLook up which school has better foodIn the end, there\u2019s no right choice in life. Robert Frost once talked about \u201cThe Road Not Taken,\u201d but little do most people know the road actually makes no difference. What matters is what you think is best for you, and where you will learn/grow the most.  Look at this man! Good luck, Rohan. ",
