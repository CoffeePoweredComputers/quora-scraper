            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll do my best to give you advice, though in the end you have to honor your style. Hopefully you can do that without going through all kinds of contortions. If you\u2019re not used to including characters of color in your work, you may find it challenging at first. It\u2019ll take practice, like everything else. Repetition of a character\u2019s ethnicity when they\u2019re an unnamed character can be a problem when you don\u2019t use names or other monikers. What do I mean by a moniker? You \u2018nickname\u2019 unnamed characters so that the reader can keep track of who is who without having to repeat physical descriptions. For example, if I have an assault going on in an alley, I might nickname the assaulting characters Bottle Man, Knife Woman and Boxer Kid. Or whatever. A moniker is far preferable than drawing unnatural attention to ethnicity. But maybe you\u2019re less concerned about repeatedly calling an unnamed character a black man or a Hispanic woman and more interested in the initial description. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 and somewhat tacky to describe people in terms of food. It\u2019s not only overused to describe someone as hot chocolate or cafe au lait, those may have racist overtones, just like calling someone a \u2018red Indian\u2019 (shudder) or a \u2018yellow Oriental.\u2019 BTW, Oriental is for objects, not people. Asian people are Asian, and hopefully if you have an Asian character, you\u2019ll be describing them more specifically, since Asia covers a lot more ground than the United States, and the United States has quite the collection of cultures. If a description has been used since before the 70\u2019s, chances are that you\u2019ll want to avoid it. So what does that leave? Natural objects, such as earth, metals, woods. It\u2019s easy to fall back on the \u2018normal\u2019 ones like bronze and mahogany, so you\u2019ll want to spend some time really thinking on this. Presumably you have a setting, right? Bring that setting in. \u201cHe reminded me of that summer when the shadows of vast clouds played over the fields, turning them a mysterious color that was neither gold nor brown but a rich color in between, and his hair was like the deepest shade where I would hide and fan myself while watching the river flow by.\u201d \u201cShe looked like she ought to be driving a red Lamborghini in a white dress, her dark skin as perfect as a supermodel\u2019s, her auburn-toned hair cut short and neat in a style that I always wished I could pull off.\u201d If you don\u2019t write long-winded, you could address what you think is the most important aspect of your character from the beginning. Try not to make that first thing their skin color. It should be more important that they\u2019re physically imposing, or small and delicate, or they\u2019re laughing and carefree, graceful, or you notice their clothes, or that they\u2019re carrying a weapon. And remember, it will be your character noticing these things, so whatever the character notices first will be what the reader will assume is the most important detail to that character. If it\u2019s always skin color, that may suggest some unpleasant things about that character that you don\u2019t intend to suggest. Beyond these suggestions, it\u2019s hard to give more specific advice because it really will depend on your style. Everyone is on their own to develop their own style. Don\u2019t be afraid to write \u201che was the only black man at the Vietnamese restaurant.\u201d It\u2019s shorthand and inoffensive. If you\u2019re new to including a diverse cast of characters, you might check out the following links. The first is to an Atlantic article on appropriation that\u2019s a good starting point. It\u2019s not the last word on the subject for sure, though, so don\u2019t become complacent. The second link leads to annoying movie clich\u00e9s. Within that list are quite a few that point out plot points that turn on racist assumptions and stereotypes. The Dos and Don'ts of Cultural Appropriation What are some of the most annoying movie clich\u00e9s? Finally, if you\u2019re a writer who\u2019s serious about this subject, you should visit author Steve Barnes\u2019 website. This subject comes up fairly often on his blog, as do other topics related to diversity, representation, and writing ethically. Steven Barnes I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not offensive to describe skin color as a physical trait, any more than it is to describe eye color, and it is as relevant as any other trait. In fact, to *my* mind it is racist to shy away from fundamental descriptions out of fear that drawing attention to skin color will somehow be offensive. It is part of our appearance, as relevant as anything else one might notice when looking at a person. Ignoring it is dishonest. And I don\u2019t agree with the food restriction. Snow White had skin the color of cream and lips like ripe cherries. It doesn\u2019t \u201cobjectify\u201d a person to liken his or her coloring to a familiar image. Also some food words like cocoa, chocolate, and mocha are legitimate color names. I have heard all of those used by black actors, and black characters in TV shows, to describe other black people. Mahgony, olive (which in skin tone means golden, not green) , golden, bronze, ruddy, and copper are all good descriptions, as are color names : brown, sienna, umber\u2026.however you should assume that some readers will not know technical color names. \u201cFair\u201d is the traditional term for a pale complextion with pink undertones. Pale also works. There is a skin color in one part of Africa that is actually deep charcoal, quite dramatic, so actual black skin is not impossible, but make sure that\u2019s what you mean. I don\u2019t personally have an issue with referring to race, if that\u2019s what characters would notice. \u201cA tall, good looking black man entered the room\u201d should not offend anyone (though it gives us no particular clue about his coloring.) Freedom from racism does not mean we don\u2019t notice physical differences between people. As a side note, most readers will assume a character is white unless you indicate otherwise, especially in fantasy novels. I\u2019ve been on writer panels where authors shared stories about fans and even cover artists rendering characters of color as white; every writer seemed to have one (including me). If you want your characters to be non-white, don\u2019t be too subtle. I\u2019ll see if I can\u2019t dig up some of my own descriptions of dark skinned characters as examples when I get to my real computer. Regarding the person questioning how often you should mention that an African American character is African American\u2026er, once. Skin color, like eye color, weight, or height, might be repeated if there\u2019s a moment when it makes a nice image, but there\u2019s no reason to assume that if you don\u2019t keep repeating a racial cue your readers will forget it. ADDED: Okay, here are the descriptive intros for my three of my dark-skinned characters, so you can see how I personally handled it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 TOSHIDA: Has been active in the story for about five pages, among people who know him well and would not take note of his appearance. This is from the POV of newly arrived visitors: Two oil lamps cast dim golden light about the room and its occupants; its hue lent an eerie cast to the Regent\u2019s dark skin, like that of an ancient bronze statue.  SONONDRA RA: Next to enter was a figure whose surface glittered with a thousand rainbow gems. Lean, lithe, and dark-skinned, Sonondra Ra wore as little clothing as protocol permitted, in order that the sensors which studded her skin might have as maximum data input. They glittered like diamonds as she moved, tiny contacts embedded in her cocoa skin.  DEVON: My protag met him online; this is their first live meeting. I\u2019m not sure why it surprised me that Devon turned out to be black. He was a good-looking guy, with dark skin and long, lean features. He was also tall\u2014very tall\u2014and his height was all in his legs, giving him the look of a marathon runner. So\u2026that\u2019s my own approach\u2026simple, matter of fact, unself-conscious. Just tell the reader what the characters would notice, in the language that describes it best. ",
