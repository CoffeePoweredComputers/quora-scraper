            "answer_text": "Stories are often formatted in prose and stacked in ACTS from TEASER to TAG. You give the most important information about what happens and who does what, including subplots and spoilers. You\u2019re look at 2\u20133 pages tops. These are usually written in the writer\u2019s room on a white board or on strips that are attached to a wall or door. Then the Secretary or Script Editor will type them out in prose and everyone will go over things, removing, changing, adding. Plot elements and subplot elements are contained in each act. Often at the end of act 3 something new crops up and they take off in a new direction following up on this new event or information. That leads to the crisis or chase or shoot-out in the end of act 4, continues in act 5 and resolves. Then the tag out where they all go home or go for a drink. Scripts are always done in Final Draft. Acts are typically 5\u20137 pages long and the entire show runs 42 minutes or 42\u201350 pages of script if we take the average of 1 page per minute. For novels it\u2019s similar except you do it in chapters. You start with the problem, introduce the characters and tell the audience what motivates them to get into the action. Then it\u2019s off down the Yellow Brick Road. You meet helpers and mentors along the way. A chapter for each of these or all of these. There\u2019s sometimes a bad guy in your midst posing as a helper, but they are really there to slow you down and lead you astray. Chapter(s) for these. The Femme Fatale and romance chapter. She might also send you down the wrong path. Traps set by the bad guys. Maybe the authorities think you\u2019re the bad guys. A chapter for that. Around the middle something new happens. We are off the Yellow Brick Road and into the woods looking for the wicket witch because Oz wants her broomstick. (In The China Syndrome the change happens when he finds the phony X-rays and confronts the head of testing and they send bad guys off to kill him and he goes to the plant and takes it over. In 48 Hours it\u2019s when Reggie tells Jack about the money and they stake the place out and see Luther going to get it. Now we\u2019re in a new direction. In Michael Crichton\u2019s Airframe it\u2019s when Casey starts to realize that something went wrong in the cockpit and people are lying and her assistant is out to get her with her boss. So she goes down a new path trying to uncover what happened in the cockpit and pulls that out of a hat as a surprise, plus a little twist, and becomes a hero. Up until that point they were looking for a problem with the plane, with the Airframe.) There are more wrong turns. Maybe people get captured along the way and you have to save them, get them out. Then comes the battle or crisis point. This is in the last 1/4 of the book and close to the end. It can go on for two chapters. Then there\u2019s the closing tag where everyone slaps each other on the back and goes have a drink. The only difference between movie scripts, TV shows and novels is novels can go into more detail, have more subplots, meet more people, go more places. They don\u2019t have time and budget restrictions, which is why books don\u2019t translate over to movies that faithfully. A book is more like a TV Mini Series. The story outline is bare bones. You fill in all the details writing the novel or script. I sometimes do timelines if the book runs over a period of time and most of my books are at least a decade long. Sometimes I plan things past death of the first main character and into the grandchildren. Sometimes I plot out the rising wealth and how it was accumulated. The houses they have around the world. Their sources of income. Sometimes I pick out character actors and image them as my characters. I find it easy to write dialog when I think of a character I know from TV or movies. Sometimes I create their avatars using avatar design programs. One author I looked at uses Second Life to create her world and characters. I found that interesting as an associate of mine has been after me to use Second Life. I have created birth certificates, college diplomas, baptismal certificates, driver licenses, pilot licenses, passports, visas for character. That includes the birth dates way in the future, like in the year 2345. I need to keep track of character ages. Backgrounds. I do backstories that never get published. I do interviews. Q&A sessions. None of that goes into the book but it makes the characters live for me. ",

            "answer_text": "Professional writers format their stories according to the style sheets of their publishers. Every writer has their own way of organizing their work, and it varies enormously. There are countless potential digital formats and various ways of organizing stuff by people who still use typewriters or write longhand. But when it comes to professional writing, for which the author expects to see publication, there\u2019s a layer of concerns beyond personal preferences. Publishers define what they want manuscripts to look like, prescribing things like margins, fonts, sizes, formatting for titles and chapter headings, and the like. A professional author writing for a given publisher or simply anticipating writing for that publisher must format their work (or reformat it, if they\u2019ve started it another way) to conform to those styles.
