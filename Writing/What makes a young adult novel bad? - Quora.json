            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking the YA market is easier to break into than writing for adults. This is a very competitive marketplace and you have to compete with the best. Young people are sophisticated consumers and have many excellent authors to choose from, so don\u2019t annoy them by writing down to them, being preachy, or trying to copy successful YA authors. Being inspired is very different than being derivative. Using slang to look like you are one of the kids, is not a good idea. For one thing, you will probably get it wrong, and for another, it will be dated by the time the book comes out. A bad YA novel avoids controversy and comes across as bland. If a difficult issue is part of your story, address it appropriately but remember who you\u2019re writing for. A bad YA novel reads like it\u2019s from the point of view of an adult in charge, trying to get a message across to those young whippersnappers who need your superior wisdom. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience as a young person who learned to steer clear of almost any \u201cyoung adult novel\u201d written in my era, what made them bad were stereotypes, lazy character development, heavily sign-posted plot developments, already outdated slang, and, worst of all, elements of social engineering. What I mean by \u201csocial engineering\u201d: If the characters who were designed to win the reader\u2019s sympathy all ended up believing in things that some adults, TV, and movies had already been trying to nudge me toward, like sex outside of marriage* and dumping my religious beliefs*, I knew an author was attempting to play me. (*Insert in this part whatever ideas you yourself felt that adults had been pushing onto you in your youth. They could conceivably be the exact opposites of what I dealt with. These were just the ones that came up in my particular time and place.) Many years before I ever thought of studying Rhetoric as it appeared in fiction, I was already looking askance at \u201cyoung adult novels.\u201d ",
