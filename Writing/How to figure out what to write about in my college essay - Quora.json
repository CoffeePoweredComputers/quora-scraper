            "answer_text": "Unless you\u2019re applying for admission to one of the most selective colleges in the country, in which case you probably know already what you wish to write about, you might want to consider one of two directions. You can write about a specific experience you\u2019ve had which has influenced how you see the world and your place in it. Or you can write specifically about something you did which has had a positive on someone else. You should write simply, directly, and, most important, honestly about your accomplishments, hopes, fears, and aspirations while keeping it simple and honest. You don\u2019t need to be particularly complex or get over-verbose (don\u2019t write too long or difficult material). Try to keep your essay simple and direct. Being faced with a blank page is the scariest moment writers encounter. It is also the most promising. When I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, I like to brainstorm ideas, on the page, follow a few false tracks, jot down whatever comes to my mind and see where it takes me. After a while, an idea begins to take hold, which I then follow. It\u2019s a pretty good strategy. You need to find a strategy that works for you, though. Finally, you should remember that admissions people who do the first evaluation of your application have only a few minutes to make a decision on the first cut. They\u2019ll still be looking first at your GPA and SAT scores, then your activities. They will scan your essay quickly, looking for both writing skill and content, with content coming in second. Keep it direct, make it you, be honest, and stay economical. ",
