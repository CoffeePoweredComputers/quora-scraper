            "answer_text": "Scraping is a good strategy in the early days. At the very least it will keep your site from looking like a ghost town. From there, you'll need to get creative.  Reddit has recently become the canonical example of \"fake it 'till you make it\" (see How Reddit Got Huge: Tons of Fake Accounts ) though that might not be a successful approach in a marketplace setting. Have you tried reaching out to customers of competing classified ads sites and learning about what they think is lacking from the current options? Since I'm assuming you're going after a niche, rather than trying to compete with Craigslist head on, getting a few early adopters onboard would be the best way to go.  After all, nothing beats word of mouth from fanatically happy customers as a growth strategy. ",
