            "answer_text": "Usage of personal examples is perfectly fine on the the IELTS examinations for both - Writing Task 1 & 2. Infact, the Writing Task 1 (Academic) does mention that you may incorporate any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experiences. So, using personal examples is no issue at all. However, I often ask students to refrain from using personal examples. One of the most important points to remember is that one needs to keep objectivity in your essays and that examples are only helping you drive home a point that you would have made in you essay. Thus, the example must be relevant to the argument put forth and to-the-point or brief. One of the main problems using personal experiences is that people often loose the plot and tend to go on longer than required by putting forth the entire context/story of the example, which often weakens the argument instead of strengthening it. I often see students spending time on examples which they think are really thrilling or exciting (infact, that might be the case when the candidate experienced it). But, more often than not, it ends up not capturing the essence the candidate had originally thought in mind. I doubt doing so is easy in the limited time and space provided in the IELTS. But, if one can remain objective and has a really good example which can be explained well using limited number of words, I see no harm in using personal examples. Thus, it is perfectly fine to use personal experiences on the IELTS Writing Task. It is you who will have to decide whether it is prudent or not. Hope this helps.
