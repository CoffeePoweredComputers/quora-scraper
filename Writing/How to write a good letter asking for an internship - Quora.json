            "answer_text": " Hi, Well, there's no specific way of writing a good letter but one needs to look out keypoints. I read this excerpt on the internet earlier.   Do read this : Found it on Scholarships, Financial Aid, Student Loans and Colleges  An internship cover letter doesn\u2019t function like a typical cover letter. In fact, it has to work a lot harder. Chances are that if you\u2019re applying for an internship, you may be lacking in \u201creal\u201d work experience. But that\u2019s why you need an internship, right? The internship cover letter should focus more on what you want to do,  rather than what you\u2019ve done. However, don\u2019t be afraid to add previous work or extracurriculars that you think may not be relevant. For students just starting their careers, any experience is good experience. First, start by introducing yourself, and state the position for which you are applying. Next, give background information on what you\u2019re currently studying as well as your intentions toward a career in that particular field. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to mention something you\u2019ve learned about the company during your research, such as future projects they plan to work on that you\u2019d love to be involved in or recent changes  that reflect the kind of company dynamic for which you hope to work.  Use a small paragraph to talk about what you hope to do with your major and career upon graduation, and discuss how an internship with that particular company can help you reach your goals. In the final paragraphs, you can showcase your previous work experience as well as your extracurricular activities and volunteer work. Finally, close your internship cover letter by providing your contact information in addition to your desire to work and learn from the company through an internship opportunity. Check out the example attached for a little more guidance on your internship cover letter.  ",

Best tips and tricks for the question: #How do I write a good letter asking for an internship? ##4 SECRETS TO WRITE A KILLER COVER LETTER! =>1. Write a customized cover letter. Most cover letters suck. My guess is at some point you\u2019ve googled \u201ccover letter template,\u201d made a few tweaks, and used what I call the \u201cspray and pray\u201d method (sent it off to as many decent companies as you could find in the shortest amount of time). Writing a legit, personalized cover letter takes more time and effort than personalizing a resume (where you might change a bullet point here and there). So a lot of people just \u201ccheck the box\u201d and mail it in. Trust me, hiring managers can tell\u2026 you\u2019re not fooling anyone. \u2014\u2192Related post: Free ebook 395 interview questions with answers pdf Download link: CoverLetter123. com/2018/06/free-book-395-interview-questions-with-answers-pdf.html =>2. Explain what you\u2019ll deliver Once you\u2019ve hooked your reader, the next few paragraphs should explain what you can do for them and the company. \u201cSpell out very quickly and succinctly what you can walk through that company\u2019s doors and deliver, with the deliverables of the job directly in mind,\u201d said Foss. It doesn\u2019t have to be a guessing game. She pointed out that the job description will give you \u201csome very solid hints\u201d about what they\u2019re looking for. Kermes suggested using three to four bullet points within the letter. Under each one, you should \u201cquantify the outcomes you can produce to solve your recipient\u2019s biggest problems,\u201d he said. So, instead of saying \u201cI sold $300,000 worth of products at my last job,\u201d you could say \u201cI will use my past experiences to double sales of your products in the next 12 months.\u201d After all, if you write a rockstar resume, it\u2019ll have all the details about your past positions. \u2014\u2192Related post: free 32 resume templates Download link: 32ResumeTemplates.blogspot .com =>3. Make a strong first impression Your job application (resume + cover letter) is your potential dream employer\u2019s first impression of you. Your resume is your opportunity to showcase your professional experience and accomplishments. Your cover letter is your opportunity to advertise your unique personality, story, and passion. Oh and by the way, you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s sooo busy. Be respectful of the hiring manager\u2019s time and write a concise letter that packs a ton of punch. I trust you to use your discretion on cover letter length, but people always ask me for rules. So here you go: your cover letter should be 3 paragraphs.

Be Skill-Focused Most people have a resume that\u2019s structured around the jobs they\u2019ve held, rather than their skills. So turn your letter into an opportunity to highlight on 2\u20134 of your relevant abilities. Structure each paragraph around one of the skills you\u2019ve chosen to highlight, then write 2\u20133 sentences about how your experiences specifically showcase them. Again, you don\u2019t need to worry about covering everything, or even necessarily about being chronological. With this strategy, you\u2019ll avoid repeating your resume\u2014making the most of the space you have in your cover letter, and not wasting the time of your potential employer. ",
