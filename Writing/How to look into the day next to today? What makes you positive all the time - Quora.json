You managed to meet your family and spend together another night.Every morning is a new beginning.. What makes it great depends on what you do on that day.. So better plan in advance and execute if possible.Every small decision is a small step towards your destination..Look at the life as large number of small steps towards your goal. Sometimes, you may tumble and fell back. But, you can always climb back next day..Life is what you think and NOT what others think of you. So make sure that you are happy with what you are doing and make it count every day with your sincere efforts within your scope and reach.What is not in your reach, is of no concern to you..Focus only on the half glass which is always filled with water\u2026 Do not worry about the empty of other half glass..Life will be beautiful only, if you think it is..",

            "answer_text": "Im a student so cant be so philosophical but yes for sure sometimes life beats me hard to feel im isolated or i have a dumb future or im an introvert, I cant achieve anything or ill loose my special one in the upcoming years for sure.I dont even have a sibling and my parents are usually carried away with their work. BUT the ONE THING THAT KEEPS ME GOING IS that the next day is a day where ill talk with my special one ! or get to see the happy face of my grandma or get to cook or enjoy my music Believe me its a very silly reason but its so beautiful for me to think this\u2026..I always try to think in the positive aspect of what best i can expect tomorrow and boommm wonders keep me going the next day and i certainly forget all that i used to think yesterday. The real essence of the life itself is to enjoy each n everyday without thinking what will happen in my future ",
