            "answer_text": "Many don't sell them as they will return the phone back to the manufacture as it is on lone for them to review. Ones that do buy them like for initial and long term reviews will keep them because they bought them. Some give them away to family and friends and often will hold raffles or giveaways. When I owned my business I would get all kinds of phones all the time and still continued for many years after I closed it. The phones I would either keep or give away to family and friends. I like tech and electronics, always have. I had to stop this past year but I still have a desk drawer with loads of androids and iPhones I kept. Some are just great devices and always a sub in a pinch to use again. ",
