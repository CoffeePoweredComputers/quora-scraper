            "answer_text": "It's an unsafe city for the French standard for sure. Honestly it can be pretty dangerous, especially in \u201cLes Quartiers Nords\" = The Northern Districts, but those districts are isolated up north from the rest of the city, they're not even served by the public transportations, so if you intend to visit Marseille you shouldn't be worried. Marseille is a poor and dirty city with a third world feeling, most of the inhabitants are Northern Africans or Black Africans. It has an amazing history, landscapes, climate et architecture in the city center. It's an interesting place to visit, but just be aware that it's not Nice or Cannes. If you are careful, you should be just fine. Consider that the appropriate way to behave is like in a poor country, don't act like you're in an average European city. I can say that in terms of crime and inequality it is similar to Latin America. ",
