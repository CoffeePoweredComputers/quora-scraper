            "answer_text": "Reuters uses tables to summarize financial statement data on their site.  You can easily import the statements into Excel via an external web query.  Here's how you can do it: Open up Excel and on the top ribbon, click Data -> From Web (in the Get External Data\" section.Go to Reuter's website and login with your credentials.  This will ensure that the query is pulling all of the data, and not just a preview.Go to the financial statement page you're trying to import, and you'll see a Yellow Arrow next to the table.  Click the arrow (it will turn blue), and then click Import.  The data will be automatically pulled into Excel.If you know a little bit of VBA code you can automatically have Excel import the three financial statements onto three separate sheets (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows).",
