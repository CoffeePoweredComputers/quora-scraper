            "answer_text": "Technical writer here with 7+ years experience as a technical writer, from startups to a 20,000 person corporation. The money can be good. In the Bay Area where I am, experienced technical writers can make six figures and there's a lot of open jobs (though I can't speak for outside the bubble). In my personal opinion, you don\u2019t need to go back to school (though some hiring managers might disagree). The technical writers I\u2019ve met are a fairly diverse group. Many are English majors with no technical experience. Some, like myself, have some kind of technical background (programming, science, engineering). Some were journalists. Some had technical communication degrees or certifications. Most did not.  The actual skills you need (generally speaking): Good writing/editing skills: duh, although I\u2019d say only ~10% of my jobs have been actual writing. Most of it is editing, formatting, and producing the document.Understanding the technology: this will vary from job-to-job, but if you are generally good with computers, you should be able to learn what you need. I\u2019ve learned new technologies at every job. If you\u2019re documenting how an end user uses complicated software, your past experience in tech support tells me this would probably be easy for you. If you\u2019re documenting really complex high-tech stuff, you won\u2019t be expected to know it well enough to author original content (only the people creating it can do that). You\u2019ll just need to know enough to be able to edit it for grammar and flow and produce the final document. You\u2019d be surprised what you can edit with just surface knowledge of the terms involved. Good people skills: this is key. One of the hardest parts of your job will be dragging information out of extremely busy technical people, navigating company politics to get the resources you need, and hustling to keep busy when work is scarce (particularly common in smaller companies/startups). This is less of an issue if you\u2019re at a larger company that creates enough documentation to necessitate a group of technical writers and someone managing them - though at that point your bigger challenge may be keeping your soul (my one experience as a technical writer in such an environment was less than positive, as you might guess:(Psychological fit: being a technical writer is a lot like being any kind of writer. It can get lonely. The amount of time you spend talking to and collaborating with other humans will be a very small compared to your staring-at-the-screen time. This is one of the hardest parts of the job for me.Tools: The range of technical writing tools is surprisingly large. Some companies will only require you be a power user of Word. Others may require learning a more complex tool like MadCap Flare or FrameMaker. These tools take time to learn, but if you\u2019re good at learning software, it won\u2019t take too long. I learned FrameMaker on the job and was functioning at a basic level within a week. By the time I left a year later people were coming to me with advanced questions.Your biggest hurdle will probably be lack of experience. People want the role \u2018Technical Writer\u2019 on your resume, even though, IMHO, this is often short sighted. I\u2019d maybe go for for a technical writer job with less stringent requirements. Perhaps a company that just needs someone to document software similar to what you\u2019ve supported in the past (maybe even in a similar category of software?). Perhaps a company just needs someone to document internal business procedures, or write compliance reports for the government. All of these (very different) activities usually fall under the title \u201ctechnical writer\u201d. Once you have that first technical writer job and some experience, you'll be in a good position to grow as a technical writer (should you still want it).   Another angle is to start learning a hot technology. For instance, knowing an in-demand programming language can definitely get the attention of a company using that language, even if you only have a rudimentary understanding of it. I got my first technical writing job just because I had an engineering degree in a field the company was active in (and used that knowledge exactly zero times).  ",
