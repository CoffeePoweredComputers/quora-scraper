            "answer_text": "In the course of writing a paper you will almost definitely reach conclusions or think of new ideas that didn't occur to you when you set out. If you get too attached to your original intro and thesis statement, you risk fudging your results to fit your hypothesis, when you should really make your thesis fit your findings. Your introduction should be written like you're trying to explain the paper to a friend who doesn't know anything about the topic. ",
