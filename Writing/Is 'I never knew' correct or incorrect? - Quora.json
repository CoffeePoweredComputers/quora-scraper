I never knew. I did not think she was athletic at all.\u201d \u201cI just heard that New Year\u2019s Day was your birthday! I never knew that.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. \u201cI never knew\u201d is a correct phrase in slang, but gramatically in English it is incorrect. This is because we\u2019re looking at a sentence with no Direct Object for the verb \u201cknew\u201d. The phrase \u201cI never knew that,\u201d would be a correct phrase grammatically in English according to grammar rules. ",
