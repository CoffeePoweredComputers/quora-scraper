Speaking of great that reminds me of how great my great tax cut bill ever has been for the middle class saving them over 30% of their income that they can spend on themselves. Did you know my uncle was a genius just like me at MIT? He investigated the fact the windmills cause cancere and the affects of liesol on virouses. Meanwhile I have been selecting only the best people to work in my administration and they like it. They all tell me that the cabinets are the best ever and I\u2019ve given more people chances to be members of my canbinets then any other Precedent that ever lived. They call me the greatest recruiter ever. Did you see how crazy Nancy past that insane Heros Bill awhile back? Why name a bill after a sandwich? But that is crazy Nancy for you. My daughter Ivanka has created more jobs that Obama did in his entire administration, sheesh a chip n dale off the old block. Meanwhile I got the demoncrats searching for cryptonite to conneract me seeing how I conkered the virous like it was n\u2019t and my cure is gonna be distributed to every loyal voter just a few days after the erlection. Now sleepy joe he won\u2019t even know what hit him after the courts are done. Can you believe it, the greatest Supreme Court since the Supremes? They will roll back time till supremacy meant something. I built the greatest economy in the world and that dirty little spike ball came along and next thing you know the demoncrats spoiled it by bad governorships - they are so ante-american. Maga! \u201d ",

His whole appeal it in his unfettered, off-the-cuff method of standing up and vomiting repetitive, uncontrolled garbage from his mouth. His followers don\u2019t notice that he is anecdotal and repetitive. His vocabulary is on the level of a fifth grader at best. He is only able to insult and demean, make promises he will not keep, take credit for things he didn\u2019t do and bluster that he conquered a virus that is running roughshod over everyone, including his followers.

Most of it will be bullshit, bluster, blame and more bullshit though. Unless it\u2019s about how great, awesome, amazing, perfect, intelligent, funny, kind, generous, brilliant he is. Yeah, thing is he can make shit up, and funnel it directly to his mouth for hours, without first having spent any time in the brain. Which is fair enough, because as we know there is a stain of anti-intellectualism ingrained in American society which prizes action and emotion over rationalism and realism. So he does appeal to a great part of the electorate, who want to see him put on a good show, not be honest and sensible. Yes, the unprompted speech is by far Humpty Dumpty\u2019s favourite. ",

For his grand finale, he shoots himself in the feet, which are now in his mouth. The amazing thing is how many times he can do it and how many times people fall for the trick. ",

That is, if you count \u201cbetter\u201d as entertaining, unpredictable , and inspiring to Trump Supporters. A teleprompter hobbles him and he reads stiffly and without animation. Whereas when winging it, his youthful, exciting gestures and delivery come to the fore and electrify the crowd of Trump Supporters. And, even more, the impossibility of guessing which hated easy target he\u2019ll go after, or what new target he\u2019ll find to attack, or what flight of rhetorical bloviation, interspersed with gibberish and pure word salad, he\u2019ll go off on this time.

NOBODY wants to see someone get up on stage and ramble. They have been used for sometime. Probably so that the speaker will not have to look down at notes, thereby looking away from the crowd and just reading their speech, head down, looking like a clueless, unprepared fool. Perhaps, try it yourself. How long can you speak from a prepared text and engage a crowd? ",
