            "answer_text": "You can disprove Jesus\u2019 Resurrection in the same way that you can disprove time travel. When we discuss Jesus rising from death, no one is saying that it was a normal or natural occurrence. The Resurrection of Jesus is so noteworthy precisely because it\u2019s so impossible. Imagine if scientists invented time-travel. Many people would be incredibly excited about it, because it\u2019s something we all thought was impossible. We would delight to imagine all the possibilities it now provides to us. But of course, some would doubt that it\u2019s real, because so many people before thought it was impossible. They would explain it away as a deception, a magic trick, or a scam. That\u2019s how people reacted to Jesus\u2019 Resurrection. Those that saw and believed were incredibly excited. They delighted to imagine all the possibilities. With death defeated and eternal life guaranteed, then we can use our earthly lives entirely differently. We can sacrifice our earthly lives for the benefit of others, because even if we die here, we\u2019ll live forever with Jesus. Death is no longer the enemy; it\u2019s merely a point of transition. But of course, some doubted that Jesus\u2019 Resurrection was real, because so many people thought it was impossible. They tried to explain Jesus\u2019 Resurrection away as a deception, a magic trick, or a scam. They still do. If someone is determined not to believe, there\u2019s nothing you can do to make them believe. Even if you used your time machine to bring the skeptic a long-lost object from their past, they could explain it away by saying it\u2019s a clever duplicate. After all, which is easier, to duplicate an object from someone\u2019s past or to invent time travel? Even if you took them on a trip in the time machine, they could explain the trip away as a drug-induced hypnotic event, or a clever use of virtual reality, or a mind-altering sonic technology. After all, aren\u2019t all of those options easier than inventing time travel? If someone doesn\u2019t want to believe, they won\u2019t. But if someone is open-minded, then you have hope. Jesus\u2019 disciples did not believe He had risen from death, at first. When the women who went to the empty tomb reported that Jesus had risen from death, the disciples scoffed. As honest skeptics, they didn\u2019t understand how someone who was clearly dead could be alive again. They remained skeptical until Jesus appeared to them directly. Not only did Jesus appear, but He let them examine His body to see for sure that He had died and was alive again. Jesus showed them the scars in His hands and feet, as well as the spear-wound that punctured His heart on the Cross. They could verify for themselves that He was alive, despite dying before their eyes. The evidence was so strong that the disciples of Jesus gave their lives to transform the Roman Empire with the message of Jesus. They willingly embraced execution to spread the news that Jesus is alive, death is defeated, and God has opened the way for every person to be with Him in Heaven, if you want to come. They saw the impossible happen. Jesus defeated death. Jesus claimed to be God, then did what only God could do. They believed \u2014 because of the evidence. This is the same Jesus who invites you to experience Him today. Jesus never asks you for blind faith in things you can\u2019t experience. He gives you His Word in the Bible, inviting you to taste and see. Test His wisdom, explore His philosophy, live life as He commands, and watch what happens. Further, when you bow knee and accept Jesus as your King, He fills you with His Spirit. He gives you instant, immediate access to Him. That\u2019s what prayer is. He not only listens and answers your prayers, but He also speaks back. God is active. He works in your life, He speaks into your life, He transforms your life. The same power that rose Jesus from the grave lives inside everyone who chooses to follow Jesus. And that power is active. The truth often offends our expectations. Every paradigm-shifting scientific discovery meets incredible resistance upon its unveiling. Even Charles Darwin, today the darling of the scientific community, faced stiff opposition for his entire life from the majority of the scientists of his day. People who set their minds on one way of viewing the world do not embrace change easily \u2014 especially if they have to admit that they were wrong to do so. But the true scientific mindset embraces new ideas \u2014 especially paradigm-shifting ideas. Science, as a discipline of investigation, relies on the premise that the universe is filled with knowledge we don\u2019t yet know. There is far more out there to be discovered than we have yet uncovered. That\u2019s the joy of experimentation, discovery, and advancement. Thus, when the true scientific mindset encounters Darwin\u2019s claims, it does not respond \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Instead, it says \u201cInteresting. Tell me why you believe that.\u201d Likewise, when the true scientific mindset encounters the claim of Jesus\u2019 Resurrection, the response is not \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Instead, it responds \u201cThat would change everything I thought I knew. That\u2019s exciting. Tell me more.\u201d This is one of the reasons why such a vast number of leading scientists believe in God. James Tour, one of the world\u2019s leading biologists and nano-scientists, put it this way: \u201cI build molecules for a living. I can\u2019t begin to tell you how difficult that job is. I stand in awe of God because of what he has done through his creation. My faith has been increased through my research. Only a rookie who knows nothing about science would say science takes away from faith. If you really study science, it will bring you closer to God.\u201d (Adams, C., \u201cLeading Nanoscientist Builds Big Faith,\u201d Baptist Standard, 15 March 2002.) Or as Sir Francis Bacon declared: \u201dA little science estranges a man from God. A lot of science brings him back.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Is it possible to disprove Jesus\u2019 resurrection? Hello, Billbobjoe1234, and welcome to Quora! We can\u2019t even prove that Jesus was crucified (or, for that matter, that he was even a real person who actually lived in the first place), so how in the world would you ever expect anybody to prove that he didn\u2019t come back to lifer after supposedly living and being crucified? I mean, it\u2019s like asking if anybody can prove that Atlantis didn\u2019t sink into the ocean when nobody has even been able to prove that Atlantis wasn\u2019t just a wholly fictional place to begin with. Cart before the horse, dude. Having said that, what would it even matter? Let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that we actually could prove that Jesus lived and that he was crucified and that nobody could prove that he wasn\u2019t resurrected? Where would that get you? Do you somehow think that the inability to prove something false somehow makes it even slightly more likely that the thing in question is true if you don\u2019t have any independent evidence of its truth? That\u2019s not how logic works, and if the best argument you have for your religious beliefs is, \u201cnobody can prove they are false,\u201d then you might as well just give up right now. But, hey \u2014 let\u2019s throw logic out the window and imagine just for a second that the fact that nobody can disprove the resurrection of a possibly fictitious character somehow does provide evidence that that character was resurrected, just like it says in the Bible. So what? A man was crucified, apparently died much sooner than most people in that situation, was taken down and buried in an above ground tomb, and was then reported being alive days later. And? History is filled with people who were declared dead only to \u201ccome back to life\u201d days later (sometimes, unfortunately, after having been placed in a coffin and buried in the ground). Do you think they had medical examiners or coroners 2000 years ago? Any way to check for brain activity? Even if you assume that Jesus somehow \u201crose from the dead,\u201d that still wouldn\u2019t prove that, say, he was the literal Son of God or that he took upon himself all our sins or that we can somehow gain eternal salvation by believing in him. Seriously, though \u2014 there are many ancient stories that describe supernatural events that we can\u2019t prove are impossible. But since when is that mere fact alone actually justification for believing in them?
