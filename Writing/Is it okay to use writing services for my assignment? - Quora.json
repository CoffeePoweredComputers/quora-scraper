I cannot imagine any good reason to hire someone to write an assignment for you. It\u2019s unethical, uneducational, in many cases illegal, and just such a bad idea. However, I can think of many good reasons to hire a writing coach or editor who can provide guidance and feedback on your own work so you can improve your own communication skills. ",
