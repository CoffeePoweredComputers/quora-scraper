            "answer_text": "Depending on what freelancing websites you\u2019re looking at, the approach could be very different. Disclaimer: I\u2019m the founder of Maven Access. One of our products is an on-demand freelancer platform for content writers in Asia, the second one is to manage collaborators. From my point of view, there are 2 biggest categories of freelancing sites. (A) Generic ones, winning in quantity not the quality of projects and talents. E.g. Upwork.com , freelancer.com etc. (B) Domain-specific sites, winning in quality not the quantity (sometimes) of projects and talents. E.g. 99designs.com, toptal.com etc. If you\u2019re just starting out, going for type (A) might be better. Easier to get jobs. As companies over there might not have that high of a standard, which might not require your extensive portfolio as a reference.It\u2019s a good chance for you to see what other areas you might be able to freelance for yet haven\u2019t given a thought. E.g. If I\u2019m a content marketer aiming to get some copywriting freelance work there. I would discover some clients might also want SEO consultation and infographic design service which I could do too.Experience whether you like freelancing especially using these sites. You might end up wanting to build your own website or agency as well.Way to get jobs here: Proactively find out jobs that interest you and ping the posters on other channels. (Being LinkedIn, Facebook, Emails etc.) Even if you lack the experience to reference on, the proactiveness adds a point. At the all, they work with the person - you.Throw in all relevant work you\u2019ve done in the past even in the college or other volunteer work. Sometimes working for free does help you to kickstart a bit.Partner with other freelancers on the site. As mentioned you could find what other projects the client is looking for. You could as well pitch yourself to other freelancers who are working for this exact client to join forces or proactively find other freelancers that might suit the client need. It saves the client from managing multiple freelancers.If you\u2019re more experienced or knowing exactly a vertical domain you want to get into, then go for type (B). Clients value quality over quantity (in most cases). You can get higher project fee.Problem with type (A) platform is that there are many newbies coming in and often beat the price really low whereas their skillsets are better for novice projects.Better client quality. With projects set up in these sites, likely the clients have a better idea in what they want, hence, better communications.They know how to pinpoint an \u201cisometric graphics\u201d rather than just \u201ca graphic\u201d; \u201clead-converting landing page content\u201d rather than just \u201cweb copy\u201d.Way to get jobs here (also depends on site\u2019s structure): It\u2019s better if you have a portfolio, website, references as clients here often aim for better quality and experience.Be domain-specific. What specific expertise that makes you stand out? For example, we at Maven Access, focus on localized content for Asia. We also recommend our freelancers to specify what domain (e.g. PR) and industry (e.g. healthcare) they are in. If you\u2019re saying that you specialize in legal documents for Blockchain projects, that\u2019s very handy.Offer free consultation if possible. At your level, your expertise should be carrying a consultation value. Offering them advice apart from just doing the work is much more valuable. You could do it by linking your personal site / LinkedIn profile if the site allows.Treat your profile as your personal brand. Just as your LinkedIn profile goes, these represent your professional image. A better headline to catch eyeball. A better opening content of your profile to capture attention. Be funny, why not!Cheers! Ed ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a sad story for every freelancer who gets work on freelancing websites. Here\u2019s how the story goes: John, a run-of-the-mill 35-years old front-end developer, is tired of working from his soul-sucking full-time job at a large dreadful corporation. He reads there are huge sites carrying thousands of companies willing to pay people just like him for his work, without having to go to any office and tolerate the 2-hours daily commuting. After having a particularly bad day and an ugly fight with his boss, John decides to become a freelancer and break free from the shackles of his day job. He quickly decides to open an account at Upwork, the largest freelancing marketplace. As soon as he starts building his profile, John makes a mistake that will cause him to lose thousands of dollars without he ever realizing it. The title.  As a no-BS developer, he writes the first \u2014 and most obvious \u2014 sentence that comes into his mind. \u201cFront-end developer,\u201d he writes. Then, he writes his description, which looks something like this: I am a front end web developer with more than 7 years of experience. Over these years, I have been involved in several projects, which I have designed and developed from scratch. Several of them have become a big success online. Being passionate about code and entrepreneurship, I embrace the ideas of my clients as if they were mine and work hard until the client is satisfied. My priority is to do a good job, money is secondary. Most of my work has been in PHP and WordPress, but I have worked in Drupal, PrestaShop, CodeIgniter, and Magento. My commitment to the projects I undertake is definitely my top skill, as my co-workers and clients can attest to. Whatever the challenge and the technology involved, I always welcome it, master it and help to improve it. This is the real description of an $80-per-hour developer with 100% job success. What\u2019s the problem with this description? After all, this freelancer made $60 thousand benjamins so far. Here\u2019s the problem: There are 14 references to the developer. \u201cI am awesome. I can develop lots of stuff. I care about my clients.\u201d Yada, yada, yada. Companies don\u2019t look for job seekers. They look for solutions. If you just say what you do but can\u2019t prove it or explain it in terms that the business can understand \u2014 the outcomes \u2014, you will have a hard time getting any work. Talk about the results you can bring. Talk about the problems the company is facing. Talk like a businessman. Show, don't tell. ",
