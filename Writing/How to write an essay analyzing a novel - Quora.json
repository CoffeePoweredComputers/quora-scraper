            "answer_text": "Alright, here's my tried-and-true method: Be unoriginal. In the history or literary criticism, there are a number of \"schools\" that people have used to analyze literature. Here's a brief list by the folks over at Perdue Owl. Moral CriticismDramatic ConstructionFormalismNew CriticismNeo-Aristotelian CriticismPsychoanalytic CriticismJungian CriticismMarxist CriticismReader-Response CriticismStructuralism/SemioticsPost-Structuralism/DeconstructionNew Historicism/Cultural StudiesPost-Colonial CriticismFeminist Criticism, Gender/Queer StudiesPick one that looks interesting. The great thing about literary theory is that you can make almost every single one of these theories apply to any piece of literature. Research heavily. If you have access to literary databases, look up some literary criticisms in that school. Know the theory inside and out. Then apply it to your literature. Personally, I recommend Marxist theory, because the center of Marxist theory is basically just proletariat vs bourgeois conflict, which is pretty common. Feminism is also pretty useful. As for your thesis problems, there's a bit of an art to it. You want to get the topic of your essay in a concise, but also informative paragraph. Here's a thesis I wrote a while back that should suffice for your basic high school or gen ed college classes. Sorry if it gets a bit flowery and unnecessary, I've never been good at the \"concise\" part. The Oppressive Iron Horse of the Bourgeois: Gertrude Bonnin Illuminates the Evils of Capitalism in Isolation from Marxist Theory The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes. (Manifesto I) Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels penned this passage in the atmosphere of monarchal Germany, imperialist England, and Tsarist Russia. The Manifesto of the Communist Party argues that class warfare crafts history with omnipresence. Marxist doctrine involves itself directly with Eurasian affairs. However, true to its global nature, the documents that sparked the Communist February Revolution and subsequent Red October apply to tensions between native Americans and the United States government. In her works \u201cImpressions of an Indian Childhood\u201d and \u201cSchool Days of an Indian Girl,\u201d Gertrude Bonnin relates her autobiography of how her nativity blinds her into acquiescence when white missionaries offer the children of her community re-education. Marxist theory elaborates on the intentions and reasoning of the antagonists in Bonnin\u2019s memoirs. The Manifesto contains the fundamental Marxist value that the Bourgeoisie seeks to actively oppress the lowly proletariat for economic and political gain. Doctrine establishes also the Capitalist abuse of religion as a mechanism for manipulation. Marx and Engels then detail the effects of capitalist imperialism, effectively prophesizing the American empire. Dang, MLA format does not copypaste into Reddit at all. Anyway, I start with a block quote from the Manifesto, which is a little wordy, but it explains a bit about the theory that you're going to be applying, which is good. Just hit the basics, don't go too into details yet. Bring in the piece of literature you're working with. A bit of summary, nothing major. Then, write a thesis statement. How does your theory relate to your literature? Mine is italicized for your convenience. Typically it should be one sentence, but mine blends together a bit with my summarizing and ends up as two. Then hit it with your main points. You usually want three solid points to back up your argument. You can be short and sweet and just list them in one sentence with commas, or you can fill up your Word Count and write three sentences. Both work, as long as they sound good. Mine are bolded. Hope this helps! I'm by no means an English professor, but I've always had success with this model. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Someone said, write the summary. Do not, I repeat, do not write the summary if you have to analyse a novel because trust me, teachers hate it. Readers would hate it. Now coming back to your question, typically in an analysis, you need to focus on select few things and you're good to go. Setting, how it affects the course of novel, whether it reflects the theme, etc.Themes, symbols and motifs.Point of views. The same story can have two different point if views or many different characters with the same point of view (say first person or third person omniscient). Understanding it is important because it sets the mood and tone of the novel which is another thing that you must consider. Also, whether the omniscient narrator has a considerable influence in the novel. For instance, the use of second person in Han Kang's Human Acts gave me nightmares for days. It made the story more realistic over all and the descriptions were far more harrowing than if I had read it in first person.Mood and tone of the novel. Whether it's stagnant or changes throughout the story.Title of the story. How it reflects the themes, plot, motifs.Characters and their development throughout the course of the story. Whether they are realistic or not.Literary theories. For example, feminist theory, eco-criticism, marxist theory, post colonial theory, post modern theories etc. If you find it difficult to go over these, I'd suggest focusing on looking at the events in the novel from a different perspective. For instance, if it's a novel on subjugation by the British colonial powers, then try to find out how stereotypes have been used and justified, things that might be propagandist for the say populace of 1800, how it's relevant in today's context.Comparison of the timelines, if it's set in different worlds. How relevant the novel is in modern context.I hope this helps. Good luck. And have a good day. ",
