            "answer_text": "Usually, it takes about 3 months for our handwriting to change if we practice writing everyday. If you wish to change it in one month, then the only way out would be to write for a few hours daily in any book on handwriting practice. Please remember, our handwriting is a reflection of what we are. When our handwriting changes, changes will be noticed in our nature too. Similarly, even after a lot of practice, we may end up forming certain letters the way we always do. You may not be able to decipher that unless you check the formation closely. Hope, this answer helps\u2026 ",
