            "answer_text": "What Is a Synonym? Synonyms are two different words that have the same, or very similar, meaning. They can be any part of speech, which is a category of words grouped together by their function (and include verbs, adjectives, adverbs, nouns, or prepositions), as long as both words are the same part of speech. This means that they both have to be nouns or both have to be verbs. Why Are Synonyms Important? In writing, it's important that you keep your audience engaged in your work. Think about your own experiences reading essays, novels, or articles. What made the writing interesting? The content may draw us in, but it is the language and word choices that keep us reading.
