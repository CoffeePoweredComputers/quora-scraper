            "answer_text": "\u201cHate\u201d is a strong word, as is \u201cfamous,\u201d though he is an NYT bestselling author so that\u2019s probably more famous than I\u2019ll ever be. His name is Andrew Gross, and I feel closer to mild disgust and disappointment than hatred for the guy. It was at a writer\u2019s convention, with keynote speakers Mary Kay Andrews, the aforementioned Andrew Gross, and some guy called Bob Stein. Andrews kicked it off Friday night with just the kind of speech you expect at a conference geared toward authors struggling to begin their careers. I\u2019ll probably mangle it, but she told us how she\u2019d struggled for years as a journalist before realizing she wasn\u2019t paying her dues, she\u2019d already capped out and was always going to be relegated to the trash beats while worse journalists would be promoted by virtue of their chromosomes. She told her editor she was quitting to be a novelist. He told her she\u2019d never make it because she was a shit writer and no one would want to read her fiction. She went after it anyway, saddened and discouraged to learn her journalism hadn\u2019t prepared her for fiction as well as she\u2019d thought. She stuck with it after a failed first manuscript or two and finally, starving and desperate, she sold one. It had a limited run and didn\u2019t sell as well as she\u2019d hoped but after a long time, struggling all the way, she carved out a sustainable living, only to change her pen name and brand ten years in and basically start over. She\u2019d survived the loss of her very dear, favorite editor and continued to write novels, some of them best sellers, up until today. The moral could hardly have been more explicit if she\u2019d outright said it; it won\u2019t be easy but if you work harder than any sane person is willing to work, you just might be a moderate success. Standing ovation, tears in the crowd, etc. Then there\u2019s Mr. Gross. He showed up to his author\u2019s panel in the morning still drunk from the night before, and slurred awful advice when he bothered to talk at all, which we kind of wished he hadn\u2019t. He did sober up for his speech that evening, but he clearly hadn\u2019t prepared anything. He recognized Andrew\u2019s inspiring story from the night before, and decided he\u2019d spitball his own journey into being a novelist. He too came into it late, having been raised in Westchester, attended Columbia, and starting out on a career as CEO to dying companies. He pulled three from the brink of bankruptcy, each endeavor more extreme and difficult than the last until he burned out on business. He hated his life, hated that he never got to see his wife, and fell into depression. I should note, I was with him up to this point. Sure, he had a pedigree and a pretty cushy life, but that came with high expectations and pressure, and who doesn\u2019t feel for a depressed guy who wants more time with his wife? But then he said it; \u201cI wanted to do something easier,\u201d and I thought \u201coh boy, I hope he\u2019s not going to stick with that assertion.\u201d He did. He wrote a thriller and since he knew a guy who knew a guy (of course he did), he was able to get an interview with a guy who had an interesting business proposal. So that\u2019s how this unpublished hombre who dashed off a novel on a lark got to sit across a table from one James Patterson, who didn\u2019t like the whole novel but did think there was some good dialogue, so they could do business. Patterson has a plot outlined and he wanted Gross to write it, Patterson would take credit for it, Gross would get an upfront fee and that would be that. Gross agreed. That wound up being a bestseller. Gross wrote a few more for Patterson before getting sick of having no credit and a fraction of the profit, so he got second billing a couple times on novels that were basically all his before breaking clean from the Patterson brand and going it alone. That\u2019s it. The story kind of trailed off from there. I don\u2019t hate him, but he did kind of give us all a kick to the balls. He could have spun it more to his favor, if he was a decent storyteller and had an ounce of self awareness, he would have. Instead he implied writing fiction is way easier than we make it out to be, and churning out bestsellers is just a cool hobby you can enjoy after you\u2019ve made your fortune. His was not a popular table at the signing. ",

One can learn nothing from their books and you get the most clich\u00e9d kind of stuff strewn all over them which are too shallow, at least according to me. It makes me wonder sometimes what a hapless state the readers of India are in and I feel so ashamed that it is our country who has nurtured the growth of these amateurish writers. Mr. Bhagat may be an excellent orator but writing, I feel, is just not his cup of tea. Thanks for the A2A. Sneha. ",
