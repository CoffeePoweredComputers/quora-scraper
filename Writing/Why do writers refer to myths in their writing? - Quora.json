            "answer_text": "Writing literature is an art. That implies that the artist works with different materials. Among the most important are words and traditions, the last can happen to be myths. This kind of stories are pretty simple and that allows the writer to make a text adding and changing elements in order to create artistic meanings. It is the same reason why some poets write sonnets: it is a premade structure that restricts possibilities but also increases the writer\u2019s creativeness. On the other side, that gives myths the appearance to be imperishable. When a text is related to a myth, it isn\u2019t just the myth: all the other texts related are in a similar situation. So, all those variations make all texts richer to the reader\u2019s eyes if he/she is aware of that tradition. For example: Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound is related to Hesiod\u2019s works and to Percy Shelley\u2019s Prometheus Unbound but also to Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus and Meyrink\u2019s Der Golem. Each one of them adds something to the set. ",

            "answer_text": "Reference is a strong tool, regardless of if it\u2019s from myth or not. This is because references can pack huge amounts of images and themes into them. For instance, one of the more referred to myths is Sisyphus who is the king who is damned to roll a huge boulder up a hill, only for it to roll away when it nears the top forcing him to repeat this action for all eternity. It just so happens, that some literature has become so classic of a reference that we turn them into words. \u201cQuixotic\u201d is a word that refers to the insane romanticism of the character Don Quixote, no wonder it means \u201cexceedingly idealistic; unrealistic and impractical.\u201d But it has the added advantage for those familiar with literature and etymology to give you an image of Don Quixote battling windmills. The myth of Sisyphus also has just such a word \u201cSisyphean\u201d meaning \u201c(of a task) such that it can never be completed.\u201d You could simply say something like \u201can impossible task\u201d, but that wouldn\u2019t conjure up the image of king Sisyphus and his eternal suffering, which may be how the speaker also feels about her own suffering. There are also works that use reference as a primary tool. One of these that comes to mind is \u201cTill We Have Faces\u201d by CS Lewis, which is subtitled \u201cA Myth Retold\u201d. Essentially the whole book focuses on a retelling of the story of Cupid & Psyche, but with several important twists, which makes it interesting and helps the reader understand the work as a whole. ",
