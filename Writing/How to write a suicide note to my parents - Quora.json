            "answer_text": "As Brian Ferguson wisely said, say it in person. For me, my suicide attempts came between my twenties to late-40\u2019s and though my childhood by all accounts could be called abusive on all levels (sexually, mentally, emotionally, physically), which I won\u2019t recount here, it definitely took its toll on my self-esteem. I\u2019ve been in therapy for a couple of decades and any suicide note I\u2019d leave would be simply redundant. By wanting to write a note you are struggling inside, knowing you still care about them, about how you want them to understand you. You DO care about them. So tell them, in a note you hand them personally that you love them very much and are seeking an alternative to suicide. Since they already know you are suicidal it makes me wonder if they even take you seriously or have some other reason to ignore you in this - which is a type of abuse, but let\u2019s not go there. Then, please, please, seek that alternative to suicide. From your question it sounds like you are under 18 but don\u2019t let that stop you from seeking help. Being suicidal is a medical emergency. It is not a moral failing. If you slipped and fell and broke a bone, would you berate yourself and not get the broken bone fixed because you were stupid enough to fall down in the first place? No! Being suicidal is like having a broken emotional and mental bone. If you are feeling you are about to commit suicide, please call or go to your nearest emergency room. When they ask you why you\u2019re there simply say \u201cI want to die\u201d or \u201cI want to kill myself\u201d or whatever comes to you. They will treat you with the emergency care you deserve. Note: Anyone who knowingly provides the means, or encourages another by action or inaction to take their own lives may be guilty of a crime. ",

            "answer_text": "Not all of us had a great childhood. Not all of us enjoyed growing up. Yet many of us did. The best way is to go upto them and tell them on the face. You want to die, you must have the courage to atleast talk to your parents face to face. 9 months of carrying you within her was for her to face the day when you would say you want to end your life.All the hopes and dreams they have for you must end.Don't thank them for the childhood they gave you.Don't thank them for the attention they gave you. You didn't deserve any bit.Don't thank them for their guidance. You have come this far in life only because of yourself and nobody else.Don't thank them for their money. It was their obligation to support you financially. Who asked them to give birth to you in the first place ?Don't even bother remembering the love they showered, the respect they showed even when you didn't deserve it. Why did they have to listen to you when you wanted to go on that night out? Why did they have to respect your privacy and not check your phone ?Staying up all night to nurse you when you were ill was uncalled for.Investing themselves on you and your future was their mistake. You are not answerable to anybody.Just tell them that you have decided to die. No turning back. Happy dying ! ",
