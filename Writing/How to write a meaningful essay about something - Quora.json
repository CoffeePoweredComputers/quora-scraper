            "answer_text": "Let's be real; hardly anybody finds inherent joy in writing essays. But over years of having to write them anyway for school, I've been able to trick myself into doing it and even enjoy myself along the way. Look at your subject/ prompt. Do you have any opinions about that thing, even be they small? If so, great! That's your angle. No one else can write that but you, which is pretty cool. I like to think of myself as a pretty neutral person on most issues, but when writing, I usually discover that no, I actually had a huge opinion on said thing and I find myself kind of ranting. Now, maybe ranting is not the best way to go about it \u2014 you want to still be professional \u2014 but think of your essay as your personal spotlight to talk about whatever you want under the criteria, and no one can tell you to shut up. What would you say about this issue if no one could tell you no? That's some power, and fuel to make your essay unique. Additionally, using your own voice is something a lot of people forget when writing essays. They hyper-focus on sounding as professional as possible, which is important, but your reader doesn't want to hear from a dry old textbook; they want to hear you. They want to hear your enthusiasm and analysis and curiosities. If that means you don't use a thesaurus and use run of the mill vocab, so be it. What makes a good, meaningful essay are the ideas and opinions, not the fancy packaging, and your personality will make it memorable. ",
