The bride /groom is placed in a special seat and then the prayers are done and the uncle of the bride/groom will ask to the group of close relatives, whether he shall give the bride/groom the sweet, It will be asked three times and then sweet is given to the bride/groom. reference (Syrian Catholic Marriage Customs In Kerala). even though this custom is widely popular among the knanaya christians it is also done by the other churches tracing the same roots(note that the knanaya church was once part of the malankara sabha which includes the malankara orthodox , jacobite, marthoma and malankara catholic).since the ancestral backgrounds of the above said churches are same you cannot deny them the right to perform this particular ritual. Maduram veppu has no particular religious meaning , it is just a custom or tradition that originated among the ancient st.Thomas Christians. ",

            "answer_text": "Maduram Veppu is a tradition of giving sweets that is very similar to the Knanaya tradition of Ichapaddu Kodukal. The Knanaya give the groom and bride sweets during their Chandam Charthal and Mylanchi Ideel ceremony. Some Nasrani or St. Thomas Christians have a ceremony by itself of giving sweets known as Maduram Veppu. The Knanaya use a sweet rice pudding known as Ven-Pachor during the ceremony, I think the Nasrani instead use a special type of cake made at home. Ichapaddu Kodukal and Maduram Veppu are simply traditions that represent the sweetness of the new married life to come. ",
