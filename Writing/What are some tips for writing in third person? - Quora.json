            "answer_text": "I am almost finished changing a first-person work to third-person, and intermittent other-person use, too. The best tips for tense address the whole work, as a balancing act of tenses. There are categorical issues for third-person. Content\u2014action, characters, voice, narrative arc\u2014come first. Be saying something, not just filling narrative holes. All of us do it, when we try to flow, add in plot aspects, retain Character and Voice, maintain style, because sometimes first-drafts flow best when we permit some overt function in the flow. BTW, sometimes the final remnants of awkward, syntax-that-crowds-content is revealed by switching a paragraph to first person, and back again. Say it out loud, if your wrist hurts. I lose about ten percent of hidden, unnecessary words this way, in parts that don\u2019t sound right yet.We hear the artificial application of a system like a spill of nickels on concrete. Don\u2019t repeat the two dozen or so common third-person indications (said, walked, went, did, was, had, stood, etc) endlessly, or in a set pattern. Make intra-paragraph fragments your friend. Your best friend. See? Like that. It speeds up the action independent of mood, too. Getting to the point makes the reader forget you the writer and surrender to the work, a good thing. A very good thing. Aren\u2019t fragments fun?You are telling a good story, a ripping yarn. (Right?) Hear it inside, as it unfolds; listen for Fuddy Old Boring Storyteller moments, no matter how elegant or exacting they seem. Imagine doing a public reading at an unfamiliar open mic, that turns out to be a bar full of teen garage bands and their proud grandmothers, and you are first spoken word to show up since 2013. How would you trim it? \u201cThen she gaped, her voice rose as she said, \u2018Herman, please. Put down that pickle.\u2019 And Herman said, \u2018Stop crowding me, mother,\u2019\u201d quickly becomes \u201c\u2018Herman! Put down the pickle!\u2019 \u2018 Mom, please!\u2019\u2019Be artful and simple with future tenses, even first-person tense, for reverie, memory, dreams, aspiration and imagination. Here\u2019s a handy anecdote showing three: \u2014The queen looked over the fields, to the distant faire, and joked to Sir Didagain, \u201cIt would have been quite a sight! I can see him now: \u2018I am walking and I have the best-trimmed beard, the comeliest \u2018staches, the most manly tresses!\u2019\u201d\u2014Okay, sure, you know this\u2014but well enough to cheat, for impact in dialog? Go to public places, listen to us: we\u2019re a mess. We take shortcuts, conjure for each other, mix tenses\u2014I am doing it now; seriously, look at this. The best writers did it, long before us. If in doubt, say it the plainest way. Like explaining it to Nana. \u201cHe wanted to take her to the dance, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s the one she should end up with, Nana, trust me.\u201dFirst-person is clearly an identifiable actor in your work. But so is third-person. Unless you are extraordinarily careful, it is you, too (or \u201ca you\u201d of some kind). Usually accept this, and permit some omniscience, however mild or lofty, and shape, shape, shape so it is you in every other sense, polish polish polish to get rid of artificial distance and false notes, things that don\u2019t sound like you. You might say even scrupulous scrubbing of personality in third person reveals a quiet, disciplined presence. And can, done well, shift our attention to ethereal, indirect aspects of the work (See: \u201cThe Dead,\u201d Joyce) (No seriously. go read it, again or whatever. How did he do that?).The challenge of literary is to achieve sublime craft to make the author invisible, then re-emerge as a brilliant, resonant Voice. Third-person is this: \u2014\u201cSomething happened. There was a fire. I escaped. I was injured.\u201d He put her bell down, and left.Third person is this, too:\u2014 He took it from her, held it tight. \u201cDon\u2019t call them. Something happened\u2014It\u2019s as if I am there now, yet standing before you; I see the red faces, feel the heat, hear\u2014\u201d She took a step back, covered her face, horrified. \u201cThere was a fire. But I guess you would know that already. Before anyone, even.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cAnd I escaped. I was injured, but I was lucky. Here, take the bell\u2026no? \u201d He put her bell carefully on the desk. \u201cI wanted to see your face, see for myself\u2026\u201d He turned, and left.\u2014The point is: follow the inner state of your characters, use the tenses their perspective require. Be blunt, even.",
