            "answer_text": "\u2018What are some good strategies for writing thousands of words in a day?\u2019 I write quickly and could go on for hours until I\u2019m forced to call it a day. I\u2019m assuming here that we are talking about writing novels? I\u2019ve done this for all my novels. And usually write more than 4 or 5 chapters a day. Each chapter depending on what I want to say is usually more than 10\u201315 pages. What\u2019s the trick? You need to have an idea of what you want to say in each chapter. Some writers find doing an outline or pre-plan helpful. Very rarely have I jacked an entire chapter because it didn\u2019t work. Having said that I often go for months thinking about ideas, dialogue, narration and background story etc before I\u2019m ready to commit this to paper. I am unable to write 1000 words or more if I have not prepared my story or characters. Reading a lot and generally knowing a lot about what you want to say is the best option. (This includes emotions of characters, thoughts and background noise etc. I\u2019ve only ever suffered writers block once when I first started writing). Which is why writers are often advised to write about what you know. A way out this quandary (since knowing about certain facts outside your own life experiences) would be to do a lot of research. Writing is intensely pleasurable. And once you start writing, it would be impossible to do anything else. You feel as if you want to die if you didn\u2019t write. Like breathing, you can\u2019t do without it. But the agony of writing is when you have finally finished that first draft (I\u2019ve only ever done one draft by the way, and just edit edit edit like there\u2019s no tomorrow!) then find you want to share your true genius with the world - but can\u2019t find an agent to represent your work. Torture! Absolute torture! Have faith in your writing and keep going. Keep practicing until you get better and better. I always believed that true talent that is not shared with the world is their loss. Not yours. Sooner or later, if your work has true merit, it will come to light. And this coming from someone who was denied the opportunity to study Creative Writing at University from literally every university in England, despite achieving a first in both EngIish and English Lit at O\u2019Level. I remember applying 3 times, in 3 consecutive years. To no avail. I was a mature student with no refs. I tried again and again but got nowhere. In the end I came across Stephen Kings \u2018On Writing\u2019 and studied that. Downloaded it and read it blue. I also got a lot of direction from other writers online who posted stuff on their blogs. Very helpful. In my last attempt to study writing at university which I did through UCAS, only 2 uni\u2019s bothered to reply to my application. And so on and so forth\u2026 the point I\u2019m trying to say is that 1000 words is a doddle if you know what you want to say. And how you want to say it. The Art of Writing (Novels) ought to be (for me, at least) based on how beautiful your prose, and how well you articulate your ideas. Finally, I am always amazed at how most writers on Quora are able to keep me engaged in their stories. I loose interest quickly if an answer is boring or not well presented. Good luck! NB: My first novel titled \u2018Our Feet Were Soft in Flowers\u2019 will be published soon. ",

I\u2019ll just reply in the writer\u2019s sense\u2026 If you meant for school tell me and I\u2019ll do another answer for that. Thanks! .`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`.`. Well, first of all, you have to know what you\u2019re doing. I mean, sure, you can always just type random letters and put spaces inbetween\u2026 But like anyone\u2019s going to read that! I write a lot, so here\u2019s something I can tell you: do NOT overuse words. Like, read a sentence from one of my old works; \u201cMom seemed kind of scared, and I did, too. The situation seemed hopeless. But, for some reason, Nurse Molly didn\u2019t seem scared. She seemed brave. She looked the humanoid in the eyes, and it seemed pretty surprised that she faced it.\u201d You must\u2019ve gotten tired reading that, right? My little ten year-old self apparently liked the word seem(ed). There\u2019s a way you can fix a sentence/paragraph/chapter if you feel you\u2019ve been using a word too much. It\u2019s easy. Just either find a synomyn for that word, or phrase it differently, like how we all do when we can\u2019t remember how to spell(lol). You can easily search up synonyms on Google, and find sites that tell you synonyms of words\u2026 For example, this one.  If replaced with synonyms: \u201cMom hinted that she was kind of scared, and I did, too. The situation suggested hopelessness. But, for some reason, Nurse Molly didn\u2019t seem scared. She showed nearly very sign of bravery. She looked the humanoid in the eyes, and it looked pretty surprised that she faced it.\u201d That sounds better, now doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s okay to still keep the word you overused in there once or twice, as long as the others got replaced. You wanted to rephrase instead? Just re-write the paragraph underneath the current one, trying to use a different view on what\u2019s happening, maybe change the order of saying things. For example, you might change this: \u201cMom seemed kind of scared, and I did, too. The situation seemed hopeless. But, for some reason, Nurse Molly didn\u2019t seem scared. She seemed brave. She looked the humanoid in the eyes, and it seemed pretty surprised that she faced it.\u201d Into this: \u201cThe situation displayed our very real loss of hope\u2026 Yet Nurse Molly stepped forwards, and bravely faced the humanoid, who drew back the slightest bit in surprise. Mom and I were too scared to move, let alone breathe, as the nurse and inhuman stared into each others eyes.\u201d Sounds a bit better, huh? Kinda. You can also get yourself really into the story. If you\u2019re not, you\u2019re gonna get bored quickly, and that\u2019ll often lead to blanking out. Make sure each character has their own unique way of talking/doing things and that should keep you busy. When intruducing a new character, describe them in detail\u2026 That should add a lot of words. Also describe new scenes in detail. Always take note of the character\u2019s facial expressions, or at least hint to what their faces look like. This will probably give your reader a good view on what is happening. Make sure your characters have their flaws, and make those come out every once in a while. That should make up more words because more events will take place that way. Maybe have some bad event happen to a character and describe the way they feel. Maybe have two of your characters confess to one another, that\u2019ll make for interesting topics to write about. \u2026Or even have a character talk about their backstory. Hope this helped! Also, sorry if I got carried away\u2026 ",
