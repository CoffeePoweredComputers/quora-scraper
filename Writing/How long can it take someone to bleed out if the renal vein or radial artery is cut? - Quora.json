            "answer_text": "The radial artery is hard to prodict - a sliced artery will bleed faster than a torn or crushed artery, and the radial artey takes a relatively small proportion of the cardiac output. The reanl vein is an easier case. The renal veins get between 15% and 30% of the cardiac output depending on age (Pediatric Critical Care Medicine) between them, so a single vein has, let's say, 10%. As the circulation time (time for the whole blood volume to pass through the heart) is about 60 seconds, (How long does it take your heart to circulate the total amount of blood in your body?)  then the whole blood volume would leak out in 10 minutes if flow was maintained. Flow wouldn't be maintained, since as blood pressure fall, cardiac circulation will also fall and you'll get catastrophic circulatory collapse in much less time. I'll leave aside the difficult issue of what EXACTLY is meant by \"bleed out\" - what's the end point? ",
