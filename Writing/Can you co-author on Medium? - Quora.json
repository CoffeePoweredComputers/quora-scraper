What has been your own life experience and how does that compare to the co writer. Then you are looking for the friend companion you have grown up with. Then the two reflect on those life experiences. often with \u201coh yeah i remember that\u201d. I do disseminate to the world what ever i come across. My inputs are unstoppable and new ideas which a psychic will not even consider are all original thoughts. Too often the thoughts, seem to become the way of life soon after. Admittedly i do hear at times from people who say \u201c i don\u2019t understand you\u201d. Some do consider a five year old can learn algebra by anyone, but not even know math. Trump learns everything he says simply by picking up that book. Knowing more than anyone else in government. so while beating people out of the way and gassing them with a noxious gas, and they had done nothing except to BE in EXISTENCE in front of his need to make a photo opportunity.   Ask him what he absorbed from holding the bible.  I do find some which are advancing and often just upvote them for their own idea. ",

It seems like the presence of the second writer keeps the first from working as hard. The difference in writing styles also tends to be pretty obvious and lacks coherence. ",
