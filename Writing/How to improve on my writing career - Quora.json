            "answer_text": " To improve your writing career, you have to see it for what it is: a small business. That means you have to consider all the \u201cdepartments\u201d of your business. How\u2019s your marketing? Your sales operations? Your accounting? Executive leadership? If you just focus on your craft (as you also should), then you\u2019re spending all your time in what could be called product development. But it\u2019s not enough to write well, if you want to make a living at it. You have to sell that writing to the right people, through pitches. You have to have a system for tracking your progress. You have to spend time thinking about who you want to be as a writer and reach out to the people who can help you get there. If you just want to write at home for yourself, you don\u2019t have to worry about all this other stuff. But if you want to make writing your career, you have to build your business skills. It\u2019s challenging, but it\u2019s not impossible. As I tell my coaching clients, they should just get started reading business books and watching classes. All the lessons out there about marketing, sales, accounting, and vision can be applied to your writing career. I provide free 15-minute consultations if you\u2019d like to discuss this further.
