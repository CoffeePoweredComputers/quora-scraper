            "answer_text": "Originally answered: \"is it okay to have sex before your wedding?\". Tim Janes sort of summed it up well, sure it is, but not right before. It might cause scheduling issues. This is something that my girlfriend and I have actually discussed in a surprising amount of depth. You see, we both come from large, reasonably affluent families. While I\u2019m an only child I have dozens of cousins, second cousins, and the like. It\u2019s a big family. While I\u2019m not close to all of them, I grew up in Florida and most of them are in the North; Ohio, Pennsylvania, upstate New York, Massachusetts, with a few offshoots in Lousiana, and elsewhere, they will still be there, especially the ones with whom I\u2019m close. The Angelic One, on the other hand, has three siblings, two sisters and a brother. She comes from a large family too, with the same kind of spread; Virginia, Lousiana, Florida, California, and a reasonable contingent in France. Now, while we are not sure if we even want to get married, or how that is going to go, but we do know about the wedding. If it was up to us, we\u2019d get married in the North Carolina mountains at my Mother\u2019s vacation home with a few friends and cousins present and throw an epic party. Or we\u2019d get married on the beach in a small ceremony, same thing with close friends and cousins (good friends of mine did this, and it was a blast) But, ha ha, that\u2019s not going to happen. No, our families are going to want a wedding. Like a big wedding. Between her family and mine, probably 500 guests or so, very formal. Dozens of caterers, full staff, ice sculptures, large bar, some sort of live music. Which is fine, I don\u2019t mind formality and I\u2019d like to see her in a stunning wedding gown, but this would be a large affair. If readers are unaware, this kind of wedding is known for its complexity, length, and exhausting nature. A cousin of mine got married not too long ago and the ceremony + reception was the better part of seven hours. I\u2019m not joking. Seven hours of dancing, food, open bar, pictures, greetings, etc. She married someone from a normal sized family. Seven hours of wedding is tiring. No. It\u2019s fucking exhausting. Just the greeting takes a couple of hours with that many guests, then all the stupid, pointless formalities. Although I draw the line at the following: the YMCA, the bunny dance, and Vic\u2019s \u201cWobble\u201d. There will be none of that at my wedding. It\u2019s just foolishness that I don\u2019t care for. We can have full on disco music and dancing, in fact, I\u2019m all for that. But no idiotic dancing. Anyway, it all makes for a long day and evening. Then we have to get up early in the morning to fly to Phuket for the first part of the honeymoon? Ouch. Do you know what you typically do after a wedding? You have sex. Lots of sex. You know what you don\u2019t feel like doing after being on your feet in uncomfortable formal shoes, in formal wear, eating drinking, taking pictures and general unending socialization with the focus completely on you? Having sex. Which is why we have decided, should/when we get married, we\u2019re banging like a pair of braindead test monkeys that morning. It will burn off nervous energy, loosen us up for the long day ahead and tide us over until we get our energy back up. So, before our wedding, we will be fucking energetically first thing in the morning. Probably in a variety of ways. We just feel we\u2019ll be able to better attack the day that way. In our case, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to have intercourse before sex, I think it\u2019s great. Of course, it will vary depending on the couple. But don\u2019t let the fact that you\u2019re getting married stop you from having sex. There is that idea of \u201coh, let\u2019s go on a break before the wedding and we\u2019ll want it more\u201d. Well, real life isn\u2019t That 70\u2019s Show and you\u2019ll end up just getting frustrated and there\u2019s no guarantee that there will be shagging the night of the wedding, if it\u2019s anything like what I\u2019ve described above. Then there\u2019s traveling for the honeymoon. Personally, that\u2019s just too long for me not to have sex with the woman I love when we\u2019re in close proximity to each other. But do whatever you\u2019re comfortable with. Just don\u2019t let any idea of tradition get in the way of boinking just because you\u2019re having a formal party with words being spoken. ",
