            "answer_text": "It is still around and it hasn't gone away contrary to what you or the media says. Everyone got up on the trash Flash bandwagon after Steve Jobs ripped on it with false statements. What he said was some what true of earlier versions of Flash and Flash Lite (a different product on old phones) but that wasn't what was being offered and demoed on iOS and running successfully on Android for 2 years.  What happened was when Adobe pulled Flash Player from mobile devices the world or rather the media interpreted it as Adobe throwing in the towel.  Everyone likes to bash on Flash because some times it would make the fan in their laptop start up. And people would claim it was a resource hog. The truth is it's not Flash it's the type of content and programming that take up resources. Video, animation and games all take significant resources. Flash is just a technology. HTML5 came around and everyone jumped on that bandwagon because they thought it would be the solution to all of the web problems. It didn't even exist yet. Do you understand that? It didn't even exist! It was a set of goals and a few prototypes.  Now that it's been a few years and it's starting to fulfill some of it's promises and people should be excited but wait a minute! It's also taking up massive amounts of CPU?!? Could it be that it wasn't Flash that was the problem but the type of content?  I and others have done comparison tests between Flash and HTML5 and the truth is Flash is faster than HTML in animation, sound, video, camera and more but the browsers are faster in image and text layout. Take for example this game, A suite of Javascript libraries and tools for building rich, interactive experiences with HTML5. Check your activity monitor. Now launch a Flash version, http://www.onemotion.com/flash/asteroids-game/.   Flash version: 23.5% CPUHTML5 version: 44-65% CPU And Flash is not only used by YouTube. It's used all over the web for video (Vimeo, Vine, nearly every site that has a video in the world), games (Facebook uses Flash for games and thousands of other sites), audio (Flash is used for audio even in HTML apps because web audio is still a joke), web camera (video conferencing, chat apps, web camera is still not fully supported), uploading (Google, WordPress, etc). Nearly everything HTML can't do yet Flash does with ease. There is even a StageVideo that developers can use that reduce video playback resources from 25% to 5% CPU if they update their applications.  Flash is also used in more places than you image. Google is using Flash when you use GMail. Firefox used Flash as a built in plugin for audio or video playback in it's browser. Google and Opera are shipping with the Flash plugin already installed. But Flash isn't always faster than HTML5 because the developer can make a faster or slower app in either technology.  In software development you are taught to choose the right tool for the job. You don't use a screwdriver to hammer in a nail and vice versa. And going around and blaming Flash for all the problems of your outdated computer, outdated Flash version, outdated browser that can barely play your YouTube video doesn't help solve your problem. Update your browser, your Flash version, your computer and then try again. Email websites that have slow or poorly programmed websites (HTML and Flash) and let them know. Ask what the minimum requirements are to use the site.  BTW Flash scored the least amount of security issues of any runtime or browser multiple years in a row. Windows, Internet Explorer, Java, Oracle and others made up 24 out of 25 bug reports while Flash had only one on the official list of security alerts at https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts. ",

            "answer_text": "It is one of the great wars on the Internet and already belongs to its history. The struggle between Adobe and browser developers for Flash is more known than nearly anyone who knows more or less about the network and hasn't stopped generating headlines and episodes for nearly a decade. Nevertheless, the serial is about to end and we must become accustomed to a new level. Naturally, without controversy, the end will not come. Google has just added a new message (it will not stop appearing when you open a new window) in your web browser, warning every user that the interruption between Flash and that we must live together in a new environment in 2020. Therefore, the note is not ready to vanish without deleting Flash. But what's going to change every day? Okay, it won't be too many things due to the years of moratorium, but best to have it specifically, so as not to take surprises.  When you don't know, it's time to learn a bit. The entire battle to leave behind Flash started in 2010 when Steve Jobs himself released a letter which came out as a bomb in the network and which said that after several years of cooperation and even something else (Apple itself became an investor in the software company), Apple has taken Flash technology out of their systems. Only this year, Jobs spoke of Flash not being ready to compete in the modern world of mobile technology and touch growth. The letter is still valid 9 years later and will be up to the end of 2020. Such was their influence, that in 2015 Google and Firefox decided to give the coup de grace to the system and announce that they would start blocking Flash Player content from the two most used browsers on the planet. Only Microsoft endured the pull between the greats a little more but ended up joining the change. This would remain mostly on the move as most of the giants followed after Jobs in agreeing with the 'guru' and destroying Flash for the sake of network advances, given Adobe's attempts to retain their 'place' and to win over the majority of the technology enterprises. They could not eliminate 'software' in one fell swoop and agreed to have a moratorium of 5 years to slowly close the program and to use it by consumers and developers. Your options. And while we are at the end of this road, loose limits are still to be solved. ",

            "answer_text": "In some ways, Flash was the victim of its own success. When it appeared on the scene, it allowed content creators to do things which had never done before. Suddenly, it was relatively easy to incorporate interactive elements or animations into previously static websites. With this new found freedom, many failed to see that the ability to do something did not mean that something should be done. Do you remember the era when every website had a cumbersome Flash splash page which incorporated either an unnecessary interactive element or a big animation which could not easily be bypassed? Even worse, do you remember entire websites which were nothing but buggy, jumpy, unnecessary Flash gizmos? Around the time that Flash peaked, people in both the marketing world and content creation world started to conduct surveys that showed many users preferred simple, cleaner layouts. People actually wanted blocks of black and white text. People wanted interactive elements that complimented content, rather than serving as content on its own. Don't believe me? Look at the most popular websites on the internet. Facebook. Text with occasional pictures and videos.  Google. Almost completely text. Twitter. Almost completely text. Wikipedia.

            "answer_text": "100% iOS. I was running the \"rich media\" product line at Google when iOS came out. Rich media was essentially a euphemism for Flash optimized for advertising. Before iOS, executive management at Google, including very senior engineers, had posed the question to me, and others in the advertising group, of \"how do we get rid of Flash\". The answer, to their consternation, was \"you can't.\" Back then 80%+ of banners were written in Flash, all the agencies were committed to teaching new designers how to work with Flash, and all the advertising vendors (like us) were 100% Flash. There was no way anyone in the ecosystem was going to consider a non-Flash alternative for ads, with the exception of some corner cases like interactive TV or flip phones. Then iOS came out and stubbornly refused to support Flash. It was obvious to everyone that the iPhone was going to change the world and that Apple was never, ever going to support Flash. (Thoughts on Flash). Within a year advertising vendors started to change their tune. I started seeing pitches for HTML5 ad platforms, and then some companies switched entirely. There was no reason to switch besides iOS support -- HTML5 made everything far more difficult for designers, ad traffickers, etc -- but people had to switch. And the switch in advertising isn't even done: Open Letter to Marketers ",

Flash, the authoring environment (Adobe Flash CC), which was way ahead of its time with heararchical, vector-based, deeply scriptable (ActionScript 3 powered an entire generation of browser games) animation creation tools, is alive and thriving under a different name Adobe Animate CC. Flash, the runtime environment, died because it simply became unnecessary: HTML caught up on gaps like video (YouTube used Flash Player to play its videos until it could positively move to \u201cpure\u201d HTML). Also HTML is an open standard. Adobe simply separated the beautiful authoring tool and the hated playback tool, shook off the bad fame with the rename of the former and killed the latter. People still create insane handcrafted animations and export them into sprite sheets and feed into other engines like Unity. It\u2019s still \u201csame old Flash\u201d under the hood, except named differently. You may be playing a game that\u2019s drawn with Animate and compiled with Unity, because people don\u2019t slap the \u201cFlash\u201d on it anymore, but the tool chain is majorly the same. PS: I was a Flash developer for years and I think Adobe did the right move. ",

And the owners of Flash at the time, and still today, have no spine to stand up to all the dispersions, and they never could figure out (nor tried copying) a business model to make money from everything Flash technology could offer. So the whole world in November 2011 plunged 7 years backwards on the promise of HTML5 which STILL has not caught up in \"non-kludgy\" capabilities to what Flash has to offer. It really made no rational sense from a technology point of view... for Apple it was business sense only... Flash offered a way to build apps for iPhone that could circumvent Apple's control... unless Apple refused to support Flash. ",

Nobody liked Flash for performance or stability. Its dominance was strictly due to inertia, and once given a good push, there was nothing else holding it up. Flash did ask you to update annoyingly often, though this was probably not a major reason to avoid sites using it. \"Rich internet application\" was a category coined only to have a category for Flash.

            "answer_text": "Flash is still around and has been renamed Adobe Animate. It is not as popular as it used to be, but it is a useful animation tool that exports to multiple formats including AIR, video, spritesheets, HTML canvas, gifs, and svgs. As others have said, iOS killed the Flash Player. Its performance on Android was sluggish and painful, so it was abandoned. In 2010, it was obvious that more and more users were consuming content on mobile devices, and it was only a matter of time before mobile usage overtook desktop usage. In regards to Flash, I believe Adobe hastened its demise by telling Flash users that the Flash Player was going nowhere and everything would be just dandy. However, their actions or lack of action said otherwise. It was obvious which way the wind was blowing, and a lot of Flash folks no longer trusted Adobe, so many of us jumped into other areas and technologies. ",

It is still the number one go to solution for rich media solutions for online advertising, due to it's rapid development nature as opposed to it's direct competitor html5, which is cumbersome in both performance and development time. There is still a team of developers at Adobe continuing development on the latest build in Flash CC (The latest news, updates, tips, and insights into the features of Flash Professional), although the main focus for this development is for deployment to Air or for native iOS or Android development.

The platform\u2019s suffered from consistent vulnerabilities since at least 2009, and every time one is patched out, it seems another one pops into the news. That has led to the biggest supporters of Flash pulling their support, something that has quickened recently.  Check out this post I wrote for more info: Does Your Website Use Flash? Maybe You Should Reconsider That. However, the contention that Flash is just gone is not correct and in some small way, it will probably continue to hang around longer than people expect. ",
