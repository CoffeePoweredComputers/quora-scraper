Most people don't write because either they feel that their work is horrible or they feel that they 'can't'. Both tendencies are equally damaging.  Why don't you start writing a blog? If you don't want to share it with anyone you can make your blog private. Before you are about to sleep, take out half an hour and just write on anything.  If you can't think of anything, write about your day. Do it religiously though - you will only get better with practice.  Your question is about finding a writing environment. Such a thing does not exist.  You sound inspired which is the biggest problem in writing. Nietzsche wrote about the wilderness and men who should dominate the world while he lived in a tiny apartment and was petrified of his sister. I love the Romantics but they are to be blamed for creating this hullabaloo around 'environment'.  You do not live in the 18th or even 19th century and nature retreats won't come your way. You'll have to write exams and do housework and function as a person in a cluttered and crowded world.  You have finished the self-discovery portion of the journey- you know you wan't to write, what's more you seem to have an idea about what you want to write now. That is more than half the battle. Just start writing - I'll leave you with this amazing quote from Maya Angelou-  \u201cWhat I try to do is write. I may write for two weeks \u2018the cat sat on the mat, that is that, not a rat.\u2019 And it might be just the most boring and awful stuff. But I try. When I\u2019m writing, I write. And then it\u2019s as if the muse is convinced that I\u2019m serious and says, \u2018Okay. Okay. I\u2019ll come.\u2019\u201d  Also, here are some amazing authors giving writing advice (taken from buzzfeed.)   And the ultimate advice that you must follow -   ",

            "answer_text": "I will tell you what worked for me. There is no \"best\" time, situation or environment for writing. As soon as you get an idea, jot it down in a diary or an online journal like Penzu. once you get time to start writing, read more on what is already available regarding the topic in the internet, pick out the best illustrations, quotes etc related to that topic. Now start writing your unique thoughts on that topic without worrying about the grammar and sentence formation.  Once you think that you have covered the topic enough, do some fine tuning to your writing and publish it. What I have found out is that even though you feel like you don't have enough words to write, once you start writing, words automatically flourish from your mind. Hope this helps! ",
