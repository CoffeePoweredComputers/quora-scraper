            "answer_text": "Bear in mind that the singular is \u2018pretence\u2019 for which we could substitute: acting, posturing, make-believe, dissembling, play-acting, deception, deceit, trickery, dishonesty, hypocrisy, semblance, affectation, guise, facade or anything that is the opposite of honesty.
