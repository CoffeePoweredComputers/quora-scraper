            "answer_text": "\u2018In which\u2019 is fairly formal, yes, and most people never use it. In most cases we\u2019ll either end the clause or sentence with \u2018in\u2019 or build the sentence differently. For example, I might write, \u201cThis is a government in which I have little confidence,\u201d but I\u2019d say either, \u201cThis is a government (that) I have little confidence in\u201d or simply \u201cI have little confidence in this government.\u201d The same would apply to other prepositions with \u2018which,\u2019 e.g. \u2018of which\u2019 and \u2018to which.\u2019 Their chief function is to allow someone to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition, but sometimes these phrases are useful in long, complex sentences. And no, \u2018in which\u2019 and \u2018which in\u2019 are not interchangeable. \u2018Which in\u2019 would probably be found in a situation where the \u2018in\u2019 is simply part of a prepositional phrase following the relative pronoun \u2018which,\u2019 e.g. \u201cI have a bad knee, which in some situations locks up and causes me to fall.\u201d ",

(\u201cWhich in\" is not used so, no, they're not interchangeable.) In which does sound more formal than its equivalent formation, as these two sentences show: This is something in which I believe. This is something I believe in. The first form is more likely to occur in writing; the second is the more common spoken form. ",
