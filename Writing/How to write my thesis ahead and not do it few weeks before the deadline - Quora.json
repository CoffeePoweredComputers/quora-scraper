            "answer_text": "No one can write a good thesis in a few weeks. The fastest I have seen was a month. But that person wrote a thesis that got rejected at the defense. The board gave her another month to write a whole new thesis. And she did. The second one was written from scratch. BUT she already knew the literature (because she had written a literature review before). To really start from scratch is pretty impossible. I guess it depends on what level of thesis and in what subject. But I stand by my point because most of the time, it will be true. My advice: Organize organize organize. Acknowledge that it will take around a year and start working accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "Arrange your sources of information just now - it will help you later. Make a plan. Don\u2019t force yourself to do everything at the time - step by step. With plan and literature you at least will have an idea about how to arrange your thesis. Personally I did like this and it helped, but next time I forgot to follow these step and I ordered a thesis from http://writemypaper.today/research-paper-writing.php . It\u2019s cool when no need to worry about deadlines and you have a great written paper. If you need it as well - try. And good luck with deadlines. ",
