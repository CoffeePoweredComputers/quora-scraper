            "answer_text": "Well, to kick this answer off, I'm sure you've heard the age old example of using the sun as a metaphor for a smile (or was that a simile?..hmmm) This works great because both (especially, if you are speaking with regard to a love interest): are quite radiant;fill one with warmth;possess the power to brighten the day;are indicative of life.  A brief example: ~ Overcast Heart ~ These are new skies \u2014 new vibrant hues \u2014 A new world brought to life within; For each time she smiles, Rays of glee break through my overcast heart. I could continue, but I think you got it*  The next metaphor I can think of \u2014 and I\u2019ll stop at 3 \u2014 is stained-glass windows. Bet\u2019cha wondering how that works? ;) Welllll, lettuce see, they both: craftily hide inner turmoil/conflict;are able to be manufactured;are one of the first features you notice on people/architecture;depict character;artistically portray a wide range of emotions/color;can be broken;can contain gaps;often have a history \u2014 tell a story;take time to put together;have two sides.  An example: ~ The Girl with the Stained Glass Smile ~ Lazy eyes, burdened with unrest \u2014 Ashen mascara to shadow her brow of coal. Those ebbing lamps, Oh! dying flames! A clandestine iniquity, Veils her smiles of glass-stain: Damp skin, ghoulish hues, chalky lips replete with sacred wine; by drip and flow it sates the beast \u2014 he breaks her bread in moonlight and consumes it piece by piece. It's a bit dark and eery \u2014 such is the history of stained-glass windows \u2014 but I wanted to supply you with a versatile stretch of potential usage, as this metaphor could easily be used in a light and cute context, in the same manner the sun metaphor could be used in one which is dark. ~ *P.S. Yes, I realize, this feature is designed for quoting other people\u2026buuut Have you heard of \u201casides\u201d in Shakespeare's plays? Well, there\u2019ya go :) (Even better than parentheticals! oh..wait\u2026) ~  Now, onto our final metaphor. *drum roll* \u201cRa-ta-taatatata-doobie-dun-dun-ayee-du---\" *odd looks and shrugs get exchanged betwixt the bewildered attending audience and the slightly horrified drum section* \u201cWhat? Was I sup--ohhhh\u2026yeahhh..\u201d Ahem, *blushing fades slowly* back to my narrator voice. Where were we? Oh, yes.. Our final metaphor is none other than a polaroid picture.  Getting the picture? I just wanted to shake things up a bit \u2014 don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s alright if it takes a while for things to become clear, you\u2019ll see it eventually :p I can smell your ruminating through the screen\u2026  \u201cWhat could the potential parallels be, when you\u2019re using something which generally captures the very smile for which it has now become a metaphor?\u201d Aye, because thou hast beseeched me, I shall extrapolate: Everyone seems to remember a smile, as if it were a momentous polaroid picture hanging upon a clothesline, encapsulating the bond between two people \u2014 romantic, friendly, etc.If the smile is the resulting picture printed from the camera \u2014 their face \u2014 the nose is the button you press *cough* boop *cough* to get it.Just as the picture from a polaroid comes out white when printed, such could be said of a smile from someone you don\u2019t know; however, as you put in the effort and work to get to know the person and make memories with them, the smile changes and develops its own deeper meaning and sentimental value, just as how the polaroid picture becomes clearer the more you shake it.Afterthought on that point: the potential for friendship/romance is captured in every smile, but it will never be realized until initiative and perseverance is taken to see the outcome, whether it turns out good or bad.Like a polaroid picture, there\u2019s a lot that goes into a person\u2019s smile:film \u2014 memories and life experiences;ink \u2014 emotions and thoughts;buttons \u2014 physical interaction;lense \u2014 worldview and upbringing;flash \u2014 spontaneity and insightIt\u2019s something which is important and meaningful, people love to share it and to see other\u2019s, and they always keep it on them. But even smiles can fade with time, after being passed through so many hands, especially ones who were rough and didn\u2019t value it. Unfortunately, it often becomes hidden: stuffed in an old wallet or drawer; lost in stacks of mail and other internal clutter \u2014 regret, hate, sadness, fear, apathy.The clouds converge to obscure the radiant sun as hail rains from above to destroy her stained-glass windows; the polaroids all fade to black and become stained with coffee and tears. We are left only to wonder where the beauty went, where that frugacious smile has gone, and why we could not capture it, and keep it to cherish for just a moment longer.  A final poetry example: ~ Polaroid ~ let me pull you close, until we are eye to eye; i want to see the world from the lenses of your mind. a vintage soul in color \u2014 darling you are rare \u2014 you remind me of a time, we still have yet to share. and as i rest softly my thumb upon your cheek, my hand will hold your chin as our noses begin to meet. captured on a film, the ink our hearts have bled, i caught that little smile \u2014 before i knew, it fled. contagious as a laugh, though, i caught one of my own, and hung it o\u2019er the windows of this love we call our home.  To the Whomsoevers, I hope this helped you out some! Maybe a bit over-the-top in retrospect, but I enjoyed writing it (ntm, I always love a good excuse to write more poems XD) *Attending audience continues in their bewilderment as the drum section remains inert, still petrified in absolute and sheer horror* *looks down* Oh..did I forget to wear clothes again? ~ Caleb  Author\u2019s notes: \u201cdeebideebidee th-th-that\u2019s all folks!\u201d \u2014 Porky Pig \u201cHah! See! I did use this mechanism/tool as a quote thingy!\u201d \u2014 me Also me \u2014 \u201cPinterest was my source for all of those beauteous pictures up there^^\u201d ",
