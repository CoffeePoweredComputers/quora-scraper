            "answer_text": "John Creasey was a British author who was born in 1908, published his first novel in 1930, became a full-time writer in 1935, and died in 1973. During his career har published more than 600 novels under 28 pen names. This means that he continuously published fifteen novels per year for forty years, and so at no time could spend more than around three weeks on any novel; however, there were years when he published as many as almost thirty books, bringing the possible time spent on each down to less than two weeks. But Creasey was known to be an extremely fast typist, and in fact did many other things during his writing career: he was active in politics, founded the British Crime Writers\u2019 Association, served a year as president of the Mystery Writers of America, raised a family and served in the British National Savings Movement during WWII. So I submit that most probably, Creasey on the average spent from perhaps a week to two or three weeks on each of his books. Could he have written one of them in two days? Yes, probably. A professional typist typically manages around 75 words per minute. A very fast typist will do over 100 words per minute. And a novel is a work of fiction of 40,000 words or more. Consequently, if s/he knew exactly what s/he wanted to write, a very fast typist could nominally write a short novel in around 400 minutes, or a little less than seven hours. I would guess that an extremely fast writer, as Creasey certainly was, might very well have written a novel or two in two days, which after all would provide him with perhaps as much as 20 or more hours, which after all wouldn\u2019t require him to finish off more than around 30 words per minute. As for Stephen King\u2019s Carrie, it\u2019s actually a fairly short novel \u2013 around 60,000 words. The final version, according to King, was written after his wife had found a first draft in his wastbasket, read it, and urged him to finish it. What King says is that inspiration hit him, he realized what he wanted to do with the story, and wrote it very quickly. And in the right circumstances, it\u2019s certainly not miraculous for a writer to manage 10,000 words a day, even if most days probably are far from as successful. What should be remembered, I believe, is that typing a story is usually not the same as creating it. In his autobiography, British author C. S. Forrester (best known for his \u201cHornblower\u201d novels about a naval officer during the Napoleonic wars) writes about spending weeks lying on a couch in his office room while the next story slowly grew in his thoughts. When at last the story was finished, all that remained was to get up off his couch, sit down at his desk, and put it down on paper. The creative process is complex and works differently in different persons, but is always mental. For writers, once the mental process is finished, it really is primarily a question of how fast a typist you happen to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Typing at 100 wpm, 6,000 words per hour, is 60,000 words in a ten-hour day. That\u2019s one short novel. Maybe if you had completed all research, had the characters and plot already in your head, and could sustain a manic typing pace, it could be done. Certainly for \u201cCarrie\u201d in a week. Don\u2019t remember the claim about John Creasy in \u201cOn Writing\u201d (excellent book). I think we\u2019d have to be talking really ragged material, with lots of corrections and edits and rewrites to come. I\u2019ve once or twice got 10,00 words out of a day. Stuff that comes that fast is either utter junk or semi-inspired. In my case 4\u20135 redos were necessary to make the cosmic gifts clean enough to use. But that\u2019s a fantastic bargain: until there\u2019s a rough draft, there\u2019s nothing. You get a flow, you go. ",
