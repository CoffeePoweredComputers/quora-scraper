            "answer_text": "Both reflect a similar meaning. If you are looking for deep analysis, you can say that: Pen your thoughts would mean to simply write your thoughts somewhere. This is majorly a suggestion. Pen down your thoughts would mean to write down your thoughts and make a note out of them. This is majorly a task. But I won't recommend to go into such depths. Both the phrases can definitely be used interchangeably. ",
