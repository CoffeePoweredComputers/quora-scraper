            "answer_text": "the best way to start would be with a short plan. Your plan may be bigger than the end piece but won\u2019t be that long over all. Start by writing down 18 things that are important in your life. These things will be there to show you what you consider important when you write the piece. Next write down 18 milestones in your life. I\u2019m not talking about your 18th birthday being a thing. Everyone past that point has turned 18 and it is a very basic thing. the milestones you want to look for are where things changed. points where your life could have gone two different ways. Times you realised something important. Times you lost someone that affected you strongly. Times you read something that made you really evaluate what you wanted to do. Put both of these lists into order of importance to you and your life. So each of your sentences can have a milestone and be linked to something important. You just mix and match both sets. Take the top milestone and link it to something you feel is important in your life. As far as humour goes. Don\u2019t force it or it will come off cringey. if you really want to make it humorous read up a lot of one liner jokes and look at the format. Plug some of the things into that format and see what you come up with. Whatever you do get someone to proof read it for you. If you want short biographies then it depends entirely on what you are going to be doing with it. An authors one will be different than a businessman\u2019s one. A faculty members academic one will be different from a students yearbook one etc. In short you will have to look up examples based on what you are aiming for in the sense of audience. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "As nearly always in writing, how to start and how to do this is depending on your audience. You want to write \u2018humorous\u2019 so I guess you need the biography for a more or less informal purpose. In this case I would not only think about what you do, but also what you like and maybe what is quirky or funny about you. Like \u2018likes to spend Sundays in pink pyjamas\u2019. You even can break free of reality a bit at this point as in \u2018would really love to be a snatcher in Ravenclaw\u2019s quidditch team\u2019. (Don\u2019t steal these suggestions. Chose something that is true to you.) In informal writing I would be careful with self-attribution, \u2018I\u2019m a nice and pleasant-natured guy/gal\u2019 for example can quickly sound very cheesy. Because \u2018says who?\u2019. Such attribution can come from people near to you, but they sound boastful if they come from yourself. But: in writing a more formal biography, for example, for an job application, self-attribution of positive traits can be expected or even required. Like \u2018I am hard-working and dedicated\u2019.
