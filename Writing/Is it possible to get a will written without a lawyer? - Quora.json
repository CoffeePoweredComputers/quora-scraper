            "answer_text": "Can you make your own will? Sure you can. There\u2019s plenty of examples on the internet and there are forms you can download. If you follow all the steps you can have a perfectly valid will. You can also draft a holographic will, entirely in your own handwriting that can be valid in your state or jurisdiction, if you once again follow all the steps. I\u2019ll tell you the same thing I tell all of my clients wanting to start the process of estate planning. Don\u2019t try and figure how to make your estate documents do what you want, just sit down and tell me what you want. Make a list of your important property, tell me who gets your property and then let me as an attorney figure out how we make that happen. It\u2019s as simple or as complex as you want to make it. What a form can\u2019t tell you is whether what you fill in the blanks will actually do what you think it can do. If all you need is a simple rest and residue will, we can do that in a very cost efficient manner. If you want specific things to go to specific individuals, we can make that happen as well. If you want to leave it all to charity, we can get that done, if you want to leave it all in trust for the grandchildren there\u2019s steps to achieve that goal as well. Estate planning especially with complex estates isn\u2019t easy, it requires a good deal of thought and planning. Frankly I\u2019d say most people don\u2019t have the background or training to do that on your own. With all of that said, yes you can save a few bucks and make your own will. If want assurances that your will will do what you want, you are better off with an attorney. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not that well! If you go to law school, you\u2019ll take a Property class that is chock-full of people writing what they thought were fairly straightforward wills on their own that result in years of acrimonious litigation between relatives and the stuff ending up with someone totally different than what the will says. A key thing indicating why having a lawyer would be helpful: you don\u2019t mention what state you are in, and that can make a huge difference in what works and what doesn\u2019t. You should try to find a lawyer in your area who does this sort of work. Assuming you don\u2019t have a particularly complex situation, it probably won\u2019t be as expensive as you might be thinking. Your state bar association website (Google \u201c[your state] bar association\u201d) should have a guide to finding a licensed practitioner in your area. If you are unable to afford a lawyer, if there is a law school in your area they might have a clinic that helps folks with this sort of thing. Having said all that, the AARP has a guide for sort of process you would be looking at:Creating A Will Online Or With A Lawyer But, again, this is very much the sort of thing where you spending a little bit of money on a lawyer now can save your heirs a lot of time and money later, so if it\u2019s at all possible you probably should consult with a local attorney. Or at least call around and see how much it\u2019s going to cost. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it's entirely possible to have a will written without the advice of an attorney.  You should be able to find the laws regarding a valid will somewhere on your state's website, and you can certainly choose to rely on books published by those such as Nolo Press to attempt to create something that's valid and binding. And, if you have a simply family and a simple estate without much in the way of assets, that's probably fine -- let's call that two kids, two cars, a house, and a small retirement fund.  And you don't want to do anything fancy - it all goes to your spouse, or if your spouse is predeceased, to your kids equally. If, however, you have step-children, children from a previous marriage, any significant investments, homes that are used for a purpose other than living in, or really anything remotely complicated, the amount of money that you'll \"save\" by not going to an attorney will evaporate when  your will winds up in probate court and people are fighting over what it means, whether it's legal, and who gets what. Wills are one of those things where an initial outlay of $500-$1000 is going to save everyone a lot of heartache and trouble when it comes time to resolve the estate. ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t say what country you are from, but in most English speaking countries you can buy \u201cwill kits\u201d which enable lay people to do their own wills without a lawyer. However, they only really work provided your affairs are not complicated. If, for example, you own property or investments in a foreign country, I would not recommend using a will kit. Similarly, if you want to make complex provisions for people after you die. But in simple cases (you want to leave your property to your spouse, or if they before you, to your kids equally) will kits seem to be up to the task. However (whisper this quietly), if you are reasonably intelligent, and you take the time to learn and understand the basic rules, in many countries you can even write your own will (again, providing your needs are simple). But if you are in any doubt, don\u2019t try this. Two additional points that I would make: Firstly, lots of lawyers will do a simple will for you pretty cheaply, but the advantage they give is that they can advise you on things you may not have thought about (such as inheritance taxes).Secondly, whatever you do - do leave a will. One of the cruellest things people do to their loved ones by accident is die intestate (ie. without a will). It often makes no different to who would get the money. But what it does mean is significantly more costly for your family (they will have to go to court to appoint an administrator), more time consuming (it takes months rather than weeks) and more stressful to go through an intestacy than if they had just taken the time to leave a simple will.Reasons to have a will ",

            "answer_text": "A few of the answers here need to be addressed.  Getting a Will written without a lawyer does not necessarily mean a holographic Will. I don't think anybody would recommend that you attempt to write a Will starting with a blank piece of paper. Even a trained estate planning attorney would have a difficult time doing this. You would never be able to properly draft clauses to set up minor trusts, grant appropriate powers to the Executor, and set up alternate plans in case for whatever reason, your first choice plan could not come into effect (e.g. you and your main beneficiary were involved in a common accident). However, there is no legal statute anywhere that requires you to use the services of a lawyer to write a Will. Lawyers provide legal advice, and most people when preparing a simple Will do not need legal advice to do this. I dispute the claim that if you prepare your Will without using a lawyer \"odds are it will not go well\". This is simply not true. If you use an online interactive service, your final Will would look very similar than one prepared by an estate planning attorney. I roll my eyes at lawyers who try to make comparisons with removing your own appendix...it's actually more analogous to filing your own taxes. One of the answers here, provided by a lawyer states that \"in a non-emergency situation you MUST get your Will written by a lawyer\". This it  false. There are many interactive services online that allow you to create an extremely well drafted Will, customized to your jurisdiction, from the comfort of your own home, at an affordable price, that also allow you to update your Will as often as you wish when your circumstances change. Clearly there are situations when you need to see a lawyer, and if you have things like children with special needs, large complex business interests, property in multiple countries etc we would recommend that you seek legal advice. But the vast majority of people could use an online interactive service and create a Will without needing to pay for the services of a lawyer. ",

Have it notorized and filed in your Counties Probate Court. And any Amendments later do the same have it filed. This is to protect your heirs. I have in my day seen People like home health aids draw up phoney Wills. Or even Family members. I seen someone litteraly draw up a Will giving the House to them. But the Person was smart enough to have already put his son on the deed. Making himself a life time occupant. If you have much complicated stuff. Use the Attorney. Scrape the money together. You will leave your Children with less headaches. Attorneys will come to your house as well. If you are homebound. So don't worry about that. And they as standard practice file the Will in Probate Court in your County. DO NOT give your Attorney rights to draw on your money. Once you have passed away. I have seen Attorneys wipe out the money also. And take your time signing the Will. If you do it in the Office take the Will home and read through it, before signing. To bad if they don't like it.

The words of a Will are meant to outlive you, therefore the wording of a Will will have highly specific, specialised and specified meanings in law. In emergency situations, you are allowed in the eyes of the law to  write a Will without a lawyer (by virtue of being in emergency circumstances). You need to write in your own hand (handwriting), and have at least one witness (preferably two) who put their signatures to the Will document to prove that they've actually seen you writing the Will -- the witness(es) don't necessarily have to know the details contained in the Will. The preprinted Will forms that you could buy off the shelf are acceptable enough but they may also be subject to legal challenge. That's the long and short of if. Other commenters please advise if this general overview is acceptable. ",

            "answer_text": "Frankly, I have mixed feelings about preparing a will without an attorney. I see it like this \u2013 if we have a good amount of assets to leave, and we opt to do our will ourselves, we run the risk of missing something, forgetting to add language of some kind to protect something here or something there, or to include this person or that person, or we might miss leaving this asset here or that cash there. Of course we can always purchase a good form online\u2026 but \u2013 it\u2019s not customized really\u2026 it\u2019s just an impersonal generic, albeit accurately organized, form. As I see it, if we want to cover all our bases properly, and have the assets and money in the bank or invested to merit the expense and time\u2026 we still need a good estate attorney to flesh it all out on paper. Again, if we have the financial holdings to merit it. On the other hand, if our assets and holdings are slim, and our savings modest, any decent online document service that sells professionally organized wills will allow us to create a perfectly respectable well drafter will, customized enough to our location and personal situation, and to our unique needs. From the comfort of our own home\u2026 at a very affordable price; and we can always update our will as often as we need to. Probably, if we\u2019re realistic about it, the majority of Americans can get away with using an online interactive document service and create a will without spending money on an estate lawyer. I think, ultimately, a will written by an estate attorney is better than a do-it-yourself will\u2026 even one with a brief visit with an experienced estate lawyer. There are a lot of things we just don\u2019t know how to handle\u2026 addressing grandchildren, and perhaps only grandchildren born before our death. Or, if we have significant assets and cash to leave our heirs, or beneficiaries, we can create a trust with the help of an estate lawyer. Of course, if we don\u2019t have much to leave \u2013 why spend a lot of money o a will or, worse, a trust! But if we do \u2013 we might not want to allow a ne\u2019er\u2013do-well grown child have access to money we are leaving them until a certain birthday, to insure maturity\u2026 or until he or she completes college, perhaps with some courses on economics\u2026 or whatever. Or maybe if one particular beneficiary remains alcohol-free or drug-free for 15 or 20 years. So, I agree that at the end of the day a decent estate attorney is a real good investment. It costs\u2026 but in my view it\u2019s worth every penny. Looking at all of this from the other end, from the heir\u2019s point of view, from my experience, I think estates without a will, or with a poorly drafted, or amateurish, will often creates a somewhat nervous situation later on\u2026 Not always, but often. Heirs don\u2019t have a reliable will to follow, to depend on, and so frequently will be motivated to take steps to borrow money against inheritance, to get a loan on inheritance, for as much cash as possible\u2026. heirs often get very nervous about things during probate, even if there is an attorney of record in place, but managing an estate based on a will that was written poorly, probably without an attorney \u2013 is tough. So some of those heirs will get a loan on inheritance just to have enough cash on hand if they need to hire their own estate lawyer, or pricey CPA, or perhaps tax attorney. Some professional who can help them try to make the best of a bad estate plan, or an obviously badly written will. Some may even contest such a will. We\u2019ve all seen it happen in circumstances like this. Some of those worried heirs or beneficiaries, especially middle class or upper middle class heirs that are dealing with painful cash flow problems, or unemployment issues, or severe debt challenges \u2013 frequently feel they simply have to get a loan on inheritance to hire a CPA, or their own lawyer or a tax attorney, or just to feel more confident with more money in the bank.\u2026 So they get an advance against inheritance, an inheritance advance\u2026 Usually one of the faster inheritance loans, probate loans, estate loans, probate advance or inheritance advance assignments \u2013 and generally we\u2019re looking at middle class or upper middle class heirs\u2026 People who don\u2019t have wealthy parents to lean on. Who have to lean on themselves. So that inheritance, and of course an advance on that inheritance, is often a life saver for many heirs who can now get an advance on that inheritance, a probate advance, who apply for a loan against an inheritance, an inheritance cash advance\u2026 either one of the larger trust fund loans or probate loans, inheritance loans, estate loans, or probate advance, inheritance loan, estate loan or probate advance assignment \u2013 and take care to research tons of loans on inheritance, inheritance loans, from established inheritance advance or inheritance loans companies like www.inheritanceadvance.com, or www.heiradvance.com, or perhaps www.inheritancenow.com. Firms that have a lot of experience with probate heirs, probate advance property, etc. I actually see that type of advance on inheritance as a sort of \u201chidden\u201d benefit of probate that often isn\u2019t generally available if our inheritance is not in an estate going through probate; or is in a trust with a Spendthrift Clause. Despite the glow of inheritance money up ahead, which unfortunately takes time to get it, a year or two usually\u2026 Hence the probate cash option, to get speedy inheritance money, which can be a real life saver during probate, based on need for fast cash, or medical issues, or foreclosure. Whatever the need is \u2013 it generally requires fast cash to fix the problem. ",

Virtually everywhere a will needs at least 2 independent Witnesses. A Beneficiary cannot be a Witness to your Will ever. A Beneficiary can however be appointed as an Executor to your Will in most Jurisdictions. Make absolutely certain that you follow the instructions included with the Will Package and you can safely do it yourself. If you have overseas properties they generally don't form part of your own Jurisdiction's Estate. You need a separate Will for those properties written under the laws applicable to that country. Some countries don't recognize wills that have not been registered with the local Registry Office or Certified by a local Notary Public. In those cases you have no option other than to employ a legal adviser in that type of Jurisdiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Not much I can add here but I will try. The other answers are so good, I wish I had covered the easy ground first. Some states (New York) prohibit holographic wills but that is more on the grounds that they are not properly witnessed. You must have at least two witnesses who are not beneficiaries or have some inside interest.  The real issue you face is poor writing or mistakes in what is written. One mistake can mean years of litigation. Grammar can mean all the difference between four of your six children inheriting and \"share and share alike\". Some will forms neglect to demand that some states do not allow disinheritance ( Louisiana) , so you have to leave every child something, and others allow it. You have to provide for a living spouse but a smart lawyer can get you around that. Sometimes the spouse wants that ( think inheritance taxes.) New Jersey has some terrible inheritance taxes but Florida does not.  So in the end, a lawyer drafted will is probably better but don't go on price. Look for reputation. Some lawyers charge more than they are worth and some charge less. More people have simple interests but are you aware that a will can actually make sure you provide only for grandchildren and only those grandchildren born as of your death? Or that you can establish a trust with no money, to provide for your girlfriend but not give anything for your bad children? Or give your children money only if they remain drug-free for 21 years? So a good lawyer is a good investment, like fine art or a fine car, which will give you pleasure long after you no longer need it. ",
