            "answer_text": "Here is my answer to a similar question. While writing 45 minutes per day will increase your output, I believe in will enhance your writing skills only so much. Lets take golf for an example; say you go to the range and practice everyday, doing the exact same thing. Is this going to improve your game? Some, but if you do that everyday, and you\u2019re doing it wrong, than you\u2019re perfecting wrongness. Perhaps a better use of that 315 minutes a week might be reading how-to books on writing and writing techniques; focusing on dialogue, plotting, narration, character creation, and how-to advice on specific genres you\u2019re interested in. Beyond that, there are a myriad of in-person classes, (not recommended at this time) on-line classes from Writer\u2019s Studio (where I took semesters and learned a lot) and hundreds of other. Also Great Courses has several courses on creative writing on CD, DVD and streamed which are very good. There advantage is you can go back and replay and redo parts with areas of concern. A final good use of your time is to read, both good and bad writing, but read as a writer, with the intent, \u201cHow the heck did she write such powerfully tense, realistic sounding dialogue?\u201d and \u201cHow does he handle flash backs so smoothly?\u201c I\u2019ve mentioned reading as a writer, several times in the past, but, truthfully, beyond that mind-set, I didn\u2019t really know. I Just finished Francine Prose\u2019s book, \u201cReading Like A Writer,\u201d which I found very useful. I think the best answer to your question would be the shotgun method; use them all, and one more thing; if you can find a mentor, picking her brain and using her could be the greatest use of your time towards improving your writing skills. Write like the wind!             Just a few of the books I have on creative writing. ",
