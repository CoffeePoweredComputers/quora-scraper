            "answer_text": "How did I find my voice? By using it. By using it and using it and using it. But not just by writing. I found my voice by speaking. By singing in the shower. By getting lost in hours of swirling daydreams. By getting braver in relationships and owning my truth. Through political arguments on Facebook never intended to change anyone\u2019s damn mind, hours and hours of talking with dear friends, whispered bedtime stories with my girls at night, pouring out the deepest secrets in messy scrawls in my own journal. Through nights of making love and afternoons of pouring out rivers of grief and through paying deep attention to all the boring, mundane bits until they too became extraordinary. Through fumbling and twisting and getting it wrong and by being too concise and too verbose and by saying the exact thing I never meant to say. The actual writing \u2014 pen to paper or fingers to keyboard \u2014 that\u2019s the least of it, really. A writer\u2019s voice isn\u2019t just word choice or sentence structure or novel turns of phrase. That elusive voice we are all in search of? It\u2019s not often so much about the words at all. It\u2019s the beating human heart that matters. Voice, true voice, is the active pulse of life that comes from the core of you. It\u2019s that essential nameless thing that is yours and can never belong to anyone else. It\u2019s not just the way you mold language to suit, it\u2019s in your breath, in your smile, even in your silence. Voice, for me, is not found in the writing of a life, but in the living of it. Give yourself over to that living, and then commit to the recording of it in countless different ways (words and images and watercolor and stories and dance and attention) and you\u2019ll find the raw kernel of your voice where it has been all along. Within. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I never \u201cfound\u201d my voice as a writer. I always had it. A writer\u2019s voice emerges as a natural consequence of the subjects they tackle, the genre they work in, the vocabulary they have, the parole and patois of where they grew up and have lived. The \u201cvoice\u201d naturally follows from life and experience. What I did need to do was learn to trust my voice. Like most writers, I went through a long period of uncertainty and doubt about whether my voice was fresh and compelling enough, whether my writing was \u201cgood\u201d enough. That never really goes away, I think; I still struggle with it. Working with other writers and editors helps (although some days, the critiques can be brutal). Having the support and encouragement of friends and family helps. But mostly, it\u2019s a leap of faith. One trusts one\u2019s voice, or one takes one\u2019s ball and goes home. We do the best with what we\u2019ve got. ",
