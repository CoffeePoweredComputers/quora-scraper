Of course,our struggles in life define our character and make us more resilient.Someone who went through struggles will always be more poised and adept at dealing with complicated situations than someone who has been highly pampered. HOWEVER, I don't feel there is a Personal God or divine being who has planned out our entire sequence of life(Mind you,this is my personal opinion and am not imposing my beliefs upon anyone). Both good and bad things happen to people due to CAUSE and EFFECT of the Universe or BUTTERFLY EFFECT ",

            "answer_text": "We are like marble blocks and our struggles are the sculptor\u2019s tools that chip away the unwanted bits. God is the sculptor. When He's done with us, we be mighty pretty and pleasing to His eye. That's the romantic version. The truth is our choices define us. If we align ourselves with the Creator we grow spiritually and things go well with us in the face of adversity. Not without drama, but at least a way out and over and through it all. Struggles are a given. Our character emerges as we fight the good fight. Be attentive to Soul and Character will stand up and show up and be counted. Best wishes ",
