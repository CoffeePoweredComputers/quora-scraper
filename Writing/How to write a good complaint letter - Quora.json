            "answer_text": "Keep emotion out of it. Before you call to make a complaint write out salient points. Have a timeline of events, actions, conversations. I often take complaints from customers about service and the ones that get the quickest and most effective actions are the ones where I can clearly email the manager with the timeline of events, what was said by who, what was done by who, what the end results were and what the customer wants to be done now. Know what you want as a resolution for your complaint. You may not get it but start with the best case of what you would like to see done and then negotiate from there. Yelling, screaming, cursing and calling names accomplishes little and doesn\u2019t put someone in a receptive frame of mine to help you or work with you to resolve the problem. I have gone out of my way to resolve issues for customers who treated me like a human being with feelings of my own who realized that the problem wasn\u2019t my fault and I was trying to help resolve it. I have offered money off or waived dispatch fees for customers who didn\u2019t get nasty with me when our schedule got screwed up because a technician got sick or delayed on a previous call and we couldn\u2019t get out to them that night and needed to reschedule for the next day. It\u2019s ok to ask for stuff like that, but the nicer you are about it the more likely they are to help you or find someone who can. It\u2019s ok to let them know how you were inconvenienced by something they did. If you took off work early to be there, let them know that and that you have lost wages as a result because you could have been at work instead of at home waiting for them and you feel that deserves a discount, but try to stay calm about it. Stick to the problem and the related facts. The less extraneous information that doesn\u2019t apply to the situation at hand the better. It\u2019s quicker and easier for them to come to a solution that way. Hopefully, this helps a little bit. ",
