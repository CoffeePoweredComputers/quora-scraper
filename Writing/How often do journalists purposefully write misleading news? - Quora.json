            "answer_text": "I don't don't know how often this happened with this particular newspaper, but it was a newspaper that eventually went out of business. I only know of one such article it had published, but there was no avoiding the notice of it because it almost endangered me while I was still a grade school child. The article was written for the express and obvious purposes of singing the praises of a young boy who was the son of a personal friend of the journalist. The boy in question was a terrible bully to me and getting worse by the day, and less than 48 hours after he got very publicly caught in the act of physically messing with me in front of many other students the article appeared early that morning. While my name was never mentioned, it was clear what would happen to me if I ever complained about his treatment of me ever again. He had blamed me for being a \u201cBlabbermouth.\u201d for already reporting him to our teacher, who said she couldn't do anything since it was my word against his. This I did understand, but he did not; and that's how things began falling apart for him. As he saw it, he would have never gotten in trouble on the first place if I hadn't complained about his earlier behavior, after which he then got caught in the act twice, the second and more spectacular time by one of my brothers, who only saw it because he was home early from high school due to a dental appointment and we lived right across the street from the school. Less than 48 hours later the article was in the newspaper early that morning, but I hadn't known it yet. What I did notice was that I began my walk home in peace without him chasing me and throwing rocks with the help of his gang, which had been growing almost daily by then. Usually he was behind me. This time he was way ahead of me surrounded by other kids. They were all congratulating, patting him on the back, and shaking his hand. It all seemed very odd, because the timing of the whole crowd seemed to suggest they were already there when they should have just going out the doors themselves. Then again none of them appeared to go to my school, which only made it seem even more odd. I asked what was happening, not yet aware of the article and just relieved he seemed too busy to mess with me for once. I then heard smug laughter from the crowd with remarks like \u201cThis'll teach her!\u201d The boy they came to pay their respects to ran to me and began to crow. \u201cYeah, like you don't know! Where's your brother now?! Why don't you sick him on me now?! Why isn't he here now?!\u201d The only reason my brother wasn't there already was because he had been back on his own school schedule and was also unaware of the article; but the boy in question thought it was a sign he had been scared off by said article and this would make him bullet proof. He refused to understand I still didn't know what was now happening let alone let me speak and must have gotten drunk on his imagined power because he lost control of himself in front of all those who came to see him. Whatever purpose the timing of their presence may or may not have been for they were now all witness to what he had been doing for a long time already and why the article had been printed in the first place. He gave it all away by his words and actions alone right there and then. The crowd, who started by encouraging what they evidently thought would be different behavior on his part stopped laughing and some called out for him to stop, he was being a jerk. But he continued, firmly establishing it wasn't just a matter of him being a sore winner. For a boy who had been dedicating much of his time tearing down my reputation he seemed to have no idea what it took to have one of any kind. He had been literally handed one on a silver platter and he broke it within hours. Especially since he alone brought up the subject of how he had been treating me because the article made no mention whatsoever of me or anything I had said, most likely because he probably failed to tell his father and his father's friend he really had gotten in trouble by being caught in the act twice already and not because I had made only claims of earlier behavior where the only evidence available at the time had been his word against mine, which of course he denied. Once others who actually did go to the same school saw that he had failed to push me back into the image in which he was trying to recreate me they came forward to report not only what they had seen him do but how he had been treating them as well. Since then I've been less inclined to listen to everything I get from the news. News reporters are people too, and they get lied to as well. But at least they have the guts to allow their faces on camera while reporting the news, unlike some of their sources. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by \u201cmisleading news\u201d. If you mean out-and-out lies - this very, very, very rarely happens except in regimes where the media are propaganda outlets. No respectable publication would condone it, and on the rare occasions it happens, it\u2019s down to an individual rogue reporter. But it takes place so infrequently it\u2019s really not worth worrying about. Occasionally there are cases where the journalist knows more about a subject than they write, but are not able to tell the whole story - perhaps because of legal issues, or to protect a source. However, in those cases, they\u2019d still take care to ensure that what they did write wasn\u2019t actually misleading. In other words, it would be true as far as it went. Then there is the more difficult question of when an angle on a story becomes misleading, without being factually incorrect. Suppose there is a new scientific study out, stating that on 999 out of 1000 criteria, people are healthier than ever before. But the incidence of one very obscure kind of cancer has increased from 0.000001% to 0.000002%. Is Cancer cases double! misleading? It\u2019s strictly speaking correct: cases of a cancer have doubled. But it also gives an impression to the reader that is very much at odds with the bigger picture given by the academic study. This happens quite a lot. But normally it\u2019s the same media outlets that do it over and over again (you won\u2019t generally find a publication that is sober and respectable most of the time suddenly descending to this level), so they\u2019re not too difficult to spot.
