            "answer_text": "Hemingway does not use \"too many conjunctions,\" as another answer asserts, nor was his style the easily-reduced set of caricatural rules used to guide parodies of his prose. It's popular to mock Hemingway now for his putatively offensive peccadilloes and his problematic politics, but:  Hemingway did not write to be \"manly\" and he was not narrowly or stupidly concerned with seeming macho or acting tough; his style is not the pose of a puffed-up bullyThat Hemingway set some stories in Spain is not a matter of style but of subjectHemingway won the Nobel Prize for Literature, and as worthless as a Nobel Prize in Literature is, he was not lauded internationally because he wrote while drunkThe transformation of Hemingway from legitimate literary figure to object of common derision amazes me. As a writer, he was deeply thoughtful about prose, style, the function of theme, the technical and strategic aspects of his craft; his influence is without a doubt as significant as that of, say, Faulkner or Kafka, and he's not far behind any of them (nor Joyce) in his formal creativity. Almost none of the classics of the latter half of the 20th century in American letters, from journalistic movements to literary icons to the dialogue in Hollywood movies, would be the same without Hemingway. Of course, it's possible to be tired of conjunctions; I have just as often heard people complain of Kafka's insistence on the use of semi-colons and uninterrupted paragraphs. But what's amusing is that Hemingway was a central figure in the restoration of realism to fiction, and to bemoan his style is essentially to bemoan how people speak! Hemingway was only trying to get close to reality, and in several stories I believe he got very close indeed, largely because of his stylistic creativity. For example:  One Reader Writes She sat at the table in her bedroom with a newspaper folded open before her and only stopping to look out of the window at the snow which was falling and melting on the roof as it fell. She wrote this letter, writing it steadily with no necessity to cross out or rewrite anything. Roanoke, Virginia February 6, 1933 Dear Doctor \u2013   May I write you for some very important advice \u2013 I have a decision to make and don't know just whom to trust most I dare not ask my parents \u2013and so I come to you\u2013 and only because I need not see you, can I confide in you even. Now here is the situation \u2013 I married a man in U. S. service in 1929 and that same year he was sent to China, Shanghai \u2013 he staid three years \u2013 and came home \u2013 he was discharged from the service some few months ago. and went to his mother's home in Helena, Arkansas. He wrote for me to come home. I went, and found he is taking a course of injections and I naturally ask, and found he is being treated for I don't know how to spell the word but it sound like this \"sifilus\". Do you know what I mean \u2013 now tell me will it ever be safe for me to live with him again. I did not come in close contact with him at any time since his return from China. He assures me he will be OK after this doctor finishes with him. Do you think it right \u2013 I often heard my Father say one could well wish themselves dead if once they became a victim of that malady. I believe my Father but want to believe my Husband most. Please, please tell me what to do \u2013 I have a daughter born while her Father was in China. Thanking you and trusting wholly in your advice I am   and signed her name.   Maybe he can tell me what's right to do, she said to herself. Maybe he can tell me. In the picture in the paper he looks like he'd know. He looks smart, all right. Every day he tells somebody what to do. He ought to know. I want to do whatever is right. It's such a long time though. It's a long time. And it's been a long time. My Christ, it's been a long time. He had to go wherever they sent him, I know, but I don't know what he had to get it for. Oh, I wish to Christ he wouldn't have got it. I don't care what he did to get it. But I wish to Christ he hadn't ever got it. It does seem like he didn't have to have got it. I don't know what to do. I wish to Christ he hadn't got any kind of malady. I don't know why he had to get a malady. This extremely short story \u2014which may amuse contemporary readers who cannot imagine the agony of fearful ignorance of this sort (while we surely experience other forms)\u2014 illustrates the stylistically experimental approaches Hemingway was willing to take in order to capture something like truth, something like the rhythm and cadence of a frightened interior monologue. Note that we pass from 3rd person to a document to 1st person without any cumbersome explanation or exposition; note, too, that the form of the prose, the style of it, has nothing to do with Hemingway, not as a drinker or as a macho jerk or as a suicide or anything else. It is the style best suited to this woman, this woman's thoughts in her state of despair; that is, it is her style. If this story now seems \"predictable\" or \"ho-hum,\" it's because Hemingway made this common. Contrast it with the interior monologues of a typical fictional character from that time and you'll see quite clearly that this was not only different, it was a kind of achievement. Saying \"Hemingway used lots of conjunctions because he was a drunk\" misses the point quite badly; Hemingway tried to capture the ignored worlds of ordinary humans and render them such that both the beauty and the pity of each was clear. Hemingway was perfectly capable of \"fancier\" prose and even made sport of it in his short story \"A Natural History of the Dead.\" It's clear, in that piece, that he feels something like contempt for the capacity of language to dither intricately while bones crack and flesh tears. So, in sum, Hemingway's style can be described as follows:  Extreme concision; only the essential.What's essential? The human / experiential elements of situations.No elaboration of facts; the brutality of facts, of facticity itself.Diction, syntax, and grammar suited to the subject; a refusal to parade sophistication while narrating stories of broken boxers or soldiers or fishermen or prostitutes.A use of space, of the unsaid; in being direct and concise, he leaves room around the text.Enormous reworking and polishing of prose, which produces occasionally perfect sentences with lots of density and punch.You will often read that Hemingway's style \"grew out of\" his time as a journalist, and you will see the word \"reportage\" used in this context; while it's true that journalists are concise, it's not as though he was concise because of the Kansas City Star.This often produces memorable short stories and less memorable novels, in my opinion. Indeed, The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway features a lot of truly astonishing prose, and if you're looking to learn more about his style, that's where I'd start. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that Hemingway was one of the greatest novelists of our time. Writing in the concise, at times brutal, style that he did is not easy, and I think in many ways he used the English language to physically embody the emotional conflict that many men of his generation felt inside. His often short sentences are packed with power, like a punch, but his obsessively repeated imagery (the drunken scenes in The Sun Also Rises come to mind) speaks of a sort of emotional sloppiness \u2014 the man that feels desire and pain deeply, but can\u2019t figure out how to express it, so he tries over and over to run away from himself. Hemingway also attempted to depict the tight conflicts between couples, and to address the fact that so little is really said out loud. He left the truths behind his stories to our imaginations, which I enjoy. In his own time Hemingway stood out for writing in his own way; this is also why some people couldn\u2019t stand his books. I think he cherished writing, and he worked hard at crafting what he wrote, rather than crafting his \u201cstyle.\u201d Many people might describe his style as too terse or even superficial, particularly if you compare it to works by authors like Faulkner or Joyce. In the end Hemingway\u2019s alcoholism and depression are great windows into a man who was messy and hurting, and who tried to express that through his art. ",
