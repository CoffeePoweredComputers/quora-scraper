            "answer_text": "I thought I understood this question until I read Jasleen's answer. Because this is in a literature and fiction topic area of Quora, I immediately assumed that the question is about developing characters in works of fiction. For that question I do not have any books. The magazine, Writers Digest http://www.writersdigest.com/ , has several compilations of articles that have dealt extensively with this topic and provide a varied look at individual techniques and \"best practices.\"  As for fiction books that have helped build my character, I have been influenced by quite a few. The character building usually was the product of my life experiences converging with something addressed in a novel or play I was reading. Because of this, I have not repeated character building experiences when I have revisited works that were influential. I have been shaped more by nonfiction works. ",

            "answer_text": "Developing strong character comes from within and isn\u2019t something that changes - it is a part of your character. To get you thinking about what this means for you, I might suggest reading Man\u2019s Search for Meaning. To develop and balance your character with your competencies, I suggest looking to the Franklin Covey franchise: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (and the 8th Habit, etc. in the series) and The Speed of Trust. The 7 Habits, written by the late Steven Covey can be said to be a basis for his son\u2019s The Speed of Trust. The former is a decent and straightforward read that can be taught in excruciating detail should a leader choose. The latter has many basic concepts and IMPO should be taught using their curriculum because it includes modifying your behaviors to build/maintain/repair trust amongst colleagues. ",
