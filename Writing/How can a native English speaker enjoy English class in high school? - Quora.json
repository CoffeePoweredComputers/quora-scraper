            "answer_text": "Shakespeare is often a drag to read. I've usually found it best to watch a good movie version of a play before reading it -- Kenneth Branagh's stuff especially. Netflix is full of the stuff. Of course, not everybody is a natural born reader, especially of fiction.  Perhaps you're one of them. It's been many years since I've read any \"serious\" or literary fiction -- except for a return to read some Dickens every couple of years.  Mostly, I stick to thrillers/mysteries and the very occasional sci-fi.  Even at that, for every novel that I read there are at least two or three that I start and quit after 15 or 20 pages. On the other hand, I do read a lot of other books -- mostly history stuff nowadays, two or three a week. That said, I'm in the advice-giving mood at the moment so I'm going to blather on for a bit. I'm assuming that you're in your mid-teens, maybe 15 or 16, and so you've got a lot of school still ahead of you.  You have my sympathy.  But, almost always, it's something that you just have to put your head down and plow through and a big part of the plowing is going to involve reading. One thing that you've got to learn -- and, since you're still in high school, I'm guessing that you really haven't had a chance to learn it yet -- is that at least half of the stuff in life that's really worth doing isn't much fun while you're doing it -- and it usually doesn't seem like it's all that worth doing while you're doing it.  It isn't until later, sometimes much later -- years, decades even -- that you really realize how worthwhile it was.   That's the way the Army was for me. Let's try a bit of a metaphor here. I don't know if you play sports, football especially.  When I did in high school, more than anything I hated the blocking sleds, the running through tires, the jogging up and down the stadium steps -- you name it, I hated it all.   The only thing that seemed worthwhile to me were the games themselves. But all of the rest of that crap was absolutely necessary if I were going to be able to perform in an actual game situation.  So I did it, cursing and muttering under my breath the whole time. Part of the reason why we went through that stuff was so that we could develop what is often called muscle memory -- in other words, so that we could do what we had to do without having to think through every step of it. Reading's a lot like that. It's like something else too.  Somebody once said, it's not necessary to be courageous, all you have to do is act courageous and in time courage will come to you. You don't have to like to read, all you have to do is read.  Eventually you'll get really good at it and, probably, even get to like it. (For my part, there are three or four other things that I like as much as reading but nothing that I like better.) Here's a hint that might make reading easier and more enjoyable for you. One of the things about reading is that to a very great extent it requires that you know a lot of miscellaneous stuff in order to understand what it is that you're reading. Sort of the old you're-not-allowed-to-use-scissors-until-you-know-how-to-use-scissors thing. Fortunately nowadays we have the internet and it can help make the learning background stuff relatively painless. There are two good websites (well, at least I like them) that will help a lot: Top 10 Lists - Listverse and mentalfloss.com. Aside from that, I'd suggest you get some books -- nonfiction for starters, I'd suggest -- out of the library that are about some subjects that you find interesting and then force yourself to read 15 or 20 of them. No matter how much you're tempted, keep at the task.  Don't quit.  Don't give up. Just do it. The first couple will probably be pretty hard slogging but by the time you get to the 15th or so, it should be pretty enjoyable going. Okay, that's enough soap-boxing for one day. ",

            "answer_text": "If you prefer YA books to the assigned books - is that what you meant? - then it's difficult to like English class. This has little if anything to do with being a native speaker - it has everything to do with what you like to read.  Many kids who don't like English classes or Lit classes have trouble with reading. Reading books is a slog if you don't read well. But you clearly do read well or you wouldn't pick up books to read on your own for pleasure. There's some poetry that some might consider similar to YA  - Alan Ginsburg's poetry - he certainly wrote in a youthful tone - but he's not often assigned in high school English classes. From what you're saying it sounds as if the only possible way for you to enjoy English classes would be if the reading list were changed - and the curriculum as well. Maybe it would help to read Shakespeare in translation first - easily found on line - than the slog it can be to read Shakespeare in the English of his time. ",
