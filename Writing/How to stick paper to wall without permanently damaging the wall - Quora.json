            "answer_text": "Zinsser SureGrip Heavy Duty Strippable Wallcovering Adhesive, 1 qt, Container, Clear, Paste - Walmart.comThis is strippable wallpaper paste. You would use it to mount a billboard to a wall or something like that. When you put up something huge, if you use products made for small items they are going to fail and you\u2019ll constantly be nursing that job along by fixing this area and that one. There are other brands, but this is an acceptable and cheap one. For smaller items you can use that 3M adhesive that you can detach by stretching it. You can frame your paper item with removable masking tape. You could just use finish nails, frame and hang it, and patch the little tiny holes later. It\u2019s easy enough and it only takes a little dot of paint. Most homeowners and landlords keep a little touchup paint for the walls because it\u2019s a terrible job of planning ahead if one doesn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! This is an easy-to-solve problem and can be done in a way that looks good, too! Washi tape is a great alternative to wall tack or anything with a strong adhesive on it. No wear and tear on your walls AND it comes in all colors and patterns so that when you tape the border of the paper it will frame it!   This version of using washi tape formed creative frames in terms of some of the shapes and arrangement.   Easily removable and very inexpensive are what I see as two perks of using washi tape! Good luck and I hope this works out for you!  ",
