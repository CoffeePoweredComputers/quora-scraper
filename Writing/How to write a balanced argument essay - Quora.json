            "answer_text": "There are three key aspects of writing a balanced argument \u2014 tone, space and viewpoints. One, the tone of the article should be neutral. You must look like you are advocating for all points equally, without any bias. Second, each point should get enough space in the essay. You cannot spend three paragraphs talking about one aspect and then give another aspect only three lines. Third, don\u2019t think of balance as a binary concept. There aren\u2019t just two sides to everything. Think of multiple viewpoints, as many as you can find or think of, and include it all in your essay. ",
