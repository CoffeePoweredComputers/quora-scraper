            "answer_text": "I feel first time, I should thank the person who raised this question here. Thank you! This question pulled back my memories. I started shaving may be at 17. To this year it is exactly 17 years back. There were no supermarkets and hypermarkets. Everyone used to buy at Grocery and Kirana shops. My father used to buy at wholesale shops to save on some cost. There won't be any racks to display products in these shops and no advertisement boards to make impulsive buying or some salesman to explain about the product. One day my mother went to the same shop to purchase groceries. There she had seen this  when someone was buying and asked the seller what was the purpose of this? My father do not use after shave even now and so she doesn\u2019t have idea about the product. The shopkeeper told her it is an after shave and makes the skin soft and smooth. She instantly purchased and given to me. I used this on my first day of shave though I don't know how to shave properly. This is how my mother cares me. She gives me everything before I ask and she says, \u201cwhy don't you ask and take from me\u201d. We don't have a camera to click this moment, but I treasure this incident till my lifetime. From that day, I became fan to this Cologne, and I still use this though I tried many brands. My mother never said anything when I kept long beard. But my wife always asks to shave. :) Pa1 ",
