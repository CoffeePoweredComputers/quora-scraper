            "answer_text": "Yeah many don\u2019t know, I will give you 2 fast ways to get your website indexed. (Point No. 1) First one is using Google Console or you can also go to the Search Console - Crawl URL option directly and submit your website link, but you should be logged on to your gmail account. The second way is to create a blog in any Web 2.0 like Blogger, WordPress, Wix, Weebly. Here you create the website like a blog. To start with initially post 3\u20135 blog posts. After that you can start inserting your backlinks in the posts as anchor text links. You can place around 10\u201315 links and get the post published. Since these are Web 2.0, the search engine bots crawl them regularly and keep updating its database or index. Wait for a week and remove all links as it would have got crawled. If it hasn\u2019t then you can manually submit the Post URL to Google as mentioned in Point No. 1 above. There are also paid options available, but they too have a limit of 15\u201350 URLs per day. Why? Remember, the backlinks have to look natural. For more on SEO, please do visit my website - SKARTEC Digital Marketing Academy ",
