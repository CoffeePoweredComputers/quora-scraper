            "answer_text": "Think of your book as a product. Now here's the thing, to be a millionaire, you need to sell that product to a million of a hundred thousand people (depending on the price range and revenues) So writing can actually be a very lucrative business if one knows how to make good books and sell them. Simple as that. Best of luck for your life, my friend, and if anything has resonated with you then please upvote this answer, and let me know your thoughts in the comments. Thank you and have a great day!! ",
