            "answer_text": "This is how to do it: Do it the way that seems best to you, in consultation with your editor. If you want NO capitals in your title, you can do that.If you want ALL capitals in your title, you can do that, too.However, the conventional way to capitalize the words in the title of a book or article is this: a) capitalize the first word, even if it is really short, like \u2018the\u2019 or \u2018a\u2019,b) capitalize the major words: all the nouns, adjectives, and adverbs and verbs,c) it is generally not necessary to capitalize articles (the and a or an) or prepositions, or very short words (unless they are important to the title),d) when in doubt, just capitalize all the words. It\u2019s okay.",
