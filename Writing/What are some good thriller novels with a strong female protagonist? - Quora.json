            "answer_text": "Gone girl by Gillian Flynn. In several interviews, Flynn has said that she was interested in exploring the psychology and dynamics of a long-term relationship. In portraying her principal characters who are out-of-work writers, she made use of her own experience being laid off from her job as a writer for Entertainment Weekly. On a personal note, wow! What a book. I loved the way the author has tried to fabricate both the sides of the story. For no moment, while reading the man's portions, would you think that the book is written by a female author. Each and every credit goes to the author for learning the men's psychology so well. ",

            "answer_text": "For this question, I would like to point out this novel by Spandana Chakradhar \u2013 Sadhana Who Stalked Her? The novel is based around Sadhana who becomes victim of stalking in Delhi. Initially, I felt as it is a horror fiction, but as the story moves on it becomes transparent that Sadhana is the only lead character in the novel who not only fights her way to restore her life back to normalcy but also hunts down her enemies.  Mind-blowing performance by the lady. The performance of the lead character is way beyond ordinary\u2026yes I admit that she was not as glamorous as \u2018Salander of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\u2019. Rather she is simple, sober, and elegant. The way she rises from being mild carelessness to fighting cat will keep you on toes. This protagonist is worth watching. ",
