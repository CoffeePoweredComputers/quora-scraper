            "answer_text": "Scene breaks are usually for when there\u2019s some break in continuity, either in place or time. Sometimes you can continue a scene by saying something like \u201ca few minutes later,\u201d if you wish to continue on without a break. As to how to show a scene break, the \u201c* * *\u201d centered on the line seems to be the usual, but I\u2019d check with your publisher to make sure. They may have a different standard they want you adhere to. Dependent upon the type of novel, they may decide on some special character based on genre or even your story. While you\u2019re writing, make it something simple and unique, like the above, so that a quick find-n-replace will take care of it. ",

            "answer_text": "From my experience, I\u2019d say it depends on the publisher. Many of them have their own rules about how to mark a scene break. If I don\u2019t know the particular standard, I skip a line and put a hashtag mark centered on the blank line. If I get far enough with the submission that it matters whether the publisher wants something different, the editor will tell me what to change. ",
