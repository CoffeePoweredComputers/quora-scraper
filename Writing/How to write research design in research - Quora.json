It\u2019s very broad, and any answer really depends on several things: your area of interest, your level of experience, and the expectations and guidelines of your professors (or anyone else who will be reviewing your design). Take a look at this example of a research design for the social sciences. It has a good list of the things you need to consider for just about any type of research project. If you hover over each of the areas listed in the tabs, like Literature Review or Discussion, you\u2019ll see additional details for each area.
