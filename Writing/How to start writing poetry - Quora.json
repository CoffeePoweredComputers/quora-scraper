            "answer_text": "A few other answers correctly say that you have to read a lot. I\u2019ll elaborate on that. You have to read poetry.You have to read widely, from diverse poets of many different eras and locations.You have to read actively. You have reach for what the poem is telling you. You have to think about and speculate about what such poetic devices like images, rhyme schemes or even odd line breaks are conveying. If a poem makes you feel something, you have to ask HOW it is doing that. In other words, you have search for the poet\u2019s technique. It is like the difference between watching a movie with your mouth open, just taking it in, and instead watching it for changes in pace, sound cues, color, camera angles, and seeing HOW those tools work their magic. That is how you begin to develop your own skill with those tools.You have to read openly, with both heart and head. You have to connect to poetry enough that it makes you feel something, or think something, or ask some new question. In other words, it can\u2019t be just an intellectual exercise. If you learn to enjoy poetry, it will give you endlessly varied pleasure.You have to find your favorite poets. Find some that inspire you. That list should change and grow over time, as your reading ability and exposure grows. As a start, I\u2019d suggest Ada Limon.(This is an odd one.) Read some less-than-incredible poets. Try to understand what they are trying to achieve, and ask yourself if you could achieve their goal better than they are. I have often been inspired to write something by reading a good attempt that ultimately fails. Then I start writing just to do that same thing better, out of sheer exasperation. :-)Re the first thing: according to the poetry teachers I know, it is very common for young people to want to write poetry, but not to read it. Let\u2019s just think about how strange that is. If you were a musician, would you say you just want to play music, and that you don\u2019t want to listen to it? What kind of musician doesn\u2019t want to listen to music? Re the second thing: reading poetry actively is hard to learn on your own. The best way might be in a poetry writing class (NOT a literature class.) In a poetry class or \u201cworkshop,\u201d as they are often called, you get to read other students\u2019 poetry and make some analytical comments about it. That activity is not really for their benefit (most comments I have received in workshops are ignorant, irrelevant or otherwise not helpful.) It is for YOUR benefit as a reader. It is to give you practice in reading. (There are also books that help you learn to read poetry well, but I am more familiar with books for fiction.) The next thing to do would be to start writing poetry. As far as that goes, I can offer a few tips: Learn to recognize and avoid cliches. Some of them you can spot right away (\u201cgentle as a lamb\u201d) but some you won\u2019t spot until you have learned something about the history of poetry (like the idea of the weather somehow reflecting your internal state, i.e., the \u201cpathetic fallacy.\u201d)This is key. Do not bullsh*t. Readers (and young writers have a hard time believing this) really can tell when you are doing it, and they will lose all respect for you if you do. Don\u2019t try to be smart or profound. Don\u2019t try to be \u201cinnovative.\u201d Don\u2019t try to use fancy words to impress people (you CAN use interesting words out of simple joy, or irony. And yet again, readers can tell the difference. How? Because they are really good at that analytical, active reading skill, and because there are actually only a few ways to bullsh*t, and they have seen them all. On the other hand, there are an infinite number of ways to be authentic, if you are brave enough.) Just report your actual thoughts or observations or questions (that last option might be the best of the three), not what you think a smart, profound, creative poet would think or see or ask. Because if you read a lot of poetry, you will see that actual smart, profound creative poets don\u2019t think or see or ask what you expect, i.e., your mental image of a good poet was incorrect. It was actually a cliche.Be brave. Try experiments. Fail often. Fail often so you can learn from your mistakes quickly. And be authentic (i.e., don\u2019t bullsh*t.) That takes courage, no doubt about it. Pro tip: a lot of \u201cinnovations\u201d were not created as a lark. They were created because the writer felt forced to do it, because nothing else was working. And often they not confident in their innovations. Often they are quaking in their boots. If they are confident, it is often (usually?) because they don\u2019t really have anything at risk, which cheapens their poetry.Be honest with yourself. Do you really want to write poetry? Or do you just like the idea of being a poet? (Being honest with yourself is, again, part of being authentic.)Be humble. Learning to write poetry can take many years, and many people never become even moderately good. (Many young people assume they can write poetry because they don\u2019t read or understand poetry. That would be like me assuming I can play pro basketball, even though I don\u2019t watch it and don\u2019t know anything about it.) That's the way it is. (Of course, you can still learn to enjoy reading and writing poetry, the way I might enjoy playing beginner basketball.)[EDIT: adding another tip] Try new techniques. Take those technical devices you have learned to spot in a poem, and try using them. That is how you can begin to internalize these techniques and make them natural to you. It will feel uncomfortable at first, but that is because you are a beginner. It feels that way for everybody at first.Have fun. Writing poetry isn't just about writing GOOD poetry. It should be rewarding for its own sake.",

            "answer_text": "I wrote my first ever poem when I was seven or eight. I showed it to my mum who asked me to go to my teacher at school and show it to her. I was a shy kid. I usually stayed away from any sort of confrontation from any teacher and so I didn't go to her obviously. But while checking my homework, she happened to read it and looked at me with this weird expression on her face and it made me real uncomfortable. Now, it wasn't a brilliant piece of literature or anything, it was a stupid poem about a some random gardener who had visitors over - I don't even remember what it was about, it was that bad, but my teacher found it interesting. She immediately sent me to another teacher who is, and I didn't know this back then, inarguably the best English teacher in our school, if not the entire city. I'm not exaggerating. Teachers like her are rare. This is where things changed for me.  How does somebody write a poem? The same way artists paint, or singers sing, or dancers dance. Anybody can do it, but some of them are simply better at it than the others. I believe this little oomph is added by the presence of a great teacher or a mentor. I found mine when I was eight. She taught me everything I needed to know as a beginner, and she's teaching me even now (turns out my writing style hasn't changed much, and I'm still a noob, even after studying poems for a good fraction of my life). It's relatively easier to write a poem than it is to give out constructive criticism and advice on how to make the piece better without hurting a child's fragile heart. I read my old poems now and wonder how anybody could go through them with a straight face. Yet my teacher did everything to make it better and to encourage me one stanza at a time. It's been almost ten years since I left school and she's still teaching me.  So the answer here is quite simple: find a good teacher. A good teacher is probably the best thing that can happen to anybody. The second option is finding someone whose work you like and to study them. I like Maya Angelou. I love her poems.  The other thing that is important is getting in touch with your own feelings. By feelings, I mean finding your innermost emotions, the ones you usually hide, and bare them all on a piece of paper. Writing a poem about your true face is a great way of keeping it hidden even when it's right in the open. The more you keep your poem ambiguous, the more it is appreciated. Having said that, poetry, like any other art form, stems from creativity. You don't have to follow a set of rules, you don't have to follow a set of pattern, you can even bend the way a word is pronounced (poetic licence, hey yo!) to make it sit well with your rhyme. All you need is a pen, a paper, your heart and imagination. This freedom comes at the cost of you being irreversibly true to yourself. If you can do that, you can write a good poem, too.  Before I leave, I'd like to share a Richard Feynman quote that I recently came across: \"...for poets do not write to be understood.\" ",
