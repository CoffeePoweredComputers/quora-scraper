            "answer_text": "Spend one minute planning, three minutes writing, and one minute revising. Shall we try it? The clock will start at exactly 22:10 CET. Planning: Intro: what is an essay, what are the characteristics of success Body: set out three criteria of success: lucidpersuasiveinterestingConclusion \u2014 wrap up the effective essay 22:11 An essay is a discursive document by a single author, being a continuous argument from beginning to end. Typically, an essay will begin with an introduction, setting out the parameters and aims, go on to the body, and then form a conclusion. More important than the question of how fast, is the question: \u2018what is success?\u2019 This is what I shall proceed to explore. It seems to me that a successful essay has three criteria. First, it must be lucid, which is to say that someone examining it can understand the argument simply by reading, rather than having to piece things together. Second, it must be persuasive. The argument must in itself be compelling. Finally, it must be interesting: an essay which loses the attention of the reader fails in the fundamental requirement of any piece of literature, that it is read. In conclusion, I would argue that planning the essay is the key component in writing a three paragraph essay in just five minutes. It is tempting to jump in and hurry, but this will not produce an argument which is lucid, persuasive, and interesting. 22:14 Reread, correct, improve. 22:15 Done. ",
