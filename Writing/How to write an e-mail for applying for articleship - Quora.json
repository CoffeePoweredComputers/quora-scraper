Also don't send blank mail. Don't use informal salutations like Hi Now few Dos : Address the name of the firm or employer with proper salutation like Dear Sir / Madam. Give a brief introduction about yourself in the mail itself and then say \u201cplease see my resume attached herewith\u201d. If you have clarity about your goal like practice or job or setting up your own business, you can mention about it so that you can get into the right kind of firm for pursuing your goal. You may also mention the areas of work you would like to get trained like taxation and audit and assure him/her that you will put in your best efforts to live up to the standards laid down by ICAI. Conclude your mail with a request to give you an opportunity of learning the practical aspects of the profession under his / her guidance and with a further request to meet him/her personally to present your case. Your mail helps the prospective employer to assess clarity of your thoughts, your ability in written communication and most importantly your commitment. ",
