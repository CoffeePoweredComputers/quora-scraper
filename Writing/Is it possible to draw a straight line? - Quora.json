            "answer_text": "The other answers are all correct... Basically no. But just to add an interesting thought to the discussion. If you modify what you mean by \"draw\" and make it more general. Instead of physically drawing on a piece of paper, think of drawing as the process of tracing out points in space. In a way, that's what you're doing when you pull the pencil across the paper. You're tracing out a series of points on a 2D surface. Now think of something that will trace out points for you. If I throw a ball horizontally it will trace out a series of points that will make a perfect curved line. In the absence of air resistance this line will be a parabolic curve. So how do you get a straight line? If I drop the ball from some height it will fall to the ground, tracing out (drawing) a perfectly straight line. But in actuality, that's not correct. It's not \"perfectly\" straight. It would be straight if the earth was the only massive object in the universe. Due to the mass of other objects near us, mainly the Sun and the Moon, it will experience the gravitation force from these objects and will be pulled in a slightly curved path. This can be dealt with though by generalizing the notion of \"straight\". You're defining straight in terms of Euclidean geometry. But we don't actually live in a Euclidean (flat) space. General Relativity tells us that massive objects curve the space we live in. In a curved space the idea of a straight line is generalized to be simply the shortest distance between two points. This is called the geodesic. For instance the shortest distance from New York to London is a straight line that goes through the mantle of the Earth. But when I travel to London I can't go that way. I follow the shortest path on the curved surface of the Earth - a geodesic. So when I drop the ball it actually does \"draw\" a line that is \"straight\". It's not drawing it in the way you originally stated. And it's not straight in the way you originally meant. But it is tracing out series of points (drawing) following a geodesic curve (a straight line in curved space) towards the center of the Earth. So that's how you could do it. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve actually done this and looked into it before. There\u2019s this great video by Feng Zhu that I found when I did, and if I remember correctly it basically explains Draw From Your Shoulder - Your wrist is good for finder details, but not so much straight smooth lines because it only really has a small range of movement. Your elbow is better, but your shoulder is best (it has less of an arching motion that you have to counteract if you use your elbow). Try practicing not moving your wrist or fingers at all while drawing lines, just your shoulder and your elbow (very little). It\u2019s a bit tiring at first if you\u2019re not used to it. But with practice it\u2019ll become easier and then you can adjust to just using your shoulder depending on how long the line needs to be. Connect the Dots - Try putting down a bunch of dots on your paper, then connecting randomly. Don\u2019t be concerned so much with stopping in the right place at first, just try to hit the dot you\u2019re aiming for. Alternatively you can try drawing two dots close together, master connecting those, then increase the distance more and more. Ghost Your Stroke - Try only using pens to encourage this. By ghosting I mean like visualize the stroke, and hover over the page with the motion until you\u2019re sure it\u2019s right, then put down the line. You don\u2019t want to draw mindlessly (concentrate, practice should be hard and mentally exhausting, even with something as simple as a line). You can see why a pen would encourage this. Rotate Your Paper - Some lines are just really hard to draw in a certain direction so you have to rotate your paper. ",

            "answer_text": "All the other answers are pretty good. However I\u2019ve been trained to do really quick sketching and I have some tips for you. Do straight lines fast. When you try to do a straight line the speed at which your hand moves affects the line. here\u2019s a quick example I\u2019ve made. (This is digital but it works the same in any medium)  Be confident or fake it Drawing in general seems like a very daunting task especially because we can notice how many mistakes we have made on a drawing as soon as we draw the line. the trick is to disregard the line mistakes and think of the drawing as a whole. (drawing by Glenn Keane, Disney animator)  Notice the \u201cdouble lines\u201d and lines floating everywhere, what happens is that he\u2019s trying to find the figure rather than trying to make everything perfect immediately, this probably probably took him 10 mins at most. Know where your line is going. This is more important that it seems. The gist of it is that you need to at least have a rough idea of where the line should go on the paper. As a practice exercise draw 2 points on a piece of paper and quickly draw a line from one to the other. It does not matter if somehow you end up \u201cmissing\u201d the end point, you\u2019ll notice that your line is smoother since you have a goal. Rotate the paper. Depending of your dominant hand You\u2019ll have a certain diagonal position in which your lines will just simply be easier to make, once you have found your comfort position you can always rotate the paper to get the line you want (animators do this all the time.) BUT if all fails, or you\u2019re working on a technical drawing, do use a ruler like it has been pointed in some of the other answers. Cheers! Don\u2019t stop drawing. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Judith Selcuk has the process nailed. Rather than riding a bike I liken it to driving a car... Look where you want to go, because if you show your brain where the destination is, it instinctively controls your body in a determined effort to accomplish your goal. That works well in many situations. By looking at where you're going instead of where you are, you take all the worry out of it. You're also receiving feedback from your brain about where you should be aiming for, instead of information about where you're going wrong in that immediate area. When you're driving, by looking at where you're going you react ahead of time and make minor changes. However, if you only look at the road immediately in front, you have to constantly slow down or pause to re-evaluate the direction and the result is a series of zigzags. The same applies if you want to draw two parallel lines. Draw the first looking at the destination. Then draw the second looking at the first and not at the line you are drawing. If those two parallel lines are relatively close, you can alternatively look at the gap between the two. Your brain will perceive the white \"line\" you are drawing (the gap) and correct your movements to maintain the width of the line. In all cases it has far more to do with generating the right kind of mental feedback than manual dexterity. ",

You can draw a physical line between two points, so a good model for that should allow a mathematical line between two points. They're not the same thing.  A real line will have thickness, it won't be perfectly straight, and it can have gaps.   A mathematical line won't have thickness, it will be perfectly straight, and it won't have gaps.  If you ask that a physical line be as perfect as its mathematical model, you'll be disappointed.  If you ask that a mathematical line exist physically, you'll be disappointed, too.  But, a mathematical line is a pretty good model for a physical line. ",

Place the tip of the pencil on the first mark, and then while looking at the second; aim for it and draw your line to it, quickly lightly and surely, in a stroke. That's it\u2026you get it\u2026 and being an athlete helps..or hanging out in bars playing darts..it is no secret that a straight line is the most direct distance between two points\u2026yeah there are different ways to hold the pencil and different positions to do it from and all that But come on its a line. You should be able to do it standing on yout head. So you will have to figure the rest out for yourself. Oh you don't know how to stand on your head, well that's an entirely different matter..here it's easy, I'll show you.. . ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Drawing smooth straight lines is a combination of technique and skill. When drawing lines I always keep one finger as anchor point on the paper. To draw a line I move my arm, not my hands. By using an anchor point and moving your arm gives you much more control over your lines. But even then, it requires skills to have steady lines. Like a calligraphist you need to practise daily drawing lines. It very much helps to be in a good mood when drawing, calm and relaxed. Any level of stress has an effect on the lines. Usually I need a warming up. My first lines are always very bad. After a few minutes of doodling on a piece of scrap paper my body and hands get more relaxed. Listen to music, think positive ideas, get your heart rate down.  ",

So call your brain into the present, be aware of it and command it to go the way that you want. It is weird how mind becomes bored and enters an almost medatitive state where doing straight lines is easy. I could never do a straight line in a chaotic bubbly mood. So do a lot of them until your mind surrenders. It could take you a few hours but you\u2019ll reach it. Remember it\u2019s all about the mindset. ",

Draw the line keeping your wrist straight and using your elbows to move the pencil. ",

The wrist has a natural tendency to curve our lines so its perfect for curves but when drawing straight lines its the shoulder that will give you the stability you need.Sketch by stroking the page several times, instead of drawing with a single line that we use for writing. That way you can take advantage of the law of averages to find the perfect position of your line.Always look slightly ahead to where you are going.Draw \u2018Ghost lines\u2019 that means sketch above the page in the air first.",

Listen to a song and doodle away.  Something like this, with more variety in the type of lines. When the pencil has become really blunt, sharpen it, and confidently draw a straight line. It'll happen. ",

Some people just use the edge of the sheet of paper and can do well. ",
