            "answer_text": "I personally love the fight between Meruem and Netero\u2026 It lasts for only 2\u20133 episodes, but it\u2019s one of the most intense fight scenes I\u2019ve seen in any anime\u2026 And it was one of those fights where at least one of them wasn\u2019t holding back\u2026 I also like the Episodes where Bisky-san trains Gon and Killua in Green Island arc\u2026 Their training and the result of that training were shown in a way that they didn\u2019t seem like fillers at all\u2026 Others worth mentioning are the ones where Uvo from Phantom Troupe takes on the Beasts of The Mafia\u2026 That was a savage fight!! I absolutely love it! For feels, I would have to say it was Meruem\u2019s final moments\u2026 Meruem was only a few days old, he simply wanted to spend time with Komugi playing games with her because that was the only thing he truly enjoyed\u2026 Watching that final moment was really moving\u2026 Edit: I forgot to mention the Heaven\u2019s arena episodes. The whole arc is just awesome with a lot of fights\u2026 But the best part about that arc is Gon vs Hisoka! This has to be one of the best hand-to-hand fights I\u2019ve seen. ",

            "answer_text": "Hunter x Hunter (2011) hooks you from Episode 3 due to Hisoka's masterful introduction:  His characteristic music, his performance, his strange ability and personality intrigued me immediately, before this I thought this would be a typical Shonen, but Hisoka felt original and wanted to see what was going on, little by little I was seeing details that made me understand that this is a Shonen, but not typical. Just listen to this:  This musical theme expresses mystery, spontaneity, surprise, magic and in combination with Hisoka's language, appearance and personality make you want to know how this character will alter things and if there will be other characters like him. Best of all, it's true. There will be tension in the plot for our protagonists once this character appears together with two others who will reveal certain things later. All this gives you a sense of satisfaction that makes certain things very fluid. I hope I helped you \ud83d\ude09 ",
