            "answer_text": "OK. Here is the sentence and the related question under consideration (what I see when I click on the link): The sight of the little Breton peasant who did her humble housework aroused in her despairing regrets and ________ dreams.(distract) Distracted or Distracting? Which one should I choose? I think the problem is I don\u2019t know whether the \u201cand\u201d connects (a) verb + verb or (b) noun + noun. \u201cDistracted dreams\u201d is a phrase that uses a certain type of netaphor, one that nominally turns something non-living into a living being. Specifically, here, the word \u201cdreams\u201d becomes a person, and even more specifically, a distracted person. We see a similar type of use of metaphor in the common phrase \u201cuntil Death do us part\u201d where Death is seen as a person, not as a process, and thus parts the husband from the wife, by more or less stepping between them. Even if this were not the case, clearly, in this particular sentence, \u201cdistracting\u201d is the correct choice because of the rule of parallelism. Given that the first part says \u201cdespairing regrets\u201d, the second part must say, \u201cdistracting thoughts\u201d so that both, \u201cdespair\u201d and \u201cdespair\u201d end in -ing. The overall tone and style of this sentence (the one in bold) is awful and disgusting, though, and I can\u2019t imagine that anyone sensible would talk or write in this way, unless he or she were completely drunk while slowly going insane, on a particularly bad day for both (getting drunk and going insane). Anyway, to determine what, exactly, and (or any other conjunction) connects to what, you need to read that specific sentence, very carefully. There is no rule or formula. For example, the and in \u201csalt and pepper\u201d is a different kind of and than the one in \u201csalt and oil.\u201d The salt and pepper thing is a complete phrase. Salt and pepper kind of go together. They\u2019re an item, a couple, a married couple, really, not boyfriend and girlfriend. Salt and oil are just total strangers. They\u2019re just completely random people thrown together by circumstances. On the other hand, \u201cbread and salt\u201d, both being basic necessities, go together but like boyfriend and girlfriend. They date when they want to and generally like each other but could also easily live without each other. They\u2019re much more than just friends. They may or not be lovers. They\u2019re certainly not a genuine couple. In each of these cases, the word and is just connecting together individual words. But each use is a very specialised use. You really need to read the specifics of the situation (the entire sentence as well as the overall context within which you are reading that sentence), to gauge proper usage. ",
