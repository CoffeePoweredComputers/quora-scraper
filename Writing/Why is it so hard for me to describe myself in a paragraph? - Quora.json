            "answer_text": "The question was - Why is it so hard for me to describe myself in a paragraph? There are two reasons. First, you know yourself really well and want to do a full description. It\u2019s hard to cut out some things that might be objectively less important because \u2018you\u2019re not objective.\u2019 The second reason is the human condition - we (and you) don\u2019t want to be wrong. What you write will have errors or not be perfect. It\u2019s hard to do that. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Because you are over-thinking it. Make a list of relevant things about yourself in relation to whatever the bio is for, then condense them into short, easy-to-read sentences. Cut out any adverbs (change the verb if you need to, to make it stronger), and then go. \u201cI\u2019m only 21. I really have no routine,\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. And being negative about who you are, and what you are trying to accomplish makes me wonder why you are making a bio in the first place. Figure out the purpose of the bio, and you should be able to list things about yourself that are relevant. Think of it as a miniature resume. ",
