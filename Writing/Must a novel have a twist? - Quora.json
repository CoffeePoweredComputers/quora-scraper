            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. It doesn\u2019t have to. Specially not at the ending. I have been disappointed about books before because of their overwhelming and unrealistic \u2018twists\u2019. While a well defined plot twist can increase interest in the narrative, it can also create the complete opposite effect. Proceed at your own risk. It\u2019s known that new writers tend to think it\u2019s cool to \u2018trick\u2019 the reader, writing a whole story only to reveal something completely different in the end of the book. It\u2019s called the trick ending. Is it a twist? Definitely? Is it good? Not always. Actually tropes, and even cliches, sometimes, are what are good (if used in the right way). They provide us some kind of way to relate to situations and characters, as human beings. There has to be some kind of balance between predictability and surprise. So what does an ending need to provide? In a word: Answers. The ending has to answer the questions in the plot, which is the reason why the reader turns every page\u2026until the very end. It is a sort of closure somehow. It\u2019s the moment when everything makes sense. Not the moment when everything stops making sense - that will actually leave most readers frustrated. ",

I better read on and see how this turns out!\u201d Otherwise, if you stick to tried-and-true tropes, you\u2019re likely to get readers who will quit your book in mid-stream because they will say, \u201cThese reads like Story X, Story Y, or Story Z. Been there, done that, got my t-shirt. Next book\u2026\u201d However, if you have compelling and interesting characters and a well-defined plot, you could get away with a book or ending that doesn\u2019t have a twist. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not always. At least not the \"surprise\" twist you're describing, although this is the most exciting one, obviously. Plot twists are actually extremely common, but the method(s) of revelation can differ based on the story or genre or whatever the author is comfortable with. For example, misdirection is often used to facilitate plot twists, but it isn't the same thing, and I think some people do get them confused. Misdirection can be employed in several ways, but especially if a story is written from a perspective that's limited to a single person for the duration, misdirection is an adequate method because the audience only knows what that character experiences, which forces a limitation on the information being shared. Thus you have a mimic of the real world, because not only are other characters possibly misleading the audience for their own gain, but the main character's own ignorance and assumptions are throwing a wrench in the works. Also, misdirection can be used solely on a character rather than the audience. When done properly, this creates suspense, as the audience wonders how the character will respond, and if their prediction of the response is accurate. In all cases the author has to be careful to keep things straight, though. ",

            "answer_text": "Your story must have tension, but the twist is not necessary. Tension drives the reader forward, keeps him/her engaged. You can see an interesting example by watching Leaving Las Vegas or reading John O\u2019Brien\u2019s novel (same title)\u2026At the beginning of the story, the main character tells the audience he\u2019s going to drink himself to death\u2026the rest of the story is an unfolding. Ask yourself the question as you watch or read\u2026what is keeping me engaged? Certainly, there are small twists here and there, but in the end, the story is straight-forward and disturbing, as it was meant to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on the genre. If it\u2019s sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, or action, it should have at least one twist. If it\u2019s a more dramatic story, not as important. But, there are great books from all genres without twists. If an author nails everything else but there\u2019s no twist, it\u2019s still gonna be a great book. And of course there are plenty of bad books with twists. Also, the big twists generally aren\u2019t at the ending. They\u2019re usually anywhere from halfway to 3/4 through the book. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of book being written. I prefer historical novels so the story is already happened. There might be a twist or event that shaped the outcome, but the author can not make believe things happened there that did not. My wife loves detective and horror novels. They usually have a plot twist to advance the story of surprise you in the end.Sci-fi and fantasy novels usually throw something like a twist to heighten the tension of the story and hold your attention.

            "answer_text": "Yes necessarily speaking,We generally see the twist in books at ending as it will give the readers a very good feel that the book is good as thus advising others to read it. But in books having no twist, but we often found them not competing to read again as we will not get a second frame of reference.Like,knowing someone\u2019s character is actually different than the expected will allow us to go through all the story once again to find how it happened and any bugs the character left out. But it is also dependent on the taste of the writer and the zone where he aims to meet the audience.So,we can also expect a book with no twist in finish but i think it should rather have a smoky start with compelling storyline.
