            "answer_text": "The term \u201cstyle\u201d is thrown around a lot by writers, but it\u2019s a misnomer for copywriters because \u201cstyle\u201d doesn\u2019t work in the extremely short attention economy of the internet. Good copy isn\u2019t necessarily \u201cstylish.\u201d But copy that establishes trust, authority, builds relationships, and gets people talking, sharing, and buying is in high demand. A lack of style is what makes it work, so writers who master this \u201cstyle\u201d are sought after and revered. Legendary ad man David Ogilvy was one of those writers, and he said, \u201cA good advertisement is one which sells the product without drawing attention to itself.\u201d It sounds counterintuitive, but it holds up under pressure, and I\u2019ll explain why great content marketing is built on that exact premise. Clear communication is the key to effective copy Your best copy needs to be \u201cdisplay window clear,\u201d and you need to be out there every morning with your Windex, to make sure it doesn\u2019t distract from the product or service you provide for your clients and customers. Every writer eventually reaches for a style guide to help them craft clear copy, and there are countless helpful rulebooks and list posts that offer writers advice about proper usage and consistent language. Copyblogger actually has its own internal style guide, and members of the editorial crew often squabble about usage over (virtual) martinis. I am also a big fan of the classic English guidebook, The Elements of Style by Strunk & White. The aged copy I keep handy is dog-eared and yellowing. In it, William Strunk advises writers, A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. This is very solid advice for online publishers A copywriter comes to the rescue It was actually famed writer E. B. White who updated professor Strunk\u2019s \u201clittle\u201d 43 page English He revived it from scholastic obscurity to become what Time magazine has called \u201cone of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.\u201d E. B. White was more than a revered journalist (contributor to the New Yorker for 60 years), and award-winning children\u2019s author (Charlotte\u2019s Web). He honed his writing style as a copywriter in the 1920s, and contributed what he learned to The Elements of Style re-issue in chapter V, \u201cAn Approach to Style.\u201d It\u2019s no secret why this revered text is so short, and so effective. Mr. White edited the style guide with some reluctance, and was quoted years later as saying, My role in the revival of Strunk\u2019s book was a fluke \u2014 just something I took on because I was not doing anything else at the time. It cost me a year out of my life, so little did I know about grammar. Make every word tell White\u2019s lack of grammatical knowledge did not prevent the guide from becoming a bestseller for the better part of the last 50 years. In interviews, White wanted to remind writers that rules are meant to be broken, and that every writer has their own unique point of view and voice. Style results more from what a person is than from what he knows. In other words, every writer can memorize rules, but how you get people\u2019s attention requires some creativity. Don\u2019t get too hung up on the rules, or your copy might end up sucking, and that would break the first rule of Copyblogger. In honor of E. B. White I have updated Dean Rieck\u2019s post The Ultimate Blogger Writing Guide. This list is only a sampling of the vast amount of knowledge available to online publishers and content marketers, but they are a few things that have helped me most along the way. What I present to you is an annotated guide to effective online copywriting \u201cstyle\u201d \u2026 1. Headline Writing 101 Every writer who wants to make an impact online must take this clinic. There is only one reason your client or prospect will read a single word of the copy you\u2019ve written: your headline. This is where you should spend 70% of your time.

            "answer_text": "It really depends on the industry. When I wrote copy for the alternative health industry, I was usually selling a supplement. I determined what to write by doing a boatload of research on the ingredients and on the conditions they help. Plus, I had to be intimately acquainted with the worries, needs, and desires of my target market, so that I could paint a compelling picture of how this supplement was the best way to solve their problems or achieve their dreams. It\u2019s different in the financial publishing industry. There, a promotion starts with a Big Idea. The copywriter has to write up a copy platform describing the idea and making a strong case for why it could be a successful promotion. This involves a lot of research as well. You have to have a fascinating story to tell. And you must prove that it\u2019s something that can make investors money. Plus, you need to come up with some stocks with a large enough market cap that are on a upward trajectory. It\u2019s a tall order. But if the copy platform is approved, you have the basic outline you need to write the promotion. ",
