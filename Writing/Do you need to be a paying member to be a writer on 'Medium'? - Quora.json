For that matter, you don\u2019t need to be a paying member to \u201cearn money\u201d for your writing either. There are two things that you can do, and one has nothing to do with the other. You can become a member for $5 a month (or $50 a year) that allows you to read unlimited stories on Medium. Without that, you are limited to reading only three stories a month.You can join the Medium Partner Program (MPP), that allows you to potentially earn revenue based on reader engagement. There is no cost for joining the MPP.As I said these two things have nothing to do with the other. You can do one or the other, or both. You can also do neither. But if you don\u2019t join the MPP then you will not earn revenue from your articles. So, that\u2019s kind of a no-brainer since there\u2019s no cost for it. ",
