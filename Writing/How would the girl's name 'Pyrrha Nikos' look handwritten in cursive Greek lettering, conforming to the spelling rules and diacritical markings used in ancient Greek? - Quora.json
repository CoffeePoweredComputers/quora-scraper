            "answer_text": "\u039donononono. Pyrrha Nikos means nothing. Actually Nikos is the male name for Nick (Nicholas). Pyrrhios Nike is the female form but it is still NOT something you want to name a child. You see, it comes from Pyrrhic victory - Wikipedia : a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat So you wouldn\u2019t want it written\u2026 anywhere especially with regards to a little child! If you\u2019re still interested in how it would look copy and paste: \u03a0\u03cd\u03c1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 into a word document and select a cursive font, e.g. Monotype Corsiva or Mistral  You should also note that these are Old Greek, not Ancient Greek. In ancient times it would be displayed as \u03a0\u03a5\u03a1\u03a1\u0395\u0399\u039f\u03a3\u039d\u0399\u039a\u0397 If you meant something else, please elaborate. ",
