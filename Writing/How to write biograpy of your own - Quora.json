            "answer_text": "An autobiography is nothing but a happy retelling of events in the autobiographer\u2019s past,where almost always, the autobiographer will find a silver lining in every regretful cloud that faced him. Trump would, for instance, swear that his parents named him \u201cDonald\u201d after King Donald III of Scotland, but we all know that Trump\u2019s parents named him Donald after Donald Duck, the funniest duck alive next to Howard. And that\u2019s how you write an autobiography. ",

            "answer_text": "Knowing the character\u2019s background is easier if it is the author\u2019s. Otherwise it is going to take some study to find life, chronology, society, and history. Memories tend to be subjective and narrative like personal correspondence. Autobiography is nonfiction, while a protagonist could be fictional characterization including the meaning of events, places, or themes as memories. In any case they tend toward name dropping and half the index is acquaintances. Read in the genre to see how other writers have sorted it out. Those often show up around elections to defend their past and throw the hat into some ring of issues with an eye toward the future. Each decade has its own twists and bubbles. Contradictions may seem less knotted in retrospect, but positions may also have sailed off a cliff so it invites constructive interpretation. Write the scenes and try to figure out the plot in time.
