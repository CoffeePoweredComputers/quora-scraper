            "answer_text": "In writer discussions I have heard other authors say you would need permission from the estate of any real person or current owner of any real property/location mentioned in the work. It may depend on how far back in time your story occurs. I have written historical fiction that involves real people as secondary characters or by mention and have not asked permission. In one case, the person (my antagonist) lived around the time of Louis the IX\u2019s first Crusade, so it is unlikely that there is a living person to object or seek any sort of compensation. In the second case, I mentioned persons involved in the battles for Texas independence. I spoke of them respectfully and truthfully and therefore there should be no cause for complaint. My use of these was merely a restatement of what is already available in public records so no permission was necessary. ",

Even then, the more famous a person is, the less you need permission \u2014 under U.S. law \u201cpublic figures\u201d do not have the same right to privacy that ordinary folks do. What this means is that you can include Bill Clinton as a character without permission, but not your own college roommate. However, if you tell vicious lies about someone, even a public figure can sue you for defamation. ",
