But make sure you don\u2019t tell (name of girl you like here) that I like her, because that would be really, really embarrassing and I\u2019m not even sure if she likes me back. I\u2019d really like to go out with her, but I don\u2019t know how to approach her and ask her out, so I wrote this letter instead. I don\u2019t really know why it\u2019s written in the third person but whatever. So yeah. Sincerely, (your name here). Then you say \u201chey, someone gave me this letter for you\u201d or something like that, and give her the letter. ",
