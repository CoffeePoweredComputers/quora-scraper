            "answer_text": "I had been using the Google Calendar since last 2 years after having trial and errors with few other 3rd party apps promising deliverables of sync, backup, desktop collaboration and just like that. A calendar, plus an organizer with a to-do list, everything compiles in this app from G.Suite. I had this trouble once of mistakenly deleting events which got sorted with the feature trash encompassed in later updates of the app. All was good until today when erroneously on my repeating event, the click went on to \u201cAll Events\u201d which ideally should have been on \u201cThis Event\u201d only. (Attached screenshot).  And lo! Boasting of big reliance, data sync, and tons of whole lot of features, this thing just ruined it. In a kind of Thanos snap'. All my journal entries, memoirs and everyday thinking just whooosh. Duplicated into the entry of today, and copy-pasted retrospective, and forward events too. Damn!!! Foolish coders out there. . . Can't just have an undo edit option??? The calendar app version while I write on my Android 9 now is . . .  The fact of surprise, though these people have the undo-edits feature on their notes app, Google Keep, they are lazy enough to can't incorporate in their calendar app. The undo-edits in Google Keep:  Hope any update in due time lets me recover the lost data of 2 years. . . If not, this app sucks! Try other 3rd party apps out there. They maybe intruding your data, but are good than this big data fool giant Google! ",

Many people have some enterprise calendar server and a private google calendar (or other scenarios, with two jobs/responsibilities, only one of them running google calendar).I would be nice to be able to embed a 'common events calendar' or something alike into google sites (or somewhere else). Of course you can easily embed a read-only calendar now. But collaborative editing a common-events calendar (e.g. events of interest to all members of an goolge-app installation) is quite a pain, because peole click on the widget, their own calendar opens, than they have to manually add this other calendar and if they create a new event, they have to choose the right calendar. We are running google-apps and people do only use the common calendar, they do not use their own calendar.",

Say you get an invite to you@yourdomain.com that forwards to you@gmail.com, before April this year if you accepted that invite, all would be done. Now, google calendar rejects the invite forcing you to use your gmail address. Frustrating when you use gmail to consolidate email from other addresses! Google do propose a clunky work around setting up another calendar is the alternate name, but it is awkward to say the least.

How this is being used: We have a master calendar for all the rooms (resources) that are in use. We created a user with the email rooms@domain.com to hold this as their default calendar. In order for the event to be populated on this master calendar, the creator of the event must invite rooms@domain.com We did this as a way of holding all the resource calendars in one place. The problem with this solution is that people forget to put rooms@domain.com as a guest every time they check out a room. This may be a convoluted workaround in itself. Ultimately, it would be nice to have a way to better track who is using what resources at any given time. ",
