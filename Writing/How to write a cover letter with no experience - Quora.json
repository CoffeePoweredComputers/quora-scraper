            "answer_text": "Of course you have experience\u2014but maybe not in the job market. Your challenge is to review your life history to identify your strong points as a person and potential employee. And, to thoroughly review the qualifications of the job you want and find matching points. Explore, for example: Are you strong in technology? Do you write well and communicate well in person? Have you done any projects or internships or volunteer work that testify to your abilities? Have you pursued any serious interests, not only that might relate to the job, but demonstrate your initiative and commitment? Did you choose difficult courses in school? Pay for your own education? Also think through ways to back up your claims: any kind of recognition you\u2019ve received, a testimonial from a teacher, a thank you from the organization you did volunteer work for perhaps praising your personality and enthusiasm. Take time to build the best possible case for yourself. Once you believe in it, you will be ready to write a good cover letter (and resume). If you can answer the inevitable question, \u201cwhy should I hire you for this position?\u201d you\u2019re equipped to convince other people. ",

            "answer_text": "It is all about how you match the job criteria. Let me give you some examples. Ability to handle physically strenuous work I go to the gym regularly with a focus on cardio but also do a little light lifting. I enjoy hiking, which has helped build my endurance. Customer service skills As part of my course, we learnt customer service skills including positive language, handling complaints and so on. While I haven\u2019t worked in customer service, I sometimes help out at my local church collecting old clothes for charity. In this situation I need to talk to people in a friendly and positive manner and answer their questions about what the money will be used for. And so it goes on. Most people have a lot that they can bring to a role and yes, you are competing against other people with experience, but like many others, I prefer to choose people who have the ability over the experience.
