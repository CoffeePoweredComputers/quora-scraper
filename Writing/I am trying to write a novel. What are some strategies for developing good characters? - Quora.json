            "answer_text": "It is very important that the reader falls in love with your hero/heroine.  A reader must worry and care what happens to them.  Without that, your story will be flat.  All good books are character driven.  You can have the best, most wonderful story in the world, but if the reader doesn't care if your hero dies or not, they won't read the book. The hero drives the story. (And I use the word hero, but it could be a man or a woman.) He has to have a visible goal, which is his outer motivation for what he does, and an inner goal, which is something in his past that is holding him back. The inner turmoil could be a longing or need, a deeply held desire that he is afraid to go after; or an old wound from the past that your hero suppressed but is still affecting his life; or a strong belief such as \u2018if I love I will be hurt\u2019; or a fear of experiencing the pain he has felt before. You must have him conquer this inner torment by the end.  The hero has to grow in order for you to reach a satisfying ending to your outer story. Let's say our hero was hired to blow up a building.  In this version we don't know anything about him, his background, why he even took this type of job.  We don't like him very much. If he sets the bomb and completes the job, that's not a very interesting read.  But what if he falls in love with the lady who works in the coffee shop on the first floor, and finds out there's a day care center on the 10th floor with 42 little kids in it?  Now, he's conflicted. He saw kids being hurt in the war and he wants no part of this. He tries to back out, but the bad guys are pushing him to complete the job or else they're going to hurt his own daughter.  Now we have a good story going -- and the reader's attention.  There are five ways to initially draw your reader to the hero. Chose two to work with and be sure to include them in the first few pages of your book. Hook the reader right away.  1) Create sympathy, make him the victim of something or some undeserved misfortune.  2) Put him in jeopardy, make us worry about him.  3) Make him likable or liked by others.  4) Make him funny.  5) Make him powerful in some good way.  In order to create a memorable character you, as the writer, must know him inside and out.  Know what makes him tick, what makes him mad, what makes him act out.  Then you will know how he will react when you put him in danger, or threaten to ruin his business, or have his lovers leave him. Create a background story for him. There are lots of character check lists you can find on the Internet, but don't spend too much time on it.  His favorite color is probably not all that important to the story. Focus on the items on the list that carved out his personality and/or made him the man he is today. Think out your characters.  Did they have a crappy childhood?  Were they rich?  Poor? Mom was a drunk?  Dad was in jail?  Did they have a privileged life?  Were they in the military and saw despicable behavior?  Did they take part in it?  All these things will shape who they are and how they deal with the situations you're going to put them into, and how they will react to others, especially the love interest.   Make them interesting and not clich\u00e9d.  They can be tough but remember we have to like them, so don't make them too cold. Give them a soft side.  A hero always does the right thing, even if his behavior is not always perfect.  Make sure your character cares passionately about what is happening.  Give him emotions.  If he doesn't care, why should the reader?  Also give him a flaw.  Nobody is perfect and we hate reading about perfect people.  We want to relate to the character; we want to become them. And we want him to solve his problem.  Just a quick note on naming your characters.  Don't use a name so difficult the reader can\u2019t pronounce it.  Don't have a John and a Jake and a Jerry.  Too confusing.  Use names that fit the personality and the time you are writing in. For example very few young girls are named Gertrude today but that was a popular name in the 20s.

            "answer_text": "Make them either normal and empathizable or not empathizable but not villainous, or be abnormal and either empathizable or hateable.  That's kind of:  normal, hero, or villain, for short.  You can have bad heroes who are villains, as long as they have admirable qualities.  Then pick some inter-consistent traits for them. That is, a set of traits that are recognizable, and which do not terribly conflict with each other. Also, no  one is perfect, so it's okay for them to have some failings. In fact, they better have failings or else they will be too perfect and seen as not human.  For normals or heroes, they are basically decent good people but they have a couple of flaws that hamper them. For example a doctor who is a healer but he has a sharp temper. Or a parent who is basically good but a little slow on the uptake so they fail to understand some things as they should.  For villainous types, they often have exceptional abilities or qualities, but offset by bad deep failings. This advice is just a bag of small rules and there are far more ways to develop a character. There are many books on how to do this. However, a story turns on the goals and needs of its main characters. The collisions of these needs with blocks provide the necessary conflicts vital to an interesting story. So when you develop a character, it must support the needs you assign to the character and then help make their actions and reactions be both interesting and naturally fit the character. Scrooge McDuck loves money and it shapes all his actions and thoughts. Moby Dick's captain's whole life is shaped by the revenge need in his character. Hamlet ... ah. well, Hamlet. He's not a one-note character. Some other things. A non-minor character should probably either interest you (novelty), be admirable, amuse you, or at worst, only have a role in moving the plot forward. Often a character is someone against whom you can compare your viewpoints on life, and what the character does furnishes you with stimulus to consider some belief or value. Thus the right characters give the audience some actual value because they help you find things to reconsider, ",
