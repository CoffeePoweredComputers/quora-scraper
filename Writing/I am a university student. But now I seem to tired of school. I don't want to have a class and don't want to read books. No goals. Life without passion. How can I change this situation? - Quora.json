            "answer_text": "The problem with school is it teaches you about a lot of stuff, which you may or may not find interesting or relevant to what you want to do with your life. I will say that having a degree at least automatically puts you in a better position to earn more during your life, but it is no guarantee - and it isn\u2019t as important as it used to be. Now, thanks to Google and YouTube, you can pretty much begin learning about just about anything. I say \u201cbegin\u201d because there is no substitute for talking to real people doing real things that you find interesting. What is interesting to you? There\u2019s a way to find out. Sit down with paper or at your computer and write down everything that you\u2019ve ever done that you found satisfying. Where, after it was done, you thought, \u201cThat was good. I feel good about that.\u201d Don\u2019t write down things that your parents or friends thought were impressive; only write down the things that made you feel better about yourself as a human being. Then, walk away from the list. 24 hours later, come back to it, and ask yourself this question: \u201cWhat is the bigger picture here? What is this telling me?\u201d In my case, it was the realization that I loved helping others achieve their dreams. At first, and at that time in my life (I was still in college, but also working), I thought that meant something like social work. But over the years, I was drawn more and more to business. I was a headhunter for a while, where my boss allowed me to help people find the perfect job. I got involved in sales and marketing, and started helping CEOs and entrepreneurs be successful. I ended up spending many years as a \u201crevenue coach,\u201d and now own a company where I provide those services plus digital marketing. The goal has remained the same: to help our business owner clients realize their own dreams. It is very satisfying work. Who knows what your list will hold for you. There is something for you, out there, and the seeds of it have already been sown by your own life experiences. Whatever you decide to do, it has to be related to what gives you the most joy. Work is hard, even if you love what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ll only be really good at it if you do love what you\u2019re doing. You will come up with ideas and approaches that no one else has, simply because you are following your own personal passion. Energy and fascination follow as a natural result of figuring out what already interests you, and then, simply, pursuing it. Opportunities will present themselves as you start to go down this road; it\u2019s as if the universe rewards you for doing what you were meant to do. Good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on why you feel this way.  If you are depressed then you should speak to a counselor (generally they are free at universities for a certain amount of visits).   If you just don't find a reason to go to school, then you should reflect on why you went to school in the first place, what you care about and what you would like to accomplish in the future. If you are lost then you may want to speak to a college adviser to see what avenues you can take to either temporarily leave (such as a leave of absence) or if there are other opportunities that can revalize you. I hope this helps,Dr. Michael Kurland ",
