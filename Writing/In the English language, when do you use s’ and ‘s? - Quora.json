            "answer_text": "This seems to get just about everyone on social media pages these days. I\u2019ve written about it before, but can never find any of my answers on Quora\u2026 Perhaps some examples rather than quote grammar, which I can\u2019t do anyway\u2026 The sentence \u201cWe are going to the Smith\u2019s house tonight for tea\u201d has the apostrophe \u2018s\u2019 because their name is Smith and the apostrophe \u2018s\u2019 denotes ownership - in this case their house. However \u201cWe are going to the Roberts\u2019 house tonight for tea\u201d has the apostrophe after the \u2018s\u2019 because their name already includes an \u2018s\u2019. The apostrophe at the end in effect means \u201cWe are going to the Roberts\u2019s house tonight for tea\u201d, though that\u2019s a bit clunky, even though some people would pronounce the double \u2018s\u2019 in this case as it\u2019s someone\u2019s name. It is also relevant when we are talking about plurals. \u201cThe horse\u2019s tail is twitching\u201d means there is only one horse - and one tail of course. \u201cThe horses\u2019 tails are twitching\u201d however shows that there are more than one horse - and tails - so in this case one wouldn\u2019t pronounce it as horses\u2019s! If the horses in the last example only had one stall between them, then it would be \u201cThe horses\u2019 stall needs painting\u201d, whereas if they all had their own, then it would be \u201cThe horses\u2019 stalls need painting\u201d You see evidence of the \u201cGrocer\u2019s apostrophe\u201d in many shops and supermarkets in the UK, as it seems grocers are not the best users of English grammar. Examples such as \u201cTry our fresh carrot\u2019s today!\u201d should have customers asking \u201cYour fresh carrot\u2019s what?\u201d, but as most of the population (evidenced by the likes of FaceBook) cannot manage the appropriate grammar anyway, it\u2019s unlikely that the customers would notice. There are others which also use inverted commas incorrectly, such as \u201cTry our \u201cfresh\u201d carrot\u2019s today!\u201d which is even worse, and should have the customers wondering why the carrots are not actually fresh? Correct pronunciation can change completely the sense of a sentence - 40 Ridiculously Cringeworthy Mistakes That Prove Punctuation and Proofreading Matter - shows how things can go astray\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a very simple rule, with only rare exceptions. \u2018s is the singular possessive, even if the singular ends in s. s\u2019 is the plural possessive, unless it\u2019s a plural that doesn\u2019t end in s, like children (children\u2019s). The exception occurs in ancient classical or biblical figures\u2019 names that end in s or es and are multisyllabic, such as Jesus (Jesus\u2019), Moses (Moses\u2019), Xerxes (Xerxes\u2019), Socrates (Socrates\u2019), Amos (Amos\u2019),and Euripides (Eurpides\u2019). But not Zeus (Zeus\u2019s), because it is one syllable. And not Charles (Charles\u2019s), because it is not an ancient classical or biblical figure\u2019s name. That means if a surname ends in s, you still add \u2018s to it, such the Roberts family. \u201cI\u2019m going to the Roberts\u2019s house.\u201d Also, if the last letter is silent, such as Descartes (pronounced day-cart), you still add \u2018s, Descartes\u2019s (pronounced day-carts).
