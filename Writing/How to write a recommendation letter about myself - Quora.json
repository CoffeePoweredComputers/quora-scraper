            "answer_text": "This is a puzzling question to me. I am not sure why you would write a recommendation letter for yourself. Certainly, your resume should cast you in the best light possible (and still be an honest appraisal of your accomplishments). Your cover letter to any prospective employer should define how your experience and vision meet the qualifications for the position you are looking for. Having said that, I have coached a few people to write a pro forma letter of recommendation for when you need a friend to write one for you. Have an outline that talks about the position you are applying to and how your experience with your friend (or associate) intersected. This would help your friend with any writer\u2019s block and perhaps get the letter to the employer sooner. ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, a person does not write their own recommendation letter. On occasion, a teacher, professor or supervisor will ask a someone to prepare an outline of accomplishments or assignments you\u2019ve successfully completed. They do that to save themselves the effort of looking up all your work. This does not mean this is the final letter. It is then edited by the teacher to incorporate their assessment of your abilities. So if someone has asked you to do this, regarding your own work, then just make a list of your projects or assigments or papers, whatever you feel represents your best efforts and provide that for further editing.
