            "answer_text": "Good question. It was one I had before. Why on earth should I read the plays and books of Shakespeare when there are others better than him? Much ado about nothing (taken from a play of the same name) All that glitters is not gold (The Merchant of Venice) All's well that ends well ( taken from a play of the same name) You might have noticed that these phrases are an integral part of English Language today. These phrases do not even skim the surface of the contributions made by Shakespeare to modern English Language. If you do a brief google search, you will get to know that writers before Shakespeare are less know to common people. And why is that? One reason is that during 1500\u2019s, before Shakespeare, plays were usually meant for elitists and people of the church. Plays were on themes from Bible and were usually not shown to masses, nor meant for them. Then came Shakespeare. He was not from an acclaimed language school nor was he born wealthy. However his word play was exquisite and so was the way in which he portrayed human emotions, desires and conflicts . Plays such as Othello are remade every other day because of its universality. So the next time you use phrase like \u2018it\u2019s high time (The Comedy of Errors) or \u2018love is blind\u2019 (The Merchant of Venice), remember that you just used something a man wrote centuries ago, which still lives on. P.S. - However there are other writers who are equally influential like Bernard Shaw or Rabindranath Tagore from India. Do learn more about them. Thanks for A2A Prashant Raj ",

            "answer_text": "We do study Shakespeare along with other writers. Was the first story that you heard was a plot from Shakespeare's play? I don't think so. Did your text book only had chapters from works of Shakespeare? Well, the answer would still be no. Now, it may occur that \u201cShakespeare\u201d however have been a writer who have been engaging us from time to time. We study his work because it has stood the test of time. His plays still have the essence to attract us. He was not only an enigma of his time but even today. There is just so much in his works that till date researches are being carried on. But he is not the \u201conly\u201dwriter about whom we study, infact, his contemporary Marlowe is equally intriguing. Therefore it can be concluded that the question itself is not very appropriate.
