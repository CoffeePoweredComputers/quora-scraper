            "answer_text": "It spoke for you more meaning than the reader is able to retrieve from your words; this means you are ready to edit. Can you answer who, what, where, when, why? Look at the form of the poem, it starts almost regular, long line, two short lines, long line, one short line\u2014what can you add that will make the form regular? One aspect that is good is it conveys a sense of you in the poem, how you feel,chat you hear, can you add something that says why? Many of your words are words that you can't hear, feel, touch, taste or see; they're idealistic rather than concrete. Words such as outdtanding, love, purity, truth, unique, experience, need to either be replaced or related to something concrete, like a phone call, softness of a cheek, shut door. Can you change words to use softer s sounds, or add a contrast that connects to a lie? Play, add meaning, select words, delete words. If it's an important poem to you, make it come as alive to others as it is to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Your poem is good for a beginner .You should read . It tried to be somewhere along the lines of Edgar Allen Poe and Pablo Neruda.But it feels a bit groundless and all over the place. What I mean to say is that it's easy to come up with random strings of words that sound lyrical and beautiful, but to unify such lines to convey something meaningful is really hard, and somehow the actual purpose too.You should work on that, so that your lines complement each other. Also try to be as grammatically correct as you can ,because even though poets enjoy certain liberties there are some lines that shouldn't be crossed. I also feel that the first part and the second part of the poem sound like two different things merged together. It could also be that I am not imaginative enough to comprehend the link. ",
