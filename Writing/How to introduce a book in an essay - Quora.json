            "answer_text": "If you want to introduce a book, whether in a talk or in a piece of writing or even engage in a discussion, it goes without saying that you must know about the book. a book narrates or describes some events under many settings, but the writer will consider 2 or a maximum of 3 settings. the writer will drive home the point the purpose, reasons, conclusions or results. So, when you introduce the book you must organize your narratives that prove what you are wanting to say or defend, its repercussions and weave it to the major narrative. The book adds to your narrative in terms of purposes, outcomes, pinning certain facts or points in a historic settings, history here is a limited purpose and within the scope of your output or deliberation. It can also be used, as to refute certain narratives or conclusions advanced by others. however, it presents you as a serious person, knowledgeable, good debater and of course well read. i hope you get the drift of my understanding applied to your question.

            "answer_text": "Simply compare the intention for the audience to the types of essays. The thesis may be about what makes that book unique. Take notes about the book and then draw a conclusion from them. Several kinds of content address books specifically. A book report may indicate how it affected the reader\u2019s emotions and if they liked it. Or it may compare the title to others that the writer has read. The jacket blurb is a very brief synopsis. Analyze the content or style in the context of the genre. Write a summary, review, or critique. Quotation references include the title, author, date, and possibly page numbers. Get to the point about what motivates wider readership. The author themselves often present the first chapter or about fifty pages as a preview. ",
