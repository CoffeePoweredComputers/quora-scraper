            "answer_text": "What makes for an interesting answer on Quora? Generally for a really interesting answer, One must have a very good question to give an interesting answer to. Unfortunately, Quora seems to be going for a Quantity over Quality kick and there are a flood of generic, rather pointless and useless question being fostered onto the site. it is bad enough that trolls and idiots tend to ask these self-same inane questions, we got Quora content Bots doing the same damned thing. However\u2026 given a finding of a genuinely interesting question, an Interesting answer is one that would on most other types of social media get glossed over with a Tl;Dr tag. The answer will be thoughtful, in depths, and most importantly\u2026 ACCURATE. Quite often the answer will go above and beyond explaining the answer to the question itself and delve more deeply into the subject itself. The best of all answers are those that you get from people who have BEEN-THERE-DONE-THAT, and give insights that you cannot just \u201cgoogle\u201d. Like the answers you get from ISS Astronauts, etc\u2026 Conversely, the types of questions that are a simple matter of a Google Search are the most boring and inane questions and often provoke single sentence answers. Though some of my favorite answers are those that do answer those rather stupid questions and do so in a way that skirts or avoids a BNBR violation while still trying to get away with explaining to the questioner just how stupid and inane his/her question really is. And yes\u2026 there actually is such a thing as a Stupid Question. ",

            "answer_text": "If you think about it for a moment, it\u2019s not hard to figure out, But just in case you can\u2019t figure it out, I will inform you. Shit, That\u2019s literally what I\u2019m here for, right? Let\u2019s get started. TIP #1 : BE ACCURATE AND UNBIASED first of all, when it comes to answering questions purely based on facts and not subjective philopshy, make sure you do your research before telling someone some facts, as you don\u2019t want to mislead them and cause them even more inconvenience than they already did when they came seeking for your answer. Chances are they are struggling for an answer, and count on YOU to help them effectively. It\u2019s also helpful to give references and cite resources if what you say seems somewhat incredible, to further prove your point. If you are answering a question that is controvercial or is highly subjective, You are allowed to have your own opinion, but you must acknowledge the other side of the argument. You don\u2019t have to agree with anyone, just let them know that their counterargument is also valid but stay strong with your beliefs and give proof. TIP #2: BE INSIGHTFUL. Apart from giving accurate information, it\u2019s a MAJOR PLUS if you explain WHY you say what you say, and give real life applicable examples to help visualize your response. Sometimes, people will ask HOW to do something, and by giving examples, it can give insight, and help the person understand WHY they must do X a certain way and why it\u2019s the best way. TIP #3 OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BE HUMAN. If a person just merely wanted a simple factual answer to a question, they would just google it. They come here because I wanna hear real life answers from HUMANS, with a human aspect to it. This goes back to the concept of being insightful. Show empathy, sympathy, thoughts of comfort and support, to reinforce your credential, your human credibility, and your approachability. It never hurts to break the tension of some difficult question with humor. I personally don\u2019t mind using self-deprecating humor to make the reader feel better about themself but still get my message across. ",
