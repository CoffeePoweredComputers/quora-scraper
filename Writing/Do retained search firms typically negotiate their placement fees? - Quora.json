            "answer_text": "Yes, there are always negotiation points, though they may not always be about fees. From my blog: Creating a Win-Win Search Firm Contract Unless  you\u2019re an insider to the executive search profession, it can be  difficult to ensure the terms of engagement are in the best interest of  both the firm and the client. First, it is important to recognize  that contingency vs retained search is more about sourcing, process and  client management than about fee structures. Read my blog Retained or Contingency to learn more. In this article, I\u2019m addressing retained fee structures. A  win-win fee structure ensures that both the search firm and client are  committed to the project and excited about their partnership. While it  may seem advantageous for a client to negotiate the lowest possible fee,  this strategy can backfire. If a firm has similar searches at different  clients and some candidates would qualify for either, the firm would  present the candidates to the client paying the higher fee first. The  low-fee client may not see that talent unless the first client  determines the candidate isn\u2019t a fit.  I am in favor of fees  based on the first year\u2019s base salary and target bonus.  If there is  history of substantial volume, then I believe the percentage should be  in the 25-30% range; otherwise, I support the standard retained rate of  33%. I am less likely to use or recommend a search firm that  charges blanket administrative fees. The big five (Korn/Ferry, Heidrick  & Struggles, Spencer Stuart, Russell Reynolds and Egon Zehnder) are  more likely to add this fee on top of the retainer and in addition to  documented expenses. When the search market is strong, this can add much  as 18% to the fee. It\u2019s rarely clear what these charges cover; in my  opinion expenses not easily documented and client specific are the costs  of doing business. If the larger firms are not willing to forego the  administrative fees, consider using a boutique firm. On the other  hand, a search firm should charge for client-specific and documented  expenses including overnight mail or courier services, outsourced  research, video conferencing, meals with candidates, travel for  interviews, etc. Any engagement letter (contract) with a search firm should identify off limits,  both client and firm defined, as well as candidate ownership. The  firm\u2019s candidate ownership should be married to their placement  guarantee which is usually one year from the signed offer letter. I  support a fee schedule based both on deliverables as well as time  periods. Many would argue that this isn\u2019t pure retained search, and  they\u2019re right. Be that as it may, a fee schedule where the first  retainer is due at search kick-off ensures buy-in from the client and  reduces the firm's risk of expending resources for an uncommitted  customer. The second retainer should be due after 60 days providing the  firm has presented a slate of qualified and interested candidates. The  final fee should be due upon a signed offer letter. While this structure  isn't purely retained, I would argue that it is best for constructing  win-win engagement terms. There are many nuances to search firm  engagement terms; this blog touches the surface. If you\u2019re about to  embark on a major search, it may behoove you to enlist the help of an  expert.  - See more at: Creating a Win-Win Search Firm Contract ",

            "answer_text": "This is an excellent question.I will comment from 18 years of experience, placing senior~mid level management in my niche market.We have negotiated and do in most instances. What we take into consideration are many factors that contribute to the completion of a successful hire.How long will this take? How realistic is the client in terms of the type of person for the search? What is the overall compensation for the placed individual? Is this an exotic search? (my term, exotic, is for a position with unusual requirements.) Is this client a long term client? Is this a new client? Are there more searches on the horizon? Does the client want this position filled immediately? (usually, yes, if not sooner) Are we exclusive to the search? For those who don't understand the process and think it's all a matter of going on line and just looking over resumes, you have not a clue. There is MUCH that goes on in the background for search professionals to serve our clients. What about our finding and recruiting the candidate who walks in with MM's of dollars in business? It happens.  Or the Finance Whiz, who, we have found for our client that saves the company MM's with a few financial maneuvers not yet practiced by our client, but she/he has experienced in prior instances? It happens.Or, the PR professional who spins and smooths our clients major client and saves a MM$ account for our client? It happens. It's healthy and wise to negotiate with a retained firm. Choose your firm carefully and be realistic about your goal to acquire talent. ",

You want to ask yourself what you need from the recruiting agency. If they're saving you time and money because you don't have time to staff, maybe the 60K is worth it. Maybe 50K is worth it, but not 60. It's important to know what your priorities are, and also how difficult it may be to staff that particular position. ",

The agency is going to get one of its employees to source candidates by putting up a job post in job boards, LinkedIn etc. (I am assuming this is not a CXO level hiring). 2. Once sourced, the candidates are filtered based on resume and probably a initial call.3. They will send you relevant resumes for further processes.  Now think of whether this is worth $60K. Isn't is better and cheaper to hire a hiring expert? To answer your question, you should negotiate. Generally recruiters quote 20-50% more than what the deal is worth for. So do some hard negotiation. ",
