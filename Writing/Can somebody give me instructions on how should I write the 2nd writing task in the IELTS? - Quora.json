            "answer_text": "This isn\u2019t, in fact, my weakness. But this skill is difficult to self-study. You need to go to an English center where there are teachers who are willing to check your writing. Here are some suggestions I can think of, it maybe can\u2019t help you out. But do your best, you will be fine. Before writing an essay, you must know its basic structure. A book about essay writing might show you this.Do Task 2 first, because it is worth more marks and is easier.Don\u2019t waste too much time on Task 1. Learn all the specific writing structure for each type of task 1. In the real test, you just have to apply that structure with new data and suitable verb tenses. Read sample essays and take note of the ones with good structure to have a wide range of academic structures for task 1. Some structures might be used in the task 2 as well.You must complete both tasks. I don\u2019t care how difficult the test is, I don\u2019t care how little time you have got. You MUST complete your test at any cost. If you don\u2019t, you will be penalized.Again, practice writing. Do both 2 tasks in one hour. You can focus only on task 1 or task 2, but before the test, you should practice writing both tasks to get familiar with time limits.Practice makes perfect. In writing, this statement is completely true. But it is better if there is someone to check your writing for you and so you can learn from your mistakes.Writing requires wide academic vocabulary. You also have to buy a dictionary to work on and enrich your vocabulary.Avoid all informal ways of writing. There are some rules of writing you should follow. For example: no abbreviations, no 1st and 2nd pronoun or possessive (I, you, me, my, your), except in conclusion where you have to state your opinion.Each body paragraph has to include: the topic sentence, supporting sentences (2-3 sentences), development sentences (evidence: example, experience, data). In many languages (English included), there are many ways to develop a body paragraph, which results in a situation where that topic sentence is not the first sentence. But you are advised to put the topic sentence at the beginning of each body paragraph. Don\u2019t be creative in this case.That is all I can think of. I hope you will be lucky in your exam and what I wrote will help you in one way or another. But REMEMBER, to reach success, you MUST make an effort. You should have a clear motivation and a strong will to overcome difficulties. When I did practice tests, I was exhausted. But no success comes easily. Practice is the only way to gain success. Don\u2019t just wait for a lucky break, it will never come if you don\u2019t know how to grab it. And the final point I want to mention is: Relax before the test! Attempting to do one or two practice tests before the real test won\u2019t help you increase your score. On the contrary, it will make you feel stressed and less confident. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether you are writing the General or Academic Module of The IELTS, the Task 2 in the Writing Segment is the same. You will be asked to write an essay of not less than 250 words in 40 minutes. Follow the tips below to guarantee a successful writing on test day.  1. Understand The Topic. Before you start writing, ensure you clearly understand the topic and  the type of essay you are to to write. Is it an argumentative essay? or are you to compare and contrast? or discuss problems, causes and proffer solutions? 2. Plan Before You Write. Before you start writing your essay, make out an outline of how your essay will be organized. 4 or 5 paragraphs is perfect. The first paragraph should be your introduction. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th(if you wish) should be the body of your essay while the last paragraph is your conclusion.  3. Obey The Instructions. This may sound Trivial but it is important that you always read and follow given instructions. In the IELTS Writing Task 2,  you must not write less than 250 words. As a matter of fact, if you do not write up to 250 words, you will be penalized.  4. Pick A Good Side. When writing argumentative essays (most times they end with \"Do you agree or disagree?\"), pick the side which you can defend best. It does not matter which side you choose. The question you should ask yourself is \"do i have enough points to back this up?\" 5. Practice. The need for constant practice in The IELTS Test can never be over emphasized. Practice popular IELTS essay topics. This will help you in many ways especially in timing yourself. You can view some sample essays on ielts-ok.com to get a head start. I wish you the best of luck!

            "answer_text": "Hi There! IELTS Writing task 2 is a general topic and you are supposed to write your ideas in a manner that shows your proficiency in the English language. Let us start with the intro part of the Essay( Writing task 2) I will try to help you with an example. In some schools and universities, girls tend to choose art subjects (e.g. literature), and boys tend to choose science subjects (e.g. physics). Why do you think this is so? Should this tendency be changed? Source of the topic- Internet How would you write the introduction of this topic? I would suggest you, try with a background statement( a statement which gives an overall idea about the topic) Pick the main idea of the topic. In this particular topic, the main idea is different choices(of education) of different genders during a particular stage of life. Keeping this in mind, let's write the background statement of the topic- When it comes to making choices, both genders; male and female, tend to show various dissimilarities. Note- By writing this statement I am showing that I have understood the topic very well and giving the answer in the same context only. The next sentence of the intro can be rephrasing of the given statement. Make sure that you connect the background statement and the rephrased statement in a good manner. For example, the next sentence will be- Therefore, different genders prefer different subjects during the higher level of their education, for instance, girls are more likely to choose arts subjects, whereas the opposite gender gets inclined towards subjects such as science. After these statements, make sure you write your opinion as in the statement it is expected from you. SO the complete intro of the task will be- When it comes to making choices, both genders; male and female, tend to show various dissimilarities. Therefore, different genders prefer different subjects during the higher level of their education, for instance, girls are more likely to choose arts subjects, whereas the opposite gender gets inclined towards subjects such as science. Various reasons lead towards/result in this trend. Also, in my opinion, this pattern ought to be changed owing to the factors stated further. The introduction is the face of an essay, it should be written in an organized way. Now coming to the rest body of the essay, it should be equipped with relevant ideas and an adequate explanation of the points. To acquire a high band, you are expected to write various sentence structures, such as- Compound, complex, conditional, passive sentences. Using advance vocab and connectors is also required. IELTS writing is not tough, you just require correct guidance for it. I hope it was helpful! #ieltswriting ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, To achieve a good band in the writing module, you need to take care of four aspects: Task response, Vocabulary, Grammar, Coherence, and Cohesion. What exactly these terms mean? Task Response- While responding to the statement, do you answer each part of the question? Also, giving logical answers to the questions is mandatory. Vocabulary- Can you think of two synonyms for the word - Important? ( The most conman word used in IELTS Writing task 2) . Think again if necessary came to your mind when I asked that question. My friends are important to me. Can you write my friends are necessary for me? They are not necessary but they definitely are important. Having advance vocabulary does not mean that every word can be used at the place of its synonyms. You may have to change the sentence structure to fit that word in that sentence. When it comes to impressing the examiner with the range of words you have, adequate work is required on this. Grammar- How much advance your grammar is, matters a lot! What do I mean by advanced grammar? Does it mean the good knowledge of helping verbs, articles or tenses? Let me tell you, this is only basic and fine knowledge of this basic grammar can only help you achieve a very basic score. If I talk about advance grammar, sentence structure gets the priority here. Examiner expects: Complex sentences, Passive sentences, Conditional sentences and usage of some connectors such as: although _yet, Not only _ But also, Nonetheless, Nevertheless, However etcetera. Which sentence looks more impressive? A-Education makes a person civilized and well mannered. B-Not only does education make a person civilized, but it also transforms him into a well-mannered individual. A-War caused destruction and hatred between the communities. B-Not only did war cause destruction and death but it also generated hatred between the two communities. Coherence and Cohesion-This basically mean showing a proper link in the ideas you are writing in your essay. Your ideas should not go haywire and must not be irrelevant. Thank you!

We are going to look at three main methods of brainstorming: listing, freewriting and mind mapping. Try them out, find which one which works best for you, or create your own.PlanningOnce we have these ideas we need to make a quick plan for our essay. Each paragraph should have a topic, main ideas and supporting ideas. We select these from our brainstorming. Having a plan will help you to write faster, and increase you coherence and cohesion score in the IELTS exam.Writing an introductionNow we have a plan, we can write our introduction. A good introduction makes a favourable impression on an IELTS examiner and will certainly increase your exam score. It will also help you think clearly about what you are writing and prevent you from getting confused as you write. Attention GrabberIt is usually first sentence.An interesting, attention getting, sentence.Can be funny, factual, or a question, but must be relevant to your topic.Examples:Funny: There is a joke circulating online: \u201cI don\u2019t have insomnia, I have internet connection\u201d.Factual: By 2020 nearly 4 billion people will be connected to the internet.Question: Have you ever tried living for one day without going online? 2. Position Statement (Thesis) Usually, it comes after your attention grabber.This is your opinion, and the main theme of the entire essay.3. Main Points The main points you will cover in your essay can be mentioned in your introductionUsually after position statement.We take these directly from our planThis can be in one or two sentencesExample introduction: Nearly every human being alive on the planet today is connected by one network: the internet. This essay will show that there are both positive and negative aspects to this phenomena, looking first at the huge potential for learning and communication, before touching on issues such as privacy, security and false information.

Various parameters are taken into consideration while marking- not going off track the topic(central idea developed, extended and well supported, avoid using informal language), linking ideas(word order and sentence structure, simple, compound and complex sentences of varying lengths, usage of articles, relative pronouns, subordinating conjunctions and participles correctly and effectively), writing about two to three body paragraphs, appropriate grammar, punctuation, paraphrasing, vocabulary and spellings.

            "answer_text": "My answer contains strategies for Academic IELTS Task 2. Each of your paragraphs should contain a topic sentence, in the same way as the Academic IELTS Reading texts do. The topic sentence is the sentence which shows what the paragraph is about. It\u2019s usually the 1st or 2nd sentence of its paragraph. There may be other structures from the IELTS Reading texts that you can use in your Writing, so it\u2019s a good idea to tackle IELTS Reading past papers, in the way that I suggest in my IELTS information page here on Quora, before you tackle IELTS Writing. Practice past papers under exam conditions; in particular, observe the time limit. (Read some information about the format, and some advice, such as my own, before doing this.) After writing a paper, get feedback from a person who is very fluent in English. Pencil is much better than pen - you can rub out unwanted words! Don\u2019t waste time writing the title of the task on the answer sheet. It\u2019s a \u201cnormal\u201d essay, in which you are are allowed to, and should, include your own opinion. Your writing will normally need to include material that elucidates opposing points of view. Timing guidelines: plan for 5 minutes, write (on the answer sheet) for 25-30 min. (max.), checking 5 min. You should not give too much personal information; we are looking at the bigger picture. If you do include personal information, it doesn\u2019t matter if whether it\u2019s a lie or not (as long as it\u2019s plausible!). As in Task 1, they are looking for (so you get credit for) a reasonable variety of language (in particular, vocabulary), ideally hopefully using some different vocabulary from the question. Your response should be logical. The biggest problem is understanding exactly what the (long) question requires, and answering it properly. When faced with the question, you can rewrite it to help to start forming your plan. I explain this with an example in my IELTS information page here on Quora. What you do next, in order to actually start writing the essay, is explained in detail in my IELTS information page here on Quora (near the bottom). For further information about IELTS, see my IELTS information page here on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 is the second of two writing tasks on the IELTS. Even though Task 1 is by no means easy, most students find IELTS Writing Task 2 more challenging. It involves composing a formal five-paragraph essay in 40 minutes. The first section (Task 1) should take you only 20 minutes. Task 1 Vs Task 2 Task 2 counts more towards your Writing band score Task 1 = 1/3rd of your score Task 2 = 2/3rds of your score Word count minimums: Task 2 is longer Task 1 = 150 word minimum Task 2 = 250 word minimum Planning your response: Task 2 questions require more thought Task 1 = transfer of information from a visual into writing Task 2 = answer an open/abstract question with no clear or \u201ccorrect\u201d answer The IELTS Writing paper is assessed using the following four criteria: Before writing an essay, you must know its basic structure Task 1 Task 2 Task Response - This assesses how well you have understood the question and whether or not you have answered all the different parts of the question. It tests your ability to make clear and logical arguments. Coherence and Cohesion - This assesses how logically and clearly you have linked your ideas together and whether or not you have used paragraphs. It also assesses your use of linking and reference words. Lexical Resource - This assesses your vocabulary and spelling and also looks at your word formation. You need to show a wide range of topic vocabulary linked to the question. Grammatical Range and Accuracy - This assesses whether or not you have used a wide range of sentence types, both simple and complex. It also tests your punctuation. IELTS writing tips Start with Task 2 first, because it is worth more marks and is easier. Don\u2019t waste too much time on Task 1. Learn all the specific writing structure for each type of task 1. In the real test, you just have to apply that structure with new data and suitable verb tenses. Read sample essays and take note of the ones with good structure to have a wide range of academic structures for task 1. Some structures might be used in the task 2 as well. Practice makes perfect. In writing, this statement is completely true. But it is better if there is someone to check your writing for you and so you can learn from your mistakes. Avoid all informal ways of writing. There are some rules of writing you should follow. For example: no abbreviations, no 1st and 2nd pronoun or possessive (I, you, me, my, your), except in conclusion where you have to state your opinion. Choose the correct linking words combining your ideas into more complex sentences is not only good IELTS style; it is also one of the IELTS Band Descriptors for band 6 and above. Create a bank of linking words and make sure you know how they work in a sentence and also how to use them well. These are important tools in the \u2018academic\u2019 style that you need for IELTS writing. What are the best apps for writing practice for IELTS? What's the format/structure for the IELTS writing part 2 which helps to improve band scores? ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question, one in which a lot of students including myself had to struggle with. It was not long ago that I used to fret profusely even before attempting my IELTS writing 2 exams. With practice and reading various articles, I was able to overcome this fear. Following are the lessons that I learned: IELTS writing task 2 is just a way for the examiner to understand your grip on English written communication. Treat it the same way; think of how you will be acting if someone asks you this question in an interview and just translate your experience in written statements.You need to understand that this is an IELTS essay and not a university styled essay. The opinions you write are important, however, they are not being judged on their authenticity but of how well you present them.When you read a topic, think about the first thing that comes in your mind. These ideas, no matter how trivial, you need to stick with them. If this were a university styled essay, I would have adviced you against that. Hence, understanding the mantra of IELTS writing is extremely important to score a higher band.You need to think of a minimal number of ideas and focus more on their development. That is to say, it doesn\u2019t matter if you only have 2 ideas related to a particular question. As long as you are explaining them right, followed by relevant exemplifications, you are on the right track.Finally, you need to stay as focused as possible. Try to avoid as many general statements as possible. These rarely contribute towards answering your question. You only have 40 minutes to respond to your task, spend these wisely by planning accurately and staying on topic.I am sure by adopting these methodologies, you will be at a better position of planning your essay successfully. There are hundreds of resources out there, each claiming themselves to be the best. The only thing you need to focus on is to crack the need for IELTS writing. Understand what is required, and you will improve dramatically. ",

Once you are done with it, gather some common topics like education, crime,unemployment and brainstorm ideas about each topic. Next step is to practice vocabulary related to each topic. This way you become more confident!!! If you are already an expert in English, you need not worry about the brainstorming and vocabulary part! :) All the best. ",
