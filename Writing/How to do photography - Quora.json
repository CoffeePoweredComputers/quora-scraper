            "answer_text": "Visualization is the most important thing. When someone buys a camera he doesn't become a photographer. Although it's easier to learn photography on a better camera. Your visualization is the key element in your photograph. A certain thing or view might look amazing at certain angle and under certain light. No one goes to a sunrise point at 10 and say 'Kya bakwas jagah pe aye hue hain, Could've slept for a couple more hours\u2019.
