            "answer_text": "Agreed that practice is key. Accept that your handwriting will always be slightly different with different papers and pens. Getting to know the tools that make your handwriting look the way that pleases you, comes also with practice. As your handwriting improves, you will find that you have favorite tools. When you use the favorite tools most of the time, this will help with consistency. ",

            "answer_text": "I think everything depends on practice. In this mobile world, we learn how to type but we eventually forget how to write.The better way would be start using a pencil instead of a pen. Writing with a pencil, helps to improve our grip and also improves the handwriting. Try writing a few lines everyday with pencil, whether it be your favourite quotes or a letter to someone or a card or even an address. I hope it makes a difference. ",
