            "answer_text": "Oh boy. Do you have about ten years to chat with me? The more practical side is that you cannot function in a job without writing something to someone at some point- an email, a report, a proposal- and you will want to at least seem articulate. Imagine sending an email to whatever corporation you're working for, including the CEO, and seeming like an idiot. How secure will your job be? Imagine writing a proposal and it being functionally inarticulate? You likely will not win that bid. That is just the functional side. The human side is that humanity only continues as it does today because of the stories we have told. Before the written word, we told oral histories and created mythologies. Writing them down allowed the same to be passed through and transcend time. The Illiad had been told for centuries before Homer wrote it down, and now we have Homer's version coupled only recently with some anthropological evidence of a Troy. These stories will continue on and each time creates more stories telling of the human condition and the culture from which it sprung. We write for hope. What comes of that writing varies: books, financial documents, films, this random answer, historic speeches, journals no one will ever read. But we write for hope. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing is a skill that helps you communicate with others. Often, we find oout what wea are thinking when we write. Writing is a skill that can be learned. You must learn the rules for writing just like you must learn the rules of a sport or other activity. Writing classes usually teach you how to think critically and how to express yourself so you can persuade others. ",
