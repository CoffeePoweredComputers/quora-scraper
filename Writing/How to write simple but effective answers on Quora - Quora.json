            "answer_text": "Some great points have been covered in the other answers, so I\u2019ll stick to 3 different tips I used to improve my writing on Quora: Tip 1 - Central Theme for Each Paragraph I learnt this technique from Krishna Bharadwaj's answer to What do IIMA students learn outside the classroom? In this answer, he mentions something that influenced my writing for years to come: \u201cI could just list out the points, but I like telling long, rambling stories. If you hate stories, just read the text in bold.\u201d What he basically did was to mark the lines in bold which best represented the central theme of the paragraph. In my opinion, this technique does wonders to your writing style. It ensures that you stick to one point in each paragraph making your overall answer look more structured. Tip 2 - Write the Objective Answer at the Top When you google something for which you\u2019re looking for one or two-word answer, this is what Google shows you:  This is called a Rich Featured Snippet or Google Answer Box. Quora would want as many of its answers to feature in the Google Answer Box so that the traffic can be diverted from Google. In order for Quora to be able to do so, you should make sure that you mention the objective part of your answer at the top. You can certainly provide further details to supplement your answer, but whenever you get the opportunity, try mentioning the objective part at the top of your answer. This will increase your chances of getting more views both via Quora and Google. Tip 3 - Address the Reader as \u2018You\u2019 One of the best pieces of advice I\u2019ve received is: \u201cWrite as you talk\u201d. Never address the reader as \u2018OP\u2019 or \u2018Reader\u2019 or \u2018Questioner\u2019. When you try bringing a personal touch to your answers, you have a better chance of engaging with your readers, I\u2019ve experienced this multiple times with my answers as well as blog posts.  These are the 3 short tips I wished to share with you for better writing on Quora. They were originally published on my blog as the answer to - How to Write Effective and Better Answers on Quora? ",

            "answer_text": "Keep writing, and write well. The more you write, the more people will see your writing. The more people see your writing, the higher the chance that one of them will upvote your answer. However, your writing must also be good. If you don\u2019t make your point clear, or don\u2019t add in enough details, people won\u2019t think twice about your answer. You want to write in such a way that at least one person will continue thinking about your answer for days after they\u2019ve read it. You can do this in a few ways: Make it funny. If your answers are entertaining to read, people will enjoy reading them more.Write about things that you care deeply about. If you don\u2019t care about your answer, why should readers care about it?Focus not only on the content of your answer, but on how it sounds. The quality of the writing matters more than the subject.Give lots of details and examples. This is especially important if you are writing about your opinion. You can\u2019t just state it; you need to back it up.Don\u2019t make your answers too short. You often can\u2019t say everything you need to if your answer is too short.Most importantly, don\u2019t write for the recognition. On Quora, recognition is rather slow to come for most people, and requires not only good quality answers, but a good quantity of answers. If you write because you love to write, then the recognition will come naturally. ",

Here's where I admire Sean Kernan for his short but effective and to the point answers.No need to use flowery language to show off your language skills. Language should be such that even the person who doesn't have great knowledge about the language also understands what you want to convey.Have good knowledge of what you are answering. Be precise and to the point. A perfect example is one of the most popular Quoran Gopalkrishna Vishwanath Sir.Keep the points of priority first and always write from the readers point of view.Thanks for reading! ",
