            "answer_text": "POETRY An empty heart can never write a poem. Be it gladness, sadness or madness it has to be there in the poet while he writes. It comes out when we are brimming with emotions and feel a little friction inside An itching of the Heart, maybe. And just when we start to scratch there with the tip of our pen, the heart of the poet just begins to flow in a continuous manner till it empties from within. And so we end up with a poem, the stronger the itching, the more heavily it flows out from within. Poetry is sensations in pure sense. We feel, we write, we put it on a display to let other emphasize with the way we are feeling. And so poets are by default sensitive to live up to the very definition of a poet. Poetry may have wisdom but it isn\u2019t mandatory. We aren\u2019t intellectual beings we are sensitive beings. By saying this I didn\u2019t mean that we are cry babies or childish in any sense. It\u2019s just that we feel more vividly. And we choose to write about those incidents where we find that itching along with the emotions. So that itching is the very thing that inspires us to write, we get to feel when a poem is going to come out of us. That itching magnifies our ability to feel in the very moments when we write. We feel a blast of a mixture of emotions in those moments. With these raw powerful emotions, our poetry is cooked. In a poem we feel every word of what we write. BENEFITS OF WRITING POETRY:- 1) It\u2019s healthy to write poetry: It\u2019s a way to vent out the excess of emotions. For ex:- Just imagine you had a fight with your colleague in your office. You came back home with your head loaded with all the frustrations, like a balloon ready to burst. Chances are high that you would end up screaming at the top of your lungs at your loved ones for trivial reasons and would later on regret doing the same. So it\u2019s better to vent out all that frustration you had in the mind by scribbling a few lines. Your excess emotions would subside and you would feel your shit in control again. Do it if not for yourself but atleast for your loved ones Before losing your mind, lose your heart! 2) Poetry is healing: Poetry is healing in a way that, we write to better understand ourselves when we write we have we revisit that particular incident through our imaginations and memories and with heightened sensations we try to feel what happened, more vividly. Poetry is an emotional response of what happens with us good, bad or ugly. And by writing the same we get over that incident by releasing the supressed feelings of that time. And that\u2019s how we heal. 3) We become better humans:\u00ad- Humanity is to serve other humans. We develop an increased ability to get into other people\u2019s shoe. We develop understanding. We become kind. It has been rightly said by Cristopher Marlow in his play Dr Faustus that It\u2019s a comfort in wretchedness to have companions in woe. Even when the poet is not wretched he can relate to other people\u2019s pain and feel comfort for himself. It maybe out of empathy as well. 4) Pleasure of the senses:- It can\u2019t be argued that all the pleasure of the world is through our 5 senses only. Be it touch, taste, sound, smell. A Poet being a sensitive person has heightened state of all these senses and so he feels soaring highs and excruciating hues and cries, depending upon his emotional responses to what happens to him.

            "answer_text": "Writing poetry is a way to grow emotionally and intellectually, as language articulates and frames experience symbolically. Writing poetry is also a natural process, serving people\u2019s innate need to explain themselves and their lives in the world (a desire that is particularly strong during adolescence). Writing poetry produces a concrete product that is a source of pride and that can be recognized. Writing poetry is a vehicle for expressing altruistic values and philosophical explorations about life\u2019s meaning. And writing poetry is a free and available resource that can be used for self-exploration, gratification, and healing for a lifetime. Poetry provides a cultural context and expressive model that supports openness and emotional honesty. People who write poetry exercise insight and sensitivity, sometimes in profound and illuminating ways. The act of creating poetry reinforces ego strengths, including realizations about who I am, what I think, what my life has been like, what I want, and what I can accomplish. The act of creating poetry is joyful and self-reinforcing, even when the content is about a sad or traumatic event. People who write poetry can become more in touch with larger issues of life\u2019s meaning and connectedness, developing a spiritual appreciation of life. The act of writing a poem is a skill that people can use to help themselves over and over again throughout a lifetime. ",

            "answer_text": "Peotry requires imaginative thinking process and one cannot write a peotry if he/she doesn't have nothing in his mind and he/she has least imaginative thoughts. Now, there are few benefits which I think a person can gain from writing a poetry: A person can let his feelings out and pen down in a notebook in the form of a poetry. A person can increase and develop his imaginative and creativity skills by conveying by some important thoughts in a subtle way. By writing a poetry one can improve his/her vocabulary skills as for writing poetry one requires an abundant set of words. A person learns how to express his feelings and thoughts in a more expressive and sensitive way. And by writing poetry a person's mind will always be in search of new ideas and thoughts and it will crave him/her to gain more knowledge and spread it out to people in the form of poem. So, the above mentioned things are some of the benefits which I feel one can gain by writing poems.  Thank You! Open to Suggestions! ",

We have no direct experience of the lives and beliefs and loves of other people, we only now our own subjective experience in life. Poetry documents this intense private subjectiveness. And therefore what is truer than poetry? What another person tells you of life? no \u2026not at all. YOu wnat to leave your own record of life\u2026not what another person tells you about your life. You want to give a true representation of your own perception and experience in life\u2026right? Then only poetry is true. Therefore Poetry is the proof that humans exist. All that is left of a man life is his poetry (his story) his reputation that he leaves behind him. All a man can do is to climb up into his own poem (story). When a man attempts to explain hi slive, even in the first syllables, he transitions immediately to story. There is no exception to this rule in Human history. Therefore, in reality, and in truth, there are only poems in the world. Modernism is simply a lying civilization. Ad we have to document that. ",

For others its an exercise in structuring words and language in interesting, quirky and challenging ways; an opportunity to be playful. For still others, poetry is a way to explore the deeper parts of ourselves and bring other aspects of our personality, circumstances or the world around. The benefits come because these things allow us to challenge our own thoughts and feelings, express ourselves and cultivate new ways of looking at things. ",

It frees the mind to consider wild or fantastic relationships between words that create new synergies of comprehension.   It is a tool for realization.   It can express ideas that cannot otherwise be expressed. It is fun.   ",
