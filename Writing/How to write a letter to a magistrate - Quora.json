            "answer_text": "You should never contact a magistrate by phone call or mail. All interactions with magistrates and judges must be in open court for reasons of procedural fairness. Both sides must be given the opportunity to be heard. Many times people have asked me what would be appropriate to write to a judge in private or secret so the judge can know the facts. The answer is nothing. Do not write the judge or magistrate ever, for any reason. If the letter is not provided in open court after having been shown to the other side, it is an impermissible ex parte (meaning one sided)communication. Often clients write a judge and I am given their letters unopened. When a prisoner writes a letter to the judge, it is sent by the court to the clerk and sent on to the attorney unopened and unread. You know anything you say can and will be used against you. Even if you write with the good intentions of an angel there is no guarantee that the message will be received in the same spirit. Once you send a message the consequences are out of your control. Do not do this. At sentencing, Defendants and victims love to read statements. Victims lose their innocence when they speak. Defendants sound insincere or say things that hurt their case even if they mean to be sincere.. Nothing good comes from writing a judge or magistrate. Leave the writing to counsel. ",
