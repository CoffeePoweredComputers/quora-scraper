To increase this you can use google webmasters and analytics . Webmasters will guide you every steps from submitting sitemap and robots.txt which is very important. It also shows for which keyword you rank ",

In the beginning if you blog daily you can expect to get some organic traffic from the first week depending upon the keywords and the content you are creating. Then after some weeks when you get some momentum you can expect to get some traffic.There is not any fixed number though.All will depend on your effort,your niche and competition. ",
