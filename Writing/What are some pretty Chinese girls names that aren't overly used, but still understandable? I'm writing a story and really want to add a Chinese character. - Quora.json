            "answer_text": "Conventionally, a Chinese name consists of one or two of any Chinese characters. Chinese names are very meaningful and subtle, especially to their parents. Giving baby an appropriate name is quite complicated. What name we should give is based on the characteristics of the girl in your story. I can only give you some examples: \u59dd(shu, peaceful), \u598d(yan, beautiful), etc. Another problem is that you seem to write an English story so that you have no way to give an understandable Chinese name because Chinese is a tonal language and has a lot of homonyms. For example, \u201cshu\u201d represents four pronunciations with four different tones, covering almost 50 common used Chinese characters, among which four characters are often used as girls\u2019 names: \u59dd(peaceful), \u4e66 (book, if your character is in academic field), \u6dd1 (virtually good), and \u8212 (relaxed or comfortable, if your character sweet). I hope my answer helpful. ",
