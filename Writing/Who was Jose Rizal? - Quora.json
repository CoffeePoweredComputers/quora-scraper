            "answer_text": "Jos\u00e9 Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda or Jose Rizal is the national hero of the Philippines. Rizal was born on June 19, 1861 in Calamba, Laguna during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. The man was called a \u201ccreole\u201d which means he was a half Filipino, half Spanish. He was known to be part of the propaganda movement to let the Philippines become a Spanish colony. The propaganda movement he joined was called La Solidaridad or The Solidarity. That was also the name of the newspaper he wrote on. His pen name (so that he wouldn\u2019t be arrested) was Laong Laan. He also wrote two books, Noli Me Tangere (touch me not) and El Filibusterismo (The reign of greed). These were both used by Rizal to write about the abuses of the Spanish colonizers to the Philippines. When he was caught by the Spanish government, he was of course sentenced to death. He died on December 30, 1896, aged 35. He was shot by a firing squad in Bagumbayan, Manila, which is now Luneta/Rizal Park. His remains lie on the Rizal Monument in Rizal Park. ",
