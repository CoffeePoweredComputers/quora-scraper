Follow advice in this article or get a research paper in one day with the help of 99Papers or EssayBox services! How To Write A Research Paper Fast - General Guidelines 1.Select a topic First, study all the requirements carefully and don\u2019t miss anything important before you start the research paper. After that, pick your topic. Try to select a broad topic because you can find more relevant information instead of looking for obscure articles. You can also find papers by other authors that are already done. This way, it\u2019s much easier to utilize other research while writing a paper in your own words.  2. Do the Research You should do the research before creating an outline because you must understand if there is enough information on your topic. You can use various sources but don\u2019t forget that every article you read should have an author. You must indicate the sources you have used. Sites like Wikipedia, despite all the advice not to use it, can help in creating an outline for your text. But do not copy and paste from Wikipedia. Professors usually check it first if they want to check for plagiarism. Additionally, instructors still prefer books or printed articles to online sources. Thus, try to use them. If you don\u2019t have any hardcopy books on your topic, use Google to find available scans or electronic copies of them. While preparing your work, do not read the whole book! You don\u2019t have time for it. Find the sections that are related to your topic, copy and paste them into the draft document and use them while working on your research. Then rewrite the material in your own words. 3. Start to Work on Your Thesis After you have completed your research, you can prepare your thesis statement. It should not be too broad because a thesis should show the main problems related to your research. Thus, it should be short and clear. Use our thesis statement generator to save even more time. While writing a thesis, you should not limit the things you are talking about but at the same time, you should make your thesis statement as specific as possible. Your thesis does not have to reinvent the wheel. Just follow the central focus you have chosen and give the necessary information. Lastly, don\u2019t forget to state your thesis in the last sentence in your introduction. 4. Create the Main Structure of Your Research Paper Think about the number of paragraphs in your paper and distribute the information you have throughout these paragraphs. This will be the body of your text. Write the selected sources in your own words to make the paragraphs for the body of your text. After that, carefully check the style in which you have written the main parts of the text while working with the sources. The whole text must be written in one style in order to avoid plagiarism that your professors could notice while reading your work. Finally, add all citations at the end of your text. 5. Write an Introduction and a Conclusion for the Research Paper Now prepare the introduction of your text. It should contain about five sentences and you need to introduce the topic in this part with some general words and finish your introduction with a thesis statement. To write a good conclusion, figure out what the most important facts are and restate them briefly using different words. The conclusion should contain the facts that should be memorable for your reader and emphasize the general idea of your text. At the end, prepare a list of citations. 6. Proofread Your Paper After you have done all your work, start checking for mistakes. If you do it in the morning the next day, your mind will be much clearer. This way, you can have a look at your paper from another perspective and find mistakes more productively. While proofreading, get rid of all extra sentences that don\u2019t relate to the main topic, check for grammar and spelling mistakes, and check your citations\u2019 format.

            "answer_text": "It is entirely possible to write a research paper in a day. I have accomplished that feat on multiple occasions. However, before I sat down to write, I had tables or summaries of all of my observations in hand. I had polished figures that provided the narrative for the research paper. I had an excellent bibliography from which to pull the relevant references to provide the background and support for my statements. All that I needed to do was write the text around the figures to make my case. Even after that is accomplished, there is still much work to be done. The paper has to be shared with my coauthors who helped with data collection and analysis. I had to incorporate their suggestions into a revised version of the text. Sometimes I passed the manuscript by interested researchers outside my immediate field to see if the paper is accessible. All of this takes much more than one day. So whether it had taken me one day to write the paper or four, the main point here is that when I look at the overall time line for the project, from start to finish, the amount of time I spent writing was not the critical factor in how quickly I went from project inception to submission of the manuscript.
