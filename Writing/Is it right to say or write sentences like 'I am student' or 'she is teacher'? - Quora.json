            "answer_text": "No, it\u2019s not correct. It is missing the article before the noun. It\u2019s a common mistake that English speakers will hear right away. So, this is correct: \u201cI am a student.\u201d\u201cShe is a teacher.\u201d However, please note that in the plural, the article is not needed: \u201cWe are students. They are teachers.\u201dAlso correct in the singular: I am the student (a particular one) and she is the teacher (perhaps clarifying that she is THE teacher, and not the student, or another person or profession.)
