            "answer_text": "In a law practice, attorneys frequently are asked to provide the court with arguments and authorities. This is supposed to include negative authorities as well as those supporting the argument the attorney is making. This actually helps because the attorney would then be able to argue why those decisions are either incorrect or not relevant to the issue in dispute. This then becomes an opportunity, not a problem. It strengthens the reliability of the argument to acknowledge problems and refute them before they are even raised. So my answer would be a big \u201cyes\u201d. Mentioning the cons and showing them inapplicable, or outweighed by the positives, will make your writing more convincing and credible. I would mention, however, that there was once an unexpected problem with one of my legal arguments. I was frequently published even while I was still practicing, and I once lost on an issue because the judge cited one of my own articles in opposition to the position I was then taking and asked me to explain why my writing didn\u2019t apply. Awkward! ",

            "answer_text": " A persuasice essay should not be a discussion. You are supposed to have a bias for one side. You might include an argument opposed to your own position but only on the condition that you counter all its points. Some might say that you should never use cons in a persuasive essay, that you should only argue from one standpoint, but I disagree. When done correctly, it can give a dynamism to the writing that would otherwise not be there. Others might argue that it can be confusing and so easy to get wrong, losing you marks, but I would counter that using more difficult language correctly, if you are able to do so, will result in higher marks. It is a gamble as to whether you successfully pull it off, but it may be a gamble worth taking in some situations. See, I just did it in that last paragraph. I introduced opinions contrary to my own, but then immediately rebuffed them. It is a useful form of rhetoric. You must make sure you clearly rebuff and argue against the cons. If you make a discussion, you will usually lose marks. ",

            "answer_text": "It will depend upon the subject, or topic, of the essay. Many essays, especially if they are being written in order to influence the reader\u2019s decision or choice, contain both \u201cFor and Against, or Pro and Con\u201d arguments. This style of essay writing is more persuasive than a \u201cSingle Sided\u201d essay as it shows the reader that you, the writer, have taken the time to research the subject, and that you know about the subject which you are writing about. If you can present the opposition\u2019s view points and then destroy them with legitimate reasons why they are wrong, you will have a stronger essay than \u201cjust giving your opinion. ",
