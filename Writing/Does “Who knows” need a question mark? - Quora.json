            "answer_text": "A good question (which even native English speakers have issues with occasionally!). Does a rhetorical question (a question where an answer is not expected or, from context, the answer is implied or suggested, or will follow soon afterwards) need a question mark? The answer is yes, and there\u2019s a simple reason why this is so. Let\u2019s say we are writing this question; well, we want the reader to realise that it is a question, otherwise the reader would be confused and the phrase wouldn\u2019t make sense (\u201cWho knows.\u201d Who knows what/when/why/etc?). The fact that it is a rhetorical question will be demonstrated or indicated in various ways, but the reader still needs to realise that it is a question! If we are speaking, well, we demonstrate, audibly, with our voice, by using an inflection at the end, that we have just asked a question. Otherwise, again, the listener would understand what we mean. Some simple guidelines for this situation (and others involving grammatical or punctuation marks) are: if we are writing or speaking (for example, in a conversation), we are not simply writing/speaking words, we are communicating ideas, meanings and sounds, which, presumably, we want others to understand; use whatever tools (punctuation marks etc) you need to use to help facilitate that communication. Another method to consider is this: if you are writing something (like this, which is usually a part of dialogue), actually speak the words (even in your mind) and if it needs the question mark to make sense, write it; if you are speaking, then imagine whether it would seem to make sense and be understandable if it was written down. These are the tips or guidance I would give to an English language student in this situation (regardless of proficiency. Thanks for the question and I\u2019m sure others appreciated it to (plus I hope my answer helped you and then!). ",
