            "answer_text": "I try hard not to cancel class at all. It might happen if I get too sick to teach effectively, although I\u2019ve been known to soldier on even when my wife is telling me to stay home. I recall one time when I\u2019d lost my voice; I got our AV guy to wire me up with a microphone, and I lectured anyway. The show must go on. I\u2019ve very rarely had to cancel class when, say, my son gets sick and my wife can\u2019t pick him up or stay with him\u2014but that doesn\u2019t happen every semester, probably not every year. I had to cancel once when we\u2019d had a freeze; the campus was open, but my house\u2019s driveway (on a steep hill) was iced over so much that I doubted whether I could down it safely, or get back up it afterwards. In the event of extreme weather, such as a light snowfall, the entire campus may close. If that happens, all classes are canceled. That\u2019s not my decision. So I might have to cancel class. . . maybe once per semester, but not even that much if I can help it. I feel that if students are paying to attend my class, I\u2019d better give them the fullest possible value for their money. This philosophy is not always enthusiastically held by my students, but I hold to it all the same. Every so often you hear about professors who cancel the first day of class, or who hand out the syllabus and dismiss everyone because it\u2019s \u201cSyllabus Day\u201d or \u201cSyllabus Week.\u201d Screw that. EDIT: There are times when I know well in advance that we won\u2019t have class, because I have, say, a convention to attend or something like that. In those cases I don\u2019t really \u201ccancel\u201d class; I come up with a plan in advance. Usually I\u2019ll try to get a fellow faculty member to cover for me, either proctoring an exam or giving a lecture that I\u2019ve prepared in advance. I return the favor when I get the chance. Occasionally I might replace my scheduled class meeting with a take-home assignment or something like that. But I wasn\u2019t thinking of those as \u201ccancellation\u201d, because I don\u2019t intend to hold class and then suddenly change my plans. ",

            "answer_text": "Entirely anecdotal here, but in general, the university as a whole (not the professors individually) may cancel a class in case of severe weather. At my current institution in Tennessee, that is typically about one day of class every other year, on average. Some years, no cancellations at all, and other years 1\u20133 days of snow cancellations in a single winter. I\u2019ve had to cancel my own individual classes in an unscheduled manner (i.e., less than 24 hours warning in advance) a grand total of twice in 25 years, due to illness or whatnot. However, there\u2019s usually at least one and sometimes two classes each semester that I specifically list as canceled so I can attend a convention or conference. That can be taking students to the Alpha Chi Honor Society national convention, where they compete for scholarships for each April, or it can be to present a paper at a medieval conference such as the one each May in Kalamazoo, Michigan. So, that\u2019s usually 1\u20132 classes each year, but the students know about it months in advance, as it\u2019s clearly marked in the syllabus. TL, DR: Unannounced cancellations? Very rarely. Scheduled cancellations? Maybe once or twice a year. ",
