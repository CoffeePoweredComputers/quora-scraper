            "answer_text": "So let's be a little more specific. Don't just enlist in a 15 series MOS. You have 2 options if you want to be a rotor-wing gunner (I don't know anything about the fixed-wing side of the house).  As a crew chief/door gunner myself, I'll set this a little more straight. Enlist as either a 15T or as a 15U. A 15T is a UH-60 (Blackhawk) Repairer  and a 15U is a CH-47 (Chinook) Repairer.  In either case, you'll likely start as just a maintainer, fixing the helicopter. Most units, to my knowledge, start all new soldiers in a D Company (maintenance company) or an ASB (Aviation Support Battalion). If you are physically qualified and a decent worker, you could be sent to a flight company, where you'll be trained as a crew chief. It's similar to your school you went through to become a mechanic, but WAY more in depth on the systems of the helicopter, the medical effects of flying on the body, gunnary, NVG operations, limitations of the aircraft, how to handle passengers, securing cargo, aerospace surveillance, how to work as a member of a crew with your pilots, terminology, calls, so on, and so on. It's an intense amount of information and it's a bit grueling. You can also be a gunner another way. Essentially any MOS can hold the position while deployed. I'm pretty sure you still have to be cleared by a flight doc same as a 15T or 15U, and still have to go through the gunnary academics. DO NOT let a recruiter tell you to go 15R because Apaches have guns. You won't fly. None of their enlisted guys do. You have to be a Warrant Officer pilot or Commissioned Officer pilot to fly those. Their \u201ccrew chiefs\u201d prep the aircraft for flight and fix it when it's broken. That's about it. As a T or U, you'll fly a ton. I fly, on average, twice a week. The rest of my time is spent fixing aircraft. If you have any other questions about the 15T MOS, let me know!  ",

Being a door gunner is only one of their duties, but hey, you get to pew pew for a bit before going back to being a wrench.
