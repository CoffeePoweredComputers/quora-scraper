            "answer_text": "This question can be confusing, because poetry itself is one of the genres of literature. But one can classify poetry based on the structure, meter or subject matter. In all the literature courses that I took and those I am familiar with, poetry is taught according to the period. Even the famous anthologies such as Norton, list poems according to the chronology of the poets and do not bother to classify poetry by any other criteria. All I am saying is, the literature courses focus very little on the \"genres of poetry.\" This perhaps, in my view, is because there is no one particular form that is considered more respectable and poets choose the form that suites their needs the best. That said, the following is the alphabetical list of the forms of poetry taken from Academy of American Poets.
