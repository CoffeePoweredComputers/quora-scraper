            "answer_text": "No. I never would. The point of writing essays as part of an education program is to teach research skills, the ability to organize information, and the writing skills to effectively present information. That is one of the skills people attend school - or university - to gain. Why would I cheat myself out of learning those skills by not doing the assigned work? That would be stupid. If someone needs help in writing, every school/university I\u2019ve ever attended has had help. Using an essay writing service is self-defeating, dishonest, and cheating. Plus the chance that you will get caught is very high since a purchased essay will not be written in your \u2018voice\u2019, so the difference will be obvious. ",

I must confess that it helped me a lot cause I still can\u2019t write pretty essays on my own so I am glad I made the right choice.. I have used just few services. Paperell was one of them as I remember. After all I can say that such a services - are good things. ",
