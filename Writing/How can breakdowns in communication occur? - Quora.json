            "answer_text": "Breakdowns in communication occur when there is a problem with either information or idea (as all communication most basically works as: information \u2014-> idea). Also, the most basic skills in communication (describing/explaining and asking/checking) need to be employed as much as possible to try to avoid breakdowns in communication.Moreover, it should be understood that underneath the human operating system that allows us to the possibility of communicating better than any of the other creatures on this planet, there is the older operating system of our distant ancestors that plugs into our most basic emotions; and this OS is carrying out operations constantly without any conscious human supervision. Consequently, we are sometimes unaware of why we say things, or why we react so strongly to certain information. Lack of self-awareness can often lead to the communication jalopy blowing a gasket and ending up at the side of the road; steam coming out of the hood, and the occupants standing around hot, angry and blaming each other in order to defend their misplaced sense of self.* *Which I might be doing right now\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Well in my opinion, the ONLY communication that I consider REAL, is face to face. Anything else is an illusion. I realize my personality type, the way i process information, and the way i interpret symbols, or perceive the world around me is unique. Not to mention my personal hang-ups/issues, exaggerated imagination, and subconscious blind spots WITH turbulent mood swings make any communication aside from DIRECT, BLUNT- \u201cgrab the bull by the horns\u201d type, face to face (eye contact is a must) conversation absolutely necessary. In my mind, if the topic is that important, im worth the time/energy! This way, any misunderstanding, misinterpretation, loose strings, important details, or just elaborated data can be maturely addressed and straightened out on the spot. Ma'am- basically, im not sure if im old school or window lickin' anymore and im tired of beating myself up over the things i dont understand. Truth is i dont wanna be different from everyone, i abhor needing 'special attention', but when it comes to understanding things, i do occasionally need my hand held and im not ashamed of that. I just process info alot differently from others and this is why my communication breakdowns make me look like im a moron 9/10 times. ",
