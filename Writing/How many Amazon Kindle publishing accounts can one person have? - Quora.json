            "answer_text": "One. It is a TOS violation to have more than 1. You cant seem to have a personal account, and a company one acting a publisher account, but that\u2019s it. You can have as many pen names as you want, on your one account. No-one sees into your KDP account, so the author name you use on any book, is never going to be tracked back to you that way. Author Central allows 3 pen names per AC account. You sign up to AC separately than KDP. And I believe you can have an AC account for each pen name. Author Central provides author profile pages, and having a separate one for each pen name, is advisable, also so people wont track a pen name back to the actual author. But KDP? 1. One. ",
