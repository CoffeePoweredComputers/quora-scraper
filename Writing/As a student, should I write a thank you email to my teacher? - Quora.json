            "answer_text": "I was 11 and, from a class of some 40 pupils, I and 5 of my fellow pupils had been selected to go to the Grammar School. This was a big, life transforming opportunity for all of us. Our teacher, Mr Leitch, was a lovely, kind, generous man to whom we all owed a debt of gratitude. My Mum said, \u201cWhat are you all doing to thank him?\u201d The answer was, nothing. I felt ashamed. So, that night, the evening before our last day at school, my Dad took me around to the house of Stan, another of the \u201cBoteler Boys\u201d (the name of the school we had been accepted into) and we agreed to get some fancy stationery as a gift for Mr Leitch together with a card, which we would get all the other lads to sign. At the end of our last ever day at that school, the whole class tearfully said goodbye to this wonderful teacher and \u201cThe Boteler Boys\u201d duly handed over our gift to him. He was gracious, embarrassed and kind. Why do I still remember it and him nearly 50 years later? Because a good, kind teacher is so precious and we were so lucky to have had him. Thank them from the bottom of your heart. ",

If you are interested in being a decent human being\u2014or even an outstanding one\u2014 you might even double-down and put pen to paper, fashioning a handwritten artifact documenting that gratitude and non-douchiness. Imagine the positive and lasting impact of such a \u201ckind\u201d gesture! ",
