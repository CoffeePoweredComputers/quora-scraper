            "answer_text": "With the constant evolution in technology, especially, with the predominance of emerging technologies, like machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data and IoT, software testing and development approaches are bound to transform to prevent becoming obsolete. More than ever before, the area of software quality engineering is witnessing a technological revolution today. Here is a look at some of the emerging trends on software QA in 2020 and the near future: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have started drastically enhancing quality engineering through intelligent automation. They assist in optimizing test automation strategies through intuitive decision-making, thereby shrinking costs, and minimizing delivery timelines, while improving the quality of the product.Big Data, EDI and ETL testing are rapidly growing in significance as enterprises are leaning more towards a data-oriented approach. This is an emerging and essential trend, as Big Data has started playing a vital role in business-critical decision making.Agile and DevOps approaches in software testing prove to be beneficial, urging QA organizations, to progress beyond waterfall methods. With regular feedback, reduced documentation, continuous integration and deployment, early defect detection, and excellent collaboration, Agile and DevOps methodologies can significantly save time and expenditure.Testing IoT devices is a growing trend and is here to stay as a norm for the future. With IoT devices growing exponentially with every passing day, software testing service providers are rapidly gearing up to create customized strategies for comprehensive IoT testing.Performance engineering has made its way into software testing approaches, and QA firms now realize its advantages over performance testing. The collaborative approach that performance engineering follows provides better outcomes and enhances customer experience than performance testing.Apart from the above, other trends like multi-browser cross-browser testing, selenium automation, mobile test automation, RPA, voice-technology, and so forth. are also becoming established practices for advanced quality engineering services. Organizations must be prepared and start working to catch up with each of these emerging trends that will soon become the new normal in the sphere of software testing in the upcoming days. ",

            "answer_text": "The year 2020 is going to witness the following trends in the software testing industry: 1. Artificial Intelligence will be extensively used for a lot of testing tasks like analysing file contents and memory, generating robust test data and insights etc. 2. DevOps will be the new common testing norm and integrating coding, testing and other activities into one cycle will lead to faster implementation of corrective measures. 3. The demand for IoT testing will rise in the near future. On the other hand, programming testing is also likely to apply IoT to make the process more automated and accurate. 4. Test mechanization will be increasingly used in testing to minimize errors and to perform repetitive tasks faster. 5. To keep up with fast and frequent changes in the IT industry, shorter and upgraded software development life cycle will be the primary goal of every organization. 6. Demand for holistic security testing will rise in the near future. I have also written a detailed blog on the latest trends in the software testing industry.
