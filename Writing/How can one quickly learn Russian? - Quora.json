            "answer_text": "Russian is a difficult language to learn. Since it is a synthetic language, it has declensions ( 3), conjugations (2), genders (3), lots of affixes to convey both grammatical and semantic meanings, and loads of exceptions. There is a technique though which can be of help. It doesn't guarantee a profound knowledge of the language but you will be able to make yourself understood. It's the Lozanov- Kitaygorodskaya technique. It can be applied to any language, so I guess if you search the net, you are very likely to find an educational organization ( Moscow and St. Petersburg) that uses this approach to teaching Russian as a foreign language. Good luck! ",
