            "answer_text": "Of course it is. The idea behind tertiary education (or primary education, or secondary education, for that matter) is for you to do your work and get your marks as a result of it. The moment someone else enters this equation, you\u2019ve cheated. Unless your educational system is very strange, when submitting an assignment there should be the need to either sign or write a declaration to the effect of \u201cThis is my own work and nobody else\u2019s.\u201d If you can\u2019t agree to that statement (and you really can\u2019t if someone else has done it for you), then you can\u2019t submit the work. If you agree to that statement falsely (as you would if someone had done it for you), then you\u2019ll face the consequences. ",
