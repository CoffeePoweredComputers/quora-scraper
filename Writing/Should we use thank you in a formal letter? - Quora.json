            "answer_text": "There's absolutely nothing wrong with using the phrase \"thank you\" in a formal letter. While the expression is often used informally, it's perfectly possible to make it sound very formal. For example: \"I enclose my CV, and thank you for your consideration.\" -- \"I wanted to write to thank you for giving me the opportunity ...\" -- \"I note that you have now returned the paperwork I requested; thank you.\" -- etc. ",
