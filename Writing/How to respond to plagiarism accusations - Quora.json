            "answer_text": "The only time I ran into an accusation of plagiarism was when I re-submitted my own work. I had started a class and turned in several papers and then had to drop the class for personal reasons. When I next took the class, the assignment was the same, so I saw no harm in re-submitting the paper. BAM. You committed plagiarism! My paper was entered into the global database the first time but, the database didn\u2019t assign the paper to me, by name or date. I explained the situation, provided contact information for the previous instructor, and the school agreed, since the paper was for the same class and the same assignment, that it was OK to have done so. Of course, I did offer to re-author a paper if they took issue, but they didn\u2019t see the need. ",
