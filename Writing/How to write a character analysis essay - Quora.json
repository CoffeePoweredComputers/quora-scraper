            "answer_text": "Pay attention to the character\u2019s ethics. Does the character make just or unjust choices? Decide whether the character\u2019s actions are wise or unwise. What is the character\u2019s motivation? As you are mulling over the pros and cons of each character\u2019s internal thoughts and external actions, you will want to also consider why the character is acting or thinking in a particular way. Has the author given you any clues about the character\u2019s past? Consider the effects of the character\u2019s behavior on other characters. Look for repeatedly used words that describe the character. Those words often give insight into a character\u2019s psychology and motivations. Be aware of items associated with the character. They may say something about his or her state of mind. Read between the lines. Often what a character does not say is as important as what he or she does say. Is the character \u201cflat\u201d or \u201cround\u201d? A character is considered flat (or static) when he or she does not experience a change of any kind, does not grow from beginning to end. Consider the historical time period of the character. Refrain from making modern judgments about the past; put the character\u2019s actions and thoughts in context. And Finally, what does the author think? Look for any of the author\u2019s own judgments about the characters he or she has created. The author may be directing you toward an intended interpretation. Don\u2019t forget to proofread your assignment. I would recommend you to ask Supreme essay guys to help you. They do a good job. ",
