            "answer_text": "Imagery is the name given to the elements in a poem that spark off the senses. Despite image being a synonym for picture, images need not be only visual; any of the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) can respond to what a poet writes. Imagery intensifies the impact of the poet\u2019s words as he shows us with his words rather than just telling us what he feels. Song lyrics are full of imagery. The three ways to write imagery poems are: 1. Brainstorm a subject for the poem 2. List words for all five senses 3. Tie description to action This is an excerpt from Preludes, an imagery poem by T. S. Eliot. You can almost see and hear the horse steaming and stamping and smell the steaks: The winter evening settles down With smell of steaks in passageways. Six o'clock. The burnt-out ends of smoky days. And now a gusty shower wraps The grimy scraps Of withered leaves about your feet And newspapers from vacant lots; The showers beat On broken blinds and chimney-pots, And at the corner of the street A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps. And then the lighting of the lamps. ",

            "answer_text": "In an imagery poem, try and think of what you\u2019re describing. MAKE the reader think that he/she is in that place. Also, one tip is to use language suggesting something of the place. For example, if you\u2019re talking about a pastoral setting, try and use language synonymous to nature, flowers, etc. Make sure to describe it in a way that isn\u2019t to \u201cconstructed\u201d and \u201cdescription-y\u201d. (Best words I can think of at the moment. Writing an imagery poem can allow readers to really feel they are there, so it\u2019s very effective when written well. :) For example, if you\u2019re writing about being in a meadow, make he/she feel that they are touching the flowers, or that the gras is brushing against their legs, or they can smell the air, etc. There\u2019s a pretty good imagery poem down below. T.S. Eliot The winter evening settles down With smell of steaks in passageways. Six o'clock. The burnt-out ends of smoky days.

            "answer_text": "Tell a story with the imagery. Use metaphor and simile as things happen within the scene you are painting to walk your reader through it. You aren\u2019t showing your reader a pretty snapshot, you\u2019re paining them a video. A static imagery poem tends to feel a little flat Make it sound musical In poetry, proper application of alliteration adds animation and also leads the literature\u2019s audience far afield in imagination. Rhythm and Rhyme are quite an effective foundation, too. Formulaic devotion to the Bard\u2019s structures are not required all the way through. Breaks are good. Use the right words Why use blue when azure, icy, sapphire, these far more fluid and evocative adjectives exist? The sun ain\u2019t bright, it\u2019s brilliant, fiery, searing, scorching. Hit more than one sense. Vision is one of numerous senses. What does it sound like, what are the smells, how does the air taste and feel on your skin, should the reader feel off balance, does time pass. The Weft and Weave of writing poems is a combination of all these factors. ",

            "answer_text": "Finally a question regarding what I specialize in. Imagery is super easy it\u2019s literally taking what you see or would see in a scenario and describe it. Not just the tree is brown. The trees monstourous vody towered over me like something of ancient lore. It\u2019s rough hide pricked my fingers and is lithe arms danced in the spring wind. Use your words to tell the reader what you see by evoking beautiful images and feelings. ",
