            "answer_text": "Hello. It\u2019s 2018 and things are bad here in the US. The US country is divided into two political camps who can't work together. This division is prompted by a man elected who has no business in office. He has no training in how to lead people. He spends his time trying to divide and conquer the country with hateful speech directed at his base, a lunatic fringe of deplorable people who live their lives full of hate for anything or anyone culturally or racially different from themselves. We\u2019ve had great leaders in the past who worked hard to unite us all despite our differences. They thought two things that I think we\u2019ve forgotten. We have nothing to fear but fear itself.A house divided against itself cannot stand.Today, we have fear and division. I hope things are better for you in our future and the country has righted its course. ",
