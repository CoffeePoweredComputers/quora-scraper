            "answer_text": "There are many ways. You can uploads your songs on a YT channel or Soundcloud, and monetize them. Plus, if you sign up with a digital music distribution company (like Symphonic Distro, CD Baby, etc) they will protect your music and monetize it each time someone else is using it, by putting ads on itpublish them, using a publishing/distribution company (as written above) on Spotify, Itune store, Amazon, Google Play. For my last release, I paid like $39 to get my 20-songs album to those platformspromote your music by cross-linking all your social medias with your blog/website and publish amazing content/articles/vlogging/tutorials/reviews, etc. If you\u2019re good enough at that, you can even open a Sellfy shop, or Bandcamp, or Audiojungle, or Pond5 or Tunefruit account to sell your music.you can distribute your music for free and create a Patreon page to be paid by your fans (like Adrian von Ziegler did)publish some of your songs under Creative Commons or Public Domain, that people can use on their projects for free, without limitation. Ask them to mention your artist name inside the credits/the descriptionduring that period of time, you can send HQ demos (3 or 4 songs) to music talent agent/labels/music supervisors, by finding their contact on databases like IMDB pro (movie & tv business) or by searching for music sync & music placement companies. And wait for feedback/answers, and keep on sending your best songs until they are good enough to be notifiedAnd many more things !

            "answer_text": "Post a few of your songs on Youtube and make a square space website to sell your music. If your songs get a lot of views on Youtube, Youtube will recommend yhe music to people and it will be easier to find. When you do this, you'll also notice that your music is grouped with songs in a certain genre and that will give you an idea of who your target audience should be thus how to market yourself. Make sure your Youtube bio, banner, video descriptions, etc look professional as well. Good luck! ",
