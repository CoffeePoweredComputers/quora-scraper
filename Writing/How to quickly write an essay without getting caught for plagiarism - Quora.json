            "answer_text": "Let me rephrase this question. \u201cHow do I take the easy way out of an uncomfortable or difficult situation while avoiding negative consequences?\u201d Honesty, particularly with ourselves, is the best policy. If you\u2019re willing to cheat on your paper, you can\u2019t with any justification be upset at Trump for doing X with his taxes or Hillary doing Y with her emails. If you\u2019re asking advice on how to cheat - or amorally, avoid negative consequences for academically improper behavior - then you should not expect others to adhere to a moral framework you are trying to skirt. Do you expect your teacher to grade you fairly? They expect you not to claim someone else\u2019s work for your own. If you\u2019re unwilling to meet their expectations, you cannot expect them to meet yours. So, the simple answer is don\u2019t plagiarize. Show some self respect and create the best work you are capable of producing. If none of this concerns you, and you\u2019re perfectly comfortable with the self-deprecation of admitting you\u2019re incapable of meeting the requirements, but unwilling to accept the consequences, then you can\u2026 Create false citations. The teacher will probably not check your sources, especially online ones.Loosely paraphrase. Change words around and don\u2019t give credit. Most of the time, this won\u2019t be triggered by plagiarism detection programs.Avoid Control C + Control V. It is easily detectable.Use Wikipedia. Super fast research and you can rip the citations from the bottom of each article.\u201cEducation without morals only serves to create a more clever devil.\u201d- Lewis, C.S. The Screwtape Letters. p.s. See what I did there? ",

            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t plagiarise. Seriously. You will be caught. Instead, read the questions CAREFULLY and make sure what it means. Then write out what YOU think the conclusion should be. Yes, the conclusion. Then go to the library and research the points you need to look at. And see how the research grabs you. If it does agree with your conclusion, start writing it down. Consider every paragraph like a mathematical proof. This is the start point, which everyone can agree; because of this point (found in research), logically this leads us to point two; this means that because of this quotation (more research), logically we go to point three \u2026 and so on. If you have nothing to support your initial conclusion, change it. It\u2019s not a lot of words. Rewrite the conclusion to be supported by your research. And if you\u2019re given 1,500 words, assume 10% each for beginning and conclusion. That means 150 words for the opening, another 150 words for the conclusion. Therefore you have 1,500 minus 300 words for the essay, or 1,200. If you have ten points, that means you have 120 words per paragraph to make your points. It is that easy. And when writing, remember, no one is going to be impressed by you trying to sound clever. Your lecturers marking your work will want to know what you are thinking, how your mind works through a logical series of steps to get to the end. And they want to do that in quick time so that they can go home to their wife, children, and favourite soap. So keep your language simple, clear and direct. Be concise. Pretend you are writing for a teenager, not a lecturer. Keep the words short, the sentences short, and you will get marks just for saving excessive brain power on the part of your lecturer. ",
