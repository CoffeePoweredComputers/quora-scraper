            "answer_text": "There is an old theory that the question mark evolved from the latin \"quaestio\" for question.  The theory goes that early scribes would place \"quaestio\" after a sentence to denote it was a question, then shortened it to \"qo\", then wrote the q over the o, and it evolved into a question mark :  While an interesting theory there's no good evidence for it - there are no known scripts that employ the \"q over o\" technique. Another account states that the earliest version of a question mark was a dot followed by a \"lightning\" mark, that would look similar to a dot followed by a tilde.  There are known examples of its usage :  It's easy to imagine how this \"dot tilde\" punctuation could have morphed into the familiar question mark that we use today.   ",
