            "answer_text": "There are several aspects to this: How hard is it to become a CA or CPA? Answer: it\u2019s difficult. You have to master a lot of disciplines, including accounting, finance, tax law, general business law and regulation, financial planning, investments, IT, business strategy and management. Lot\u2019s of study, lots of discipline. Then you have to demonstrate that you have this knowledge by passing a difficult multi part examination, full of trick questions.Once you have passed the exam, you still don\u2019t know much other than theory and book learning. As the saying goes, \u201c in theory, real life and theory are the same, in real life, they are different.\u201d When you enter into the CA / CPA profession, it will take several years of apprenticeship to begin to master the real life challenges of being a CA or CPA.Just when you think you have a grasp on things, you\u2019ll realize that the accounting and tax fields change constantly, and you have to spend lots of time just keeping up.Contrary to all the stereotypes, accounting and taxation is NOT boring. It\u2019s actually quite intellectually stimulating and very challenging. If you are not smart, you won\u2019t survive, no matter how good you are at cramming for a test. Every day is filled with new challenges and different problems. If you want same-old, same old, look for a bookkeeping job. By the way, in a few years those will all be automated.The biggest shock you will find is that being a CPA / CA requires good marketing skills. You must market yourself and your firm. You have to be able to sell your suggestions and ideas to people who have little idea of what you are talking about. You have to be sincere and convincing, and able to translate difficult and obtuse concepts and rules into simple explanations without sounding like you are talking down to people.Another shock you will be in for is that you train to be a technical expert, but after a couple of years, the skills that are most important are the ability to manage people and execute operational plans. If you are an auditor, you may have 3 - 500 people working with you. If you are a tax accountant, you may have 1 - 50 people working with you. Can you be a leader? Shy and retiring won\u2019t hack it.The most successful accountants are decent technicians, but excellent business people. They can relate well to people, gain the confidence of clients to the point that they are recommended, they can associate well with business leaders and business owners, and they know how to bring in and keep the business.In short, I would say that the field of Chartered Accountancy / Certified Public Accountancy is very challenging. On the other hand, it is very rewarding, and those who excel are rewarded in many ways, not the least of which is financially. ",

            "answer_text": "CA is not difficult because of low passing percentage; it becomes tough because aspirants get stuck in the later stage of CA. Enrolling yourself for CA is easy; the real challenge is passing out. Discipline and right attitude can help you reach unattainable goal and make things simpler. CA course is difficult as the syllabus is vast. Clearing all the levels of CA needs average intelligence combined with plenty of hard work. So does UPSC. But people clear it too. So nothing is difficult if we have the right attitude. It is completely in contrast to engineering as the challenge there is to get into some good college and not passing out. Many CA aspirants get stuck in the studies phase. This may become very frustrating as after a certain age, the career opportunities available become limited. Unlike engineering, medical or management course, CA is a distance learning course. No college provides knowledge on the subject. The CA students have to study all by themselves. But only a handful of students pass the exam this way. So many students choose to take up coaching classes. There are many coaching classes available for CA but these classes cannot be compared with colleges. CA is not at all difficult for those who are willing to invest their time and give up something. 1. Invest your time: CA is just like your girlfriend who demands more time from you for being happy. This means that the more time you invest and attention you pay is directly proportional to your own happiness. As you gather a lot of information about likes and dislikes of your girlfriend, you need to do same with CA. You should research and plan things accordingly to get great dividends. 2. Give up somethings: The weirdest thing about CA is that once you enroll in it, you need to stop somewhere in your lifestyle. This takes away directly 5 years of your life. You should persevere for some time to get greater benefits.  Keep working for this face! Best of Luck! ",
