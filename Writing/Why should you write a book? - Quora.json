            "answer_text": "Question: should everyone write a book? Everybody has a story. Each story can be can either be inspiring or a learning experience - either in what not to do or what to do. Furthermore, even if most people are bad writers, a good ghost-writer / editor can work with just about any text to coax it into a readable work. Does this mean everybody should write a book about their life\u2019s stories or a fictional plot? Nope. \u2018Should\u2019 is one of those \u2018it\u2019s a good idea / it\u2019s an idea\u2019 qualifiers. Nothing is going to happen with a should. Let me explain: Forcing people to expose their experiences / ideas on paper is a chore. Most writers write because they feel compelled to. It\u2019s a long process that takes enormous chunks of time out of one\u2019s life, away from earning a salary, away from spending time with kids and family, etc. In telling one\u2019s life story, one also makes oneself vulnerable, both in everybody knowing your history, opening you up to insults and further hurts from haters and bullies, and to possible lawsuits from people or companies who feel they have been defamed. Most writers sell on average about 200 books, once they\u2019ve written one. In this situation, the costs are usually much larger than the financial benefits. Frankly, most people have better things to do. If a person feels like telling elements of their life stories, they can and do do so in ordinary conversation with (hopefully) interested parties. They can answer questions on Quora. They can talk into a recorder or a camera about their lives so that after they\u2019re gone, their families have something of them still. (In fact, Steven Spielburg sent teams around the world to document survivors\u2019 experiences of the Holocaust for posterity.) People can sew a story quilt, create photobooks, writer letters or e-mails, post on Facebook or another forum\u2026 frankly the list of how people can tell their stories in the way that appeals to them the most, are endless. I think that all of us, if we choose to, can greatly benefit from other people\u2019s stories. This does not mean that each person should write a book, though. ",

If you talk about an issue and chip in, \u201cWell, I wrote a book about it\u201d, people will listen to you.You\u2019ll die but the book will stay. It is your legacy.Having a book published is the perfect excuse to indulge in social media. \u201cWhy do you spend so much time on Facebook, Instagram, Quora?\u201d \u201cWell honey, I\u2019m promoting my book!\u201d[1]There\u2019s something extremely satisfying to it when you see your own book displayed in your favorite bookstore.You get to know a lot of interesting people: other writers, poets, booklovers. People you would never have met without your book and who enrich your life.People will think you\u2019re smart. You wrote a book, after all.Book fairs and book promotions (where you'll get invited to a lot) are fun!If someone asks you stupid questions about your life, you can refer them to your book: \u201cIf you really want to know, there\u2019s my bio at the back of my last novel.\u201dBook writing is a challenge. You\u2019ll become extremely frustrated at one point, but it\u2019s worth it. The day you finish your first book will be one of the happiest and most momentous days of your life.I know, they say you shouldn't start writing a book for selfish reasons, but I don't buy that. If you need to dream of becoming a famous author who gets laid a lot to finish the first pages of your book, then why not? You probably won't pull that off anyway, but there's no harm done dreaming about it.
