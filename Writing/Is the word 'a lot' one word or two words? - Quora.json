            "answer_text": "Right now, a lot is supposed to be written as two words. But so many people write it as one word that it may become recognized as a single word at some point in the future. There isn\u2019t really any reason why it couldn\u2019t be a single word except for how we understand it at this moment in the history of the language In American English, the word lot used in this way only goes with the word a. In British English, you might see the lot or you lot, as in I don't know how I'm meant to act with all of you lot. The only other form in American English is lots. (maybe lotta or lotsa) When words uniquely go together like this, there is a tendency for them to be smashed into a single word, like with ahold and maybe. So maybe it will become one word someday, but we\u2019re not there yet. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey, Hannah. Thank you for your question. Come, let\u2019s have a look at it. Is the word \"a lot\" one word or two words? A lot is two words e.g. I do not have a lot of money, that\u2019s it! When it comes to the one word of a lot it becomes \u2018allot\u2019 e.g. \"equal time was allotted to each\" i.e. give or apportion (something) to someone. synonyms: Allocate, assign, issue, award, grant, administer or devote. I trust that will help to distinguish between the two. Good luck. Kind regards, Bye. ",
