            "answer_text": "There are many reasons to be interested in linear transformations. I'm only gonna mention 3. Firstly we apply linear transformation to vector spaces because they're exactly the maps which preserve the natural structure of vector spaces. They let us answer questions like when are two vector spaces the same? This is vital to our understanding of vector spaces. Secondly we like to use linear transformations because in the grand scheme of things they're really simple. They have really nice theory about kernels and domains and many other nice properties. They're even relatively well behaved when we start to introduce infinite dimensional spaces. Integration and differentiation for example are linear transformations on appropriate vector spaces. If we can reduce something to a problem involving only linear transformations we can exploit these properties to solve it. One of my lectures often says if can reduce something to linear algebra it's as good as solved. This is perhaps a bit far, but certainly there's some truth to it. Finally, many many many things in real life are linear. As I mentioned integration and differentiation are linear, but many physical systems can be thought of as linear systems. Most PDE theory for example takes place in vector spaces because we want to use the natural linear structures on them. ",
