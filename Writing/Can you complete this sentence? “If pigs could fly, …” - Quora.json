But apparently that may not be the case. Or perhaps you are curious about the extent of my wit. Instead of adding to the stash of illustrative examples already given, I will offer you a link that explains beautifully the origin of the expression: If wishes were horses, beggars would ride - Wikipedia Cheers!

That\u2019s all I remember. Sometimes the saying is used more prosaically in everyday speech, something like ; He\u2019ll marry her when pigs can fly\u2019, and so forth. ",
