            "answer_text": "I wouldn't bother unless it's required by the department/graduate program you are applying to. I would rather spend some time in understanding the research work of the potential PhD supervisor. It's very unlikely that good functional research groups would wait for new graduate students' research proposals or ideas to run the lab. Read his/her recent publications so that you can say what they want to hear from you. Also, think thoroughly and make sure you have an answer to this question. Great that you have read our XYZ paper(s). What do you think we should do next? If you could answer that, you would have a proposal already :) Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "One of the best way to get the attention of potential supervisors is to put into perspective your experience and research interests/goals with potential supervisor expertise. To do this, two things are required : know what are your research interests/goals. In this respect, writing a research proposal could significantly help you structure your questions, hypothesis and potential experiments/solutions.understand expertise/research interests of potential supervisor by going through their work (publications), personal website and/or profiles at their institution website. Summarizing their work can be though and I design a free tool to help you get the gist of publications at Researchout Toolbox.You could find a detail description of what to do to contact potential PhD supervisors in the paper : How to approach supervisors for research opportunities ",
