            "answer_text": "The first task you have is to organise your thoughts to form a kind of outline. Let\u2019s say you wish to write a formal report outlining the challenges of choosing an operating system for a new computer installation. You will want to describe the new computer installation (its purpose, size, any other factors). You might then want to describe the challenges it needs to meet (say, real-time operating, large number of users, etc.). Then you might want to describe any candidate operating systems, with their pros and cons for your situation. Get these ideas into a sensible order to form a good outline. In writing the report, your first paragraph should describe the problem you are seeking to report on: new computer installation of such-and-such a size, approximate number of users, type of use (real-time, transactional), and state that there are X candidate operating systems for such an installation. Subsequent paragraphs (or sections) should take each of these sub-topics and make one the topic of each paragraph or section, if this is a very long report. Once all that is out of the way, you then need to discuss candidate operating system(s) with the pros and cons of each (one paragraph or section for each). Finally, you should present your conclusions, which might be that X and Y candidate OSs are suitable, and while Z is also suitable it is very expensive (or whatever you find). End with a paragraph or small section that summarises everything again. It might look rather like your first paragraph/section. There is an old rule about this kind of report: tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them. It\u2019s a good rule. Use more formal language in writing. Avoid, if you can, contractions like can\u2019t instead of cannot, and check your use of specialist terminology to make sure it\u2019s accurate and, if necessary, you\u2019ve defined these terms somewhere in the document. Also avoid (PLEASE) the over-use of the passive voice! It\u2019s perfectly proper to say something like: \u201cOn investigation of system X, I found that \u2026\u201d instead of \u201cIt was found on investigation of system X that \u2026\u201d Try to keep as much as possible to plain English rather than try to sound \u201cfancy\u201d. Keep sentences relatively short, but avoid making your report sound like a collection of bullet points. Pay attention to spelling and punctuation. Don\u2019t be afraid to use white space (for example a blank line between paragraphs, ample margins, etc.). Make your report as easy on the eye as you can. ",
