Doesn\u2019t seem to be the type who sits at home signing fan mail. Most likely if you go to an event he is at you might manage to quickly ask him as he is passing. I haven\u2019t heard friends mention he goes to events though. You can of course do \u201ccrazy effort\u201d stuff and try, but he\u2019s not like Mark Cuban who has time for folk (from what I can derive). ",
