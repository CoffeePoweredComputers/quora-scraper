            "answer_text": "I'm not going to feel ashamed for writing fanfiction.  My family was embarrassed for a while, that I had such a \"juvenile\" hobby when I could be doing \"something more productive.\"  They eventually learned that other people--college friends, admired authors--wrote and read it too.  One of my friends took hers a step further and submitted a screenplay to \"Star Trek:The Next Generation.\"   She got it back covered with coffee stains and a nice letter indicating the reasons why it was rejected. All those movies of Cinderella, and Snow White and so on that Disney did?  fanfiction on the screen.  Sherlock Holmes parodies, movies, and television shows are fanfiction.  There are novels and comic books that started out as fanfics. Also,  Rowling backs Potter fan fiction This, from Fanfic - TV Tropes: The distinction between fanfic and original fiction, as we know it today, is largely created by modern copyright law; much of classical writing is actually \"fanfiction\" based on older sources. The major distinction between fanfic and a story inspired by another story is that the story a fanfic is based on has one or more \"official\" versions, usually owned by a company, a creator, or both. Thus, things like The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, a piece of biblical apocrypha featuring Angry!Uber!Baby Jesus, or variations on Arthurian legend where there is no Holy Grail and Lancelot's affair with Guinevere never happens, would not \"count\" by this definition. No statement on the legality of fanfic has ever been given in American formal law or in its courts. Some argue that it's a form of copyright infringement; however, see \"Legal Fictions: Copyright, Fan Fiction, and a New Common Law\", and note the above precedents. The two most common arguments for fanfic being legal involve either implied consent - companies and authors have every right to enact a Fanwork Ban as evidenced by http://fanfiction.net's banlist but are mostly tolerant - or fair use - the non-profit, educational and transformative use of the work justifies its existence. The latter is the main argument that sparked the development of the Organization of Transformative Works, a fan labor advocacy site.    fanart by Robin Wood, of \"The Masterharper of P.E.R.N.\" ",

I do know that many people for reasons that I will forever fail to understand detest fanfiction, but\u2026 Do fan-artists feel ashamed for being \u2018so uncreative\u2019 as to drawing their favourite chars, instead of trying to be the next van Gogh, Picasso\u2026? Do aspiring musicians feel ashamed for covering their favorite band\u2019s songs? Or create original music for their favorite franchise? Nope. A lot of people love what these guys/girls are doing. The difference is that it\u2019s easier to publish work that is subpar, and have it reach a certain audience. Could just be down to the incompetence of certain websites to implement features that seperate good from bad work, but ah well. Leads people to see the bad work just as much, so everyone thinks that every fanfiction is badly written. But, back to the topic. I myself have written horrible, horrible stories, some that I have published and that have (rightfully) received no attention, some I have kept on my harddrive on this day, knowing that I will likely never publish them. And you know what? I don\u2019t regret it. It\u2019s my joy to write it, so everyone who thinks I\u2019m wasting time may go\u2026 you know how this sentence ends. ",

Should someone who strums on a guitar for fun be ashamed of it? Should someone who collects coins be ashamed of it? Absolutely not. It\u2019s a hobby. It\u2019s something to do with your free time and if you like doing it, then keep doing it and to hell with anyone who tells you you\u2019re wrong. ",

And by the way, you can make a living off of writing now seemingly on Wattpad Futures and publishing them as ebooks would do too if your writing was pretty good then it\u2019s possible :) and there\u2019s always room for improving.
