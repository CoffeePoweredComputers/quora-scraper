            "answer_text": "\u201cMailing address\" is by definition where you receive mail. If I wish to send you a letter, this is what i write on the envelope. It may be the same as your physical address, which is where you are living, but it needn't be. I could receive mail at a post office box (fairly common), or at my ex-wife's house (fairly foolish), or at a commercial facility established for this purpose. Often, the commercial courier services such as FedEx and UPS cannot deliver to a post office box, which is one of the advantages of the commercial facilities. Either one works well if you dont want to give out your physical address, or if you receive enough mail that it would be awkward, or if security of your mailbox is an issue, or if you want an assistant to pick up the mail, given the key. There could be other reasons. But \u201cmailing address\" just lets that address be different if you want it to be. ",

In many cases, for many people, they receive their mails at home where they live, so they use their home address, or known as physical address, as their mailing address, which is very common, perfectly valid and legal.
