Add an unthought of twist - As you start writing and have reached a stage, include the most bizzare thing you can imagine. Spend a few chapters describing it. Do this much and it's a decent read. Of all that you've written it, you can always share it with me. Shall try to help you how you can make it better anf give you an honest and true review Thanks :) ",
