            "answer_text": "Many excellent answers here. The wary student should take note: throughout most of the world where these characters are used, the printed versions are pretty much constant - in that all geographical locations have a wide variation but most of the variants are known everywhere. However, cursive (handwritten, joined-up) letters vary from country to country. In the early twentieth century, there was a very wide variety of scripts used - in some countries more than one cursive script existed. In the mid twentieth century, many countries \u2018rationalized\u2019 this by creating a standard cursive script to be used by all. But while some countries revised the way certain letters were written to make them easier to read, others did not. As a result, modern cursive in the UK (when the handwriting is reasonably clear) can be read the world over, because all the characters closely resemble the same characters in print (with the exception of the letter \u2018a\u2019 where most typefaces continue to use what I call the \u201cstupid inverted letter e\u201d). However modern cursive French can be quite difficult for non-natives to read (I speak and read fluently in French, but did not learn to read and write here). This is especially true of the lowercase \u2018r\u2019 and \u2018s.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, the letters in the diagram you posted are correct. But there is also variation in the way people write. These shapes are not quite the same as the ones I was taught in school in the U.S. Many people don't add the little curls like the one at the bottom of the lower-case L. Some people put a crossbar at the top of the capital J, or a short horizontal line in the middle of the Z. My upper-case G includes a horizontal line instead of the vertical one in  your illustration. And so forth. All of these variations are allowed, because people can still read the letters. If you make your letters this way, people will be able to read them. If you are reading someone else's handwriting, the letters will look somewhat different, but should still be recognizable. And I will point out, in case you don't know, that this is only one way of writing English. This is called printing. The other way is called cursive writing. In cursive, the letters are joined, so you can write an entire word without lifting the pen (except to go back to add dots or lines to certain letters).  ",
