            "answer_text": "'Contents' is used to refer to countable parts that constitute something, such as a bag (countable stuff e.g. cans, books etc.), a letter (countable lines), a book (countable sections and chapters) etc.While 'content' is used for uncountable parts that constitute something, such as the subject matter of a speech, programme or a book etc. (subject matter is indefinite e.g. Chemistry) or the amount of a substance in a drink (caffeinated, alcoholic etc.) , a food (fat, carbohydrate), the character of a person (humble, arrogant etc.).If 'contents' has been used in the above context, it is grammatically correct. Just remember to judge if the parts are countable or uncountable, and then used 'contents' or 'content' respectively. P.S. 'Content' may also mean satisfaction or happiness. However, in this context, it is not applicable. ",
