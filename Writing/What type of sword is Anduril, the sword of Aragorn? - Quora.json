            "answer_text": "After doing all the delving into Middle-Earth history and technology I could and I'm actually inclined to believe that And\u00faril is accurately depicted in the films as a long sword and here's why.  First Narsil was forged by Telchar in the depths of time likely to be a part of Thingol's hoard The Dwarves and Elves of this time were incredibly advanced so that Telchar made a long sword is in the realm of possible. And\u00faril is specifically called a long sword by Professor Tolkien himself \u201cThe Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had And\u00faril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brown. as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a long sword, in fashion like And\u00faril but of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war-horn.\u201d The Ring Goes South. the Return of the King. And\u00faril is also described as a great sword which has often been a common name for a large long sword (or a War Sword). Particularly the Oakeshott type XIIa which And\u00faril shown in the Return of the King is. \u201dThere a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man, a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. As they drew near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of face, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey.\u201d The Field of Cormallen, The Return of the King. Yes Aragorn, obtains a shield however he never actually uses it in the text and it was just as likely that he took it with the intention of using it while mounted, and had no use for it when the host of Theoden king decided to fight at Helm\u2019s Deep rather than ride to open battle, Aragorn would have only been able use And\u00faril one handed while mounted, but would have been able to still hold the reins of his horse with a shield in his off-hand. Aragorn could have used And\u00faril with a shield even if it was a long sword although the practice was very uncommon it was done, and may have been necessary when the greater defence offered by a shield when armour was not enough like Boromir\u2019s adventure to Rivendell might have presented. And\u00faril was first known as Narsil who\u2019s first known owner was Elendil a 7 foot 7 inch man so unless he preferred short swords Narsil would likely have been designed to be closer to his and his ancestors comfort than his descendants. The argument that the Lord of the Rings level of technology never advanced beyond something comparable to that of 1066 Europe never sits right with me this is often referenced to letter 211, but the quote that is used is only in reference to the Rohirrim and only the Rohirrim who were based on Dark Ages Anglo-Saxons and were perhaps one of the least advanced races in Middle-Earth. Professor Tolkien view the Gondorians and D\u00fanedain in a much more romantic Arthurian inspiration. Another argument is clocks the Hobbits are a simple people and they have clocks \u201cBilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit\u2019s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.\u201d A Long-Expected Party- Fellowship of the Ring - J.R.R Tolkien Clocks are a 14th century invention, a long sword like And\u00faril appears to be an Oakeshott XIIa that appears in the mid-13th century. Oakeshott typology - Wikipedia As for the runes they put on the blade they actually fit surprisingly The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and the light of the moon shone cold, its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And\u00faril, Flame of the West - The Ring goes south, The Fellowship of the Ring My last piece of evidence is this  This is the most consistent look for Excalibur for the better part of the last 550 years from medieval art to modern movies, the blade of King Arthur. The sword that was the inspiration for And\u00faril, for they are both blades from the depths of time. Both have amazing scabbards that give some kind of cool power (I'd prefer Excalibur's), glow with magical light, both are the sword of Kings. Not to mention the huge similarities between Aragorn and Arthur themselves. Tolkien himself loved Arthurian legend. In some stories Excalibur breaks in two and is repaired. The blades forged by Telchar cut through iron like greenwood And\u00faril shows this power \u201cAnd\u00faril came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head.\u201d - The Bridge of Khazad-D\u00fbm, The Fellowship of the Ring. Much like Excalibur \u201c it is stated, \"for at his belt hung Excalibur the finest sword that there was, which sliced through iron as through wood\u201d  (Still more than enough room on the hilt for a second hand)  ",

            "answer_text": "An arming sword. As far as I know, it\u2019s not described in any detail in the books, but Tolkien based his world very closely on early medieval England, particularly pre-Norman. As a language historian and a great stickler for detail, we can be confident that what Tolkien had in mind would be historically appropriate, not a bizarre and impractical typical fantasy sword. During that period (< 1066 AD), arming swords were just about the only common variety (unless you\u2019d like to make a distinction between them and \u201cViking\u201d or \u201cMigration Era\u201d swords; personally I would consider that splitting hairs). Metallurgy did not support the longer and narrower blades which became popular in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance (longswords, great swords, rapiers and the various cut-and-thrust swords descended from the rapier, falchions, sabers, etc). There were seaxes, some of which were big enough to count as swords, but for a noble that would be a half-measure. For a good contemporary illustration of the kinds of swords used, we have the Bayeux Tapestry; here\u2019s a detail showing a sword:  Visual adaptations such as the Lord of the Rings movies have sometimes been more generous. That\u2019s not impossible; in Tolkien\u2019s world, elves were master crafters in metal, so it\u2019s reasonable that they could make something like a longsword. But since those came well after the period he loved so much, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what was in his head. I\u2019m not an expert on Tolkien, so I hope someone more familiar with his extended body of work can cite something more certain! Edit: as far as a specific Oakeshott classification, only the type X was common in the pre-Norman period. ",
