            "answer_text": "This short infographic below will show you that writing a cover letter is a lot simpler than you might think.  There are 7 key steps: 1. Don\u2019t underestimate the Cover letter headline When in doubt, try to use this formula: Number or Trigger word + Adjective + Keyword + Promise. The result can look something like this: 5 Ways I Can Help You Improve Your Company\u2019s [insert a position-related keyword] 2. Make sure you use a correct form of greeting In this time and age, there\u2019s no excuse for using \u201cTo Whom It May Concern.\u201d You\u2019re expected to research the name of the recruiter or the hiring manager online. Even when you are totally unable to find the recruiter\u2019s name, it\u2019s better to use other forms: Formal setting: Dear Sir/ Madam, Dear Sir or Madam, Dear Dr Smith, Dear Mrs/ Ms. MorrisInformal setting: Dear Jane, Dear John Smith,3. Paragraph 1: Introduce yourself with a BANG! Open strong. Explain why this job is exciting to you and why you\u2019re the right person for it. Open with something like \u201cI\u2019m a content marketing professional with more than 5 years of experience and I\u2019d love to bring my ability and passion to your team.\u201d Compliment the company. Demonstrate appreciation for what the company does \u2014 not only will this compliment them, it will also provide them with insight as for who you are. 4. Paragraph 2: Why you\u2019re a great fit for the company Write a short summary of your career and skills, tailored to fit the company you\u2019re approaching. You did your research, now ask yourself these questions: What did you do at a previous position that gave you relevant experience?How could this experience help the new company grow?Which of the projects you have worked on would benefit their business?Which of your skills make you well-equipped for the position?Does any of these skills give you an edge over other candidates?5. Paragraph 3: Why the company is a great fit for you. In this paragraph you want to show that you\u2019re serious about developing your career at this new company. Good companies want to know why do they appeal to you and how will your professional relationship be mutually beneficial. Consider the following questions: What excites you about the prospect of working at this company?How do the company goals and align with your own?What do you hope to gain and learn from working there?6. Closing paragraph: Finish strong and stay in touch In one or two sentences reiterate that your experience and enthusiasm make you a great candidate. This is to emphasise the two main points from the previous paragraphs. Don\u2019t finish by simply saying you\u2019ll get in touch. Explain when and how you\u2019ll be contacting them; especially if the job is a step forward in your career 7. How do you send a cover letter? I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2014 don\u2019t send your cover letter as a document attached to your email. Put it inside the body of the email. The email is your cover letter! This way it won\u2019t get ignored. ",

            "answer_text": "Cover letters are rough. But if you think of it like\u2026 a movie trailer. The movie trailer is what pulls people in, gets them interested and excited about watching the movie, right? That\u2019s what your cover letter should do. It\u2019s where you sell yourself to your prospective employer. You want them to get excited about reading your resume (watching the movie). With so many applicants for today\u2019s jobs, hiring managers will sometimes not even look at a resume, unless the cover letter grabs their attention. So your cover letter is your make or break introduction of yourself. Some don\u2019ts\u2026 Do not attach your picture to your cover letter/resume - you should be hire-able based on your qualifications, not on your looks\u2026unless it\u2019s a job that requires a certain look (modeling for instance). Do not\u2026 add perfume, or glitter, or whimsical font\u2026 For one, some people are allergic to perfume, don\u2019t make a prospective employer sick\u2026 two, glitter is just bad\u2026 it gets and sticks everywhere, and is hard to clean!\u2026 for the font, unless perhaps you are seeking a job in a a creative field.. even then, you should still appear professional, and let your resume and portfolio speak for yourself. A cover letter is an introduction of who you are and what you bring to the table. Here\u2019s a basic example of a cover letter\u2026this is for one where the job application was solicited, due to an advertised position. Dear Ms. Smith: Your job announcement for Quora commentator came to my attention through your posting on the RateMyJob website. I am eager to talk to you about joining the Community of Quora in this capacity. I believe my skills and experience make me a strong candidate for this position.

May I have the opportunity to discuss the position and my qualifications with you? Please call me at the number above to arrange a time when we can meet. Like I said, it\u2019s just basic, but good to get started with. You can read this article for more insight: How to Write a Cover Letter \u2026 and just search on the internet to get more input.

            "answer_text": "This is the best cover letter that ever worked for me. Employers that read them see your qualifications right away. It gets to the point and doesn\u2019t make the employer have to think or evaluate and/or most importantly, read. It\u2019s most effective for responding to a post. Let\u2019s start with the name. The font is enlarged and in bold. I use only my first and last name. Don\u2019t use your middle name or an initial those can be distracting.Street address is optional, although just the city is sufficient.I put my cell phone number first because that will be the number I respond to the most. Using a home phone number will show that you are at an established address and the fact that the area code will reinforce that you live in that city.The present date tells the employer you have recently drafted up the cover letter.Here, I addressed the employer. If you can get a contact name, that could make it more intimate and personal.The first paragraph states the purpose that you are responding to a job post. It\u2019s important to include the job position as the employer may have multiple postings.I created two columns: 1) Your Requirements 2) My Qualifications. Under Your Requirements, you should add their requirements exactly word for word from the posting. Under My Qualifications, respond to their requirements. One rule of thumb is that if you have at least 70% of their requirements you would qualify for that job. If you don\u2019t quite have that qualification, then you need to clarify how you are qualified to do that qualification. The requirements may not always exactly match your qualification, however, you can find parallels or transferable skills to meet those requirements.Lastly, thank them for your time.There are six different types of cover letters. This one is most appropriate for responding to job postings.  ",

            "answer_text": "Among the least favorable tasks in a job search, writing a cover letter probably takes the cake. And while the myth may be that hiring managers don\u2019t read cover letters, you certainly don\u2019t want to take that chance! However, it can be difficult to know how to get started, or what any individual employer may want to read. But, one of the best approaches to writing an effective cover letter is the pain point method. What\u2019s the pain point method? Well, for any employer looking to make a great hire, what they\u2019re really looking for is someone who can solve a current problem for them. When you figure out what that pain point is, and you present yourself as a solution to the problem, the employer will probably want to hear more. But how do you begin to write such a cover letter? Read on below for how you can get started: Do your research Finding the pain point that you can address may require more than your typical company research prior to an application. In addition to thoroughly reviewing the company website, take a look at social media channels, as well as company reviews. Depending on the role, one of these may be more important than the others. For a customer-facing role, you may want to look closer at company reviews, while a sales or marketing role may mean reviewing the website and social media more. Regardless of the role, it is important that you acquire a deep understanding of that aspect of the business to pinpoint the right issue to address. Consider your best skills Now, this isn\u2019t just about finding a problem, it\u2019s about finding a problem that you can solve in this role. As a result, consider carefully how your unique skill set fits into the role, and where you would imagine you\u2019re the most beneficial. Once you figure that out, the pain point that you should address may seem more obvious. For example, if you pride yourself on productivity in the workplace, you may look for evidence that the department is unable to keep up with their projects. Find the pain point Now that you know how you can best help the team, be on the lookout for how that solves a problem for your potential employer. Keep in mind, this may be a really obvious issue, and you may not have to search very hard to find it\u2014employers may even describe a critical problem somewhere in the job description. While there\u2019s no hard and fast rule to find what is irking your potential manager, you\u2019ll know it when you see it. Use past examples Now that you know what this employer is struggling with and how you\u2019re uniquely equipped to solve it, you need to demonstrate that you\u2019ve solved a problem like this before with a past example. For instance, using the productivity pain point, you might say something like this: \u201cBecause I was able to increase productivity X amount in my previous role at Y Company, I know I am ready to take on the challenge of increasing productivity at your organization by streamlining the workflow processes and setting competitive goals.\u201d Make it the focal point As you write your letter, be sure that the pain point and your solution is the main topic of discussion. Keep in mind that it\u2019s not only about simply communicating this information, but doing so convincingly. When the hiring manager finishes reading the letter, they should be left with the impression that you can confidently solve their problem. ",

            "answer_text": "A cover letter is a one-page document that you send to recruiters, along with your resume. It gives the recruiter an introduction of yourself, and explains why you\u2019re interested in the job. It should also tell the recruiter why you think you\u2019d be a good fit for the company. Think of it as a one-page advertisement of yourself that you get to show your recruiter. You need to make it count. Introducing yourself If you don\u2019t tell the recruiter who you are, your chances of catching their interest are low. I mean, put yourselves in the shoes of a recruiter. Imagine receiving an application that doesn\u2019t even have a name or self-introduction. It only contains a few scribbles about his or her education and job experience. Would you be interested in hiring this mystery person you know absolutely nothing about? Probably not, right? Elaborate on your experiences Yes, the resume already contains an overview of your past experience and educational background, but that is all it is. An overview. In your cover letter, you can expand on these points, giving more details on your performance at the previous job you had, or the extracurricular activities you took up in school. Don\u2019t just list out experiences again \u2013 pick one or two memorable ones and talk about them in detail. Explain why you are suitable for the job Don\u2019t just go on and on about yourself. Talk about the company, and why it would be better off if you were to become a member of its staff. Make it all about them, and what you could potentially do for them. Draw the relevant links between your experience and skills, and what the company needs. This is what the recruiter is interested in. They only want to know who you are and what you can do in relation to the company itself.

You want to convey enthusiasm about the job and knowledge about the company.Address any obvious questions. For example, if you are living in San Diego and applying for a position in Seattle, you might say, \u201cI am planning a household relocation, will not request relocation assistance, and will be available to start on (date).\u201dAsk for the interview and say, \u201cThank you.\u201dIf you want to show your pro moves, a short paragraph about your professional qualities and characteristics that are relevant to the new role can help. Reference the job vacancy announcement to show you read it and understand what they want. If you follow this outline, keep it concise, and produce an error-free letter, you will be fine. Two final tips: Your cover letter introduces you and your resume, so keep your writing focused on that objective. DO NOT summarize your resume; that is redundant and a waste of everyone\u2019s time.
