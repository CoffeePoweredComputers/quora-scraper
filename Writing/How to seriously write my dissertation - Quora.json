            "answer_text": "This can be difficult and intimidating, but I think it is one of the best skills to come out doing a masters or PhD. My recommendation is to recognize some parts of the thesis will be harder than other parts of the thesis and try not to go down rabbit holes. What I usually observe is that the big picture stuff can be the hardest to write, and that abstract almost always needs to be rewritten again after the thesis is written.   It can really help to think that you are trying to tell a story to someone, but like all good stories the way it is told is not necessarily linear. A thesis is not a chronology of what you did, but rather an argument to convince a committee that you have a good explanation for your hypothesis.   There may have been missteps or detours along the way, but you don't necessarily need to include every detail of how you got to the end. The thesis should be relatively compact story, how you actually got there may not have been. It is also about organization and discipline.  Have a target of 3-5 pages a day and in 30-40 days you have a thick stack of paper. Not every page takes equal time.   How you do that is up to you. Some like a very quiet isolated place to work. Some like to walk around when they are thinking, Some like to talk with others and get feedback about what they wrote, some are scared to death that others will read what they wrote until it is perfect.  It takes all types, there is no absolutely correct way but the following can help. 1). There should be a good example that you can follow for format, most grad schools will have a template. You can also look at previous students thesis, not to plagiarize, but to understand how they are put together and what style of thesis fits your type of research. 2)Write an outline, for each bullet estimate the number of pages it seems trivial, but it is important. It helps break things down into bite size pieces.  Abstract, acknowledgements etc. (you can write some about this early, but most likely will rewrite at the end anyway.)I. 5 pages introduction to the areaII. 20 page literature reviewIII. 15 page theory of xIV. 15 page description of equipment usedV.  20 pages experiments performedVI.  15 pages analysis of experimental resultsVII. 5 pages ConclusionsVIII 5 pages of Future WorkReferences, Appendix, etc. ( Think about what people would need to know to repeat your research. what would be helpful etc. ) 3) Write around your figures and data. This depends on the field but sometimes the thesis can really be summed up is a few figures. It can also save a bit of writing.  In the literature review, rather than discussing what has happened over the last thirty years there may be a graphs that you cite and write around as shows visually what might be burdensome to write about. It can allow you to analyze and synthesize how your research fits into the state of the art and let the reader know how your research fits in.  4) Have a method to collect and store reference citations, there are several tools out there some are often provided by the university library, or can be bought.  5)The literature review can be a hard to write, because often people will discover that they don't know as much as they thought they did, or find that someone else did a similar experiment and will get worried. Put some boundaries on the literature review in terms of scope. Other people doing similar work is not usually a problem, it usually puts your research into context. Of course you will want to be able to explain why you get different results.  Don't be afraid to overcite, it is always easier to remove references later when editing. 6) The experimental work can often be easier to get on paper once you start writing, since it can be more of a first I did this , then I did that kind of writing. That can help build some confidence and help familiarize yourself with whatever tool you are using to write with.   Hope that helps. ",
