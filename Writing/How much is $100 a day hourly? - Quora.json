            "answer_text": "This is a completely unanswerable question. Do you know whether the $100.00 is in fact an hourly wage at all? It could be a flat payment where you get $100 for so many hours or the whole day or $100.00 period. So are you getting $100.00 to work an hour, a day, fifteen minutes, is it untied to an hourly wage at all? It might be royalties on a performance or payment for clicks on a website or a profit on a garage sale, a per diem, a payment to a juror for jury service, anything. Come back with more information.
