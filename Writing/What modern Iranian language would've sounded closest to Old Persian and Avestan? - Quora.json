            "answer_text": "Old Persian: The closest language to Old Persian would of course, be modern Persian. This is because modern or \u201cnew\u201d Persian descended directly from Old Persian. Old Persian morphed into the Pahlavi of the Sassanians, and then into modern Persian after the Arab invasion. However, which dialect of modern Persian is the closest? In this regard, it would have to be Dari. Dari is the dialect of Persian that is spoken in Afghanistan. The reason Dari\u2019s closeness to the ancient Persian language is due to loanwords. Other dialects of Persian, such as the Farsi of Iran and Tajiki, were heavily influenced by other languages (Arabic and French for Farsi, Arabic and Russian for Tajiki), resulting in a large number of loanwords being used. Dari however, although it has loanwords (primarily from Arabic and English), it uses far less. For example, the term for \u201ctalking\u201d in Dari is gap zadan, which comes from the Old Persian \u201cgap\u201d. However, the Farsi word is harf zadan. The word harf is a loanword from Arabic. Avestan: For Avestan, the closest language would be Pashto and other similar Eastern Iranic languages. Pashto is the language of the Pashtun people, and is regarded by many as a descendant of Avestan, which is in itself an Eastern Iranic language. For example, the Avestan word for \u201cI\u201d is Azem and in Pashto it is \u201cze\u201d. The Avestan word for horse is aspa, the Pashto word is also, aspa. Further on, \u201cten\u201d in Avestan is \u201cdasa\u201d and in Pashto it is \u201clas\u201d. ",
