That\u2019s what I did! They\u2019re close, but as of today, Nicholas Sparks is the reigning champ with 11 movies. His run started in 1999 with the maudlin \u201cMessage in a Bottle\u201d and in terms of box office and critical acceptance, peaked five years later with \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d His books have niche appeal, but that niche might be narrowing: The three lowest grossing Sparks adaptations are the most recent. Here\u2019s a list of his books that have been made into movies: Message in a bottleA walk to rememberThe notebookNights in RodantheDear JohnThe last songThe lucky oneSafe havenThe best of meThe longest rideThe choice",
