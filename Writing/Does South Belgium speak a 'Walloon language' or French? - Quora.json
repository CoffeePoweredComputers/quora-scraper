Wallonia is nowadays essentially French-speaking. Some efforts are made to conserve the Walloon language and to speak it, but those are minimal and mostly ineffective. ",

            "answer_text": "The south of Belgium speaks pretty much the French that is spoken in France but there are a few differences. Sometimes there is a little difference in accent and also the numbers 70 and 90 are in standard French : 70 = soixante-dix 90 = quatre-vingt-dix In the French speaking part of Belgium, they say 70 = septante 90 = nonante But that does not make a huge difference.
