I actually did a search and found this question to give answers :) According to me : parts of writing good lyrics Understand the basics : Like format of songwriting e.g verse chorus verse chorus bridge chours. Learn rhyming methods: eg AABB ABAB ABCB and so on. Listen to various songwriter who are known for good lyrics : bob dylan, joni mitchell, jhonny cash, lou reed, david bowie, tom waits. Read: Most budding songwriter think most of lyrical idea comes out of a melody but it actually comes out of the material you read and brainstormed along. Reading poetry literature and news not only gives you ideas and inspiration but also builds your vocabulary. And also subject matter for your song gets variety. Also paintings, art work, design, particle physics\u2026lol yeah go for theae subject matter as well. Experience : All the reading and learning basics will facilitate you to write songs, try combining your musical style. And see what you come up with. Record it on your phone, listen to it, make others listen to it ask them what they think. At this phase u might me getting serious feed backs and so take them seriously. Dont get dissapointed if people did not like it. Improve with Paitence: Keep writing songs, change your lyrical style, musical style, change rythm, change instrument, keep changing and keep experimenting , fuse concepts of lyrical styles, use serious metaphor along side wit, use similie along side cliche, make it ovious but make people guessing. Keep experimenting and finally out of pool of many songs you have wirtten select top 5 and rec them. P.S lyrics is like telling a story. So try and live a few life and translate that with tools i have mentioned above. P.P.S and do not forget to take rest some people think writing is lesuire. Not if u want to be good at it. Take few breaks and get back at it agian. Hope these advice can help u write good songs. ",

            "answer_text": "What an awesome question, which I wish many more lyricists were asking. 1) Learn all the old formal esthetics of rhymed and metered poetry. You don\u2019t have to follow those rules, at least not all the time, but they\u2019ll surely help you get the effects you\u2019re after. For example, listen to Nat King Cole\u2019s \u201cWalking My Baby Back Home\u201d and notice that word-phrases line up with note-phrases (dum-diddy-dum, \u201cGee but it\u2019s great\u201d) and the use of internal rhymes, to give the whole thing the gait of two people walking home, half-dancing, not caring if they get there soon. Or Dylan\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right\u201d with all those long vowels placed on a line that\u2019s virtually on one pitch (\u201cwhen your rooster crows at the break of dawn\u201d \u2014 ooo oh ay awww) Old-style poetics is where you start paying attention to what the words sound like, and sound is the critical thing in lyrics. \u201cBefore this river becomes an ocean, Before I pick my heart up off the floor, I\u2019ll reconsider this foolish notion\u201d \u2014 sure, Ocean and Notion rhyme, but did you catch the assonant rhyme between river and reconsider? 2) If you\u2019re writing after the music is composed, think about syntax and phrasing. Try to get the important words onto the places where the music stresses them. Remember that singing is, in a good measure, acting, and help the actor out by positioning phrases to take advantage of the tones and rhythm of the music. Listen to Sinatra\u2019s \u201cIn the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\u201d; it\u2019s a guy who lost a girl feeling bad about it at 3 am or so, and do you hear that every breath he takes is a forced sigh? That was written in the syntax and phrasing; the places where the singer takes a breath and hesitates are there in what the words do with the music. Or listen to any decent Irish band do \u201cThe Black Velvet Band\u201d and notice how all the sarcastic words about the guy\u2019s hard luck are on the UNemphasized beats; it\u2019s like he\u2019s muttering under his breath about the whole stupid situation that got him a seven-year-sentence, because the pretty girl he was hitting on turned out to be a pickpocket. 3. Have a few real feelings and see if you can make the song catch them exactly. Too many songs are just commercials for a hot-button phrase (\u201cI Write the Songs,\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the Way I Like It\u201d, \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d), or pulling up the nearest available rhyme (\u201cThe moon shines above, we\u2019re falling love\u201d \u201cYour charms, you arms\u201d that kind of thing), or maybe worst of all, leaving everything up to the listener to make sense out of. Since I mentioned \u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s All Right,\u201d compare that with \u201cJust One of Those Things\u201d, \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d and \u201cMrs. Brown You\u2019ve Got a Lovely Daughter.\u201d All four have narrators trying to stay cool and classy while their hearts break open, but it\u2019s four very different narrators \u2014 Dylan\u2019s is bitter but won\u2019t say so directly, Porter\u2019s is flippant and refusing to get sucked in to regret, Parton\u2019s is letting herself feel everything and insisting that her ex-lover know it\u2019s there, and the Herman\u2019s Hermits song is more worried about hurting his ex\u2019s feelings than he is about expressing his own. Precision, precision, precision, what feeling exactly are you capturing? Don\u2019t settle too easily. 4. While we\u2019re at it, can you make your narrator a precise someone? Who\u2019s telling this to whom? \u201cThe Streets of Laredo,\u201d Marty Robbins\u2019s \u201cRunning Gun\u201d, Elvis\u2019s \u201cIn the Ghetto,\u201d Scarface\u2019s \u201cSeen A Man Die,\u201d are all about a man dying too young for something too small, but the narrator is (in order) a casual acquaintance who just met him, the dying man himself, an all-seeing being outside the story, and a deeply understanding witness trying to report the truth. All four have the narrator they do for a reason; have a reason for your narrator too. ",
