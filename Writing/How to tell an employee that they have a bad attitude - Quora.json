            "answer_text": "Good question. Some people who simply tell the employee that the attitude is not good for business and that person needs to come in with a better attitude or you will fire him or her. Ultimately, that does nothing for society. I am not an SJW, but I think that, whenever we can, we should try to help those who are lost in one way or another. SO - this is my way; please feel free to disregard it. I would take the employee aside and try to get to know him or her before acting. Maybe the person has problems at home, or maybe with a health issue, or financial issue. Our culture can be a very negative culture at times. Look at what has happened within our society, media, etc. We have people seem to hate any people whose beliefs do not agree with theirs. These people are willing to lie and actually hurt those who do not agree with them. Our schools have nurtured resentment among many people by reducing society to those who are \u201cgood\u201d and those who are \u201cbad\u201d based on some very narrow criteria. IF you can find out what is bothering this person, maybe you can try to help the person to find the answers. She the employee kindness and patience, and then ask the person what you can do to help. You can say that you noticed that he/she is bothered, and that, from the outside, it seems like a bad attitude. Explain that a bad attitude is a workplace (or any group) is like a cancer. Hanging on to it only feeds it and makes the person more miserable. But, in a group, it can spread to other people and, eventually, create a workplace where everyone is miserable. When a person becomes that kind of \u201ccancer\u201d in a group, that person must be removed to stop the spread. This kind of thing happens in classes, sports teams, performing groups, and in the workplace. I have seen people with these bad attitudes bring others down with them. As a professor, I have seen students create such a negative situation that other students dropped out of college. If, after your best efforts and kindnesses, the person does not improve, you will need to let that person go. Again, you can simply do that tomorrow. I only make this suggestion because I believe that some people simply need to know others care. ",

            "answer_text": "Not sure if you are a peer or a manager. In general, however, you don\u2019t tell someone they have a bad attitude \u2026. you tell them what the actions or behaviors they are doing which is wrong. What does a \u201cbad attitude\u201d mean? If someone told me I had a \u201cbad attitude,\u201d I would have to go back and guess what exactly I am doing wrong so I can try to fix it. I\u2019d probably be wrong since what you consider a bad attitude may be very different than mine. So, consider the specific actions or behaviors they are exhibiting and address those. Are they complaining so much to others that their work isn\u2019t getting done? (i.e. their productivity is down?) Are they not doing what they are told? (being insubordinate?) Are they just being sloppy (not paying attention to details in their work?) By breaking down the actions and behaviors you go from a vague description to behaviors in which they can take action. Good luck! ",
