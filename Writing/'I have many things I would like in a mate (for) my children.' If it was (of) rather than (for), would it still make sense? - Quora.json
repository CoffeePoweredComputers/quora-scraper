            "answer_text": "\u201cA mate for my children\u201d sounds natural; \u201ca mate of my children\u201d does not. In the first place, the preposition \u201cfor\u201d is used to indicate that something is being done or was done for a future goal or purpose: Have you bought a gift for the newlyweds? We\u2019re looking for a car for my son. I submitted an application for the university. You\u2019d better get some new tires for your bicycle. In all of these sentences, \u201cof\u201d would be incorrect. Secondly, the \u2018s construction is usually preferred to the of construction when a person is the possessor. The professor\u2019s exams rather than the exams of the professor My wife\u2019s family rather than the family of my wife So it would sound better to say my children\u2019s mates than the mates of my children. However, since the mates are still theoretical (future), mates for my children is even better. If your children are married, then you can say, for instance, We are very fond of all of our children\u2019s mates (though our children\u2019s spouses or our children\u2019s husbands and wives or our sons and daughters-in-law would all be preferable to \u201cmates,\u201d which is likely to be misunderstood.) Here is another set of examples: I\u2019m looking for a car for my son means that my son does not yet have a car. I\u2019m looking for my son\u2019s car means that he already owns a car; I\u2019m just not sure where it is. I\u2019m looking for the car of my son is unnatural. ",

            "answer_text": "Agree w/ Claudia, spot on. The sentence is also lacking clarity. \u201cI have many things\u201d could mean that you personally possess traits that you would like to see in their mates. It also mean that you have many traits in mind, although you may or may not possess them yourself. I suspect you mean the latter. A more clear statement of that would be \u201cThere are many things I would like to see in mates for my children.\u201d ",
