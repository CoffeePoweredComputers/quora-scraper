            "answer_text": "Yes! Why not? If you don't take any initiative of showing your talents to the people then when will your writings be read? It doesn't really matter if you have followers or not. Once you start posting, people will read, critizise or appreciate and share it with others. But you shouldn't write to please people or write something that people like. You should write what you want to write or what you feel like writing. For yourself. This might sound very philosophical but when something is done with utmost dedication, hardwork and concentration, it really pays off at the end. So start showing people the abilities and amazing talents you bear! All the best! Have a great time :) ",

I myself am not on Instagram, but I would have considered posting some of my poems on it. I can understand every writer wants his writings to be accepted and appreciated, but I think, given your problem of not having a decent followership, there's nothing much you can do about it other than improving your writings and interacting with more people on Instagram. Work on your writings and gradually your followership will improve. Make your works count; make them competent. Good work doesn't remain unnoticed for long, you know. ;-) ",
