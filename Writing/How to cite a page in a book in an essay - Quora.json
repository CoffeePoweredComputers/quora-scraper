            "answer_text": "Modern Language Association (MLA) is the most commonly used when citing and writing essays and papers. To cite a page in a book in an essay, Locate the information you need to cite within the body of the essay. If all of the information in a paragraph came from the same page of the same source or contiguous pages of the same source, you only need to cite the last sentence in that paragraph. However, if you combined several sources or the information came from different or non-contiguous pages of the same source, you will need to provide a citation for each sentence or group of sentences. Locate the last name of the author and page number(s) for the information. Place the citation within parenthesis before the period of the last sentence of the information you wish to cite. If you are citing a direct quotation enclosed in quotation marks, place the citation outside the final quotation marks. Format the citation as (last name, page number). For example, information on page 29 from a book written by Ezra Kip would be written as (Kip, 29). ",
