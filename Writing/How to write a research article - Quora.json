Spend almost as long analysing your results from every possible angle. Be open to the fact that the results might not be what you are expecting, or in line with any ideology you might have. Write your method; results; discussion; conclusion; introduction; precis, in that order. Include everything. Reference everything. Identify and remove any bias, conscious or otherwise, that you might have. Get it published. Have it either accepted by, or torn apart by, the scientific community during peer review. ",
