            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A For me, technical articles are basically written for 3 things. A. To showcase your study and understanding of a particular topic. B. To put forward something new and innovative or C. To establish and reaffirm an already proven phenomenon (theoretically or otherwise). Depending on the type of article you want to write you can choose the tone required. After finishing my research, I gather all the data I have and the first thing I do is write down the inference. This gives me the guide to list down all citations, references etc. Next comes the difficult part the beginning. Its not only the most important bit of your paper but also serves as an orientation to the point(s) you are trying to make. I generally start by stating a well known fact, something very basic and elementary. After that its just about connecting the dots and if you have time I would definitely recommend through proofreading and revising at least once. This is a technique that I prefer and you should try to devise your own according to your comfort. P. S.: if you are trying to write a paper on electronics do contact me I may have a few more pointers ",

The common mistake is to write a dull first paragraph. ...Keep things brief. ...Work to a strict framework but then remove it. ...Periphrastic perambulations are anathema. ...Convey the emotion. ...Cite and acknowledge sources.",
