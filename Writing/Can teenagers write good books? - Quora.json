            "answer_text": "Yes. The argument from highly experienced people in the writing industry states that teenagers don\u2019t have enough life experience to tell a good story. Well, my argument is, \u201cWho knows more about being a teenager than a teenager?\u201d Truth is, both are valid arguments. Kids who read a lot learn how to write from reading those examples. I could explain to you how to hit a tennis ball with a racket for the better part of an hour, diagraming vectors, calculating velocities and acceleration, etc. Or, I could just pick up a racket and show you in roughly two seconds. That being said, it takes practice to perfect just how to do something. A LOT of practice. Also, just because you haven\u2019t done something doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t write about it. Just ask any science fiction author how many aliens they\u2019ve met in their lifetime. What, then, qualifies them to write about aliens in their stories? I like to point out to budding and aspiring writers that first draft manuscripts almost always suck. So don\u2019t worry about it. Just write! This is why we have editors, to help writers fix what doesn\u2019t work and turn their meanderings into an actual, readable book. Getting published might be a little harder because of your age. Agents and publishers won\u2019t take you seriously. But a good story is a good story and good writing is good writing. If it reads well, they won\u2019t care about your age. A good book will sell and make money. For story ideas that just don\u2019t work today, don\u2019t throw them away. They could become the seeds for future books when you figure out how to make them work. Robert Heinlein\u2019s first novel was For Us, The Living. It was never published; it was absolutely terrible. He wrote it in 1938, it was published in 2003, some 15 years after his death. Yet, as bad as it is, it is an amazing look into the mind of the now famous author. You can see all the different characters, ideas, and scenes that would be used to become some of his biggest and most famous novels stuffed into this one volume. Write because you enjoy it! ",

            "answer_text": "I certainly believe so. Or, I hope so. Everyone has different styles of writing, and each is unique and perfect in its own way. Plus, one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that teenagers have a very wild imagination and can seemingly imagine anything they want. And, if they're writing teen fiction or young adult, they know their genre well; they're the readers! I\u2019m a fourteen-year-old with a published fantasy novel, which has received praise multiple times. It's not big or anything, but it is published. In my life, I've written over 750,000 words with different collections of novels and stories. I have a few hit fanfictions on Wattpad as well. I tend to fight for the teens for this reason. Think of it; look how many teens have written magnificent literature works! Anne Frank, suggested earlier, wrote her journal, which is widespread and amazing. Additionally, the book Eragon was written by a fifteen-year-old. With enough practice, writing can become natural and beautiful for anyone of any age. Just Google it, and you'll find lots of different types of proof. As long as someone has the practice, patience, and stamina, a book can be written! ",

If you want a more modern example, the movie The DUFF is based on Kody Keplinger's novel of the same name, written when she was seventeen. Quality is subjective. I've read books by adults that aren't good at all. I regularly go to writing conferences, conventions, and book signings where I talk to authors, and many of them started writing as teenagers. They all agree that the books they write today are better than what they wrote as teenagers, but that's because their twentieth book is better than their first book. It's not due (entirely) to age or life experience, but writing experience. Teenagers can most definitely write books and they should if they want to be good at it as adults. ",

Taking place on a holiday in Southern France it's the story of a girl who doesn't like the new girlfriend of her divorced father. It's not the most complex or intellectual book, but it's written in a poetic and fluent style, and you can easily relate to the emotions of the main character - a young girl not unlike the French author herself. She has written twenty novels in total, but her debut is still her most popular work.   Other examples: Mary Shelley was nineteen when she wrote Frankenstein.Arthur Rimbaud wrote his best poems when he was seventeen to twenty. He practically stopped writing at twenty-one.Anne Frank wrote her diary when she was thirteen to fifteen years old.So the real question seems to be: \"Can teenagers who wrote a good book equal that after they turned twenty?\" ",

In fact, if you enjoy writing I would highly encourage you to try it, 12 is about the age I started writing seriously. It can be a very fun and rewarding hobby. 2. Can you publish a book? As someone else has stated, technically yes but realistically no. Anyone can self publish these days, but can you write a book thats worth publishing? That people will actually buy (keep in mind the average self published book sells under 50 copies) With professional editing/ covers? Probably not. This isn\u2019t to say anything about your age or talent, but writing is a game of experience and practice. Most authors have several manuscripts under their belt before they try to publish. They go through dozens of revisions, betta readers, and editors. 5 years from now you\u2019ll look back at your current writing and laugh, and five years from then you\u2019ll look at that writing and laugh. For now, focus on improving your skills, on learning how to tell a story and bring characters to life. Then you can worry about building a marketing platform and querying agents. ",

At Rainbowdash Publishers LLC our publishing decisions are primarily based on quality, and after that our preference is for new authors under 25 years old trying to break out (because we feel other publishers discriminate against this demographic). Best of luck with your book and think of us when it is ready for a publisher. ",
