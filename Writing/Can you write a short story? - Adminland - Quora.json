            "answer_text": "(Some of this story is fake, while some of it was based off a true story) August, 2013 (fake), little eight year old Trey (fake) was spending the night at a friend\u2019s house. Alex\u2019s (fake) mom was friend\u2019s with Trey\u2019s mom. And so Trey frequently had sleepovers with his friend. The sleepover was the same as any other, but the morning afterwards, when little Trey went home, things were different. Trey\u2019s friend lived a little far away, and so whenever Trey was brought home, the highway was taken. On that morning Trey was in the backseat. He was in the middle. Alex\u2019s mom\u2019s friend was sitting to his left, and Alex was sitting to his right. Another person was in the passenger seat, and Alex\u2019s mom was driving. At some point during the drive bullets hit the car. And of course this made everyone jump, including Trey. One of the bullets nearly hit Trey in the head. He knew this because he heard the bullet, and he felt it. It didn\u2019t hit Trey, but he could still feel it. The car stopped, as well as the car behind. Alex\u2019s mom got out and confronted the man who shot at us. Apparently all was good, because Alex\u2019s mom got back into the car and drove off. Hours later Trey is sleeping. Trey is in his bed, sleeping with his stuffed animal, Tigger. Downstairs, his mom, her boyfriend Bobby, his aunt C, and her boyfriend were getting high and drunk. Aunt C\u2019s boyfriend, Shane, offered to fix the generator in the basement, because it needed to be fixed. Shane was allowed, and so he grabbed a candle, and went downstairs. Right in front of the generator was a highly flammable carpet. Shane, because he was high and drunk, tripped, and the candle hit the carpet. The carpet immediately caught fire, and the fire raced towards the generator. Apparently there wasn\u2019t enough time to get water, because Shane told everyone, and they got out of there. The generator was right under Trey\u2019s room, and so Trey needed to get out of there fast before the generator exploded. Trey\u2019s mom didn\u2019t grab him, because she has a disability, and neither Shane or Bobby went to grab Trey. Trey\u2019s aunt went in there, and grabbed Trey before the generator exploded. And after that, happy ever after, or so you would think. Pretty much everything in this answer actually happened. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote a super dark short story a year ago. The writing isnt very good because I was younger, but I hope you enjoy. Again, its really dark. Like psychological horror. I stood in front of my old house. A navy keychain was clutched loosely in one hand, the other closed around an iPod in my pocket. A small part of my mind was screaming to wake up, but I was spellbound by the images before me. The door swung open, revealing a cozy living room. My little sisters shoes and backpack had been discarded in the living room. I sighed and took a moment to put them away before collapsing onto the beige sofa. Everything was exactly as I had left it; my mother hadn\u2019t been downstairs. I fixed a small snack for her. After a moment of heated debate with myself, I made one for my little brother as well. He would be coming home from school soon and often forgot to eat his lunch because he was talking with his friends. I left his snack on the counter. \u201cEhrial,\u201d a soft voice whispered from above. I whirled around, nearly dropping the tray of gram crackers, and found my mother leaning heavily on the banister. She used to be beautiful, but after father left, she no longer seemed to care about anything. Her once-fair hair was a tangled grey beast atop her head. Her eyes were a cloudy jade when her empty gaze met mine. She reminded me very much of an angel cast from Heaven. \u201cEhrial, sweetie, I have a surprise for you,\u201d she continued in the same quiet, monotone voice. She smiled at something just over my left shoulder, a maniacal grin that chilled me to the bone. \u201cWhoops!\u201d She giggled as she swayed on her feet and tripped into the wall. I shook away the moment of terror and smiled kindly in return. \u201cYou forgot to eat again. The next time you see your therapist we\u2019re gonna talk about that. It\u2019s not healthy. Honestly, mom, what would you do without me?\u201d I started up the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ve got a snack for you.\u201d My mother seemed to snap back into reality. \u201cRight. Yes, come quickly. The longer you wait, the more angry they get.\u201d I forced myself not to flinch away from her touch as she guided me down the hall to her room. It was better that I didn\u2019t ask who \u2018they\u2019 were or why \u2018they\u2019 would be angry. Ever since my father\u2019s disappearance, she wasn\u2019t quite in touch with reality. The doctors said there was nothing medically wrong with her. If there were, it would be so much simpler. Alas, there was no cure for a broken heart. It was because of this that I refused to let my emotions rule me. I refused to become her because of some guy. It wasn\u2019t logical to waste time and money on someone else. I smiled as we passed the room my siblings share and the lyrics to \u2018Outrunning Karma\u2019 blasted through the door. Nakir always got upset when Teresa listened to her music without headphones so she took all the time she could get to do it. \u201cCome on,\u201d My mother urged, a little color coming back into her voice.\u201cIt\u2019s not much further now. I made it just for you. A grand masterpiece for you to enjoy. They say you will like it very much.\u201d She giggled softly as she opened her bedroom door. The suspicious part of me was tearing at my mind now, begging me not to look, to do anything but take a step through that doorway. But I did. Suddenly, I stopped. My mother's room was sparsely furnished; an unmade bed sat in one corner across from the dresser, and a light blue rug laid in the very center. It was stained with blood, the mangled body of my sister just beyond it. My breath came out in a ragged gasp and my knees buckled. She was sprawled out on her stomach, blood pooling around her. Chunks of things were strewn around her head like a satanic halo and I dared not imagine what it was. He face was turned towards me, two gaping holes where her eyes once were. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d A soft voice whispered. ",
