            "answer_text": " I DON\u2019T WRITE FOR ROBOTS. Okay, now that you understand that, the answer below is going to make a little more sense. Yes, I cross post my work. Why? Because the same people do not follow me on every platform. \u201cSo I can just copy/paste my work and have the same results?\u201d Nope. People recognize laziness, even if they don't know it. I do my best to respect the people on each platform. The same idea can work on Quora and Medium, but the approach is just a little different. \u201cHow many platforms do you do this on?\u201d I typically cross post one type of way: From Quora to Medium or my blog. Each time I do so, I write a different lead. If anyone points out holes in my logic, I fix those before I repost. Recently I've experimented with posting to Instagram. The post makes for a LONG caption, but so far I've gotten good feedback. Very rarely I\u2019ll take work from Medium or my blog back to this platform. The question has to be exactly right. The first time I did this, my answer was featured on Inc. Magazine and has currently been seen almost half a million times. Not bad for a year-old post. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that hurt your SEO\u201d Probably. I\u2019ve been writing for two years and don\u2019t have many (any?) pages that rank on Google. I stopped checking for a couple of reasons: SEO confuses me. It\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t like it.Talking with humans makes me happy. It\u2019s easy. I do like it.Knowing those two things allows me to focus my effort on Human Engine Optimization (HEO). SEO has probably a billion steps. HEO only has two. Make art people enjoyAsk them to share itI believe my art is good enough that if given enough eyeballs, it will share itself. The best ideas spread like wildfire in spite of SEO. \u201cIsn\u2019t cross-posting kind of\u2026 lazy?\u201d If you write once every month, and then keep cross-posting that throughout the month, yes it\u2019s lazy. What I\u2019ve found is that I actually write MORE since I started cross-posting. Maybe it\u2019s a guilt thing, I don\u2019t know, but when I can stagger my posts across different platforms, each audience is getting something new almost every day. I used to worry people would get mad if I posted almost the same work in different places. Now, I just ask myself this question: \u201cHas every single person who could benefit from this had a chance to see it?\u201d If the answer is no, I post elsewhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the answers on here are oversimplifying the negative aspects of cross-publishing, which, if done right, are virtually nonexistent. Cross-publishing is a great way to increase the reach of your content, and as long as you cross-publish on a platform that supports canonical links does not have a significant downside in terms of SEO. Most modern publishing platforms provide a way for you to do this so that you don\u2019t harm your SEO. For example, this is how to do it on Medium. Unless you already have a large organic reach with your blog (and really even if you do) I would recommend cross-publishing things freely so long as you do so in a way that maintains your own site as the canonical home for your content.

You can post an excerpt on Facebook and point back to the main article. You can tweet a quote from the article. You need to be careful of a few things: Duplicate content - Google only wants to rank one version of an article. So if you use the exact same article on 2 websites only one \u201cwill count\u201d. You can use the canonical attribute to instruct Google which one should be ranked for search results. You can also use a 301 redirect where that makes sense.If you rework the content for another site or another article on your blog. You need to be careful of keyword cannibalization. You run the risk of weakening the original by having two pieces with the same keyword focus.Mark - Prosociate.com ",

Which means that the first article you publish, probably won't be affected, but the second and third won't rank to well. I recommend you post it first on your WordPress blog and then re-purpose the same content for Medium and LinkedIn. Through in a link to the original article and it might even help in your link building campaigns.
