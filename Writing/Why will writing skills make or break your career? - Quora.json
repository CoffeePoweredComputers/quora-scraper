            "answer_text": "Skilful writing is all about effective communication and effective understanding. It uses everything about grammar, in fact \u201cgrammar\" IS a structured way to communicate effectively. I will not get into the details of writing all about grammar, so whenever I write a sentence and punctuate it properly, I am holding in my vision the big red book on English grammar written by Wren & Martin. Skilful writing can be used on many major languages that include English, French, Tamil, etc. To communicate effectively and if you are able to do it, you will have a big career opening up for you. Some of them are, writing novels, writing for newspapers, a news reader, a vlogger and a vlogger, penning down your thoughts on Quora and assisting someone in understanding their problems and giving solutions that they understand, a motivational speaker, writer\u2026the list is plenty. When you write about some topic, you also think about it. With a well developed skill in writing (leading to well developed analytical thinking) you can unravel the complex concepts and lay them threadbare at the feet of whoever needs clarification. Effective writing leads to effective thinking and the two complement each other towards effective communication. Some of the people who impress me the most are : Bob Proctor Simon Sinek Dr. Joe Dispenza ",
