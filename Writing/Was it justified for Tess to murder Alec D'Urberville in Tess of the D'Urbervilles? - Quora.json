            "answer_text": "Tess of the d'Urbervilles is \u2026 difficult. And I, uh, don\u2019t exactly know how to answer this question. I often visualize Hardy as a meditative bard, who sympathetically depicts the vicissitudes of his characters set against the background of a society which has remained static for long, but is now threatened by the forces of change. As such, his stories exist on two planes. Tess of the d'Urbervilles, for example, is not just the story of Tess\u2019s trials and tribulations (and how the fairer sex has been exploited by the fragile masculinity of the menfolk). It is also a story of struggle between the old and new orders. Hardy was a virtuoso in the depiction of nature and landscape, and in painting it verbally, he displayed a remarkable freshness and accuracy of touch and tone. (Mervyn Peake is the only other English writer I can recall at this point who had the ability to truly \u201cpaint a scene\u201d.) This preoccupation of his to depict nature in all its raw and sensuous beauty spilled to his characters as well. That is why, his characters are more than heroes and villains. Their being is seen in relation to the weather, the seasons, the changing mood of the countryside. The world is transforming, and Tess is a child of the bygone era of simplicity. Not only is Tess a descendant of the ancient and noble family of d\u2019Urbervilles, she is also innocent, compassionate, and resilient, rather like nature itself. On the other hand, Alec d\u2019Urberville is unscrupulous, lecherous, and dominating, hellbent on subjugating others to his will. It is not a coincidence that he resembles the destructive aspect of man\u2019s enterprise (modern technology, if you will). The advent of industrial age brought the issues of class and gender consciousness to the forefront. There were those who hoped that modernity would lend voice to the oppressed. And then there was Hardy, the consummate pessimist. After all, what can mere mortals do in a world populated by demons and monsters, where there will always be want and never sufficiency, where misery is the norm and comfort a rarity, where good men suffer and the bad thrive. \u201cDid you say the stars were worlds, Tess?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAll like ours?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like the apples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound\u2014a few blighted.\u201d\u201cWhich do we live on\u2014a splendid one or a blighted one?\u201d\u201cA blighted one\u201d Against the backdrop of this cold unfeeling world, Tess struggles for her soul. Her attempt to claim her own individuality is thwarted first by Alec who, after forcing himself on her, accuses her of saying no when she meant yes, and then by Angel who prefers to see her as an idealization, not as a woman of flesh and blood. She loses her child, who is denied a proper Christian burial because he is unbaptized. She loses the man she loves, because he can\u2019t overlook the past, though she is expected to forgive his indiscretions. She loses herself to Alec for the sake of her family. When Angel returns to Tess\u2019s life, it dawns on her that she is trapped \u2014 by society, by scripture, by an arbitrary and discriminating morality. Alec\u2019s murder is her last act of defiance, her final attempt to claim her soul. She frees herself (both literally and symbolically), but at a great cost. Thereafter, her only significant act in the novel is when she sleeps peacefully on an altar of the Stonehenge. As befitting the true-born daughter of nature, this ancient stone \u2014 and not a feather-bed \u2014 is her penultimate resting place. After this, she'll find rest only in the gentlemanly embrace of death. Was Tess\u2019s murder of Alec justified? Perhaps not. Was it understandable? Most certainly yes. ",
