            "answer_text": "Look, I'm going to tell you what to do, but you might not like it. Okay, here goes, give your kid an M and M candy, just one, out of the bag, every time they go potty. But, your kid must have their own little potty toilet to do this. The reason is, because they have to sit there until they pee or poop or both. And as soon as they do, clap for them, and tell them that you're so so happy they did it, then wash up and give them a candy. If your kid doesn't like MandMs then reward them with whatever you want. Sooner or later, they are going to go without being rewarded. It just takes time. The fact that they have to sit there isn't fun, because someone has to sit there with them. But, someone does have to sit there with them or none of this is going to work. Also, at nap time and bed time put a pull up's on him. And always only underwear any other time. The diapers no longer exist. Believe me, a kid will not potty train with a diaper or pull up on when they're playing. It makes it easy to be lazy. And they hate peeing in underwear. But also, with our son, I would only have him in underwear during the summer time and warm day's and let him out to play in the backyard, and tell him to pick a tree and go pee. I didn't give a damn what anyone thought. If they didn't like it then they could train him at their house and bring him back. Haahaa! But if you don't have a backyard to let him loose on then just be consistently asking him if he has to go yet, to tell you when he does, and he will get his candy when he does. Do not let him see the bag though. Make him think there is only one piece of candy in the house. Otherwise, he will cry for the whole bag. Just say you got this one piece at the store and he can have it when he goes. Remember, there will be accidents, do not get mad when that happens or your kid will not know what to think. It will totally confuse him actually going pee but getting in trouble for it. Sounds weird but, these things I know about. Trust me. So, I want to wish you the best of luck with it all. You don't have to do what I said, I just told you what worked for me with our two kid's. Just don't forget to tell him how proud you are of him when he goes on the potty. And let him help put on his underwear and pull up because it makes them feel more grown up, so to speak. Sorry this is so long but I needed you to know. Take care ",

            "answer_text": "We bribed our first-born with the promise of Daddy making her a cake for her first peeing in the toilet this. This worked, but do think that I had erred by focusing initially on her \u201cKeeping her big girl panties dry\u201d. She could be dry for hours and hours, but was not ABLE to pee until the diaper went back on. The message here is to be sure that the child knows that the pee and poops go in the toilet. After the wrong approach above, we put the child potty seat outside, where she played most of the time, and with her wearing no panties or diaper. Pretty easy to notice that she was wetting her legs, so I could get her to the toilet and she could pee and she could get her cake. An instant phone to Dad after the first event, and several times during the day to remind her. That was the turning point! Just be sure that what you are doing is clear to the child. It is not about keeping him dry, but making sure that he uses the toilet. Wherever he is, have a little potty chair nearby, and remember that he really needs to see/feel the impact of peeing on himself, if you can tolerate a few puddles. Of course, if it is too easy for him to pee in his diaper, and not interrupt his play or such, then that is what he will do. After all, that has worked \u2018all his life\u2019. I can guarantee you that seeing other little boys use the toilet is important, too. Can you borrow a friend or cousin who is \u2018such a big boy\u2019 to use the toilet and let him be a highly visible role model? At nursery schools, ,most often the toilets are quite low so that a tiny child can be independent in reaching the toilet, and they are often unisex. They are generally open to the classroom, so they can be monitored, and EASY to get to from the play area. A low sink to facilitate hand-washing in also part of the process. He will learn, I promise. Nothing is more hard on a boy\u2019s ego than to be the \u2018baby\u2019 who doesn\u2019t use the toilet. ",

            "answer_text": "What I did was , as soon as the child was aware of going to the bathroom(shows discomfort, pulls at diaper, stops and looks down at what is happening while doing his /her after bath dancing in the buff) I put those thin, terry cloth undies(do they even make those anymore?) on them. Of course do this when you will be home for the day(perfect situation with Covid). The child urinates, the undies are sopping, they walk around like their straddling a horse as they look down at the visual transformation of what is hanging on their bodies. I say \u201coops, what happened ? You best go into the bathroom. What do you need to do? Take off your pants. They\u2019re very wet\u201d . This is key. Child MUST do this her/himself. Even better if they struggle a bit as it will make a more lasting impression. I then say \u201c Sit on the potty. Go pee pee. (Of course, they won\u2019t go because they just have. But you\u2019re creating an association.). Then I say \u201c put your WET pants in the laundry(child must do this). Now go get some DRY pants( child must do this) and put them on. REPEAT this ALL day for several days and longer. Commit yourself to being consistent. All three of my kids (2 boys and a girl) were potty trained within 3 weeks. I have no idea why each one was 3 weeks but I am known as the Queen of Consistency. Parents struggle with potty training because the child is carted from one activity to another all day everyday. I watched my grown children with this. I could have helped them but they were trying to \u201cfit in\u201d potty training into their busy days. Consequently, it went on and on and on\u2026.. Be Aware\u2014\u2014 it can become a power struggle. But that\u2019s another conversation. P.S. A 3 year old in kindergarten? Remember that he\u2019s just spent his time on earth learning to walk, talk, feed himself and navigate his own little world. Give him time to practice all these newly acquired skills. Be cognizant of that his pace in doing things might not coincide with your pace. ",

I used cloth diapers and it was easier because kids can\u2019t feel the wet disposable diaper! Now the only thing is, if your child doesn\u2019t care if he is wet or not, then potty training is going to be hard, but I wouldn\u2019t give up! Diaper or pull up can be worn only at bedtime, otherwise, underwear where he can feel being wet or poopy! If you can catch him going on the potty, make a big deal about it with a special treat so he will do it again! If you can wake him in the morning & get him on the potty right away, that may help. I knew when my kids were ready to potty train because they would come & tell me they were wet! But again, they knew they were wet because they could feel it with cloth diapers. You have to keep trying, he will get it. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, not all children are the same and some get the idea of what a potty is for sooner than others. I do wonder if, when parents get anxious and try to push the child, it can be counter-productive as the child senses the anxiety and associates the potty with tension and stress\u2014and unhappiness. It could be worth backing off for a while and trying to relax. Perhaps, as someone has suggested, have several potties about the house. Anyway, try to keep the atmosphere free from stress and be extremely patient. I knew a 3-year-old who didn\u2019t get the idea of what a potty was for, and eventually when she began to give it a go, she was given a lot of very positive encouragement and praise. Then she seemed to progress quite quickly. The great thing is to try not to worry. You have time before kindergarten starts next year. ",

I know he is 3yrs old and you are probably trying to get him trained as soon as possible but, a child will always win when it comes to potty training, that is the one thing they can control in their lives. Just be patient and take a step back and try again later. No kid goes to kindergarten in diapers. Good luck ",
