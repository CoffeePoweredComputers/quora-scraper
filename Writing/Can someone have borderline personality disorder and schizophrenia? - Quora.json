            "answer_text": "Yes. These are two distinct and distinctly different personality disorders, but many who suffer schizophrenia as their primary diagnosis also exhibit the characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder as well. Let\u2019s start logically- the definitions of the two disorders are distinctly different.From Merriam Webster Online: Definition of schizophrenia: 1 medical : a mental illness that is characterized by disturbances in thought (such as delusions), perception (such as hallucinations), and behavior (such as disorganized speech or catatonic behavior), by a loss of emotional responsiveness and extreme apathy, and by noticeable deterioration in the level of functioning in everyday life.NOTE: Schizophrenia often involves an inability to orient oneself with reality, a withdrawal from social interactions, and a failure to integrate thoughts with emotions so that emotional expression is inappropriate. There are several subtypes of schizophrenia, including paranoid schizophrenia and those types marked by catatonia or hebephrenia. Definition of borderline personality disorder: a disordered behavior pattern that has an onset during adolescence or early adulthood and that is marked by unstable, intense emotions and mood with symptoms including instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, fear of abandonment, and impulsive or unpredictable behavior:  \u201cLike others with borderline personality disorder, she had intense and unstable relationships with people that veered from adoration to intense hatred and jealousy the moment she felt the merest slight.\u201d \u2014 Richard A. FriedmanBorderline personality disorder afflicts an estimated 1.3 percent of U.S. adults.\u2014 Bruce Bower\u2014abbreviation BPD And as a side note, I\u2019ve wondered many times if the experience of suffering from schizophrenia itself is a contributing factor which increases the likelihood that such patients will also develop BPD, but a curious observation I\u2019ve made which may or may not validate any correlation at all is that those I know who have schizophrenia show symptoms of BPD many years prior to subsequent symptoms of schizophrenia. Perhaps they actually are experiencing the disease for potentially long periods of time prior to becoming symptomatic? I haven\u2019t seen any newer studies on this subject in a very long time, so it may be that someone or many are looking into these research questions as I type this. I would hope so, since I am no expert, but noted these observable correlations quickly, many years ago in the behaviors of people I knew with the disorders. I hope this answered your initial question adequately. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it is possible to have BPD and schizophrenia, just as it is possible to be struck by lightning in the same place on two successive days - it\u2019s just highly unlikely. The disorders are fundamentally different and have different etiologies (causes and course of development). Schizophrenia is highly genetic and typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood and is more common in males. BPD typically is associated with some experience of trauma and is characterized by extreme emotional reactivity and hypersensitivity and is more common in females. Both are typically lifelong but both may stabilize in time with effective treatment; in the case of schizophrenia with appropriate medications and supportive counseling (to stabilize adjustment), and in the case of schizophrenia to mitigate emotional reactivity and learning of self-calming interventions. Interestingly, psychosis may also be associated with extreme emotional reactivity (due to delusional beliefs) but in those cases we typically diagnosed Schizo-Affective Disorder as we testified in civil commitment hearings. The emotional reactivity is typically secondary to the schizophrenia rather than related to relationship issues, and lessens or disappears as the schizophrenia is addressed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes.It isn\u2019t the most common occurence, but it is possible.  BPD patients suffer from mood instability, self-image issues, depression and anger, amidst other symptoms. Schizophrenic patients, too, may display the above symptoms, however they can only be classified as schizophrenic if they experience psychotic symptoms (Eg. delusions, hallucinations) as well. (BPD patients may also exhibit some signs of hallucination in some cases but these are not as intrusive as those experienced by schizophrenic individuals.) Schizophrenia and Borderline Personality Disorder are distinct - so much so that they lie in different axes of the DSM-IV (Axis I and II, respectively). However, clinically, they have been found to coexist and a lot of the symptoms, such as paranoia, mood instability as well as some hallucinations, are common to both. If you or anyone you know may suffer from one or both of the above, I encourage you to get professional help. You could go to a local therapist or you could consult one online, at a platform like http://www.ewellnessexpert.com. Take care. ",

            "answer_text": "Borderline personality disorder: This disorder is characterized by instability in mood and behavior. Even a person\u2019s perception of himself isn\u2019t stable, and generally there is no in- between state\u2014he is either a saint or rotten to the core. This instability can result in dizzying emotional swings, from anger to loneliness to emptiness, and impulsive behavior. To counteract this, someone with borderline personality disorder may be tempted to indulge in unsafe behavior, such as substance abuse, as a way to regulate or medicate themselves. This disorder comes under Cluster B of DSM-5 Manual. Schizotypal personality disorder: Distorted thought is also a hallmark of this disorder, but generally more intense. Someone with this disorder may start to believe their thoughts are either all-powerful and can affect people, or the thoughts can be held captive by others. Some people start to hear voices or see things others can\u2019t, attaching significant meaning to them. This kind of thinking can manifest itself in uncomfortable social interaction and odd ways of expressing one\u2019s behavior, thoughts or emotions. This comes under Cluster A of DSM-5 Manual. Now coming to your question. The term \u201cborderline schizophrenia\u201d is sometimes used, however, to refer to an individual who meets some, but not all, of the criterion for schizophrenia or to refer to parallel symptoms of borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. Conclusion : BPD is a very different diagnosis than schizophrenia, though the two can co-exist. While BPD is characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships; schizophrenia is characterized by a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions. If you, or someone you know, are described as having \u201cborderline schizophrenia\u201d, it could point toward mild symptoms, unclear symptoms, or a combination of symptoms. The best thing you can do is to seek clarification from a licensed professional. Stressed? \nRelax, We are waiting for your \"Hi\". ",

Under this theory, a person could not be schizophrenic because they have not crossed the psychosis threshold (i.e. their bordering between neurosis and psychosis), a required feature of a schizophrenia diagnosis. The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. From my understanding, it is possible for an individual to have both disorders simultaneously. It may be relatively rare but it\u2019s still possible. A person with schizophrenia can display symptoms, in addition to psychosis, as well as some of the other symptoms of schizophrenia. The two disorders are not mutually exclusive meaning that if a person has schizophrenia, then he or she cannot be diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. ",

An excerpt from one of my textbooks: The scientific community has been increasingly drawn to the concept of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia having similar genetic origins and pathology. Both disorders exhibit irregularities on chromosomes 13 and 15. It may be that the genotype has more to do with the specific expression of psychoses (altered thought, delusions, and hallucinations) than are reflected in traditional classification systems.

Bpd is not really a \u201cdisorder\u201d it is a reaction (defense mechanism) we develop usually from two factors that cause PTSD. Biologocal, and environmental factors that could have been traumatic so your body and brain (yes they\u2019re that powerful) have an \u201cautopilot\u201d mode where if they feel in danger (PTSD) act out with characteristics of BPD. but to answer your question yes it is possible to have dual diagnosis or even multiple.

This is the exact opposite profile of a person with schizophrenia. People who have schizophrenia maintain regulated states of being , preferring low stimuli. They spend time with a few close friends, family or alone , don't seek attention and don't have the desire to manipulate in any way. I hope this is helpful. ",
