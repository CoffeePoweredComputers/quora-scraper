            "answer_text": "No. Just like every other profession, journalists must be trained in how to ethically gather news and report it. Some need training in how to write with clarity. Some need to learn how to operate cameras or edit video or audio. It also requires discipline as you cannot reveal your personal opinions or insert them into stories. You must also be dedicated enough to answer that 3 am phone call and willing to rush to the plane crash or earthquake, or whatever happened. You must be bold and brave, because people can and will threaten you and try to intimidate you. You also have to go into places that are dangerous, such as natural disasters like hurricanes. You have to have the highest moral standards as those who would like to discredit you will search for weaknesses. They will look for ways to get you off of their story and try to keep you from revealing their secrets. They may offer bribes to issue threats. You have to be strong. Not just anyone can be a journalist. ",

People skills, great writing skills, and an extroverted are pretty necessary character traits for the industry. So although, yes, anyone COULD be a journalist, not everyone will be able to thrive in the same ways. ",
