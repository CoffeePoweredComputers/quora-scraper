            "answer_text": "My native language is Hungarian, I speak both English and German. I think the best way to put arguments is to break it down to \"inside the box\" and \"outside the box\" considerations in determining how hard a language is. I. Inside the boxWhat makes German harder (-)  than English:- genders of nouns,- 4 cases that can modify the pronouns and add suffixes,- plurals change for different words and are much more complicated,- verb tenses are less logical and harder to use (for me),- strict structures and fixed word order, which is hard to remember,- long compound words made up of several others,- a lot of rules (this may be positive for some),- less flexibility in \"constructing\" words and expressions. What makes German easier (+) than English:+ a lot of rules (this may be negative for some),+ few exceptions to the rules, which is great,+ the structures make you less likely to construct weird or easily misunderstood sentences. II. Outside the boxIf we start thinking outside the box then we soon realize that all the previous arguments mean little compared to other factors.(1) What do you need to survive in your day-to-day life? If your TV speaks German, your shopkeepers are German, the traffic and other signs are German around you, then you will pick up German easier.(2) What do you use for entertainment? If you watch Hollywood movies or British TV series, you play computer games in English, read books in English then English will stick to you much more than German.(3) How your mother tongue relates to the target language (for me this didn't matter much, because Hungarian is not similar to any other language)?(4) How much you enjoy the particular language? If you enjoy learning it and speaking it, you will learn fast.(5) How many people are there with whom you can practice? You can find English speakers anywhere (online gaming, chat, comment sections, Quora, etc), while finding German natives and opportunity to speak to them in German may be more challenging. Having said all that, I started with German at the age of 6 in primary school and it took me almost 12 years to get a C1 language exam at the end of high school. Meanwhile I started learning English by myself at the age of 11-12 because I wanted to understand the computer games I was playing, and I started learning the language formally in high school at the age of 14. I took my English language exam at the age of 16. Note that it took only 2 years of learning by myself and 2 years formal education to take the English exam, as opposed to 12 years formal education of German, due to the fact that I needed to use English for my hobby. Therefore I would say the \"Outside-the-box\" factors are much more important than the \"Inside-the-box\" factors. I did find German the hardest of the European languages I've meddled with (English, German, Spanish, Italian, French), although if you are interested in something really extremely hard on a whole new level, try Hungarian ;) ",

            "answer_text": "I am not really in a position to say because I am German (with a Portuguese background) who learned a terrible English at school and then taught himself mostly or learned it the hard way (real life and interweb). All I can say is that both languages are far more different than they might appear at first (both are counted as \u201cGermanic\u201d which I don\u2019t see that English really is, it is far more Latin and French/Norman rooted). I would say that German is harder because the learning curve is much, much steeper. In English you can communicate fairly quickly with just a few words or phrases, and even if your English is a clumsy form of gibberish people will still find a way to understand you (and in my experience all natives are exceptionally nice and willing to do so, and helpful too). In German however a few words of phrases aren\u2019t very helpful. It is very hard to say things in simple terms and if your word order in a sentence or grammar is totally off, people might not get you at all. I\u2019ve noticed that with Indians or some African folks, but also French or Italians. On the plus side, however, everyone who I know (including my mom) who learned German as a second language, once they got over the first steep slope they all started to appreciate the immense variety, depth and versality of it. And if you go even further you\u2019ll notice the inherit logic in most of German words. My favorite example is the German term \u201cUnterhaltung\u201d (entertainment). Literally speaking it means \u201cunderholding\u201d or just something thats holds you from underneath. Why should it hold you up there? To keep you from digging deeper? German is a brilliant language with a depth in expression I have not yet seen in any other language (I am fluent in English, learned Latin, and understand a garden variety of all Roman languages). There is a significant difference between both languages. While German is mostly an original, \u201cnatural\u201d language, modern English is a pidgin language or creole (google Middle English creole hypothesis). But that does in no way mean that English was somehow inferior, quite the contrary, it just has a different character. As with probably every language, once you start mastering its unique qualities it begins to offer you a whole variety of things you wouldn\u2019t have thought of before. English shines in its \u201carbitrariness\u201d and flexibility. While German allows to express things to the point probably no other language can, English allows you to express things in a way that goes both ways. It is a unique quality - often seen in its diplomacy. But your question was about learning. English is also easier because there is plenty of great entertaining stuff (unterhaltendes Zeug) in English while a lot less in German. Every language is \u201ceasy\u201d to learn if you have to or have the option of exposing yourself to it. ",
