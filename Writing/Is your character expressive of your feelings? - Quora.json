            "answer_text": "Is your character expressive of your feelings? On first impression of this question, the answer seems to be \u201cNo,\u201d or at least not fully. As an example, a person may be deeply in love with someone else, but the other person is already married. Being a person of a strong ethical character, the first person might not ever reveal their true feelings for the second person. So, it seems character does reveal partial feelings, in that it expresses the ethical principles upheld, but it does not necessarily reveal the depth of feeling that someone has. Even the fact that the person is upholding personal ethics, by saying nothing, is likely hidden. This is necessary in order to not reveal private feelings of romantic love for another who is already married. So, in the end, character might be a necessary mask for a person\u2019s true feelings, in order to uphold the ethical principles of a strong character. ",
