It's not like they're going to compare notes either. I would make sure that the parts that are tailored for each school are in separate paragraphs from the parts that are identical. You can save the parts that are identical as a template and then add a few paragraphs at appropriate places to talk about your fit to each school.   In summary, don't sweat it: your strategy sounds fine. ",
