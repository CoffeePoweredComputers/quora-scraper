            "answer_text": "AP really isn't a \"writing style\" per se. There are some words that are differently spelled or differently used, and there's some punctuation pitfalls but it's not really a style that focusses on writing. What AP style is are just some changes in mechanics and grammar that allows journalism to be uniform throughout the world, regardless of media outlet or source.I use the 2011 AP Stylebook in my journalism class. It's kind of just a dictionary, with entries like: cent. Never use the word cent in relation to money, unless it is a crucial part of the story. Always refer to money amounts smaller than a dollar in dollar form.  It's great fun reading through, to see how AP refers to specific things. But yeah...it's not really a writing style. ",
