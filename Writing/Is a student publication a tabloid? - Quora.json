            "answer_text": "Ir could be, I suppose, but probably not. Tabloid originally was used to describe newspapers that have smaller, squarer pages that do not fold in half like broadsheets. Because many newspapers that printed on tabloid shape developed a more, shall we say, adventurous and bombastic style of journalism, use of the term tabloid morphed into more of a description of that journalistic style rather than the shape of the page.

            "answer_text": "The word tabloid describes the size of the paper - describes how big it is. If a student publication printed in that size it would be a tabloid. If it printed in a size much smaller or larger it wouldn\u2019t be a tabloid. The second use of the word describes a publication that takes a sensational approach to the news. But, generally, the paper must be of tabloid size to be considered a true tabloid. ",
