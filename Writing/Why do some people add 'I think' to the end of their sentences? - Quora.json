I can\u2019t say with certainty why people add \u201cI think\u201d, because I am not one of those people. Let us, therefore, examine some possibilities. If someone, in answer to your question, said \u201cThey\u2019re stupid\u201d, the answer may be true - but stating it without identifying it as an opinion suggests the respondent has not given due thought to the possibility that they might be wrong. \u201cI think they\u2019re stupid\u201d is better because it identifies the statement as an opinion, but in the absence of reasoning it is not much better. As for your final point, how do you know they know the answer? Saying \u201cI think\u201d may be habit or humility, but it may also be genuine uncertainty. I think. ",

            "answer_text": "I could think of three reasons for this: They aren't entirely sure of the facts which they have provided. It would come from a question like - What is the GDP of USA?It's a habit which they've developed. They might have been influenced by someone or something that created that habit. A more commonly used word for this is \u2018basically\u2019, where I feel that it is used unnecessarily.They really aren't sure of the answer so they tell you a rough guess.For me, I think the most common reason is 2, which is what I usually encounter. If you really want to find out how sure they are, you could ask a follow up question, \u201cWhat could be wrong about your answer?\u201d. ",
