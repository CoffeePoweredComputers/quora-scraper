            "answer_text": "Not nearly as much as you think. Of the entire membership of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Authors of America, slightly less than 10% make a living\u2014and by that, I mean about $24,000-$30,000 a year\u2014from writing. Of that 10%, only half, or 5%, make a living writing only science fiction or fantasy or both. The rest have jobs that qualify as \u201cwriting,\u201d but not SF/F\u2014they might write romance under another name, or are journalists, or technical writers, or copywriters, or work in advertising agencies. More often than not, they teach. Most authors have full time jobs and write on the side. Sometimes they make nothing at all in a year. Sometimes they make a few hundred dollars. You\u2019ll see news stories about people getting the \u201cbig paychecks\u201d from writing, but you are more likely to be struck by lightning than be able to earn a living from writing. Here is how the business works. You work hard on your first book, and it probably takes you two or three years to get it ready to be seen by a publisher. You send it to the publisher, who sends it to a long-suffering person called the \u201cFirst Reader\u201d (because the editors\u2019 time is too precious to waste on reading unsolicited manuscripts) who is very likely also an assistant to someone, and this poor soul in his or her \u201cfree\u201d time takes unsolicited manuscripts and reads them. By which I mean, he or she takes the first chapter and reads it. About half the manuscripts are rejected on the first page; they\u2019re hand-written, or written in crayon (I am not making this up), or printed in weird colors, or formatted wrong, or full of so many grammar and spelling errors and typos that they are painful to read. Most of the remaining half of these manuscripts are dreck, and get the polite rejection letter. Of the ones that are kept, the First Reader now reads the first three chapters. If the book falls to pieces or makes him/her snore, they go in the reject pile. Now, the First Reader reads the whole book. If it becomes obvious that this book submitted to the SF publisher is actually a western the author couldn\u2019t sell and substituted \u201cblasters\u201d for \u201cColts,\u201d and \u201ccolony ships\u201d for \u201cwagon trains\u201d (or vice versa) it gets the boot, and so do other books that just don\u2019t cut it. This leaves the First Reader with about 1% of the original pile, which he/she sends on to the real editor to read, who goes through the same process; first chapter and synopsis, then first three chapters, then whole book. Meanwhile the author, who has been waiting for about a year now for a response, is still paid nothing. The editor decides this is a winner. S/he writes/emails the author. The standard offer for a first novel in sf/f is $3,000-$10,000, but the only people who ever get $10,000 are people who are so amazing the publisher is willing to put the first novel out in hardcover and sink a lot of advertising money into the book. So figure, after 4 years of work, the author is getting $3,000 \u201cadvance against royalties.\u201d This is important to understand. This is not a paycheck. This is a no-interest loan against the 15% of cover price that will be his royalties. But wait. He doesn\u2019t get that at once. The contract will dole out the money in 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 increments. 1/3 on signing the contract. 1/3 on acceptance of the manuscript. 1/3 on publication. But wait, doesn\u2019t that mean he gets $2,000 up front? The publisher accepted the book\u2014 No, s/he didn\u2019t. You are more likely to win the lottery than have your first book breeze through without editorial changes. The author will get $1,000 within a few months of signing the contract. Yes, it takes that long to cut the check. Then after about a year of editorial changes, he\u2019ll get another $1,000. Then after about a year when the book is finally published, another $1,000. And then, after that $3,000 is paid back to the book company out of the author\u2019s royalties, he will start getting royalties. If the book stays in print and sells reasonably well, that can amount to anything from $50/year to $2,000 a year. So, so far, the author has worked on this book for 5 years. And he\u2019s gotten $3,000. At that rate, he can afford to live under a bridge. ",

            "answer_text": "Commonly traditional publishers compensate authors about $1.25 per book in royalties. So if your book sells for $20, you earn just over a buck.It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to know that you would have to sell a lot of books, to make good money.However, as a writer, they are so many more options to make a decent living. Freelance writers can charge by the word, by the hour or by the project depending on the circumstances.For example, a Freelance Writer can charge a company anywhere from $ 3,000 to $ 10,000 for just one White Paper.Copywriters can charge from $ 150.00 to $ 250.00 per hour or they can charge $ 1000.00 for just one Sales Letter.Someone actually made $ 10,000 a month in Sales Letters alone, now he\u2019s a Multimillionaire with a Net Worth of $ 50.00 Million.Don\u2019t just limit yourself to being an author. Here are some rates listed below for Freelance Writers. Entry Level (.03-.06 Fee Per Word) Est Per Hour 500 Words=$ 15.00-$ 30.00Intermediate Level (.07 -.12 Fee Per Word) Est Per 500 Words=$ 35.00-$60.00Experienced Level (.13-.20 Fee Per Word) Est Per 500 Words=$ 65.00-$ 100.00In-Demand Expert (.21-.30 Fee Per Word) Est Per 500 Words= $ 100.00-$ 150.00Freelance writers can also charge a company $ 1,000-$1,500 Per Project!Lets\u2019s say a freelance writer has 5 clients and each client is charged $ 1000.00 for each project, that\u2019s $ 5000 a month.Now let\u2019s take the same situation if the freelance writer charges 5 clients $ 1,500.00 Per Project-that\u2019s $ 7,500.00 a month, not bad huh!Both of these amounts would double if you had 2 Freelance Writers servicing 5 clients a piece $ 5000.00 X 2= $ 10.000 A Month$ 7,500.00 X 2=$ 15,000.00 A MonthAs you can see being a Freelance Writer is much more lucrative than being stuck as an author.
