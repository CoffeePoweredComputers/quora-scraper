            "answer_text": "The whole world says \"cool\" from Tucson to Tucumcari, Tehachapi to Tonopah as the song goes. And I certainly do. From the time of Miles Davis's \"Birth of the Cool\" though no doubt actually some time before Miles, Before my time, anyway. To today. And even including today's \"chill\" which in a way recovers the earlier, pre-specific-to-general shift of \"cool\" to mean that someone was unexcitable, imperturbable, took everything in stride, was a \"cool cat.\" My parents were beatniks, or the more literary beats, though neither was a word they used. And many of their contemporaries said \"hip\" in a way mostly congruent with \"cool.\" But my parents were genuine beatniks or beats or hipsters, despite (or perhaps because of) never saying \"beatnik\" or \"beat\" or \"hipster\" and they said \"hip\" only in its truer jazz sense of \"knowing.\" \"i'm hip to that.\" \"Get hip.\" \"Get wise.\" \"Wise up,\" etc. But the whole world has said \"cool\" throughout my lifetime except for one place. The beaches of Southern California. Where they said \"bitchin.\" Actually, cool has several very different meanings to my generation. One being the familiar word of generalized, somewhat unfocused approbation. Cool. Hip. Bitchin. Shiny in 2005 parlance. Sweet in 2010 parlance. But cool can also incorporate some other slang messaging. Be cool. Relax. Don't wig out. 1960s. Cool it. Shut the fuck up. 1970s. Be cool. This guy is a narc. Eat your roach. 1960s/1970s. It's cool. I am cool with it. It doesn't matter. I forgive you. 1970s. Cool runnin. Keep on doing your crimes. We are not south Florida undercover cops. Not much. 1980s. Cool your jets. You are the kid. I am the parent. 1980s/1990s.  It always seems that slang gets defined by other slang. The slang of Generation Alphabet Letter gets defined in terms of the slang of Generation Previous Alphabet Letter, because the latter is the one that needs the definition. I don't need to define \"cool.\" I use the fuck out of that word every day. Cool is the one bit of slang that all Alphabet generations understand. The most persistent slang word of all time. So although there are alternatives, none of them are as powerful and evocative as \"cool.\"  ",

(In other words, \"show don't tell.\") If you want to convey the sense of an \"awesome\" dinner, you may come across as more original if you call it a crackerjack dinner or a transcendent dinner, but neither will really make the listener taste the awesomeness. So it's better to say, \"I could taste the warm butter running down my throat, and the roast was so tender, the meat just fell off the bone...\" Or you can use metaphor: that hot chocolate was like a mother's embrace.
