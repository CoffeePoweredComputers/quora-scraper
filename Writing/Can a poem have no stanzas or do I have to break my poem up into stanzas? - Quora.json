Sure I think your question is does it need to be broken up into blocks, the answer is no it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ve seen many that aren\u2019t as well as many that are, however that being said, try to look into the way you read your poem and how it\u2019s structured\u2026 you might find some natural breaks that you wish you separate. If it has a rhyming scheme that\u2019s a good way to look for where the repetition cycle begins and ends, voila - a stanza, if you want it to be\u2026 If you still are having trouble blocking it into chunks, then you still don\u2019t HAVE to split it up, I think the readers would prefer you use your whitespace to the advantage of the poem to the best of your ability, but that being said, your case is your case and I don\u2019t know a whole lot about your poem, it may be that its quite fine not to use stanza breaks. There are some interesting elements of this, for example: if your text in the poem is all about not having a line between things then it is illustrating the poems point not to\u2026 There are no real rules here - to have rules in a poem, you either need to make them yourself or choose to follow a form that is already defined - which generally sets out its own rules or structure. You may get some inspiration from referring to poems others have written, or you may not, your work is probably unique to you, so anything others say is pretty much all just guidelines. I know saying that isn\u2019t all that helpful, but without specifics or any kind of understanding of your poem I can\u2019t be of more help to you. All I can do is wish you luck \u2026 you are the author, it is your choice how you present your poem and what choices you make with it. ",

            "answer_text": "A poem can be a long stretch of lines and maybe get a publisher's maximum characters per line or lines per poem. So commercially, there could be restrictions beyond your initial query. The way that poetry was usually presented was in a portrait style poetry book. So line lengths were helpful in creating text to fit the page and the font and style. You haven't used the comment section for your query to offer a link to your poetry. A poem is often regarded as having verse gaps, yet that doesn't apply to some styles that we can check using Google search or the poemhunter poetry website. Some poetry is going to use a few lines or a dozen or fourteen or just carry on till all is displayed. A book doesn't offer some scrolling effect like a web page does. A video on YouTube would be better served if offering verse gaps. The poemhunter website creates videos of our poems and adds these to the poetry web pages or on the dailymotion videos website. So we can view these when searching for a poet's name or the poemhunter username there.:The modern trend of the Internet and computers as well as Internet tablets will offer us the landscape format screen display. Some websites like QUORA maintain a central column but other websites use more of the screen width. A safe screen width isn't going to use the maximum screen width. Web pages are usually created with adequate pixel values for left and right margins or blank space. So this is why I choose that many of my longer poems are going to be displayed differently. Usually, I prefer the 8-6-8-6 syllables per line as with common metre hymns. For the Internet, I combine lines 1 and 2 then 3 and 4. I can get 32 lines to be displayed as 16 lines instead. That way, more of the poem appears on a single screen display.:You can see how this works on my 2,700+ poems on the poemhunter website which offers visitors the poet's poetry as a free download of an e-book in the PDF file format. No adverts, just poetry.:So maybe you can combine lines to create a shorter looking piece of poetry that could be displayed without verse breaks. Otherwise, count the lines and see if these fit verses with 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12. Choose a 24-lined poem and you can use 2, 4, 6, 8 or the 12 as verse line options, rather than just every 4 lines then a verse gap.:You choose and you edit to suit the line lengths... unless offering to a poetry publisher that has its own preferences, styles or guidelines. Same again with poetry competitions.: ",
