Don\u2019t say thank you more than once and don\u2019t repeat yourself anywhere else either, unless it\u2019s a key point and it\u2019s urgent. There\u2019s no place for flowery beat around the bush crap in an email. Subject: Quora Answer 1/26Body: Dear You, Thank you for your question regarding emails. I have a solution I think will work perfectly. Stick to the point and don\u2019t stay too long. Looking forward to your thoughts on this. Best,Tyler Pendleton ",
