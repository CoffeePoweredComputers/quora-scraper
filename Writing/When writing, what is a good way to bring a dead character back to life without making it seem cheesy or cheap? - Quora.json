            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read a lot of books over my lifetime, and can\u2019t think of a single one (fiction) that ever featured the return or resurrection of a dead person that didn\u2019t end up sounding cheesy. It\u2019s the plot of half the soap operas, or used to be very popular. One cheap device in movies I eventually got to be fond of was the epidemic of amnesia in classic movies, especially movies from the 40\u2019s. As a kid, I often suspected my family of having amnesia. Better to maintain quality by using a more practical reason for a person to go away for a while, and return to wherever. Since as far as I know of, there\u2019s only one resurrection that\u2019s widely believed in, even if not scientifically, don\u2019t crumb up your writing with easy solutions. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two ways to do this. Set your story in a world where coming back to life is normal. This works especially well if certain causes of death are necessary to properly kill people, e.g.: the beheading requirement in Highlander.Go so over the top with the cheesiness that the audience buys it. This takes more nuance than you\u2019d think but becomes a lot of fun in a hurry. Think of movies like Scream or Drag Me to Hell.",
