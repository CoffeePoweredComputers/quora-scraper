When I was young, my mom\u2019s best friend had a son my age and he was getting awards for \u201cpenmanship.\u201d He attended the local Christian school while I was homeschooled. Yeah, I had a weird childhood. Anyway, my mom and his mom were talking about these awards he got and my mom was congratulating her, gushing really. I was a precocious child and I was immediately annoyed by this. I wanted to be the best. I decided that I was going to improve my handwriting so that I would win awards for penmanship if such awards existed for homeschool. So I did. My cursive still sucks though. I only worked on my printing.  ",
