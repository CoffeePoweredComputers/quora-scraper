            "answer_text": "First, you briefly identify the two people, events, or things being compared and contrasted. I\u2019d do that in one or two paragraphs. Start by describing the similarities. Then find and describe the differences (the contrasts). Finally, you have a wrap-up sentence. And usually you want to keep the number of items and the length of the \u201ccompare\u201d section similar to the number of items and the length of the \u201ccontrast\u201d section. Here\u2019s a real quick example: Compare and contrast Theodore Roosevelt with Donald Trump: First, you\u2019d explain that both served as presidents of the United States. Roosevelt served in the early 1900s. You\u2019re just setting the stage. Now you\u2019d describe the similarities: Both were U.S. PresidentsBoth were born in New York CityBoth ran under the label of \u201cRepublican.\u201dBoth promised major construction projects south of the border. Roosevelt began construction of the Panama Canal. Trump promised to construct a big, beautiful wall along the Mexican border.Both defeated politicians closely tied to political machines. Roosevelt defeated an incumbent state assemblyman. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.Both named sons after themselves.From Wikipedia about: \u201cRoosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities.\u201d Trump is making the White House the center of news with his Tweets.Now the contrasts: Roosevelt had previous political experience, including serving as governor of New York and vice president under William McKinley. Trump had no prior political experience.Roosevelt became president at age 42, and remains the youngest person to become president. Trump is one of the oldest, becoming president at age 70.Roosevelt made a name for himself by leading corporate anti-corruption campaigns, including blocking a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. Trump has been accused of corruption.Roosevelt served in the military (the Navy). Trump has no military service and received multiple exemptions to stay out of the military.Roosevelt was the exemplar of masculinity. Trump ridicules the supposed lack of masculinity in others.And finally you\u2019d wrap up with a concluding, summary paragraph. ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking as someone who has read hundreds if not thousands of mind-numbingly boring compare/contrast essays, I can say confidently that the key to making your essay stand out is actually having a reason to compare the two things. Unfortunately this is not always easy, as many writing teachers seem to view the act of comparison as a worthy endeavour in itself rather than a means to an end. In the real world, people whose minds have not been irretrievably damaged by composition classes compare things as a means to an end. If you compare two phones, for example, it\u2019s usually because you want to decide which one to buy. Let\u2019s say you have been asked to write an essay comparing Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s election campaigns. What you don\u2019t want to do is just list every similarity you can think of followed by every difference, then at the end waffle about how there are some similarities but also many differences. Instead, you need to think why someone would want to compare two election campaigns. Probably it\u2019s to decide which one was more effective in terms of winning over voters, and you can go from there to drawing general conclusions about election campaigns. For this reason, you should only choose those points of comparison which are relevant to your purpose. Maybe both campaigns served pizza to campaign workers, but it\u2019s probably not worth mentioning. To sum up, before you start comparing two things, decide on your reason for comparing them, then work out your criteria for comparing them. Once you\u2019ve got that far, the rest of the essay pretty much writes itself. ",
