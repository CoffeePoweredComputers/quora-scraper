            "answer_text": "Have the antagonist kick a dog. It doesn\u2019t have to be your protagonist\u2019s dog. Better if it isn\u2019t, in some ways. The sheer shock of \u201chow could s/he do that!\u201d will echo through your protagonist into the reader. Like your protagonist, the reader will be disgusted. (Assuming you\u2019ve established your protagonist as the sort of person who wouldn\u2019t kick a dog. Otherwise that one doesn\u2019t work.) I\u2019m assuming you want to do this, but still keep your secondary antagonist around to do other things? That tends to limit the nasty. If your #2badguy drives too fast, knocks a kid off their bike, blood everywhere, but they don\u2019t stop \u2014 then the reader will hate them, yes, but the character is either under arrest or deeply out of sight for a while. You\u2019ll notice the key thing here is the hurt, and the fact that the victim does nothing to \u201cdeserve\u201d it. The dog hasn\u2019t leapt at your antagonist\u2019s throat. The kid on the bike hasn\u2019t just keyed the antagonist\u2019s car. It\u2019s hurt, inflicted Just Because. If you can make your secondary antagonist able to exercise power over the protagonist, so that the protagonist can\u2019t bring him to justice, that helpless fury will help you even better. If you want to read an ideal study, I give you Dolores Umbridge, from Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books: #5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, also #6 and #7. Dolores is a witch, a civil servant in the Ministry of Magic, and \u2014 despite being senior undersecretary to the Minister \u2014 she\u2019s pretty small fry for a hero who has faced possessed professors, giant basilisks, dragons, Death Eaters, and Voldemort the Dark Lord. But I\u2019d bet money on Dolores Umbridge being the most hated character by the readers. First, she\u2019s in a position of power. She comes into the school as Defence teacher, placed there by the Minister to spy on Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore. For political reasons, the most powerful sorcerer in the Wizarding World, viz., Dumbledore, can\u2019t restrain her. Harry has no one he can go to for help. Second, she\u2019s condemned by her background, particularly her preferences and habits. She wears twee pink all the time. Despite being a middle aged witch, she wears a little girl bow in her hair. She has a breathy, little girl voice, and she talks to the teen students literally as if they were five years old\u2014and insist they answer likewise. Her name (Rowling\u2019s names!) is Dolores, meaning \u201csorrow\u201d, and Umbridge\u2014to \u201ctake umbridge\u201d means to feel resentment or take offence at something. But it also comes from the Latin umbra, meaning \u201cshade\u201d. So there we have our shadowed, resentful, bringer of offence and sorrow\u2014talk about condemned by a name\u2026 :) You don\u2019t have to do Rowling\u2019s Dickensian version of it, but traits and names always have an effect on the reader. It\u2019s something else you can control. As we get to know Dolores better, we discover she\u2019s been hired to teach defence, but won\u2019t teach (being afraid of armed students), that she has a political agenda \u2014 her droning political speeches give way to her own \u201cInquisitorial Squad\u201d of students, and an ever-increasing number of Kafka-esque rules. When, finally, Harry gets a detention with her, she has him write lines \u2014 with a magical pen, that uses his own blood as ink, and cuts \u201cI must not tell lies\u201d into the skin of his hand, so that he is irreperably scarred. And then she gets Headmaster Dumbledore ejected from Hogwarts, and declares herself Headmistress. With the backing of the only other authority in the Wizarding World, the Ministry. It\u2019s no surprise, towards the end of Book 5, when we find her willing to cast the forbidden Pain Curse on Harry. She\u2019s moved from being irritating, to being nasty, to being all-powerful over the world of the school. She\u2019s definitely a secondary antagonist, but she\u2019s capable of arousing real hate in a way that I feel Voldemort isn\u2019t. And really, he\u2019s the #1 villain. He\u2019s upstaged, I think, because being put in a position where what is done to you is wrong, but you can\u2019t complain about it \u2014 that, for most of us, is more familiar than meeting a would-be babykiller. So, put your secondary antagonist in a position of power, and have them misuse it. Make them take what rules exist, and twist something to their own benefit. Make them the bully who picks on the protagonist, when the protagonist has rock-solid reasons for not solving the position with violence. It helps if they do this to your viewpoint character, but if that\u2019s not possible for some reason, having the POV character look on helplessly while someone they love is bullied \u2014 that\u2019ll do it too. People hate bullies. People hate powerful bullies. People hate being subjected to the bullies when they\u2019re powerless. You shouldn\u2019t need more than one chapter for an establishing incident. And if you give them no redeeming qualities, or ones that are supposedly redeeming but not (china plates with painted kittens on, gah!) \u2014 then there\u2019s no danger your secondary antagonist will become an anti-hero or likable villain\u2026  Q: How do I make my reader really hate my secondary antagonist in about one chapter?

            "answer_text": "It is really not much difficult to create a character hated by the reader, all you have to do is to make the secondary antagonist (X) do something cruel to the protagonist (Y) who is very admirable and with whom the reader empathise with. Develop a scene where X tries to hurt Y just because he wants to, make him (X) powerful in some aspect and let him oppress Y, or simply juts create a couple(maybe Y and A) and let X destroy it, it will be just so pathetic and you just can't hate anyone more\u2026.!
