            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, sometimes yes. But only when if you are not following the guidelines provided by those freelance sites. There are some websites having their own policies like: You should only communicate through that websiteYou should agree on the terms and conditions added by clientsYou should always submit your work from that site only.These are their own rules but if you look at those, actually those are for you, to stop fraud happening with you. As a freelancer, sometimes fraud can happen in the following conditions: If you try to communicate with clients out from that site.If you submit your work/files/documents out of the sites like email or other communicationIf you are not clear with terms and conditions/client haven\u2019t added terms and conditions/signing NDA without reading completely.If the client has not deposited amount and if you complete your work (If happens sometimes, not all the time)You can trust some freelance sites. These sites monitor your communications with your client, your work, terms & conditions as well. So if you are not following their guidelines then you can\u2019t raise the issue on that site. Because they are having some own policies. These sites can behave like a mediator and you can get your payment or at least your files will be kept safe. Here are some list of freelancing sites. UpworkFreelancer - Hire & Find JobsForlancer - This site acts as a mediator. If you are in some conditions like if you are not getting paid after completing your work then you can raise the issue on this site. And they will resolve your issue by monitoring terms and conditions made by the client, your work/uploaded files/documents/messages between you and client.If you follow those rules created by site, they will release your payment if the client has deposited the amount or your work will be kept as safe if your payment is not deposited by the client. Tip: Try to start work if the client has deposited the amount for that projectRead the NDA carefullyTry to avoid big work if the amount is not deposited",

            "answer_text": "Yes Rekha Joshi. Fraud happens in the freelancer website and being a freelancer you need to be alert from such clients. If you search on google you will find many company names freelancers have written about their fraud experiences with. Some basic things if you take care of you will not get trapped in such frauds : Before finalising any project with client do ask for their previous projects and company background.Verify whatever information client is given is true and confirm yourself.Ask for all deliverables in writing on mail.Before signing any NDA or Contract please read all clauses carefully if needed take help from a legal person who has knowledge.Clarify payment terms before signing any contract. I advise to add payment terms in contract so it will be in writing form in case of fraud you can use it as evidence.Ask for atleast 20% advance payment. So it brings trust in contract.And if possible meet in person to sign contract with company.Hope this will help you out. All the best. Happy Coding.  ",
