            "answer_text": "Main topics for you to fill in include: Basic information: Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Home address and Current address, Email, Phone number, LinkedIn hyperlinkSchool and education: if you are in University, you can list your High school and your progress so far on University.Special awards: Scholarships, Certificate from competitions, Online classes/courses - the more related between them and your current study course or your prospect job, the betterPast jobs: if you have any internship, write them down. Note the time and company, self-employment works too (I think). But I'm not sure flipping burgers in McDonald's is a good one.Other than that, you can try extra-curriculum activities at your university (being a guide in Intro Week or join the Student Association for example). School\u2019s projects are also eligible to be put on your CV, remember to give short description (one or two lines) on the projectsecond and note the time period as well as your position. I hope it helps. ",
