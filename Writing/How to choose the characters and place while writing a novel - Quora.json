            "answer_text": "If you know what kind of novel you\u2019re writing (mystery, thriller, science fiction, etc.) and generally what the story is, you should know what kind of characters you need. I find that the characters become \u201cfleshed out\u201d as I write, but when I begin, I usually know nothing more than that the protagonist will have a certain kind of problem. What kind of problem it is will determine some characteristics. The same is generally true of the book\u2019s setting. Since I write novels set in England in the 1740s, my choices are rather limited: London or one of the other cities, a smaller town or village, Scotland. As I\u2019m fussy about accuracy, I avoid using locales I cannot easily research, and of course, the nature of your novel will determine some location/setting choices, just as it does with characters.
