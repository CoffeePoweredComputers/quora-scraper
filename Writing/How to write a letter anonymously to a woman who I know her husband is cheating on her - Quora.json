            "answer_text": "It is none of your business. Stay out of it. For all you know they may have an agreement, and may not want to be told. You don\u2019t know why he is cheating : is he just being a bad person, or is she a major pain the neck at home and he needs to get out, but can\u2019t because of the kids or something\u2026I don\u2019t know and you don\u2019t know either, even if you are a close friend of hers and she tells you all, your are only hearing her side of the story. But lets say you really do know, and he is really being a \u201cbad person\u201d in spite of her doing everything she can to keep him, and her really being the perfect wife and in this case victim. You tell her\u2026 then what? They divorce, the kids are hurt, the family is broken\u2026 What have you achieved really? What if, it was just a fling\u2026 what if it would have finished soon anyway, and things might have gone back to normal with a reasonably \u201cnormal\u201d family life\u2026which would have been better than a divorce for all involved\u2026 There are too many \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d, and unknown factors that mean you can throw a big rock in their pool, and splash the shit about, but you have no idea who it will splash (kids? other family members etc), or how it will splash (will they argue and divorce, will she shoot him? will he shoot her?\u2026), and more importantly you have no ability to foresee or impact a better future for the family as a whole, as a result of your action. ie you can destroy (something that is weak allready I admit) but if all you are leaving is a smoldering heap of ashes where nobody has gained, what was the point? Righteousness is not a virtue. It is a religious concept which has been misused to abuse others in a way the religions say they don\u2019t intend it to be. (May he who has not sinned through the first stone) ",

            "answer_text": "So many unknowns here - Do they have an agreement between them concerning having an affair? Some people have those arrangements, y\u2019know - and some have a \u2018do it if you need to, but I don\u2019t want to know about it\u2019 deal going on. Their relationship, their concern, not yours. What if this is one-time indiscretion and the husband regrets it and wants to preserve his marriage after his mistake? Maybe he\u2019s already confessed it, and they\u2019re working through it, but aren\u2019t sharing it with anyone because it\u2019s embarrassing and ultimately a private matter. It\u2019s not unknown for couples to have this kind of thing happen and work on the problem and go on to have a very successful marriage. Why is it your concern, in the final analysis? You aren\u2019t part of the marriage, so what exactly is you stake in this, really? Are you going to help after the initial reveal - help her move, figure out her new financial situation, take her kids into account if there are any, counsel her into perhaps pursuing a healthier relationship in the future? Just how much of this are you willing to take responsibility for besides disrupting their relationship to satisfy your personal sense of morality? In the end, they have to work out their problems, and you have no idea of the repercussions that could come from this. So as much as it may make you grind your teeth down to nubs, I\u2019d stay out of it and offer support afterwards. If he\u2019s going to cheat and even leave her, then it\u2019ll happen without your interference. ",
