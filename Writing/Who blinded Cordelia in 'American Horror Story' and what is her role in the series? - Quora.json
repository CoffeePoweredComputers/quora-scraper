The blindness and then self inflicted blindness, the overall timid and quiet nature was all planned to throw the viewer completely off of guessing who the next supreme would be. They originally mentioned that Madison couldn't be supreme because Supremes are always in perfect health and she was hiding a heart murmur. Until her death and resurrection which cured that. So you are tricked twice into thinking it could never be Cordelia. ",

To take care of her Girls and TO be the Next Supreme Cordelia passes Psychokinesis, Telekinesis, Concilium, Descensum, and Transmutation, leaving Divination (the one test Madison hasn't passed yet), and Vitalum Vitalis. Cordelia passes Divination while Madison fails. Afterwards, Cordelia resurrects Zoe, proving herself as the next Supreme, and her sight is restored after she passes all of the Seven Wonders. ",
