            "answer_text": "A2A. Basic would be to create a portfolio. There are free blogs websites you could register on, like WordPress. Build up your profile with as many pieces of blog posts as possible. Write on topics you know. Could be your neighborhood, city, a mall/other places one could visit. You could also write about hobby topics, in a manner of connecting - things happening in the specific field globally to what is available locally. There's no dearth of topics. Once you have a portfolio, you can leave links on future blogs, social media posts,etc. There are several websites which could connect you with prospective employers. Like Freelancer, Upwork etc. Wherever I am writing etc. it means there are several options (not possible for me to list them all). Give it a shot. Good Luck ! :) ",

I mean doing journalism or copy writing or technical writing or any form of paid writing to specs and a deadline. If not, your first step would be finding projects - even volunteer work - to build a portfolio.You need to demonstrate your skill so you need \u2018clips\u2019 or samples of your work. Second, may I refer you to the Freelance Writers Den? I don\u2019t own it and it isn\u2019t my business and I get nothing from the referral. However I am a member and I think it offers some of the best, most realistic, and useful advice and resources for people who want to become freelance writers. Google it and it will pop up. It may not be open - but you can get on the waiting list for the next opening. In the meantime, you can check out the free website of the site owner, which also offers useful information.

All the things to avoid, warning signs, how to approach clients, and so on? If so, look into writing-based communities and be sure to ask specific questions in order to get a clear picture. For example, start with a basic Google search such as \u201cWriting forum\u201d or \u201cForum for writers\u201d or even \u201cFreelance writing basics.\u201d Those very same places can also give you more specific venues where you can find writing gigs, considering all the different types of clients available out there.

I would suggest that if, despite the answers you are seeing, you still want to learn more, go to web sites such as Write Better, Get Published, Be Creative | WritersDigest.com and start reading, and reading, and reading, and prepare yourself to up your game in a major way in terms of taking the initiative to do research on your own.
