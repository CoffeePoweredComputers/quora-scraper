I've chosen the ones that came up the most as well as the heavily upvoted responses and these were the 27 books I managed to come up with (in no particular order). Obviously there are so many more amazing books which aren't on here and equally deserve to be mentioned but if I were to list them all I'd be here a very long time. Hope there's some of you who might find his interesting and if you have any further books you might want to add or discuss then do comment!!
