            "answer_text": "I think the fatal flaws are the same as in many other genres \u2013 poor writing, 2-dimensional unappealing characters who you don't care about, lack of suspense and conflict, uninteresting plot, clunky storytelling... However, if I had to list a few more specific to fantasy that would make me either stop reading or rate it poorly: Overly indulgent worldbuilding and info-dumps. If I have to read an unbroken stream of paragraphs in which a character describes the landscape, or a cultural tradition, or a largely unrelated historical event, I'll soon be skimming and thinking of giving up on the book. This is particularly true at the beginning. If there's a prologue that reads like a history book, e.g. \"In the third age the elves came down from the mountains etc. etc. etc.\" it will be an immediate red flag. It's just poor writing and you don't need info dumps like this to create a rich fantasy world. Fantasy clich\u00e9s. This has been said by others already but it's really important so I'm including it too. I'm not interested in reading a poor imitation of Lord of the Rings. To be honest, if know there'll be elves, dwarves and orcs in a novel it could be enough to turn me off before I even start it. Similarly, if a paranormal romance looks like it's going to throw the same vampires, werewolves and angels at me, along with a love triangle, it'll take a lot for me to pick it up. This also extends to clich\u00e9 plot elements, names, characters and phrases. There has to be something new and intriguing about the book for me to love it. Protagonists being wilfully stupid \u2013 particularly when it comes to refusing to believe in magic/evil villains when those things are staring them in the face. I know that in a paranormal fantasy a normal human is not going to immediately believe in the existence of magic... but if they repeatedly get attacked by magical beings or demons, and they are still shaking their head and saying \"no, this isn't real, I'm just going to go back home and everything will be fine\" I quickly lose respect for them. Also, if the key character just generally comes across as stupid in the way they speak or act, I won't be interested in reading about them (this can happen in all kinds of fantasy, but I encounter it most often in YA paranormal, when an author has has tried to make a character seem \"adolescent\" by making them ditsy, shallow and ignorant). Seeing the author's hand in the story too obviously (or put differently: seeing the constructed, fictional nature of it). While this could happen in any genre, I think it's more of a \"fatal flaw\" in fantasy because it weakens the suspension of disbelief that is necessary to feel absorbed in the story. This could happen because of: expository dialogue (where characters are saying things they have no reason to say aloud, other than for the benefit of the reader), a character clearly making a poor decision because it suits the author's plan (e.g. the \"let's split up for no good reason\" suggestion, because that always works out so well), or a preachy comment that is too clearly put there to make a statement about events/politics in the real world. I'm sure the list goes on, but pretty much anything that feels like it's been put there by the author, rather than an organic part of the story, is a flaw. Too Much Obfuscation. If I immediately find myself in a thicket of made-up fantasy words whose meanings I don't know, or trying to make sense of verbose, archaic, abstract sentences, or reading passages that have me completely bewildered because characters are only referring to events and things I haven't heard about and giving me no clues to ground myself with... I'm going to give up. I think this sort of thing often happens because fantasy authors want to make their characters seem mysterious and unknowable and more-than-human, or just generally to create intrigue, so they withhold or obscure or complicate things... which is fine, but if it's overdone all it creates is confusion. I'm sure there are more, but those are the main ones that come to mind! By the way, Chuck Wendig (spec fic author and blogger) has a great post about things to watch out for when writing fantasy: 25 Things You Should Know About Writing Fantasy Edit: since writing this answer I\u2019ve put together two more comprehensive blog posts inspired by this question, so I thought I\u2019d mention them here in case they\u2019re of interest: 10 Common Mistakes I See in Epic Fantasy Writing & 10 Common Mistakes I See in Paranormal Romance and YA Fantasy Writing ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Four that can be extended to other genres and two I find personally annoying. POV misusagePoor description\"Said-Bookisms\"Dungeons and DragonsLord of The Rings Rip-OffsReading only a handful of genresNone of these are unbreakable rules. The key is to know when you are breaking them, and what that is doing to your text. POV misusage If you don't give a damn about POV or doesn't even know what I'm talking about, you're probably going to default to third omniscient. Even worse, switch beetween T.O. body hopper and T.O. hidden narrator (and it gets even worse: people are not buying third omniscient nowadays unless it's literary fiction or if you have an estabilished name). Learn the different kinds of POV, what they can offer to the reader, including framing devices, and if you're going to break them, be fully aware of what you're doing.  Poor Description The better your description is, the less you'll need to info dump. Try to avoid writing a whole info-dump paragraph. Learn to work with the concrete-abstract duo in description. Instead of decribing every detail, be briefer and add more heavylifting; meaning, focusing on things that can convey worldbuilding, tone and character. Think twice before writing any adverb or adjective. \"Said-Bookisms\" When writing dialogue attributions, there should be a good reason for you to write anything but \"said\" and \"asked\". Also watch where you position your attributions.   Dungeons and Dragons I love D&D. I've been DM'ing for fifteen years. But every time it leaves the table and the manuals and reach fiction, I shiver. It spreads everywhere, leading to a lot of flat wordbuilding and dumbass magic systems.    LOTR Rip-Offs I do not advocate originality, specially regarding the guy that defined what contemporary fantasy is. If you're writing fantasy, you should have something ripped-off from him, otherwise you shoul rethink your target audience. People always point out the same thing while complaining about tolkien rip-offs, usually: Good vs EvilLanguagesGoblin ArmyI'm not talking about these, which are fine for me. I think the main thing is that Tolkien was the only one writing that by that time and his book could rise based on its originality. The story is great, the characters are good, but the writing style is clunky. Nowadays the whole thing has evolved: the readers are familiar with a wider range of fantasy works, and are different people than those in the sixties. The same way nobody is trying to write the way Sun Tzu wrote, you shouldn't try to write the same way Tolkien did. Read it, study it, but know where fantasy is today.   Reading Only a Handful of Genres This one requires some determination to fix. Literary fiction people read only classics, realism and literary fiction. Fantasy people read only fantasy, sci-fi and thrillers. And so on. The thing is that it usually requires a lot of experience and time before you loose the grip between what you read and what you write. Beginners tend to read and write the same thing. They change what they read and so they change the genre they write. You can cheat this by picking consciously what you read and write. Choose the genre and the target audience for your writing and read a diverse variety of genres. You can spot this in many authors. One lack the knowlege of the other. The key here is to remember that there is no artistic truth but the act of creating. The shapes are secondary, so, there's no hierarchy of genres. Each one attempts a different thing. Cliche is not synonym to bad, and Never Done Before is not synonym to good. Everything in moderation, including moderation. ",
