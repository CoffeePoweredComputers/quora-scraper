            "answer_text": "The native American tribes basically lost their lands due to being out matched by better armed Europeans who had black powder guns and cannons, steel armor and swords which needless to say made them very hard to take down with the weapons the natives were used to fighting with. There is also the fact that the native tribes in the East were rather hostile from the get go even after trading with first with the Norse then the English and this didn't exactly help relations any. In the Vinland saga it tells of how the native tribe actually rowed out and attacked Leif E\u00ecriksson's ship while they were still off shore and were sailing along the coast looking for a place to land. That's right the natives attacked them first while they were still at sea and hadn't even set foot on land, so what does that sound like, that's right piracy. Then once the Norse threw back their attack and finally did make shore they were attacked yet again only to beat back that attack then a truce of sorts was made and they traded with the natives, one of the items the Norse traded was milk, but when the natives drank this they became sick due to not being used to milk and thought the Norse were trying to poison them so they attacked again. Needless to say the Norse ended up calling them skr\u00e6ling which in their language means savage, well I guess so if they kept attacking them. What's even worse is when the Norse left for good and headed back to Greenland the Inuit followed them and kept up the hostilities, can't win either way there. When the Pilgrims landed they were attacked and only after they held off multiple attacks did they come to a truce with the native tribe, I've been to Plymouth and seen the remains of the defenses they had to build to ward these attacks off. Now I'm not saying that terrible things didn't happen later on, they did, but attacking instead of being diplomatic tends to cause some really bad feelings that only get worse as time goes by. Then you have the Iroquois who were just plain the badasses of the Northeast in those days who used to raid English ships and take women and children as slaves as well as other tribes, there were peaceful tribes but then there were very war like tribes as well who preyed on others long before the Europeans came along and they just saw the Europeans as another tribe to try and take advantage of but that wasn't exactly what happened of course and they were defeated or joined forces with the newcomers especially the French in the Northern provinces. As time progressed onward and the Europeans brought their Manifest Destiny belief with them the natives started losing ground to the Europeans and later colonials who were were unjustly taking land that did not belong to them and the ball really started rolling then and when Andrew Jackson pulled his little stunt in the South that really opened the door to future hostilities and we know the rest of the story after that.

            "answer_text": "The main reason that native Americans--and Australians, and Cape Khoisan-speakers, et cetera--lost their land lay in the technological and related disparities between themselves and the invaders. European technologies--including military technologies--were more capable,  Why didn't they eventually get their lands back, the way nearly all Africans and Asians did? The impact of epidemic disease was devastating. At the same time that Europeans were importing new populations into these territories--themselves, Africans, even some Asians--the populations of these colonized territories were dying en masse from Eurasian and African diseases they had no immunities to or defenses against. The epidemiological catastrophe was worsened by the disruptive effects of colonialism, which often made it difficult to take independent initiative to care for the weak. (Apparently some people in groups hit by disease survived the plague only to die of starvation or exposure after their societies collapsed.) The result was that these territories ended up being repopulated, to greater or lesser degrees. Certain areas with relatively dense indigenous populations which were not replaced wholesale--Mexico and the Andes come to mind--weren't repopulated. These were exceptional. ",
