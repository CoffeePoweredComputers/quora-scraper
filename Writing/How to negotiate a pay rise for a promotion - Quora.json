            "answer_text": "Thank you for the ATA.   First of all, you should do your home work.  That is, do your research well in order to prepare a reasonable proposal.  For example, do you know how much other people doing work at the same level in companies such as yours, in your location, make?  If not, find out.  This will tell you how plausible a negotiation is. But wait a minute.  Let's take a step back.   Do you know that this same question has been asked on Quora close to a thousand times?  (I made that number up, but there are certainly more instances of this question than I can easily count, so it FEELS like a thousand times.)  So I am going to surmise that doing home work is not your forte.   That's okay. But, if you aren't ready to research the question, the best method is....  just propose/ask.  Yes, it is that simple.   Remember:  We don't know what industry you work in, nor what company, nor what country, nor what culture.  We don't know what your job is, what your education is, what your experience is, and how well you perform.  We don't know how much profit your company makes, nor whether you manager has extra budget.  Etc.   All of these factors influence how you ask. If you work for some highly unionized US government contractors, you cannot ask for much -- because all the pay grades and positions within each grade are highly regulated and standardized.  It's a formula and that is that. If you work at a startup in Europe, it's more of a \"green field\" situation, though there are typical ranges. If you work at a large tech company, with an international footprint, you'll likely find that the manager has a narrow range of dollars to choose from, and that by the time you are told you are promoted, the numbers related to the raise are already signed off by executive management --  and represent the complete budget the manager has available to them.  Or you may find that you are so incredibly valuable that they will find extra budget. So, you may want to add to your question:  What kind of role, how many years of experience, what kind of education, what kind of company, in what country, you are working for.  What kind of performance evaluations have you received.What kind of turnover is there in your org.How many times a week are you approached about other jobs in other companies?Are you ready willing or able to move to a new company?And a bonus question: What is it about the other answers to this same question that you didn't find helpful -- so folks can help fill in the blanks.",

            "answer_text": "First rule, never accept a \u2018promotion\u2019 without a pay raise or increase. Anything else, you are selling yourself short and taking on more responsibilities (which you will be held accountable to), without being compensated, is just asking for trouble. You will likely be stuck in the position for years without one for a company that misguides you into taking on more work without more pay. The proper thing to say is, \u2018wow, thank you so much for this opportunity, what additional responsibilities will there be before I accept the role?\u2019 Then, you take all the (documented) extra responsibilities, you go online and find out what the going rate is, then you come back and say, \u2018I\u2019ve thought it over, and I believe I have the resources to take on the larger role at the company, in order to help me finalize my decision, I need to know what the additional compensation will be\u201d. Notice I said, \u2018will\u2019, because it is NOT implied, it is expected. You should EXPECT an increase for more work. Would your garden keeper tear out brush and clean out your rose buds for free, in addition to mowing your lawn? I think not. Would a painter who is paid to do one job and asked to do more, do it for free? I think not. So it is the same with any other skill. Never take on more work without being compensated or without knowing what the additional role or duties will be. Good luck to you, ",
