            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re talking about an essay:  The basic formula of a five-paragraph essay is pretty straightforward: start with a snazzy hook, establish a thesis, maybe allude to talking points, illustrate talking points in body paragraphs, summary-conclusion. Your introduction will deal with the thesis and limited paraphrastic material alluding to your talking points.  For an essay that strictly deals with a comparison of two contrasting elements, this means you have two theses. Initially this may sound daunting, but really this premise only gives you twice the potential talking points with presumably the same minimum input requirements. Continuing on, your compound thesis will present both sides of the argument, eg: \u201cI like swimming at the pool, but I also like swimming at the beach.\u201d The easiest narrative flow in my experience is to present the least desirable option first, so per a contrast you can show the better option as the more desirable alternative. Even if that\u2019s not the point of your essay, this structure stimulates said flow.  Now instead of attempting to extrapolate talking points, or otherwise a multifaceted analysis of but one thesis, you have two to work from. Most difficult will be now to concisely and equally write two essays that blend into and complement each other. Such as the following: \u201cI like swimming at the pool and at the beach. The sheltered environment of a recreational swimming pool allows for swimmers to practice their form unimpeded by many environmental constraints, namely hungry wild animals including flesh-eating bacteria and uncontrollable temperature conditions. However, I find swimming at the beach to offer unequivocal benefits that speak to my animal organism, such as a nominally unrestricted expansive area in which to roam, as well as natural phenomena such as bioluminescence, sighting marine wildlife, an unparalleled connection to the ebb and flow of the tides, and the sun rising or setting on a far horizon. <Blah-blah-blah pool paragraphs> <Blah-blah-blah beach paragraphs> <Summary of talking points concurrently to suggest the revelation you want your audience to arrive at, followed by a conclusion>\u201d I realize I\u2019ve possibly delved too far into how to write the whole essay, but hopefully you will have gleaned how your opening (introductory) paragraph should sound, respective of the essay you want to write.  disclaimer: I\u2019ve only very rarely wrote an essay that amounts to five paragraphs. I prefer a free-flowing style because that\u2019s how my monkey-brain works. If you proofread your work at least a million times whilst reading it back to yourself, hopefully you will find your voice, and will be able to edit out all the extra noise. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the first thing that needs to be said is that it is important to outline your essay. Outlining your essay will help you work out the main organizational structure and will give you a template to follow as you develop your idea. Hence, in an introduction paragraph comes first and presents the basic information about the subjects to be compared and contrasted. It should present your thesis statement and the direction of your essay. ",
