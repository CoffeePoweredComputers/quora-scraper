            "answer_text": "When you apply to college, you\u2019ll need to complete an essay as part of your application. This is your opportunity to show admission officers who you are and to provide information about yourself that didn\u2019t fit in other areas of your application. The essay also reveals what you can do when you have time to think and work on a writing project. Choose a Topic That Will Highlight You Don\u2019t focus on the great aspects of a particular college, the amount of dedication it takes to be a doctor or the number of extracurricular activities you took part in during high school. Do share your personal story and thoughts, take a creative approach and highlight areas that aren\u2019t covered in other parts of the application, like your high school records. Keep Your Focus Narrow and Personal Don\u2019t try to cover too many topics. This will make the essay sound like a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that doesn\u2019t provide any details about you. Do focus on one aspect of yourself so the readers can learn more about who you are. Remember that the readers must be able to find your main idea and follow it from beginning to end. Ask a parent or teacher to read just your introduction and tell you what he or she thinks your essay is about. Show, Don\u2019t Tell Don\u2019t simply state a fact to get an idea across, such as \u201cI like to surround myself with people with a variety of backgrounds and interests.\u201d Do include specific details, examples, reasons and so on to develop your ideas. For the example above, describe a situation when you were surrounded by various types of people. What were you doing? Whom did you talk with? What did you take away from the experience? Use Your Own Voice Don\u2019t rely on phrases or ideas that people have used many times before. These could include statements like, \u201cThere is so much suffering in the world that I feel I have to help people.\u201d Avoid overly formal or business-like language, and don\u2019t use unnecessary words. Do write in your own voice. For the above example, you could write about a real experience that you had and how it made you feel you had to take action. And note that admission officers will be able to tell if your essay was edited by an adult. Ask a Teacher or Parent to Proofread Don\u2019t turn your essay in without proofreading it, and don\u2019t rely only on your computer\u2019s spell check to catch mistakes. Sure do consider useful tips from an Application Essay writing service. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are broad and specific learning opportunities to be found in researching other student's papers. As for me, observing how others approach a particular issue allows my own creative juices flow. Besides, analyzing a diversity of ideas and insights shows that even the most ordinary experiences could be turned into riveting essays. I accidentally found an application essay sample at studentshare. Reading it, I\u2019ve realized what to mention in my paper to satisfy the admission committee. The plan had worked out - my essay was highly rated. Currently, I use this sample collection from time to time to get inspired. Or when I simply have no time for the library. Also, try to find essay samples published by colleges. Some of them even include brief comments from admission officers. Hope you\u2019ll find the resource that meets your needs! ",
