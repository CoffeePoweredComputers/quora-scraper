            "answer_text": "Before they even start writing, you can brainstorm with them, and help them develop an outline by asking questions about what they want to say and where in the structure of the paper they want to say it. You can ask clarification questions. With limitations, you can suggest changes, but I would only offer suggestions where their language is unclear, and only if they're making a similar mistake in more than one place. And if you do, I'd offer a few suggestions, more about word choice for clarity, in as many directions as the sentence seems likely to be interpreted, so that the original writer can choose to clarify what they mean by using your word choice suggestions. I would avoid suggesting partial sentences or phrases-- that gets too close to writing their content. You can also suggest sources that would be valuable to supporting, refining, clarifying, or even rethinking their arguments, if you're aware of good information that supports or contradicts them. ",

            "answer_text": "Have them write a draft themselves, then read it and take notes of any issues you see with the arguments, evidence, or the grammar.  Give the marked up version back to them, and offer to elaborate on any of the notes you may have taken as well.   DO NOT succumb to the temptation to actually write portions of the essay for them, or to just make corrections and hand back a completed product.  The idea here should be to let them see the reaction it has on the reader so that they can figure out how the craft of writing works.  Taking this approach should prevent plagiarism from being an issue. ",
