            "answer_text": "It depends on how much you\u2019re crushing on them, if you two are close, or if you feel like you\u2019re ready. If it\u2019s not that big a crush but you still want to tell them, be short and quick to the point. If they\u2019re your best friend you\u2019ve known for several years, you want to write more in depth about how you feel and kinda write about the fun things you\u2019ve done together, saying something like \u201cI wanna do that more\u201d. If they\u2019re just a friend that you kinda know you could say you want to get to know them better and explain your feelings for them (although don\u2019t profess your undying love for them. Several guys I know have done that and it never worked out, just scared the girls away). Also think about how they\u2019re likely to take it. If they\u2019re shy then being too foreword about it might freak them out. All in all though, it\u2019s probably better to tell them in person. ",

            "answer_text": "I love this idea! There is something so romantic, in the extreme, fundamental sense of the word. Powerful. Intense. Committed. With this being said, I would be remiss not to caution you . Simply for I know not of whom you have in your sights ,and this fashion of expression may not be taken as it is intended, or as it was in a less tech advanced world. Certainly if it is \u201cyou\u201d, and such of your being, as I feel it must be , carry on! The response would carry such telling. This type of writing is for the writer, as opposed to the reader. Meaning, it is your very own personal core in ink. Let it flow from you. Do not, I repeat, do not begin this undertaking, if it comes with expectation, or manipulation. Ill not bore to explain the obvious here. Three bits of advice; do not ramble indefinitely. Remain focused, and on point. Always give an open reread. And most importantly, do not forget to mist you fragrance ever so long lightly. Love is for all the senses. And best of luck! ;) ",

Just tell em you got a crush on them or go into all that metaphorical expressions. Really whatever floats your boat, and won't turn you into a blushing mess before you can actually send or give them the letter. ",

Write about something that you both enjoy. Ask a question about what they think about the subject. Hopefully, that will cause them to write back. Keep it light and friendly. If something more comes of the relationship someday, fine. If not, no harm done with a few friendly letters. ",
