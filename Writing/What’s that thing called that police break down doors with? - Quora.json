            "answer_text": "It is called a Ram, its a small version of the battering ram that armies of old used to bash down castle doors to gain entrance. Now its just a few feet long and is swung by two officers at the lock set area and it bashes it in and the door is opened. It is sometimes slow and very noisy, and gives the bad guys time to bail out of a window or back door. There is also a new device that is called a Hydraulic Door blaster, it will exert tons of pressure on the door in the area where the lock goes in the door frame and will open a door in seconds very quietly. Then there is the military who use a thing called det.cord which is an explosive cord they hang on the door and it blasts the door down.  ",

They're generally called \u201cenforcers\u201d after one company that makes them, in the USA I believe. I also make & sell them in my little locksmith and security shop. Here's two \u201cBatterers\u201d under construction.  Between 7 and 15kg (to order), steel, and tough, they're designed to smash a door to bits if need be. ",
