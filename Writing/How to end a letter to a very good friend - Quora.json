But, you don\u2019t have to say \u201cLove.\u201d You can also end with a good wish for the person like, \u201cStay/Keep/Be well.\u201d Or, you can use, \u201cSee you soon\u201d if you might be meeting up in the near future. Something like \u201cWrite back soon\u201d or \u201cHope to hear from you soon\u201d also tell the reader that they are important to you. ",
