            "answer_text": "I love it when I see an old couple being cared by their family members. I see grandparents in most of the families sitting in a corner, in a room or may be spending time in balcony staring at nowhere. We all are so engrossed in life, in making career or enjoying our youth that we never look into the fact that we will also encounter this phase of life, sooner or later. Imagine yourself sitting in a room with your weak body. You need support to go out, you need support to walk but the heart in you is still a child (The heart never grows old, it just acts to be matured depending on time and situation), wants to express emotions and laugh loudly. But you have no one to share your sentiments and talks. Even if you get a chance to do so, you are considered to have lost your brain. You hesitate to ask your children for water as you have fear to face their irritation. You try to get up yourself, walk towards kitchen and drop the glass from your shivering hands. You increase the work for your young children who are already busy or disturbed with their own work. You then listen, \u201cPapa/Mama! What is the use of doing things on your own, when you know, you can not?\u201d It hurts, it hurts a lot, because you got up with the intention of not disturbing them at their work. Your good intention turned up as a disturbance. Alas! Guests come to your house, you feel good and want to talk to them, but they find you too modest and scanty to spend time with you. You crave for them and they go farther. You are so outdated and old-fashioned to them. Another case, your children are settled in different cities. You crave for their calls. They call you, but often they want to keep the call short. Why? Because they have a feeling that you can not understand them, their struggles and problems they are going through. You must know or must have the guessing ability about their mood. Your repeated questions may annoy them, your complains about your loneliness or deteriorating health may exasperate them and you end up losing their frequent calls. I have a small child. I am enjoying every beat of life with him. I am young, energetic and lively. I jump, I dance, I frolic \u2013 all with an intention to entertain him. But deep down, I am scared if he can do the same with me, when I grow old and become a child again? Do you also get alarmed with such thoughts? Thank you for reading. Stay Calm! Anshu ",
