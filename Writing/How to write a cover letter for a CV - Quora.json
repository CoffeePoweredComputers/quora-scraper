            "answer_text": "You already have awesome answers for how to write a cover letter for your resume. I will just state some rules you must never forget: Never write your cover letter before your resume[1]. Cover letters, by their very nature, must address the issues your resume raises.Ensure that your cover letter matches your resume in style and formatWrite facts and not general statements \u201cI am a result-oriented bla bla bla\u201d is bull shit. Instead, say something like \u201cI am a civil engineer with X years working experience and I have handled teams across X countries\u2026\u201dYour cover letter is an assessor, it should not duplicate your resume.Carefully write your cover letter to answer any key question your resume might raise such as an unemployment gap, reason for X number of job changes in 3 years.Pay close attention to incorporating keywords relevant to the industry you are applying to.Stick to making one point per paragraph.Show insights in your cover letter.End your cover letter humbly Never say \u201cIf you have some time, I will like to discuss my candidacy with you\u201d They don\u2019t have \u2018SOME TIME\u201d and who says they want to talk to you??? Instead say something like \u201cIf the firm finds me a fit based on my paper profile and would like to further discuss my candidacy, I would make myself available.\u201dI hope this helps.
