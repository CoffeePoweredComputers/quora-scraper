            "answer_text": "To avoid confusing them, try to avoid the use of any word that has over five letters (with the exception of Marine and a few other military terms). My youngest brother probably confused the Marines he was attached to (he was a corpsman attached to a unit that was inserted prior to the air war starting in GW1) when he called them his \u201cbullet sponges\u201d. They probably thought it was a term of endearment. Never call a Marine a Soldier. They realize their lower status and don\u2019t want to tarnish the image of Army Soldiers. Seriously now, you may ask anyone that has served what branch they were in and where they were deployed. Don\u2019t go beyond that, let them disclose what they want. A Marine I knew had his Purple Heart citation hanging on a wall at work. I noted it and left it at that. If he wanted to talk about it, he would. We talked some more about his tour in the sandbox as we got to know each other better. It bothered him, so I left the discussions about it to be initiated by him. I know I had problems seeing stories or talking about Vietnam for the longest time. I\u2019m 48 years out from my vacation in SE Asia, so it\u2019s easier. Plus, though I saw some things people shouldn\u2019t have to see, I didn\u2019t see or experience as much as a lot of people. Further discussion re: let the service person lead the discussion (triggered by a comment below). I just recently realized my dad (a combat engineer in the ETO) only talked about his experiences in the US and in England during the war, and in Germany after the war. He never talked about his experiences in France & Germany during the war. The only time he mentioned anything about what he did was when I was trying to figure out what to do. He said to avoid the infantry and combat engineers. He said that combat engineers get the task of fixing things or destroying things in bad weather while people are trying to kill you. He never said anything else about the war in mainland Europe. I had a friend that was in Vietnam. Eddie was small so he was a tunnel rat. I learned that as a bunch of us were talking one day and I said that his son would have been a perfect tunnel rat (his son was smaller). After he said he was a tunnel rat, he looked down, shook his head, and walked away. He never talked about his tour, I never pressed him. Don\u2019t ask a Marine (or any service person) if they killed someone, had a friend killed, saw a torn up body, etc. Let them dictate the conversation. Now for the truth in advertising. As stated in previous posts: I worked and was friends with a very impressive Marine Major. He got up to an E-6, became a warrant officer, then a commissioned officer before he retired as an O-4. I would have gladly served with him when I was in. Not all marines have an IQ approaching a rock (most haven\u2019t evolved to rock status yet - MARINE - Muscles Are Required, Intelligence Not Expected - the Major told me that). I still have the gift he gave me when I left NAVAIR. He said the Air Force, Navy, and Marines have F-35\u2019s. He thought the Army should have at least one. It\u2019s in my possession and is made out of an 8.5\u2033 x 11\u2033 sheet of paper with U.S. Army written on it. I love it.My brother loved his bullet sponges and they loved him. For him, \u201cBullet sponges\u201d was actually a term of endearment. He was also very p.o.\u2019d when one picked up a bullet (got wounded). He still is bothered by one he lost.",

            "answer_text": "This does\u2019nt really answer the question but I like this memory from decades ago still makes me smile. We Marines can be picky we don't want to be called Soldier we are Marines not Army Soldiers. We don't shorten the rank of Sergeant to Sarge and don't lump all NCOs into the nickname of Sarge that\u2019s Army slang. I was Marine Corps Corporal (E-4) attending a Navy technician school in the early 80s. I was the only Marine in a class of about 30 sailors. We had three instructors all retired Navy they were awesome and funny they picked on each other and the students as well. One of the instructors was calling me \u201cSarge\u201d I decided to correct him and ask that he use my correct rank. He acknowledged my concern and apologized then began calling me \u201cGunny\u201d which is correct Marine slang but indicates the rank of Gunnery Sergeant (E-7). ",
