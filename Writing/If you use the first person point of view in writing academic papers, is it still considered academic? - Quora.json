On the other hand, you\u2019d probably find it verging on impossible to write certain types of papers in entirely first-person point of view without beginning to sound like memoir, or some other sort of genre. As with most rules, this impression that one must avoid first person in academic writing probably begins in school with well-intentioned guidance to avoid the first person either to sound \u201cmore professional\u201d or to discourage students from lapsing into unfounded opinion and generalities. And as with most things you discover later about writing, the reality is that stylistic choice comes down to accepted disciplinary convention and preference more than most anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "If you used it constantly the writing would feel jarringly egotistical, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with using first person occasionally in an academic paper. The danger is that it feels so good you might be tempted to continue writing about yourself and forget about the topic\u2014or the pronoun information may become redundant. Ten sentences beginning with I believe that, I think that, I feel that is a waste of words\u2014we know these are your thoughts and that your cat did not write the paper. My experience is that Europeans, especially the French, use first person a lot, and Americans rarely. I average once or twice a paper for emphasis (Canadians always compromise in the middle). That\u2019s enough. ",
