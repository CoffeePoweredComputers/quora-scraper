            "answer_text": "When colleges say \u201cresearch paper\u201d, they mean a published research paper or a conference presentation/poster. If it\u2019s not published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal (or at least submitted for publication) or officially presented at a conference, it\u2019s not a research paper you can upload to support your college application. Usually, colleges specify that in their supplement instructions. For example, Caltech says in How to Apply as a First-Year Applicant: Additional Recommendations: In addition to the two required teacher evaluations, you are welcome to submit an evaluation from a mentor or supervisor who knows you in a different context. If you have published a scientific research paper, you may submit the full paper to Caltech. Instructions on how to submit these papers will be included in your application confirmation email. That being said, even if you don\u2019t have a published paper, you can write about your research in the application when you answer the questions about your activities and interests. Caltech uses the Common App, so you can write about your research in the main essay. This topic could fit the best: \u201cDescribe a problem you've solved or a problem you'd like to solve. It can be an intellectual challenge, a research query, an ethical dilemma - anything that is of personal importance, no matter the scale. Explain its significance to you and what steps you took or could be taken to identify a solution.\u201d Please read Irina Kitova's answer to Does publishing a research paper and getting a patent (without any parental involvement) guarantee undergraduate admission to MIT? For SlideRoom research supplement to MIT, you are supposed to submit a recommendation letter from your academic supervisor/mentor. If you did this research on your own, discuss it with an expert in the field (hopefully, with some academic weight) and ask them to read your paper and write a letter. Ideally, the letter should evaluate the results, comment on their importance, praise your skills, initiative, and academic potential, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have pointed out, only papers that are accepted for publication (even with revisions in process), in press, or published will help in the college admission process. You\u2019ve contradicted yourself in the comments: you claim here that your teachers don\u2019t know about your research, but in the comments you claim that you\u2019ve asked but no one will agree to be a mentor or review your work. So either they know about your research, even if they don\u2019t want to be involved in it, and can mention these discussions with you in a letter, or you haven\u2019t asked for their involvement (even as readers). This doesn\u2019t bode well for your research project. Those of us who\u2019ve been academic scientists work with colleagues for years hashing out a project (critiquing one another), then presenting our work at conferences for critique by peers, before writing a paper and submitting it for critique by peer reviewers and editors for publication. It isn\u2019t impossible to do what you are attempting, but it does seem more likely than not to produce a shoddy effort that would not help your college application. Find someone to read your work, if you are serious about it (setting aside the college app question). Reviews are unpleasant and easy to avoid, but they are necessary to research. If you have read widely in your field then you can identify others who might be more interested in your work, both locally and at a distance. If you work is significant, then you should be able to find someone interested enough to at least read the abstract for you. ",

You are going to waste the MIT admissions staff time to get a MIT professor to volunteer her/his time to review your research and write a critique for the admissions staff use??? And you are demonstrating great research methods by working in a Vacuum? With no review nor discussions during the process??? Think again, get a trusted person (teacher, mentor, etc.) to review the work and have that person submit a supplemental letter of recommendation. If you can\u2019t be bothered to ask someone you know, why are you willing to waste the time of MIT professors??? All the best, and I hope you reconsider. ",

            "answer_text": "A whole lot of stuff is written. Most of it is junk, and almost all of the rest has flaws. Researchers are busy people. They usually lack time to read the papers they want to, and are unlikely to even look at papers sent to them at random. If you want a research paper to be read, you should send it to a journal representing the appropriate field. The journal will arrange to have it reviewed; if it is ultimately accepted for publication, people at MIT or Caltech might read it. If you want to try to impress a particular person, you could send them your paper with a polite cover letter, but they would probably be more impressed if the paper was first accepted for publication.
