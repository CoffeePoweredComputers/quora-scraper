If it fits your plot, don\u2019t shy away from gore, torture or whatever. Cozy mystery? Sure, you\u2019ll have a murder there, but you\u2019ve promised your reader that you\u2019ll keep the description to a minimum, and gloss over the most disgusting details. The readers don\u2019t want that to be solved by analyzing the maggots in the wounds. You know what you\u2019re aiming for. Some people will complain anyway. Just keep your promises. ",
