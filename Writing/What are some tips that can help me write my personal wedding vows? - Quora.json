            "answer_text": "Okay so, this is going to be heartfelt.Excuse me if you think this is dramatic.Thanks and sorry in advance. :) Marriage is one of the most important and impactful decisions in life. Question: How does an undergraduate know anything about marriage? Don't tell me this is just the much stereotyped girl who writes mostly about dating and relationships only. Oh come on... Answer: I know how the institution and decision of marriage makes and mars many lives. I know better shit than many about marriage. So don't stereotype.Thanks again. Now, coming back to the question, I say the most beautiful marriage vows should be heartfelt only. But I'll try to write mine here: I'll never hide any illness or problem or whatsoever from my spouse.I'll always put my family first howsoever harsh the circumstances be and howsoever welcoming the relatives and every damn outsider seems to be.I'll always know that I need to put equal effort in nurturing our kids and it is much more than just give them a life and leave them to live and die on their own, which doesn't mean I'll only keep them close to my bosom; I'll put every effort in making our kids a package of warmth,sanity, rationality, love and kindness.I'll remember the purpose of my life and not waste it in futile efforts of bragging and self-obsession.I'll be a strong person and howsoever bad the circumstances around us be, I'll never let anyone of us or our kids feel insecure about us. We're a team and we'll always be.My motivation will be your love and your motivation will be my love.We'll not have kids till we're ready. If we're never ready , we'll never have or raise any kid in our house. Doing that, we'll save the then unborn from a life full of deaths and a death full of life.I'll respect my family and yours equally. I'll love them.I'll never curse anyone in the family or in the world because I know how and where actually it strikes the heart.I'll make sure our kids love us. They won't have a regretful life.( To be contd\u2026.) Much love to you and wish you a happy married life . :) Cheshta Bakshi. ",
