            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. From the language of your question, it is evident that you make rare grammatical mistakes while writing. The topic was simple and I am sure everyone knows the importance of education in present time. The simple language, in which you have written your question also, doesn't cause any problem and this is exactly what is expected from an ssc aspirant. What I understand from current trend that writing in simple word is an advantage (now a days). The writing language preference has also changed with time as the format of letters and applications has changed. But the content - of the essay - will matter. The way you have connected all points, will matter. How cleverly you have highlighted important points so that examiner finds it easy to read, shall matter. If you have written the points which can impress the examiner, you will surely get a good score. ",

            "answer_text": "I appeared in SSC CGL 2017 descriptive and scored 65 marks so i think i can give this answer. My writing skills are not that good but got average marks and this might be due to a decent content. I think content is more important than writing skill so if your content of the essay is good you will surely get average marks between 60 to 65. And this tier-3 is unpredictable and there is a possibility of getting less marks in good essay and high marks in average essay. So it is futile to expect anything from descriptive. You can hope for the best. ",
