            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll assume \u201cbeginner\u201d as in you haven\u2019t written anything yet. There are two approaches, pick an advanced language like Java, C, Python, etc. and attempt to learn it by learning simple concepts and building on those with learning more advanced concepts, OR the other approach is to start with a \u201clearning language\u201d, something like Scratch. I suggest the latter. Play with it for a week. Build simple things, then add more complex tasks to your program. Learn what things in the language do. Learn how to assemble pieces of code to work together to perform the task you have decided your program was going to do. Also, in that week learn how to \u201cdebug\u201d your program when it doesn\u2019t behave the way you wanted it to. This will be an essential and invaluable skill for every program you write because early on or even worse much later on, it could fail. Once you feel proficient enough to move on from the visual approach and want to write in a language that is used for professional applications and that software design or even just coding is something you\u2019re interested in, then go to the first option for learning as I described in the first paragraph. Use an industry grade language and start with small coding solutions, and build up from there adding new and more powerful concepts. In the beginning you will naturally write procedural oriented code. You will tend to think primarily in terms of what you want to do. You can write procedural code in any language, in fact, that\u2019s how the first programs were written, as procedural code. The coded was written and executed in a fashion with the tasks at hand being the focal point. With the more advanced languages (even in Scratch), you can think of your programs in a different way, in a way that doesn\u2019t follow process but rather in a way that \u201cmodels\u201d the elements within the problem set you are trying to write a code solution for. This is called \u201cobject\u201d programming. Think of it this way, in procedural programming, it is the procedure or ACTION, that is the main essential design goal. Get the actions done. What action happens next?, etc. Meanwhile in object programming, it is all about the objects that are pertinent to your problem. What objects are involved in the problem you want to solve? What can each object do? How do the objects interact with each other? etc. If you take a step back you\u2019ll notice that like this sentence and the other sentences I\u2019ve written, there is a noun (object), and verb (action), in each one. Hence, object programming is like thinking in nouns and verbs when constructing a sentence. Object programming then, is simply like speaking!! And we all know how to do that right? Object programming is a bit harder to grasp in concept yet it really shouldn\u2019t be because we all deal with objects and actions every day. When we pick up a new tech device that we\u2019ve never used before what do we do? We see a button or lever (noun/object), and we ask ourselves, what can it do (verb/action)? So in summary, procedural programming is defining all the actions that need to occur and begin writing sequential code that marches thru getting the actions done. Object programming is providing models (code), for each object you are trying to model and providing the actions (what each object can do). As an example, you might have code that models a player in a game, the player being the object/noun. You then define what the player is capable of doing or ways of behavior (the actions). It\u2019s really quite a fun way to think about programming really. I could delve in deeper here but I think I picked a good stopping point that keeps it simple, yet provides an overview regarding \u201cbeginning\u201d, which was your initial question. ",
