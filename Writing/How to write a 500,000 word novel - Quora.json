            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! As with so many questions here on Quora, you're leaving a lot to the imagination, such as why you'd want to write a novel that's this long (as others have pointed out, this will make it hard to sell), and whether you want it to be a GOOD novel or just want it to have that many words. So let me pause for a moment and figure out what assumptions I want to make when I'm writing my answer.  *hold music plays* Okay, I'm going to assume you want this book to be good, and that you have an epic story in mind that justifies that length (maybe five major POV characters, over the course of many many years, in an epic battle for control of the kingdom, or something!) And I'm going to assume you really want to write a 500,000-word book even though most people will say that's too long. The first thing I'll point out is that you're going to need to write a certain number of words per day. If you write 2000 words per day, you'll have 500,000 words in about a year (I gave you some days off).  If you want those 2000 words a day to go smoothly and not be super frustrating, I'd say you should make an outline first, and also do some character sketches. That way when you sit down to write, you won't just be staring at a blank page. And you won't fall into the trap of skipping your daily word count when you don't feel \"inspired.\" It's pretty hard to stay inspired over the course of an entire year (although I'm sure it has been done!) For purposes of comparison, I find that I tend to be able to write a scene a day if I'm really focused on my project, and my scenes tend to be about 1,200 words long. If I tried to do 2,000 words per day for an entire year, I might get pretty burnt-out. So you might want to adjust your planning according to how many words you can write a day without hating life. Still, even if you're a relatively slow writer like me, you can probably get to 500,000 words in two or three years if you work on an almost-daily basis.   Then, here's my final piece of advice. Cut up this monumental task into five 100,000-word sequels. This will give you some milestones to reach on the way to your goal, will allow you to cut your task up into more manageable chunks, and -- as others have pointed out, will make your book easier to sell! 100,000 words is a much more appealing length for agents & publishers.  Try to make it so the first volume can stand alone just in case the four sequels don't sell. Hope this was helpful, and good luck!! :)   ",

            "answer_text": "Holy cow! I would suggest breaking it up into three different books. People have short attention spans, which is why novellas are all the rage right now. Many people are looking for a quick read that will entertain them, but also allow them to put their book down and continue to function through their various responsibilities during the day.  Now epic fantasy tends to be a little different. Those readers know they are in for it, and they relish the challenge and the arduous journey before them. They are also the kind of people who can put the story down and actually function for the rest of the day without knowing what is going to happen next. Still, I caution you on deciding to throw all of your words in one basket. Ha! Did you catch that...little author humor there...just...ahem...moving on... From a marketing stand-point, it makes more sense to break it up into a series and make the first book free. I promise you this is a great marketing tool to get people hooked on your story and ready to continue your series, providing you've written an excellent book. If you absolutely have to write one book that is 500,000 words, kiss agents and publishers good-bye, not that I would encourage you to get a publisher since I'm all about Indie publishing, but if that was something you wanted to pursue then you have to break up that word count into separate books. Also, consider your target market and their attention span. Are people going to be willing to purchase a 500,000 word book for a large chunk of money? You can write it, but it won't sell like a series will. Finally, to actually write this monster of a book, you need to outline the crap out of it. For something this epic you need to make sure you know what your main plot points are and the main goals your characters must accomplish. Then craft your outline around those goals, wants, or needs. Grab a book that teaches you the fundamentals of plot and structure on amazon so that this story doesn't wander off into the quagmire of story tangent obscurity. An easy pit to fall into with so many words ahead of you. Good luck my friend. ",

            "answer_text": "I would first like to apologize for posting this under comment originally instead of answer. I try to pay attention better than this and I am considerably embarrassed at the mental aberration that happened on my part! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014. Why would you ever ask a question of that sort if you are, or wish to be, a writer? If you know how to design a story, the characters, the twists and turns, then when you write your book it will only be as long as it needs to be. If your book ends up being 500 pages that is an average of no more than 400 words per page (taking into account the one, two or three-letter words). When you write you also have to know a little bit about the business of writing and of the book manufacturing end. Today, especially, no Traditional Publisher wants to touch real lengthy books. When it comes to manufacturing hard covers, they want to know when they order 10,000 volumes that every copy will be sold. Right now the average cost of a mass market hard cover is $27 USD. Now consider how many people may have the money to be fortunate to buy hard cover\u2014I know I can\u2019t! As is it mass market paper back would still hover around the $15 mark. If you cannot get a Traditional Publisher to take your property, and you decide to published Independently (which is now becoming seriously acceptable) you will quickly come to learn that books in access of 500 pages (approx 160,000 words +/-) in order to make any money fall into the $15 to $20 range. Almost all will be paperback, with a few companies offering hardcover, but these are all print on demand which does bring costs down, but are ultimately harder to sell when you don\u2019t have the support system of adverting and placement within book stores. You also need exposure on-line to let the world know you have books for sale. Any way you look at it, writing a great book is a lot easier than getting anyone to buy it and read it. You also have to consider e-Books since that is quickly starting to generate larger sales than paper. How long should your e-book be and are you able to cut up your 500 page novel in 100 page parts (like a serial). E-Books are read on-the-go, by people on trains and buses, going back and forth to work, or reading during lunch time to take their minds off work, E-Books can generate more money through sheer volume if given in shorter doses. Rule of thumb - a book should only be as long as it needs to be and to have the goal of length first, is not the smartest way to approach book writing. Hope this helped? ",

            "answer_text": "How can I write a 500,000 word novel? Are you asking about publishing a work of this length? Because if not, the answer is simple. You write a 500,000 word novel by writing a 500,000 word novel. As for getting such a work published, if you expect such a novel to be published as a single volume, that would be unlikely. I am not (yet) a published author, but I am a graphic designer and know something about publishing, preparing a manuscript for print, and marketing for the publishing industry, having been involved in all these things as a designer. Most publishers these days limit a single volume to about 1000 pages That would be about 250,000 to 300,000 words (250-300 words per page, variance based on font choices and other decisions from the publisher\u2019s book designer) . A 100,000 word book would be about 400 manuscript pages. So you\u2019re looking at submitting a manuscript of about 2000 pages. Hefty. Most publishers aren\u2019t going to even consider that as a single novel, especially from an unknown author. You could pitch publishers to release a single a novel in two volumes, but I don\u2019t ever recall seeing that done lately. It would be far more marketable as a series of three or more novels. Therefore, you might be more likely to get published if you split your story into at least three coherent parts, each with a recognizable conclusion of some kind, but with some cliffhangers to encourage readership of your sequels.

            "answer_text": "Why does your book have to be 500,000 words long anyway? That is almost as large as War and Peace.  The easy way is of course to write in small chunks until you hit your word count but writing in that way is foolish. When I started out, I gave myself a goal of 1000 words a day, everyday.  I wrote a novella - it was called \"Crows will lead the way.\" I thought it was brilliant. It was a metaphysical journey of a soul and it had elements of horror, purgatory, redemption - it was amazing.  Or so I thought. When I gave it to my girlfriend to read it, she hated it. She told me this sucks Zubier. I could barely read it. I didn't understand most of it.  And she was right.  She was right because I had done what is the second mistake most beginner writers make which was write too much, instead of too little.  Write exactly how many words you need to tell your story. Then reduce it by 10%.  Each subsequent draft should be smaller than the one before. You are trimming the fat and making sure that the reader is getting the best possible experience.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m your target audience. I\u2019m a reader who loves big books. My favorite book, The Sunne in Splendour by Sharon Kay Penman is around 436800 words (1248 pages) but I can tell you Sharon\u2019s latest books are a LOT shorter. Her latest book, A King\u2019s Ransom is 896 pages (313,600). If she\u2019s paring down, so should you. So a 500,000 word novel? That\u2019s a generous two novels, and likely would sell better as five novels. Remember, word count isn\u2019t everything. Focus on telling a good story and not on how long it is, because that is what matters. In fact, show me a 500,000 word novel and I\u2019d be hard pressed to say a great editor could slice and dice a trimmer, better novel by removing 1/5th of it, minimum. Likely more. And 500,000 words is a looooong journey, many readers want some resolution much earlier than that. I can\u2019t imagine a plot that requires that length, without it being flabby or being able to be separated into more than one book. To put in perspective, GRR Martin, one of the best selling author\u2019s of today, his longest book was A Storm of Swords at 424,000 words. Your book would be a complete novel longer. Your book would be longer than the 473,000 of the Lord of the Rings, (which is most often packaged as three books) If the Great Masters can\u2019t, we can\u2019t. Now, can I say that for every writer? No. But chances are, playing by the rules is safer. ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, this is not a wise thing for you to tackle right now, but let\u2019s take the question at face value, rather than laugh at it. After all, the last two books in Brandon Sanderson\u2019s The Stormlight Archive are 450,000+[1] after editing, AND he writes novellas in between volumes. And he just raised $5.6M on Kickstarter[2] for a leather-bound volume of a book that is ten years old and everyone has already read. Maybe the rest of us are doing it wrong, and you\u2019re not crazy for wanting to write a 500,000 epic. Just be prepared to spend an insane amount of time on this. So, how do I write a 500,000 epic? Well, just for scale, I would start with Mary Robinette Kowal\u2019s story-length formula. I first heard about this tool on the Writing Excuses podcast: Ls=((C+L) *750)*1.5Mq What does this formula stand for? In simple English, you can get a rough estimate of the length of your story-idea (Ls) by adding together the number of characters and locations, and multiplying that sum by 750 ((C+L)*750). Then multiple the result by 1.5 times the number of MICE Quotient Elements the story uses (*1.5Mq). What is the MICE Quotient you ask? Orson Scott Card[3]\u2019s MICE Quotient[4] is a theory of story that revolves around four pillars: Milieu, Idea, Character, Event. There have been entire[5] books[6] written on the subject, along with hundreds of blog articles, so I won\u2019t go over it with any detail here, other than to show you how to use them in MRK\u2019s formula. So let\u2019s say I have a story idea. That story includes 20 named characters that have dialog and a bit of depth to them. Over the course of the story, the reader is taken to 40 distinct locations. My story has two Character plots in it, an A and B plot. It also has the main action plot of my antagonist and my Hero trying to overcome both each other, and the clock, in being the first to locate a particular MacGuffin in order to achieve their individual goals. This is a pretty big, ambitious story, mostly driven by the scope of the settings and characters. Let\u2019s see what our expected word count will be: ((20 Characters +40 locations) * 750)*(1.5*3 MICE Quotient Elements) = 202,500 Remember, this is a rough estimate, so you may end up with 150,000 words, or even 250,000, but it gives you a general idea of the scope of the story. So, how do I ramp this up to 500,000 in a satisfying way? The quickest way to ramp up the word count is through the MICE Quotient. Give more characters meaningful, on-screen arcs. This will necessitate increasing the amount of characters and locations in your book. What will make this satisfying to the reader is being able to tie all of these various plots and arcs together in a way that is important to the overall story, and the ending of the story. And that\u2019s incredibly difficult to achieve with three plot lines, much less the 6\u20138 plot lines you will need to achieve 500,000. In addition to making sure they all matter to the overarching plot, each of these character arcs and plot lines will also need to resonate with each other thematically \u2014 they need to be arguments for or against your controlling idea. They need to weave together and build a grand argument. And they need to do it in such a seamless manner that the reader is not aware of what has happened until it\u2019s all over and they\u2019ve had a chance to think about \u201cwhat it all means.\u201d Ultimately, to do this in a satisfying way, you will need to practice with smaller chunks of texts, with less storylines, with less character arcs. Ideally, learn how to write one or two arcs that weave together with a single plot in a satisfying way before attempting something like The Stormlight Archive. This will be your typical 90,000\u2013120,000 genre novel. And when you think about it like that, it becomes obvious how to write a 500,000 book. You are going to need to write five novels simultaneously that tackle the same theme, the same controlling statement, from different angles, using different characters, in different locations.

            "answer_text": "I guess the obvious answer is one page at a time.  But really, that size novel is not marketable and you have a better chance at being struck by lightening than finding a publisher that will offer you a contract for it.  Here are some guidelines for a more realistic goal: Novellette  (7,500 -  20,000  words):  Often  a  novellette-length  work  is  difficult to  sell  to  a  publisher. It  is  considered too  long  for  most  publishers to  insert  comfortably into  a  magazine, yet  too  short  for  a  novel.  Generally, authors  will  piece  together  three  or  four  novellette-length  works  into  a  compilation  novel. Novella  (20,000 -  50,000  words): Although  most  print  publishers will  balk  at  printing  a  novel  this  short,  this  is  almost perfect  for  the  electronic  publishing market  length.  The  online  audience doesn't  always  have  the  time  or  the  patience  to  sit  through a  100,000  word  novel.  Alternatively,  this  is  an  acceptable  length for  a  short  work  of  non-fiction. Novel  (50,000 -110,000  words):  Most  print  publishers  prefer a  minimum  word  count  of  around  70,000 words  for  a  first  novel, and  some  even  hesitate  for  any  work  shorter  than  80,000.  Yet  any  piece  of  fiction climbing  over  the  110,000  word  mark  also  tends  to  give  editors some  pause.  They  need  to  be  sure  they  can  produce  a  product  that  won't  over-extend their  budget,  but  still  be  enticing  enough to  readers  to  be  saleable. Imagine  paying  good  money  for  a  book  less  than  a  quarter-inch thick? Epics  and  Sequels  (Over  110,000  words):  If  your  story  extends  too  far  over  the  110,000 mark,  perhaps  consider where  you  could  either  condense the  story  to  only  include relevant  details,  or  lengthen  it  to  span  out  into  a  sequel, or  perhaps  even  a  trilogy. (Unless,  of  course, you're  Stephen  King  -  then  it  doesn't matter  what  length your  manuscript  is  -  a  publisher  is  a  little more  lenient  with  an  established author  who  has  a  well-established  readership) from :  How  Long  Should Your  Story  Be?

            "answer_text": "I will give you a serious answer: About 1200 words a day for a year.  But I would suggest the following: Each day, don't just \"free write\" those 1200 words, but copyedit and reedit those words until they sing. End with a segue to help you write the next 1200 words the next day.Have a loose outline for the whole book, but always have the next few days more firmly mapped out, so you don't waste time.So, a typical day would be 9-11 a.m., write your 1200 words;  11 a.m. to 12 noon, copyedit those words; 8-9 p.m., give another look at the day's words, and scribble down the key things you will write about tomorrow. Wake up at 8 a.m., make a coffee, give one last look at your previous day's 1200 words, making tweaks here and there, and then by 9 a.m., start the routine again. (You can switch this up, per your lifestyle.)Also, because this is a sizable work, set up a system where you can easily fact check along the way. For example, if you reintroduce a character from page 7 on page 177, you will have to go back and find out his physical details and such. You don't want to waste time looking for previous details, or making mistakes.Finally, I wouldn't write one 500,000 word book. Make it so that it's five interconnected 100,000-word books. Then you can sell them one at a time.  You can work on the other four after the first 100,000 word book is done.",

            "answer_text": "By writing 500,000 words. The question you SHOULD be asking is: who in their right mind would BUY a 500,000 word novel from an unknown writer? The answer to that question is: no one. Start small. Try writing a short story. Then maybe a chapter. Then maybe a novella. Then work your way up to a novel. A novel of 80,000 words or so. Save your epic tome for a later time when you've built a name for yourself, have a following, and can justify a price tag in line with that expensive of a book. Keep in mind that the longest Harry Potter Book (Order of the Phoenix) is  257,000 words. Ayn Rand's longest book (Atlas Shrugged) as 561,996 words. Leo Tolstoy's  epic (War and Peace) was 587,287 words. Most books - good books - come in at between 80,000 and 100,000 words. To get in the habit of writing every day (which you're going to have to do religiously if you plan to EVER finish a 500,000 word thing) consider participating in National Novel Writing Month (\"NaNoWriMo\") or Camp NaNoWriMo.

            "answer_text": "You need to have an idea that has a lot of scope to be able to write a novel of that length. So first things first some practical bits. Typing at an average of 50 words per minute you are looking at 10,000 minutes, 166.6 hours or 6.94 days worth of time. Double that for a simple edit and read through and your are looking at 333.3 hours straight. An hour a day for a year and you could potentially have written it and have done a spelling and grammar check. Now the average novel is somewhere around 80,000 words. Traditional publishers can cap out at 100,000 so getting it published (especially as a first novel) are slim. An issue you will have is that people will become pickier with any large pieces of exposition or tangents that don\u2019t connect to the main plot properly. They will be wondering why the book is so long and if they see anything that could easily be edited out then they are likely to view the work as an unedited manuscript. So your best bet is a series. Some series of books are essentially one book in several parts. This is what you would be looking at for inspiration. To make sure that the story connects all of the way through you need one main plot or story arc that goes on for the whole 500,000 words. This could be something like a war where the first chapter is the opening and the last the conclusions. the events are therefore taking place in the war. Wars have campaigns and battles and small skirmishes which can be translated into groups of chapters, chapters or scenes in a chapter. These all come together to make the main story. This is basic novel writing advice but you do need to consider the fact that your main plot has to have a big scope. Now while I say series I only mean that for practical purposes. Try writing the whole thing knowing that it is going to get split into smaller sections to get published. This will give you sections that you can complete as smaller targets. If you don\u2019t give yourself those milestones then you are likely to burn out and never complete the work. I would say the difference between a complete 500,000 words and 5 100,000 word novels would be the strength and obvious nature of the main plot. When writing a series you want to keep a common thread going but at the end of each book you want to have a decent conclusion to that book with many questions answered. In a 500,000 word novel I suspect that that would be less important. you are more likely to have your sections end in the same way as chapters. So to sum up. You need to set aside a lot of time to physically write and edit the whole thing. You need to have a plot that is very strong. You can go off on tangents but they need to be relevant. Avoid just fleshing the thing out with 10 page descriptions of the city gate. Make sure you track everything you do in another document or use scrivener or some such system so that you can keep the writing coherent. Be prepared to have to split it into several smaller novels to get it published. ",

How do you do that? As an example, I\u2019ll use THE BIG NOWHERE by James Ellroy. a) Take a FULL PAGE of text in any chapter, and count the number of lines. (I used page 150 \u2014 it has 44 lines.)  b) What is the last numbered page? (pg. 406)  c) Estimate that there are 9 words per line.  So THE BIG NOWHERE, according to this guideline, is 9 x 406 x 44 = 160,776 words, more or less. Try that with a few popular examples of other books. (If you have a few RECENT books, maybe you should try those \u2014 something published in the last 5\u201310 years.) Consider that people will probably be WILLING TO PUT UP WITH a huge 250,000 word novel under exceptional circumstances; e.g., if it\u2019s the third book in a popular trilogy, like The Return of the King, or the next Hunger Games novel, then no publisher is going to quibble over something like a bigger-than-average word count. But if you\u2019re submitting your first book, and you\u2019re not a famous name, then you don\u2019t have any branding power to get an audience\u2019s attention in the marketplace.

            "answer_text": "I suggest you don\u2019t set a goal of writing a 500,000 word novel. That would amount to about 1,000 pages. That would likely be a cumbersome read at best, and you would not be able to garner a significant audience for it. Instead, I suggest you set out to write a \u201cgood\u201d novel. Write your story from beginning to end. Just get it down on paper. Then, go back and rewrite it. During the second write, you will make a lot of cuts and perhaps add some stuff, too. After the second write, you should go back and revise. That means refine and clean up the novel. At the end of the process, your goal should be to have a good novel that is ready for someone else to read, someone you trust will give you an honest critique. If they enjoy it, but have suggestions to improve it, that\u2019s your goal. If they say,, \u201cIt\u2019s great. Don\u2019t do anything else to it,\u201d you might want to get another reader. Like anything worthwhile, it\u2019s a process. Follow the process, and you will write a good novel that will probably not be 500,000 words. Good luck! Eileen Albrizio ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. One word at a time. If you just want to write a 500,000 word novel, that's 1000 words a day for about a year and half. If you type 50 wpm, that's 20 minutes a day. Seriously though, why 500,00? Why not 1,000,000? Or 50,000? Or any number in between. Why are you hung up on a particular number before you even know how many words it will take to tell your story? Why not make it the length your story needs to be? With Kindle and other e-books, you are not confined to what a novel \"should be\".  It's about the story and the characters. Whether it's 5000 words or 5,000,000, make it the length it needs to be to tell your story. No more, no less. Tell your story. Tell it well. Get feedback from beta readers and incorporate their suggestions. Get more feedback. Keep improving it. When a trusted beta reader (not your mom, not a friend, but a critical one that has torn your book apart) says something like, \"Well, there's a few times I would have used a different word, and there's a typo on page 163, not to mention a missing comma on page 420, but else, you are good to go.\", well then, you're good to go ",

            "answer_text": "It's not a question of how, but a question of should. If you have a story to tell, write it. Then edit it, polish it until it's ready and then look at the word count. If you want to publish through an agent or publisher, some of them do have a limit to the size of the book they will take on. Also, as someone else has mentioned, there are people who won;t be interested in reading a book that long, and, the word count of a book is not a selling point. (when did you last see an advert screaming 250 thousand words of pure pleasure ...) Also, if you are thinking about self publishing, think about the production costs should you decided to release a paperback version through something like Createspace print on demand. As an example, a work of around 170 thousand words, fits into around 496 pages of a 6x9 inch sized book, the least amount of money Createspace will let you sell that for, is around \u00a39.99 sterling, and off that each copy sold, you will get approx 56p. Of course, you can set the price as you wish, but who's will pay in excess of \u00a312, \u00a313, \u00a325 for a paperback by an unknown author? If you tell the story and it does come in at 250 thousand words, have you thought about splitting it into a series? ",

I can understand people who write 500,000 words as a labor of love, and can\u2019t bear to part with any portion of their darling, who would rather fight for 20 years to get it published (or publish it themselves) than delete a single word. But if you haven\u2019t even started yet, why on *earth* are you targeting a length that every professional writer on quora will tell you is a death sentence for novels? Why don\u2019t you set yourself a goal appropriate to the market, that maximizes your chance of success? Target 90\u2013100,000 words. Up to 20,000 more for fantasy or science fiction, less for YA. That\u2019s the sweet spot. If you have a larger story to tell, plan it out as a duology or even a trilogy. The multiplies your income opportunities, too. It is difficult for me to think of anything more foolish that setting out on a project by establishing parameters which will guarantee its failure\u2026but this is quora, so i\u2019m sure there is something more foolish out there :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Easy.  Don't cut anything, go off on tangents, and ignore the advice of everyone who tells you that novels shouldn't be that size. Look, my last book was in the range of 250,000 words, and I got a LOT of flak for that.  And rightly so - critics like it, sure, and apparently most of the people who finish it do, but there aren't quite as many in that latter group as I'd like.  250,000 is pretty much pushing the upper limit of what most readers will tolerate.  The only reason it was tolerated AT ALL is that it was a sequel to another work.   Writing isn't an endurance contest.  If it's a contest at all, it's one where you're trying to build a ship in a bottle.  As tempting as it might be to cram everything you can think of in that bottle, at a certain point it stops being a ship and starts just being a bottle of assorted parts glued in place. You should realistically be aiming for about 1/5 of that, particularly if it's your first work you're trying to shop around.  Otherwise you're going to find it impossible to sell.  I actually went into all the reasons for why this is in my answer to another question: Can I publish my 1,000,000 word novel? All the same reasons it's a bad idea still apply for a novel half the size of that one. ",

My novel is currently around 150,000 words, which is fairly long. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has around 260,000 words. Don\u2019t shoot for length, shoot for content. Whenever I say \u201cguess how many words I have now\u201d to my dad, he always replies: \u201cbut are all of them good words?\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean that my characters don\u2019t curse sometimes. It means that all of the words are totally necessary to the story. Only when I can sincerely answer \u2018yes\u2019 am I truly getting somewhere. ",

With that being said, your book can be as long as you want it to be, you just have to justify it's length every step of the way. There are some amazing short story collections by brilliant authors that tell entire stories in 20 pages or less. But then there are also the \u201cWar and Peace's\" of the world as well. As someone who is writing a science-fantasy book myself, with a similar length coming up in the outlining process, I do have it clearly segmented into three distinct parts that could make up a trilogy. As far as publishing is concerned, because my own project is that ambitious, because I am unpublished, I am trying to gain more experience by writing another book first and will try to get that published in the interim.
