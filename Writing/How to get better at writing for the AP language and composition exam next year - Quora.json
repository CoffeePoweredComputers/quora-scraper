            "answer_text": "Wanna know a secret? Doing well on an AP Lang essay isn't primarily about how you write. It's about what you write, and making what you write sound convincing. I happen to be a good writer, so I didn't struggle much with AP Lang essays. I definitely got a decent number of points just for diction and general control over the brevity or lack thereof of the points I wanted to make. But I got far more points for making deeply convincing arguments, regardless of how they were written. There's 3 kinds of essays on the AP Lang exam. One of them is the Argument essay, where you're basically given a topic or a statement by someone and you have to formulate an argument supporting or challenging the statement. By the end of September, I was already doing well on every Argument essay. Why? Because I knew how to debate, and the skill being tested in the Argument is exactly what you learn by being on a debate team. You get a topic you know very little about, you critically think about what the topic entails, and you take a side without getting to look into any evidence going either way. In both, the trick is always to connect the argument with a broad talking point that you're already experienced in arguing for. If you aren't someone who already debates politics with people regularly, find a couple of positions from a few different political perspectives and learn to talk your way through them really well. Then when you write an essay, use those talking points as irrefutable support for your argument. In AP Lang, I challenged myself to use an appeal to \u201cthe wisdom of crowds/the free market\u201d in every Argument essay for the entire year. I succeeded (although, of course, the prompt on the actual AP exam ended up being about free trade versus fair trade, which did sort of put a damper on that plan). In real life I am in no way a staunch free market advocate; it\u2019s just really easy to make a coherent argument for and pretty much impossible for a reader to refute (without going into a tirade decrying capitalism, which they will never do). In general, you want to practice by arguing a point you know is utterly moronic. That's the only thing that can possibly prepare you for the ridiculously obscure and, frankly, unimportant topics that tend to come up on the exam- one of the prompts for me was to debate the pros and cons of privatizing the US Postal Service, without providing any data concerning the efficacy of the current postal services or private providers or anything else. A few weeks ago, I went to a college political union debate, where a debater somehow pulled off one of the most ridiculous sounding talking points I've ever heard. She argued that we shouldn't legalize drugs because doing so would make the government regulate drug selling licensing - presumably favoring big pharma - rather than leaving drug profits to cartels, and would therefore be propping up big corporations at the expense of small businesses. It was bewildering yet brilliant and, despite not being in line with how we normally think about things in America, no refutation could reasonably claim she was objectively wrong. If her argument was an AP Lang essay, she probably would've gotten a perfect score. You can make just about anything into a cogent argument if you spin it right, and AP Lang is about making a cogent argument more than anything else. If anything, your being a \u201cscience and math person\u201d is a good thing for Lang, because that means you presumably have a strong analytical ability that you can use to quickly put together irrefutable logical arguments. Debating, and arguing in general, does require lots of nuance and \u2018charisma\u2019, but it also requires a ton of analytical dexterity. Debating is like a calculus problem; it's about using the formulas (talking points) you have comfortably in your wheelhouse, but also knowing how to apply them in novel ways so that you can use them to solve (justify) any problem (position). So if you want to do well on AP Lang? Learn to argue - in the same way that you would learn math. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you have a process for writing? I thought I was a pretty good writer until I got to grad school and realized I was absolutely not prepared. What helped me was: 1. Doing an outline of what I'm going to write. Within that outline I would denote the points I'm trying to make. Under each of those points I would put quick points of evidence to support those theories/thoughts. And from those bullet points, I expand them into sentences, quotes from the literary or scientific texts I'm using, etc. and before you know you have a 35 page paper :) 2. Have someone else proofread your work and provide feedback for edits, places you need to expand, places that need omission, etc. It's make a huge difference when you have a different set of eyes on a body of work.
