            "answer_text": " Handwriting of a female serial killer of seven men.  Many people who say they have \"bad\" handwriting, don't.  Some of those whose handwriting seems Catholic school neat and scrupulous are in fact low scorers on many significant personality traits. \"Messiness\" of handwriting may have nothing to do with badness, and may in fact signal hyper-creativity, the ability to think abstractly, the ability to get along in many variable situations, and a lot of other not bad stuff.  You really cannot know if your handwriting is \"bad\" unless it is totally illegible or, as graphologist say, the thinking patterns are \"flatlines.\"  There are lots of handwriting myths that won't die, such as physicians being terrible handwriters.   We have analyzed and evaluated more than 130,000 handwriting samples from medical doctors worldwide and, contrary to popular legend, only about 10% of these doctors' handwritings are unreadable, mostly because the words are scrawled under the pressure of performance. This is about the same percentage as the rest of the population.  Yes, there is some \"bad\" handwriting out there (we are often sent ransom notes, suicide notes, and letters from the criminally deranged for analysis) but most of it is not bad at all.  Handwriting may reveal some 250+ traits of personality. We can see procrastination, low energy, lack of integrity, poor organization skills, confusion, and much more in handwriting. We can see these traits in handwriting that to some minds may seem neat and pretty, but is in fact filled with deceit and shallow thinking.  Please do not be fooled by the raw appearance of handwriting. Biometric graphologists are able to make precise opinions on strengths and weaknesses in personality through handwriting, and their opinions are held in high esteem by employers on five continents.

            "answer_text": "Without seeing your handwriting, I can make only general comments. However, most \u201cmessy\u201d handwriting has two factors. The first is that you may not be forming your letters correctly, efficiently, or consistently. The second is that you may be trying to write too fast. There are things you can do to change this. The first is to download a cursive writing sample from the internet (Palmer method is one.) It is designed to make efficient use of strokes, with all letters starting on the line, and the entire word written in one \u201cgo\u201d, before lifting your implement from the paper to go back to dot the i\u2019s and cross the t\u2019s. This method (and some others) maximize the muscular and neurological aspects of handwriting to reduce fatigue and fully use the arm muscles, not just hand and wrist movements which impair many writers. (Place your arm prone on a desk or table as if you are preparing to write. Move your hand forward and backward, left and right, relying on the large muscle on the underside of your forearm (I forget the name of this muscle.) That is the engine for your writing and will prevent crabbed, cramped writing. Then practice the formation of letters, writing the entire alphabet in sequence without lifting your pen or pencil. Be mindful. Pay attention to using smooth strokes. The second thing is to practice this several times a day for about a week. Take your time to make the finished product look beautiful. I always told my students that their papers took their places when they were not present, and judgements were made about them based on the appearance of their handwriting. Many times the handwriting was judged by someone with no knowledge of the person behind it. Take pride in your work. This becomes a habit after a you follow this advice for a week or two. If you find yourself falling back into messy writing, repeat the procedure. You will note that this information applies to cursive writing, which is the only neurologically informed approach to handwriting. Printing was designed for machines. A writer who uses printing instead of cursive handwriting finds the result choppy, inefficient, and tiring; in your case, messy. It requires stops and starts after each stroke, and placing the pen or pencil in space so that there is no momentum or fluidity. A word about how \u201chandwriting\u201d is taught in most schools in the US. Cursive writing was developed before the use of typewriters and computers, and employed in business and record-keeping for its legibility and ease of use by the writer. In the early 20th century, when immigrants to the US entered large city school districts such as New York and Boston, many students used non-Roman alphabets such as Greek and Cyrillic, which could not be easily taught in public schools. The idea was that making handwriting look like printing would ease the transition and create a level playing field for new arrivals. Printing was taught at the first and second grade; by third or fourth grade a transition was made to cursive writing. Because so many struggled with printing, for the reasons given above, by the time they transitioned to cursive, writing was an unpleasant ordeal and many children felt unable to make a change. Teachers started accepting printing (albeit of poor quality) and we have reaped the results of that practice for a century now. As a Montessori teacher, whose preparatory work involved study of biomechanics and kinesthetics, I always used cursive (Palmer) to teach writing from the beginning, with sandpaper letters and practice in a sand tray to provide the guidance for children, some starting at age 3. Most children became proficient writers with beautiful, legible handwriting in short order, before they became proficient readers. (This may be due, in part, to early preparation of the hand and eye found in authentic Montessori classrooms.). For definitive reference, I recommend neurologist Frank R. Wilson, MD\u2019s The Hand: How its use shapes the brain, language, and human culture (ISBN# 0-679\u201341249\u20132.) I look forward to hearing from you after you have developed dextrous, fluid, beautiful handwriting. ",
