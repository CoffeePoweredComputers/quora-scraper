            "answer_text": "Because Racism is an exquisite kind of evil\u2026it only shows its face to its intended victim. Like Bullying, No-one else sees it. You never see the nice neighbor when he or she is spewing the n-word at black children that walk too close to his lawn. He always shows a smile at you. Likewise, your Black friend isn\u2019t there if you ever have to grit your teeth through \u2018Ching-Chong Chinaman\u2019 (And Yes, stupid white people still say that stupid little ditty\u2026they think it\u2019s riotously funny, but only when an Asian American hears it behind their back). But if your Black Friend is present, nothing will be said. Your Black friend is not there at work when you, being the most qualified person on the team, get passed over for the White guy\u2026because it\u2019s naturally assumed by the White Manager that a \u2018Good\u2019 Asian Team Member work best as \u2018Support\u2019\u2026but never \u2018Leadership\u2019. You\u2019re there to help Them Move Up\u2026but not to move up yourself \u2018Over Them\u2019. Then there are the little lesser slights\u2026Like: Your Black friend isn\u2019t there when a friend brings a guest with them to your home and you sit down with your Family for dinner\u2026maybe mashed potatoes and fried chicken\u2026and the guest insouciantly asks: \u201cI thought we were gonna have pork fried rice or butterfly shrimp or something.\u201d (I call this offense the Weird White Ethnic Food Rule: That\u2019s when White People think that the whole reason for the existence of other ethnicities is to provide them with Restaurant Cuisine) Your Black friend isn\u2019t there when an associate or a neighbor thinks it\u2019s a riot to mimic a bad \u2018Charley Chang\u2019 accent and you just grit your teeth. Then there\u2019s the History Thing: Your Black Friend does not know what Your Father or your Grandfather went through and endured in the past\u2026 Your Black Friend, like most White Americans, never actually thought of the social and political reasons WHY every city had a \u2018China Town\u2019. Your Black Friend, like Most White Americans only learned of Chinese/Asian History that connects to Western Civilization from our High School History Books: Which basically only amounts to The Opium Wars\u2014 which don\u2019t paint the Chinese side of the situation in a good light. (But the fact that the British made an entire economic Trade model on being Opium Drug Dealers\u2026is kind of never really pointed out.) Or the fact that Chinese workers were key to the expansion of the Railway Systems out west? I learned of these things from my room-mate in college late one night after he threw an unabridged dictionary at me in anger (He missed on purpose, Thank God! \u2014 Unabridged Dictionaries are VERY BIG. That\u2019s how angry he was). I had said something, unthinkingly\u2026and his anger boiled out. He was angry at me because even though, he gritted his teeth and bore it from others\u2026he wanted \u2018Better\u2019 from the person he called his Friend. This is why I counter the easy argument from most unthinking White People who say things like: \u201cAsian Americans are Good Minorities\u201d by telling them: \u201cYou have NO freakin\u2019 idea how much repressed anger you\u2019re playing with.\u201d If this fellow is STILL your Friend \u2026 next time, just out of the blue \u2026 TELL HIM some little piece of Your Family\u2019s History. Tell him some of the History that he was Never Taught in History Class. Because History is the crucible defines Us. And while Racism affects you differently\u2026and you react differently\u2026your Friend, if he is a Good Friend, should go quiet as he processes what you reveal and compares it to what he knows\u2014and what he never knew. And Goodness knows, Life\u2019s Travails become easier to bear when you know you have Friends who can understand\u2026even if you don\u2019t outwardly say anything. Good Luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Stereotypes exist in real life and on the whole, they are often true. However and individual, as a sample of one, doesn\u2019t represent a stereotype. All that said, Asians ARE discriminated against. However, race also plays in their favor. They have strong family bonds/support, are encouraged to advance in education. They often do what other less successful races should do. That success makes your Black friend jealous. Sadly, many Black have been raised to assume the \u201cvictim\u201d role. It is like cancer and destroys generations of Black families. ",
