Can you picture it? hear it? feel it?What words and feelings do you associate with that \u201chome\u201d?What kind of essay do you want to write: informative? persuasive? creative? humorous?With partial answers to those questions, you can begin to develop your \u201cmessage.\u201d What is the main point you want to get across to your audience (readers)? Write down that point! You\u2019re going to keep going back to it. At this point, the steps are the same for all essays: write your thesis statement (message), identify the points you want to make, develop a structure for the order in which you\u2019ll make your points, create a draft of the essay (doing whatever research you might need to do to get your facts in order), revise the essay to ensure all the points directly and effectively support the message, revise the essay to improve the language/diction, tighten the conclusion, proofread, and deliver!
