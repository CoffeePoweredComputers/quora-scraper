            "answer_text": "You say that you\u2019re frustrated with how you\u2019re writing, and you want to feel better about your writing. Well, there\u2019s no one single way to do that. In addition, each writer is an individual and their feelings will stem from a variety of sources that they may or may not be in touch with within themselves. If you want to explore your feelings, especially the roots of your frustrations, fears and aspirations through meditation or with the help of a journal or counselor or whatever, that may help free you from these negative feelings. Unfortunately, especially if you do this on your own or you partner with someone who isn\u2019t a good fit for you in terms with giving advice that will lead to more writing, you might become even more frustrated and stop writing altogether. It\u2019s still worth a try. Just be cautious, conservative, and go forward at a slow pace so that if your frustrations don\u2019t seem to improve, you can switch strategies before they get worse. For me, I\u2019m a doer. I prefer to work out my problems in a hands-on way. I also love to learn. So for me, when I feel like my writing is stuck, I refer to books that include lots of exercises. Mary Buckhams books are great for that sort of thing. I recommend that if you want to give her work a go, to start with Writing Active Hooks 1. (I know I\u2019ve been recommending this a lot\u2014I swear I don\u2019t know her. It\u2019s just a really good book.) I also did well with Ursula LeGuin\u2019s Steering the Craft. If you\u2019re not as hands-on, you may still benefit from books on writing. Stand outs that worked for me include Story by Robert McKee and Self Editing for Fiction Writers by Browne and King. But every writer is different and learns different lessons in different ways during different stages of their writing. So don\u2019t panic if my suggestions don\u2019t work for you. Just try a different book. The one thing that I\u2019m pretty sure won\u2019t work is if you keep doing the same thing you\u2019ve been doing over and over again, hoping you\u2019ll have a breakthrough. Study other writers, educate yourself, and reach deep inside yourself. Maybe you won\u2019t be able to figure out the why of how you got stuck in this frustration loop, but that\u2019s not as important (at least in the short term) as figuring out how to get out of the loop and go forward with your writing. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Congratulations! You are a real writer. That is, you are suffering from two traits that plague many, if not most, writers. The first is lack of confidence in your writing. I know many writers in person and more from social media. I don\u2019t know any who are both good writers and confident that their books are the best they can be. That\u2019s because of the second trait - perfectionism. I don\u2019t know why writers in particular often have this form of OCD, but it seems we do, in droves. There are a couple of things you can do about it. The first is don\u2019t write in a vacuum. Join a writer\u2019s group or a critique group. Find supportive people who will give you constructive advice, rather than simply telling you you\u2019re great or tearing you down. I\u2019ve found writers to be a generous lot, so I\u2019m confident you can find such a group, online if not local. You may also want to take some classes in craft, online or through a local college or junior college. Next, practice being good enough in every aspect of your life. That doesn\u2019t mean being complacent about improvement. We can all improve. However, there is a point of diminishing returns in any individual endeavor. Do you start over editing your book every time you sit down to write? Stop it. Finish your book. It won\u2019t be perfect, and may not even be good, yet. Turn it over to a third party - preferably a professional editor, but at least to a reader or two who read in the genre - for critique. We call the latter \u2018beta readers\u2019. A beta reader isn\u2019t an editor. Instead he or she is an interested and aware reader who is willing to point out potential improvements in your plot arc, holes in the story, inconsistencies, and occasional grammar or typo lapses. Take the feedback and revise your book, preferably in some organized fashion. Here\u2019s an article that may help. One-Pass Manuscript Revision: From First Draft to Last in One Cycle When it\u2019s gone through one or two iterations, turn it over to a copy or line editor, make the necessary corrections and publish it. Don\u2019t look back. Your next book will be better. And when people read your books and say how much they enjoy them, you will feel better about your writing, though you still won\u2019t think it\u2019s your best. There\u2019s always improvement to be made. ",
