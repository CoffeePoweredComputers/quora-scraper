            "answer_text": "In college I tried to do a photo essay on an idea that was given to me by my professor. My heart wasn't in it because it wasn't MY idea and so the photos that came out of it were mediocre at best. I could list lots of topics that I think would make good photo essays - but they would be my ideas not yours. Like a written essay a photo essay has to tell a story or have a message. It can be about big world changing events or as small as how to tie a shoe. Think of things that have meaning to you; family, friends, where you live, work or play. What makes you happy or sad. What issues are important to you. What really ticks you off. There are countless possibilities out there. ",
