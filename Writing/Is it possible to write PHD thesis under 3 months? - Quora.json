            "answer_text": "First anything is possible. When you ask this question, I take it that you are asking about the writing part - that means you have completed your research, data analysis and conclusions, have a fairly up to date lit review that might need a bit of updating and it you\u2019ve already got a draft of your methodology chapter that would help too. The challenge in writing your thesis in under 3 months is that you have to be committed to sit down and write every day or at least 5 or 6 days per week. I recommend if that is your goal, that you connect with a writing coach or partner with another doctoral student or someone who will encourage you, act as a sounding board and most importantly light a fire under your feet when required. The more work you have already done - with drafts of some chapters, data analysis and gaps, and your conclusions will help you complete more quickly. There\u2019s also something about talking about what you are writing that can also help you in the process - that\u2019s where it\u2019s valuable to have a friend or two who will be a sounding board, ask you how you\u2019re doing (and wait for the answer) and ask you what you\u2019re writing about today (and wait for the answer). Talking about what you are writing, how it\u2019s going, what new thinking you\u2019ve got is all part of the process. Thesis work including writing was never intended to be a solo sport - yes you have to write it all. And you write better when you have or make opportunities to talk about what you\u2019re writing about fairly often, I\u2019d suggest at least weekly. Best of luck in your thesis writing. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote mine in a few hours. Where I went to grad school, the proposal defense was far more important. And it was a relaxed setup where you could get your key results and then defend a proposal \u2014 probably a semester before the dissertation defense. So, I merely collated my papers, structured them as chapters and connected these chapters together. The introduction, conclusion and suggestions for future work were all that were left. And even here the papers and the proposal document helped. I got some suggestions that I incorporated after the successful defense. But I worked in STEM. At least in my area, I believe that it is wasteful to take a 101 approach to dissertation writing \u2014 stuffing things with superfluous explanations and derivations defeats the purpose; unless you\u2019ve come up with a whole new avenue of thinking or approach, derivations from first principles constitute a waste of time. Show the assumptions and techniques that you\u2019ve used to tackle issues, derive the relevant equations, codable reductions of these equations, describe experimental setups/techniques/results, key insights etc. and move on. And your code stays with the group (frequently, the code is accessible through the group website), so I see no point in pasting modules of it in the dissertation. If you publish well in STEM fields, dissertation writing should be a mere formality. Writing like you\u2019re paid by the word is time better spent on doing research and publishing it in papers and, if possible, helping out with patent applications. ",
