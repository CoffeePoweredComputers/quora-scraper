            "answer_text": "When you write in third person, you are as omniscient as you want to be. You can give the perspectives of every character, or a select few. You can tell the story from several different angles, experience scenes and emotions from a multitude of different personalities. It\u2019s my preferred way of writing, and I think it tends to be a favorite among readers. The problem you may run into with third person writing is you can get bogged down by too many perspectives. It can become difficult to keep straight all the different lives you\u2019re entangling. It\u2019s easy to lose track of the various plots and personalities unless you\u2019re either highly organized, or you\u2019ve done it a ton and you have a \u2018system\u2019. But when you look at first person, it can be a challenge to write and to read. You\u2019re limited to one perspective, one emotional range, one sensory experience. You can switch to a different character, but it has to be done with exceptional care, otherwise you risk utterly confusing your readers. The benefit to first person is it\u2019s a more intimate form of writing, it is like your character is speaking directly to the reader, as if they are a confidant. It can be an incredibly immersive form of writing. Take a look at Jacqueline Carey, she is an extraordinary author who writes primarily in first person. And as Judy Gill said, first person perspective is more of a challenge to express all the morphing emotions and experiences that the other characters are experiencing. It\u2019s a good practice, as it will increase your descriptive vocabulary and expand your inner dialogue abilities, but to be quite frank, I personally find it kind of boring to write. I love the mishmash of different personalities and emotions bashing against each other in a story; all the different opinions and even different visual cues. One character will see another character completely different from a third character. It seems more\u2026real to me, I suppose, even though we experience life in first person. Write both, and see which fits your style best! ",

            "answer_text": "First person (I, me, we, us, etc.) has the limited perspective of a single person, which gives the reader the direct and personal perspective of the storyteller. Its limited viewpoint also makes it ideal for stories of discovery as the reader becomes aware of events along with the character doing the narration. The personal nature of first person makes it well suited for romance, erotica, and stories dealing with psychological or emotional angst. The limited unfolding perspective of first person also makes it suitable for detective and coming of age stories. Many literary classics combine the personal and coming of age aspects of first person to create powerful narratives and characters readers can connect with directly. 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'The Catcher in the Rye' and 'Treasure Island' are well-known examples. The advantages of first person are also its shortcomings. With events being seen through the eyes of a single person, the rate at which the story can unfold becomes limited. Sometimes dialog or scenes must be contrived so the narrating character can acquire information. This can make some stories seem to plod along causing problems when the plot and storyline require a rapid pace. First person's intimate nature can be incompatible with characters intended to be larger than life. A personal insight to the thinking of heroic figures overcoming obstacles can end up diminishing their stature in the eyes of the reader or make them seem artificial if all emotion is avoided. Some authors have gotten around the problem by making the narrator a companion like Sherlock Homes' Dr. Watson. Others have inserted a brash or cynical outlook into a character's personality to avoid the first person intimacy without having them come across as flat or mechanical. Though a first person perspective can make for a powerful and compelling story that readers can connect to, it's only suitable for a narrow range of stories. It works well when telling the story of war's affect on a single soldier but becomes less personal and dramatic for stories of war in general. The wider the scope a story attempts to paint through one person's eyes, the greater the level of skill and experience required on the part of the author. As the narration expands, from personal experience to that of observing the experience of others, the advantages of first person become diluted. The reader generally takes up the perspective of the narrator. As long as the story is centered around the narrator's thinking and emotions, the reader is living the narrators story. As it begins to center on other people then it starts to become a series of descriptions and more clinical in nature. Once the narrator becomes nothing more than an outside observer of other people, then the perspective effectively becomes that of third person with a very limited overview. Third person (he, she, it, etc.) provides an unlimited perspective into people and events to the reader. It is ideal for fast-paced action and painting broad imagery of characters, settings and events beyond what could be achieved through a single set of eyes. Where first person is about internal conflict and discovery, the third person narrative is more suitable for external conflict and broad tapestries of relationships. The omniscient perspective of third person gives the author the ability to provide the reader insight into what each of their characters is thinking and feeling but as an observer rather than a participant. Though it is slightly less personal, it provides a wider range of emotional conflict through multiple characters and their context within the plot. Though third person is the most widely used perspective, many first-time authors instinctively write in first person, often to the detriment of the story they are trying to tell. This doesn't mean beginning writers should not use first person in all cases. It does mean they should understand the shortcomings and advantages of each perspective. If a story doesn't play to the strengths of the first person narrative then new authors will generally be better off utilizing third person. ",
