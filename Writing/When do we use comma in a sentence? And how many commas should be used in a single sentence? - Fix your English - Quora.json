            "answer_text": " The commas are used to differentiate parts of a sentence in order to make the meaning clear. It makes your writing unambiguous. This makes a natural pause during a sentence. For instance: We study English, Hindi, Science & geography.He is a dancer, singer, and actor.We use commas to: Separate dates and part of the sentence. For instance: 14, Canning Street, Kolkata.To set off the name of a person about to be addressed.Seema, are you all right?To set off words such as Yes, no, well, and oh at the beginning of the sentence.For instance:Yes, she studies in my class.Oh, my bad!Use a comma after an expression.Most surely, you can come to stay with us.Append a comma when a participle phrase is used. You can also append a comma to set off quoted Words.\"I think, it's a great idea\".Don\u2019t use a comma before \u201cthan\u201d when you\u2019re making a comparison.He is taller than his brother.But, Use a comma before the word \u201c but\u201d if it is joining two independent clauses. There are many more comma rules, but most of them are obvious or not commonly used, so I didn't include them all.  There is no demarcation line with the number of commas to be used. Few sentences carry many commas and take a great deal of mental accounting to parse. In such situations reduce the usage of a comma to make the sentence more decipherable. The invariable rule that can be given is that the comma should help, not impede, the reader.` Hope it helps. ",
