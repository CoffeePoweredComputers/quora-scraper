            "answer_text": "Similar like whales and icthyosaurs\u2026it depends upon what time-axis you examine. Different writing systems, borne from very different cultures\u2026functioning as a means of transferring knowledge across time. Cuneiform in clay tablets, was popularized at a time when Xian symbols were carved into human bone as amulets. Cuneiform of Sumer is not same as Cuneiform of Akkad or Ebla or of Persian Empire\u2026the cuneiform writing system is a mish-mash of logograms, ideograms syllabary and phonetic symbols. Ancient logograms of Xian are symbolic one-to-one pictogram to object\u2026neither syllabary or phonetic. Cuneiform emerges in a time of God-kings in mesopotamia\u2026Xian logograms emerge AFTER trade commences with Ur along what would eventually be known as \u201cSilk Road\u201d. Another way of looking at Ancient asian writing systems is akin to looking at the cones and tokens of ancient Jericho on 10th century BCE \u2014 few knew how to write so they had artisans formulate a symbol, on an amulet, that was used as an identity\u2026a one-to-one pictogram. Thus Cuneiform evolved from logographic, to syllabic, then phonetic. Cuneiform was the writing system of Xerxes, Cyrus and Darius in Persia roughly 6th century BCE\u2026but Jews never brought cuneiform back to the levant when Darius liberated them from bondage in Babylon. Jews returned to Ktav assir \u2014 purely phonetic, upon returning to Judea. To this day, Chinese logograms of 2,000 years ago can be read by chinese readers\u2026but the Xian logograms are not well documented, thus, rarely identifiable. There was an older writing system than cuneiform which operated in same time-axis. ",

            "answer_text": "There are basic shapes that have recurred for circa 30,000 years. Marija Gimbutas covers them in her many books. The commonest appear to be shapes that we recognize as \u201cV,\u201d \u201cW,\u201d \u201cX,\u201d and \u201cY.\u201d Note that they are all related shapes in that they share some congruence (\u201cV\u201d is in all of them, for example). I can show that V = Female for 6,400 years using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denise_Schmandt-Besserat\u2019s token data. This is pre-cuneiform. Schmandt-Besserat shows a clear relationship between some tokens and cuneiform. Tokens were widespread, and were abundant in Mesopotamia. In Sumerian and Akkadian cuneiform, vaginas (an extension of that \u201cV\u201d shape) are very well represented: Vaginas Depicted in Sumerian: a Database. When something does an act as amazing as producing another, it carries a lot of meaning. That meaning is used to express other meanings, such as \u201cspouse\u201d and \u201clamb\u201d and \u201cpure,\u201d as well as \u201cdefile\u201d and \u201cinsulting\u201d and \u201cplow.\u201d The worst word in Chinese is the same part of the female genitalia as the worst word in English, and it\u2019s where the baby comes out. This sounds like jealousy to me, for experts seem to agree that men wrote language. We can only guess about the topics that human speech covered before writing existed, but once written language started, so did the domination of females. I believe this is because females can produce what males cannot. In 13 different languages, the sounds of \u201cB\u201d and \u201cV\u201d have an association (Why do the sound of \"B\" and \"V\" have an association in at least 13 different languages?). In Chinese, \u201ccunt\u201d is /be/: \u5c44 bi1. This character represents \u201cbottom cave,\u201d which is what a vagina is (sticklers will say that \u5c38 is a \u201ccorpse, body,\u201d but there are scores of examples where the character represents a bottom). Note the upside down \u201cV\u201d shape: \u516b. This \u201cB/V\u201d association is orthogonally different to those \u201cB/V\u201d associations found in languages like Latin, Spanish, etc. where \u201cV\u201d is pronounced as a \u201cB.\u201d Linguists chalk this up to Lenition, but they fail to recognize that the original alphabet (of which all alphabets appear to have descended say the experts) went \u201cA, B, V\u2026\u201d The letters \u201cB\u201d and \u201cV\u201d are very close. I think because they are representations of female genitalia. Chinese has both a \u201cB\u201d shape and a \u201cV\u201d shape. And so does Sumerian. Here is the \u201cV\u201d shape in Chinese:  from page 2 of this document: Chinese Triple Radicals    You can see this same, tilted, \u201cV\u201d-shaped character in the word for \u201crump,\u201d which is the area that backs the vagina. As linguists, we must be sleuths. We must use anthropology, psychology, creation myths, indeed all written and pictorial material across all cultures in order to ferret out what the ancient writers were really conveying. Here is my Bibliography. Understanding the role of female mammals is key to understanding language. Female mammals have the trinity: milk, offspring, fun for males. This focus of female bounty still can be seen in shrines to mammaries in the form of Hooters \u201cbreastaurants,\u201d which are proliferating across the planet. There\u2019s Hooter\u2019s Shanghai, Hooter\u2019s Beijing, Hooter\u2019s L.A., ad nauseum. Shrines to vaginas can be see at the Tilted Kilt and any strip joint. I\u2019m being facetious here, but truthful. We still are in denial about our fascination with the female human body. There are seven million of us because we still cannot separate sex from procreation, and that reality pervades language. You can see in Breasts Depicted in Sumerian: a Database, that   looks like two pointed breasts. Could \u201cdumu\u201d signify for \u201cof mother\u201d: du mu. Part of the sleuthing is realizing that ideas are conflated, such as \u201cmother,\u201d \u201cnipples,\u201d \u201cbreasts,\u201d and \u201cmilk.\u201d Here is \u201cmilk\u201d in Chinese:  The character on the left means \u201cfemale.\u201d The \u201cB\u201d-shaped character on the right means \u201cto be\u201d and it provides the sound \u201cnai3\u201d to this word. This character also means \u201cbreasts, nipples\u201d and by association \u201cwoman.\u201d \u201cEr2 nai3\u201d \u4e8c\u5976 means \u201caffair, paramour, someone you\u2019re sleeping with outside of marriage,\u201d but literally \u201csecond breast.\u201d \u5976\u5976 is your father\u2019s mother, your grandmother, but literally, \u201cmilk milk.\u201d I think the word for \u201cwife, Mrs.\u201d is also a representation of breasts: \u592a\u592a \u201ctai4 tai,\u201d literally \u201cextremely extremely.\u201d Statistically what was doubly extreme on a new wife in a time of no birth control that men would notice? Breasts, as married women were constantly pregnant. The doubling of the consonants: /tt/ show up in many languages as representative of \u201cbreasts,\u201d \u201cnipples,\u201d or for the concept of \u201clarge\u201d: Titanic, Grand Tetons, even the word \u201ctitle\u201d because it is something that goes before a name, and that prefix is to what we pay attention. Female mammals are so important that their bodies are represented all over language, often as a doubled symbol because mammals are bilaterally symmetrical, and female human breasts make this distinction very obvious, plus we all nursed from breasts, and they allowed us to live. Here is \u201cmilk\u201d in Ancient Egyptian:  And rotated 90\u00b0 cw:  It looks a lot like the letter \u201cB,\u201d which looks like breasts. The sounds /ir/ mean \u201cto make.\u201d This stands for \u201cto make TT,\u201d which sounds like \u201cmilk\u201d to me. We speak in euphemism because our denial of our female body fixation allows us to continue to produce humans unabated, and has served us well so far. The creation myth Genesis is all about generating more. Noah\u2019s Ark is the world\u2019s first sex education, and this was \u201cplagiarized\u201d from Epic of Gilgamesh. Linguists tell us that our \u201cB\u201d comes from \u201chouse,\u201d but \u201chouse\u201d is a euphemism for where one kept their \u201cB/Vs,\u201d their female mammals. Women were conflated with cows and sheep and other beasts for a very long time. In addition to Chinese, we see in the unrelated written language of Maya glyphs, a similar bilateral depiction for the word \u201cmother\u201d:  John Montgomery, Dictionary of Maya Hieroglyphs Note the breast imagery and the bilateral symmetry of two humps. I realize you didn\u2019t ask about Mayan, but it too shares this bilateral symmetry when it comes to mothers and children: Could Mayan Flowers Be Vaginas? Thank you very much for asking. Let me know if you have any more questions. ",

Some pictographs and simple ideograms had developed as part of accounting systems for thousands of years.The invention of \u201cfull writing\u201d or arbitrary speech transcription was by starting to use existing symbols not just for a word, but for the sound of that word, even for where that sound occurs in other words. Thus the ideographs became a set of phonetic symbols.With multiple similar-sounding words represented by the same syllable, scribes started to annotate with category markers to disambiguate. These are usually called radicals in Chinese and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinative by Sumerian scholars.From recognizable drawings, scribes abstracted the characters for quick writing, making them compositions of a small number of standard strokes depending on writing technology, the reed stylus in Mesopotamia and the writing brush in China.",
