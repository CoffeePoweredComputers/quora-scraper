            "answer_text": "When it comes to horror genre, then the first name that pops up in my mind is Junji Ito. He\u2019s quite famous and you must have heard his name atleast once in your life. If you want to read horror manga with an art style that\u2019ll creep you out then take up any of Ito\u2019s works.  Here are a few horror manga that you might enjoy. I\u2019m not going all out for this answer as I\u2019m a bit tired right now. Hope you enjoy the list! 1. Uzumaki  The story is well written and focuses on something that isn\u2019t scary to begin with, a spiral. But there is much more to this symbol than meets the eye and what helps this scary story is its sick and creepy art style. This manga contains so many crazy and at times disturbing images that can really put you off. I consider it to be the best work of Junji Ito and expecting a lot from the upcoming anime. Though I already think you might have read it but still recommending horror manga and not including Uzumaki is not possible. 2. Tomie  Its definitely an interesting manga but doesn\u2019t come close to Uzumaki. The story is about a woman \u2018Tomie\u2019 that could make men fall in love with her. The story is told in different arcs all of which feature strange characters. 3. Corpse Party  The story is very good having several plot twists here and there. With each chapter, you become more curious to find out what happens and the story becomes more and more interesting. 4. Gyo  The plot is nice and full of tension and suspense. The art style is again as you should expect from the master Junji Ito. Overall, it was quite fun to read but the ending is a bit disappointing. 5. Yami no Koe  It is a set of short horror stories and atleast worth reading one time. This one lacks that horror element that you usually see in Ito\u2019s work. The stories were good but wasn\u2019t exactly that great that I had hoped it to be. Nonetheless its still worth a read. 6. Franken Fran  A horror comedy by genre which tells the story in different tales out which most of the stories are decent. Overall it was quite an enjoying manga. 7. Fuan no Tane  Its a compilation of common fears and traumatizing experiences that people have. The art style is good and a lot of effort was put into detailing. There isn\u2019t any plot to begin with but still it was interesting for a one time read. 8. Left Hand of God, Right Hand of the Devil   I guess these two images would be enough for any horror manga fan to take up this manga. 9. Ibitsu  The story is good and has some twists. The horror sections were well drawn and creepy as it should be for any horror manga. Another interesting horror manga that you can read. 10. Petshop of Horrors  It will draw you in with its charming story as soon as you pick it up. The art style is great with so much detailing and good character designs (that isn\u2019t the case with most of the horror manga). Overall, it is one of the most enjoying horror manga that I\u2019ve ever read. Close the answer. txEn eht nepO ",
