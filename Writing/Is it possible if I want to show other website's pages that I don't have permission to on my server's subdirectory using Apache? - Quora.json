You may be able to see the folders when you are looking around via FTP or cPanel or something. But they are not part of the same logical domain structure. So the server won\u2019t be able to serve them up. They would need to be part of the same tree branch. If you happen to know the domain that those files are being served from, then you can access them that way, via a typical HTTP call. They call this \u201chotlinking\u201d. People do it with images all the time. This may or may not be allowed depending on how the domain/server is configured. ",
