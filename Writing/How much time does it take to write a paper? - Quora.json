            "answer_text": "It depends. Also, by \"good,\" do you mean a paper that receives an A grade? Students who write A papers generally know just how much time they require. HOWEVER: to get at least a passing grade, I recommend\u2014if the paper is for a college course\u2014that you allow at least a week (two would be better) to do some prewriting, construct an outline, compose a rough draft, and write a finished draft. Make sure to also allow enough time to have the campus writing center tutors check it over with you before you write the final draft, edit it, and proofread it. If research is involved, add another three to four weeks to front-load the research process, AND you should plan to write several successive drafts including your research sources to make sure your internal citations and bibliography are correct. If you are going to try to nail the whole thing in one go, you should plan on eight hours OR MORE to write the first draft, estimating an hour per page. Editing and proofreading the second draft should take three or four hours. Ideally, you would do this in three or four segments of activity, not an all-nighter! I do NOT recommend the one-shot approach. Invariably students who try it miss something crucial and come to grief. Also, the temptation to cut and paste source material can lead to unintentional plagiarism. ",

Two stipulations on that: 1, I'm much faster than average\u2014at least in my school; 2, if you're talking college papers my answer is nullified because those are usually much longer, to my understanding.
