            "answer_text": "Yeah, they are. Before paying for access to novels in Webnovel - Your Fictional Stories Hub I recommend to check this post Qidian Authors hit by Chinese censorship Not only Qidian never fight against Chinese censorship, they even helping gov to close whatever novels they want. Ton\u2019s of great novels get deleted from the internet because of them. The most funny thing - no one knows why their novels got closed. Authors re-write blocked chapters (they\u2019re actually lucky if only chapters get banned and not the whole novel) several times just to know what did they write wrong. Even a lot of pro-china novels get deleted. Why? some high up from gov didn\u2019t like them. Maybe author dared to write something bad about the USA/Japan or SEA. Yes, even this can lead to novel get deleted. ofc writing bad about USSR/Russia sometimes can save novel. Chinese high up loving this. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it\u2019s true. As for why Chinese authors just not use a free novel website, because qidian (and other p2r websites) pay them. You can write a good story on free websites and earn 0, while writing on qidian even if no one reads your novel can bring an author at least some money. ",
