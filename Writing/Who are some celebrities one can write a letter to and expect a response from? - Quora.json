            "answer_text": "Darren Hayes might respond to you on Twitter if you say something to catch his attention. He loves his fans and tries to respond to them when he can. Taylor Swift used to respond to her fans on MySpace, but then she got super popular and doesn\u2019t have as much time. She still loves her fans though. So yeah, I think Darren is the one you would have the best chance of getting a response from, most likely on twitter. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how much of a tear-jerking letter you can write. Most celebrities do not receieve or get to see their fan mail, but if you make it sound like you\u2019re dying, and meeting them would make your life complete, you might get a phone call or they may come look you up, but if you aren\u2019t really that bad off, you run the risk of having them post something negative about you on social media, and that would not be a good thing. Even if you do write a celebrity, don\u2019t expect them to respond because they probably won\u2019t, however, like I\u2019ve stated previously, if you can convince the people that read the celebrity\u2019s fan mail with a good sob story or convince them in some way that you need to meet them, it\u2019s possible. Not likely, but possible. ",
