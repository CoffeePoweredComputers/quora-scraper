Saying you\u2019re inspired by the world wars would be better. I can\u2019t really say if the idea\u2019s a good one, though, since you haven\u2019t mentioned the slightest bit of a plot. ",

But I hugely enjoyed Ready Player One. Because the characters and action engaged me. A good writer could make a visit to the dentist office worth reading. A bad writer could make Florence Nightingales life unreadable. The Idea is the least part of any book. ",
