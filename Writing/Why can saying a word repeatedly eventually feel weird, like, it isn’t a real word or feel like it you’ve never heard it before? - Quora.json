            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll venture my best guess. Someone famous said that the same person can never swim in the same river twice, for the river is changed the second time, and so is the person. If our wet circuitry (the brain and nervous system) is the river, and the word encoded in it is the swimmer, the words aren\u2019t the same, but all the instances of the word we can recall from a necessarily imperfect (because real world, not math with assumptions) encoding mechanism, and the brain itself has changed, alone by saying the word a second time. We get familiar of repetition, and like to listen to new music: The more often you listen to it, the less often you want to hear it. Likewise you\u2019re not going to read a book the same way a second or third time if it was a really good book. Each time you read it again, you add the currently gained understanding to your stored understanding. My suspicion is that we tag the words with something like a counter that counts like this, every time we hear the word: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice word\u201d, \u201cHmm, same word\u201d, \u201cHmm, still a nice word\u201d, \u201cHmm, same word, why do I keep repeating it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m getting tired of this word\u201d \u201cWhat a stupid word, it literally didn\u2019t change from the first time I said it to the last time I said it\u201d and so on.

            "answer_text": "The repeated deliberation of the biophysical speeching of a word becomes a gummy bear, askance and askew with nary a chance for it to advance so to ask you what it means. It is a rubber grommet with the thought held out of place, gnash of fungal hum-drum and grope of garnered gew-gaw, a fish flop finding numb un refreshening, a figure of fester , infernal , severe. One comes to an impasse and his vegetative congress of belief recesses and their is meant on his breadth. The word is a show but the purpose is to know it to grow what was to be fickle , unfettered, in fact not foible, in \u2070fruit not falacy, of a fabric already woven , a frond of fern, farmed cherish of figurative flare , fanned into life by fire of foundary, as fluid of fountain, out from famine and into a fill of fine food. An ink pen? I thought I was a goner. ",
