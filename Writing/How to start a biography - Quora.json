            "answer_text": "Why? That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the simple, but direct, question you have to ask yourself\u200a\u2014\u200aand answer\u200a\u2014\u200abefore you start writing an in-depth project like a memoir or biography (or anything else really). Before you start researching, gathering, and sorting through the facts and information, before you get down to outlining and writing a first draft of what will eventually become a permanent telling of someone\u2019s life, you need to be upfront and honest with yourself about why you\u2019re writing it in the first place. For love and honor? Curiosity? Reward? Therapy? Maybe all of the above. What drove me me to spend months doing nothing else but researching and writing the story of my father a few years ago was the notion that he was a man who lived a good, honorable life before it was cut short by cancer, raising his family without scandal or hurt; and for that, I thought, he deserved to be recognized. That was my why. (And I said as much in the introduction to his story.) What is your fundamental motivation, and will there be enough of that to carry you and your project through to the rightful end? Because no matter what, it\u2019s going to be a long, arduous and emotional journey you and your subject will be taking. Together. You\u2019re going to need all the energy and clarity you can muster to keep it going when the words and ideas get all jumbled up and the adrenaline isn\u2019t exactly flowing. You\u2019ll need to distill a lot of information and sort through a lot of human feelings past and present in order to give your subject the fair telling he or she deserves. It may be needless to say, but I\u2019ll say it anyway: Writing a biographical piece of any length carries with it a great deal of responsibility. Just as you wouldn\u2019t want someone fifty years from now doing a slanted, half-ass job writing your life story, you need to apply the same standard of honesty and integrity to your words when it comes to writing about somebody else today. You need to be clear at all times about where you\u2019re coming from, what message you want the reader to take in when they finish reading the last words and literally close the book on your work. Especially when it comes to writing about someone else, you have to be true to yourself and the degree of your motivation before you get started. If it\u2019s not there, it won\u2019t end well. Nobody wins. What\u2019s at stake is not only your reputation but the reputation of the one you\u2019re writing about as well. And then there are your readers. Be upfront right away as to why you\u2019re writing the story, and why, in turn, they should invest their time in reading it. Be as transparent as you can be. Readers will appreciate that. As for the actual nuts and bolts of writing a biographical story, well, that\u2019s your creative call. Maybe the best thing to say there is the less rules, the better. But before anything must come that critical look inside yourself\u200a\u2014\u200aat the Why before the What. Because no matter what you\u2019re writing, if that first part isn\u2019t real, the second part won\u2019t be either. ",

            "answer_text": "To write a biography you would need to create a structure, framework or outline to do so. But before that, you would need to ask yourself some questions. What makes you or your story unique or different? Why do you want to write your biography - PURPOSE OR GOALS FOR WRITING A BIOGRAPHY? Do you want to write it to leave a legacy to be remembered by or to enlighten, inspire, entertain, amuse, or educate your readers? Write what you would love to read. Write from the heart. Write with emotions. Write visually\u2026the reader must be able to visualize your story. Write to express, not to impress. Keep it simple, clear, concise, and compelling. Start your biography with an anecdote or a story. Storytelling is the key to biography writing. Don\u2019t get preachy. Tell yourself that you will complete your biography is 6\u20139 months or within 1 year, as long as you write half-page or one page every day. Good luck with your biography. ",
