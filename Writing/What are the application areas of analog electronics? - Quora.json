            "answer_text": "All the sensors that you can hook up to you computer to tell you the temperature, pressure, pH, etc. Those digital interfaces had to be created from something that is purely analog in nature, and the first stage in the process is analog electronics, like amplifiers and filters. Power supplies that make the AC power into digital logic levels? Yup, analog. The RF electronics that makes your cellular data and WiFi connections work? Also analog. The world is pretty digital these days, but behind all the digital interfaces is still a lot of analog. ",
