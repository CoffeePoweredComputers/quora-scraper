            "answer_text": "YES, usually for one very good reason\u2026. Five years ago, we moved from New Hampshire to California, three time zones away. I left a loyal following back there, and do my best to stay in touch. Which means, if I write a blog post at an odd time, I need to think about when the best time for people on both coasts. Wordpress has a date-setting \u201cpublish\u201d feature, and this lets me schedule the time I think is best. Also, I tend to cover a lot of points when I write about something, and my posts can get quite long. I\u2019m sloooowly getting better at breaking my articles into smaller/shorter reads, especially if the subject involves encouraging people to think a whole new way about something. (My latest series was about rethinking and softening our attitudes about millennials and other, younger generations, to be more understanding and kind, instead of complaining about \u201cyoung people today.\u201d) I also create \u201cdrafts\u201d on subjects and issues as they occur to me, saving them for a time when I can write about them more fully. (Although then I have trouble remembering which ones I\u2019ve expanded on, and which ones I haven\u2019t.) As with any creative pursuit, I\u2019m constantly encouraging people to do what works for THEM. There is no single right way to do almost anything in life, especially with creative work. So if stockpiling posts works for you, do it! If it feels better to write-and-publish in the moment, do that. If it feels right to do the whole series, covering many points (and points-of-view), then scheduling will be your new best friend. My question for YOU today is, why do you believe there\u2019s a right way and a wrong way to write? It helps sometimes to check those assumptions, too! Creative processes are just as unique as the people who create. Respect yours, and have your say in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, yes, a thousand times yes! I batch writing articles so that I can write a bunch of things when I\u2019m in the flow, so that I can create bite-sized morsels of information on related topics without overwhelming readers, so that I can research a topic once and write many articles, without having to go back and find my notes. There are few things in business (apart from watching sales pop up in my account, or seeing the light go on in a client\u2019s eyes) that I love more than opening my site and seeing an article that Past-Me wrote appear and engage my audience. \u201cThanks, Past-Me!\u201d I say, and then I feel good about myself for the rest of the day.
