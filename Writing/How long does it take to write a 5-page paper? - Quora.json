            "answer_text": "My goodness. How many fish are there in the sea? How many stars in the sky? The answer to your question could be anything. If I have a good story line in my head, I can bang out at least five pages at one go. On the other hand, if I\u2019m having trouble with something, I can work for hours to produce a couple of pages. It can be frustrating, but I love what I\u2019m doing and always believe things will go better tomorrow. Sometimes it can only be a few paragraphs. Try not to think about your writing as \u201cproduction\u201d. Aren\u2019t you doing it for the love of the process? Enjoy your creation and all the parts of you that go into it. Relax \u2026 and good luck to you. ",

            "answer_text": " According to this words per page calculator, 5 pages is about 1380 words. Now, you need to go to a website like LiveChat\u2019s typing test and see what\u2019s your word per minute is! All that\u2019s left now is to divide the number of words with your answer and see how many minutes it will take to write 5 pages :) ",
