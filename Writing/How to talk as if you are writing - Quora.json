The modern use of \u201cparticiple phrases\u201d would be distinctive: \u201cGoing to the store, I will be buying milk.\u201d Embedded modifiers would also be distinctive. \u201cI\u2019m going to the store, Walmart, and then to work.\u201d Putting dialogue tags after the quote (or within) would be very distinctive. \u201cI don\u2019t know where Jane is, but \u2018I\u2019m coming\u2019 she said.\u201d Obviously, no \u201cdisfluencies\u201d, like starting with \u201cum\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Hi, That\u2019s an interesting question. One way some authors do this . . . is to speak their text. There is software (Dragon seems to be the most popular) that converts sounds into text. I\u2019m old-school I\u2019ll type and will abbreviate things like will to \u2018I\u2019ll\u2019 etc as I type. Have a think . . . speak or type? Wishing you every success, Paul ",
