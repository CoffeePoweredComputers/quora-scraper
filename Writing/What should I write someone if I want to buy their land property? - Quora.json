            "answer_text": "Do it the same I way I did. We have a place in Arkansas for hunting and riding ATVs. There was a 40ac section next to us and the owners lived in California (they had inherited it from their parents). i looked up the owner through the property tax records and sent them a letter explaining who i was, that I owned the property next to theirs and would like to purchase theirs if it was for sale. I told them how I was willing to pay $x per acre (recent sales price for similar land and i enclosed a copy of the sale). They accepted the offer and we completed the sale using a title attorney and overnight mail. I have found that a letter a nice letter with as much detail about you and saying why you want it goes a long way. If it is to build a log cabin, tell them. Tell them your intent with the land. If you start using formal language or get vague, they will throw away the letter. ",
