            "answer_text": "Not in and of itself, no. Someone with the requisite skills and qualifications could be asked - for example - to write an essay for a newspaper explaining a topical issue, whatever it may be. My university even has what they call the \u201cexperts list\u201d for precisely this purpose, so that the various news sources we have can contact an expert in (let\u2019s say) town planning to ask them about writing an article about a new train line or whether we need more green space, or whatever. I\u2019m not sure that the pay is particularly great, mind you, but if money didn\u2019t change hands I\u2019d be surprised. It\u2019s that same logic which has a lot of \u201cessay writing services\u201d indicating that they\u2019re providing \u201cexample answers\u201d, rather than actually doing your work for you. It\u2019s not illegal for you to ask them \u201cHow should my essay about To Kill a Mockingbird look?\u201d, and neither is it illegal for them to say \u201cIt should look like this attached file. Best of luck with your assignment.\u201d Where things get murky, though, is when you take the \u201cexample answer\u201d provided and say \u201cThis is my work. Honest it is.\u201d You\u2019ve still not broken the law, usually, but you\u2019ve engaged in academic fraud, which will get you into as much trouble in an educational sense as breaking the law would in a criminal one.

            "answer_text": "Why should you think so. Many writers do it for money, or they may have them published, that means, sold for money. Unless you are talking about something else, something specific like a questionable subject matter. Still, many people do even that, though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Or perhaps you\u2019are talking about writing an essay for another person who will pass it for his/her own. Something like another student. Something to be presented to some school authority etc. In which case it would be cheating on the part of the other person, and he/she could end up in trouble. But unless he involves you, and mention something about paying you, you might be accused of aiding in something dishonest. But generally speaking, I don\u2019t see anything terribly wrong in you doing it for money, usually for a smallish amount. But, in my opinion, it would be better not to do it regularly. ",

            "answer_text": "Writing an essay is certainly not illegal, for money or for fun (or for school, as the case may be, though in that case you would probably wish that it was illegal). Many people have written essays, or similar works, for money. These are often included in newspapers or magazines, or even online. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. Of course, there are ways where it could be bad. If you are paid to write an essay for a student so they do not have do any work, then you are being unethical. However, writing an essay for money is entirely legal as long as the proper people get the proper credit they deserve. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you\u2019re talking about essays to be submitted by a university student for credit. The problem is, \u201cillegal\u201d is not a straightforward concept. Submitting a plagiarized essay is a kind of fraud, and definitely a breach of the contract between the student and the university. If you *help* someone commit fraud, or help someone breach a contract, you\u2019re not exactly in the clear, legally. Now, it may be that you\u2019ll get away with it. The university is more likely to be interested in the *student\u2019s* behaviour, and less likely trying to get a court to punish the writer. (I\u2019m not a lawyer, but that\u2019s my guess.) Either way, writing essays for money is definitely unethical. It\u2019s helping someone to lie, to cheat, and to take credit where credit has not been earned. ",
