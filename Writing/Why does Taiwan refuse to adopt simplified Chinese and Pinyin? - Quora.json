            "answer_text": "Simple, cold-war-thinking. During cold war, there were so many ridiculous ideas and logic, mainly about \u201cbeing different deliberately just to make a point\u201d. I remember 2 slogans specifically: 1, \u5b81\u8981\u793e\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u8349\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u8d44\u672c\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u82d7\u3002 | N\u00edngy y\u00e0o Sh\u00e8hu\u00eczh\u016dy\u00ec de c\u0103o, b\u00f9 y\u00e0o Z\u012bb\u011bnzh\u016dy\u00ec de mi\u00e1o, which roughly means \u201cI\u2019d rather have socialist weeds than capitalist crops\u201d. People cannot eat weed to live. 2, Rather be dead than red. I think this one came from the 4th Indiana Jones, in the university. It should be in the peak time of the McCarthy era.  Now let\u2019s get back to simplified Chinese and Pinyin. The first attempt to simplify Chinese in the modern era was actually during the republic of China\u2019s rule. In 1935, KMT government published the first batch of simplified Chinese characters, a total of 324. But it was cancelled next February due to some people thinking that simplified characters ruined Chinese culture. In 1952, when KMT was already in Taiwan, president at the time Chiang Kai-shek brought up the 2nd attempt of simplifying Chinese, but it was abandoned because mainland China was doing it too, and Taiwan authority didn\u2019t want it to be the same as those bloody commies.  Differently from what anti-China organizations usually claimed, the simplified Chinese used by mainland China was not created by the government of PRC. People merely collected the existed simplified characters which had been used by people for hundreds if not thousands of years. The traditional Chinese version of Taiwan should be \u201c\u81fa\u7063\u201d, and it\u2019s simplified Chinese version should be \u201c\u53f0\u6e7e\u201d. You probably could imagine the huge difficulty difference when learning Chinese. As a matter of fact, \u201c\u81fa\u6e7e\u201d , \u201c\u53f0\u7063\u201d or even \u201c\u53f0\u6e7e\u201d are widely used in Taiwan.  The above photo ought to have been taken during or after WWII, after Taiwan was taken back by the Republic of China.  The second one was taken recently, because it\u2019s in a protest against the current Taiwan president for being a dog of Japan and USA.  As for Pinyin, there is in fact something which is fundamentally the same thing in Taiwan, called \u6ce8\u97f3. It\u2019s almost 100% convertible to Pinyin, see the picture below:  They are both phonetic symbols, invented to assist in learning the language. The advantage of Pinyin is that it uses Latin letters instead of Chinese character components. This makes it easier to be learned by foreigners and be converted into other languages. When purchasing some items from other countries, I often fill in Pinyin into the address columns, such as \u201cWanke xiaoqu, Honghuang lu, Jiangbei qu\u201d. Thus the people who are responsible of mailing the goods won\u2019t have any trouble reading or inputing them, because they are just letters. And the delivering person in China won\u2019t have any problem reading it, because it\u2019s Pinyin, and anyone with basic education can read it. Imagine if I used the Taiwan version.  And if you look into all languages, simplifying is the mainstream. Language should be easy to be learned and used by the most people. Although many Taiwanese used to use or are using simplified Chinese in their daily lives, it\u2019s already too late for Taiwan authority to have their own version of simplified Chinese due to the current geopolitical situation.

            "answer_text": "There are a number of reasons. Some are cultural. Some are political. The Chief reasons are culture. Traditional Chinese is culturally more superior than Simplified Chinese. A better question would be: Why does Taiwan want to preserve the use of Traditional Chinese and Bopomofo? Political Reasons:Simplified Chinese represents \u201cPRC\u201d. While Traditional Chinese \u6b63\u9ad4\u5b57 represents \u201cRepublic of China\u201d (ROC) or Taiwan. Although simplified writing was first introduced in 1920s and 1930s in ROC, it failed and upon objection from many scholars, Chiang Kai Shek stopped implementing it. It was PRC who started off implementing in 1956. Previously, the Chinese communist were pursuing a romanized script for Mandarin, planning to abolish Hanzi. Check out Latinxua Sin Wenz - Wikipedia Literacy Reasons:Taiwan has a high literacy rate. And there is no reason to believe that \u201csimplified Chinese\u201d will solve the problem of literacy, as Taiwan has proven that Traditional Chinese has increased the literacy rate of Taiwan. Culture Reasons:|Taiwan regards \u201cTraditional Chinese character\u201d \u6b63\u9ad4\u5b57 as representing true Chinese culture | There were many Chinese cultural meanings which were lost in Simplified Chinese. Also, the logic with which a traditional Chinese character is formed is destroyed in Simplified Chinese. In traditional Chinese, if you encounter a new character, you can more or less guess its meaning by logic inference of the different composition of a radical. It also makes it easier to remember how to write, because all you have to do is to remember he logic on how the character is formed and which radicals are used. However, because of simplifications, many logical meaning of a character are destroyed. Therefore, you will not be able to guess the meaning. The only thing that you have to do to learn how to write is by hard rote memory. Ironically, this makes it harder to learn simplified Chinese, as you tend to forget how to write easily. Whereas Traditional Chinese can be learned by learning the logic of how a character is formed, which makes it easier to remember how to write, instead of relying on hard memory.   Example of loss of Chinese Culture Meaning and Logic in Simplified Chinese: Simplified Chinese \u7231 (Love) = Traditional Chinese \u611b (Love) without heart \u5fc3 (how can you \u201clove\u201d without using your heart? )Simplified Chinese \u4eb2 \uff08Parents/Relatives) = Traditional Chinese \u89aa (Parents/Relatives) without seeing each other \u898b (how can you have \u201cparents / relatives\u201d whom you would not want to see each other?)Simplified Chinese \u4ea7 (production) = Traditional Chinese \u7522 (production / assets) without \u201cproducing\u201d or \u201cgiving birth\u201d \u751f (how can you produce or have an asset without \u201cproducing\u201d ?)Simplified Chinese \u5bfc (guidance / leadership) = Traditional Chinese \u5c0e (guidance / leadership) without the \u201cway\u201d \u9053 (how can you have leadership without the \u201cway\u201d ?)\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 |Able to read Classical Chinese text and thus able to access traditional Chinese culture\\ It\u2019s better to read original Classical Chinese text in Traditional Chinese, rather than simplified Chinese, as these Classical Chinese text were written in traditional Chinese originally. In traditional Chinese, there could be two different characters with different meanings, but in simplified Chinese, many characters were simplified into one character that encompasses all meaning. The common use of repetitive character (that lumps all meanings possible into 1 character) makes it difficult to read Classical Chinese text in simplified Chinese (esp. when different characters were used to present different meaning in traditional Chinese text). Therefore, reading Classical Chinese text in traditional Chinese character is ironically a lot simpler.  Take for instance, \u4e7e(dry) and \u5e79 (doing) are different word/characters in traditional Chinese. But in traditional Chinese, it\u2019s all simplified to \u5e72 . In traditional Chinese, meaning emphasizes on precision use of words. But in simplified, meanings can be blurred out. Thus, when you\u2019re reading Classical Chinese text, you will most likely be confused. Also, the \u201ccultural feel\u201d of reading Classical Chinese text in traditional Chinese would be lost when you read it in simplified Chinese. The reason is because traditional Chinese character are like better \u201cconstructed painting\u201d. Reading Classical Chinese text is also like getting a feel of the \u201cliterary beauty of the Chinese characters\u201d. As simplified Chinese damages the aesthetic beauty of Chinese calligraphy and a character, many of the aesthetic feel of reading Classical Chinese text is lost when you\u2019re reading Simplified Chinese. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 |Traditional Chinese preserves the aesthetic beauty of Chinese Character and calligraphy style| Simplified Chinese Character damages the aesthetic beauty of Traditional Chinese Character. Traditional Chinese Character preserves the aesthetic beauty of Chinese calligraphy (notable \u201cregular script\u201d). Thus writing traditional Chinese character is more beautiful than simplified Chinese character. It\u2019s for this reason why most Chinese graphics design choose to use traditional Chinese character as they are more aesthetically beautiful. Chinese Calligraphy also writes more traditional Chinese character instead of simplified Chinese. The main problem with Simplified Chinese character is that the \u201csymmetrical beauty and a more balanced spatial distribution of filling a pictogram\u201d is lost. The number of strokes had been reduced, consequently reducing the number of calligraphic strokes that can be used to beautify a character like a picture. Chinese character is often known as \u201cSquare character\u201d. The character fills up a square box. Example of loss of aesthetic beauty in Simplified Chinese: Simplified Chinese \u5382 (factory) looks like a picture \u201cshelter\u201d without any support in front or anything inside. It looks \u201cunstable\u201d and somehow might even \u201cfall\u201d . Traditional Chinese \u5ee0 (factory) looks like a picture \u201cshelter\u201d with items inside, \u201csupporting the structure of a factory\u201d. Thus it looks more stable and is more \u201cbalanced\u201d in terms of filling the spatial distribution of a \u201csquare box\u201d (or a square picture).Simplified Chinese \u95e8 (door) doesn\u2019t actually look like a \u201cdoor\u201d. Neither is the door \u2018symmetrical\u2019. The traditional Chinese \u9580 (door) does look like a \u201cdoor\u201d in ancient Chinese\u2019s house. It\u2019s more balanced and symmetrical as well. Simplified Chinese was derived from Cursive Script \u8349\u66f8 . Thus a typical Simplified Chinese handwriting (above) often looks like cursive writing. It is not aesthetically beautiful from Chinese calligraphy point of view, and looks more like sloppy shorthand writing. As such, Simplified Chinese handwriting looks more like scribbling and sloppy handwriting \u6f66\u8349    Traditional Chinese handwriting (calligraphy) is more aesthetically beautiful (above)  See the calligraphy style. The top traditional Chinese characters (traditional Chinese - top) are definitely more defined and beautiful than simplified Chinese character (below) , because there are more strokes in Traditional Chinese character to refine and define the graphical beautify of a character. Perhaps, you might want to watch this video (in Chinese) for greater understanding of why most people prefer Traditional Chinese, as it\u2019s more \u201cculturally correct\u201d, representing \u201cauthentic Chinese culture\u201d.  \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Why use Bopomofo (phonetics) in Taiwan instead of Pinyin? Bopomofo was an older phonetic system developed in Republic of China (in mainland China) in 1910s and continued to be used in Taiwan. Pinyin was developed by PRC in 1950s. The only advantage is that it\u2019s a romanized system, which make learning the phonetic sound of Mandarin easier, esp. for Westerners. Although there is no big controversy or dispute with pinyin, from linguistic point of view, Bopomofo is however known to be a more accurate sound (phonetic) system than pinyin. Bopomofo phonetical symbols does not rely on latin alphabets, but originated mainly from \"regularised\" forms of ancient Chinese characters. In some characters phonetics, for more accuracy of sound, it should be \u3127\u3121(iou) [Bopomofo] - but in pinyin, it\u2019s been simplified to iu \uff08less accurate). E.g. for the character \u5289, it\u2019s more accurate to use \u310c\u3127\u3121\u02ca \uff08liou2) as in Bopomofo, rather than li\u00fa (pinyin)\u3128\u311f (uei) [Bopomofo] - but in pinyin, it\u2019s been simplified to ui (less accurate). E.g. for the character \u745e, it\u2019s more accurate to use \u3116\u3128\u311f\u02cb (ruei2) as in Bopomofo, rather than ru\u00ec (pinyin)\u3128\u3123(uen) [Bopomofo] - but in pinyin, it\u2019s been simplified to un (less accurate). E.g. for the character \u8ad6, it\u2019s more accurate to use\u310c\u3128\u3123\u02cb (luen4) as in Bopomofo, rather than l\u00f9n (pinyin)Certain phonetics is more \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cfaster\u201d in Bopomofo than in pinyin. Example: \u3127\u3121(iou) [Bopomofo] - E.g. for the character \u6cb9, it\u2019s faster to use \u3127\u3121\u02ca \uff08iou2) as in Bopomofo, rather than y\u00f3u (pinyin)\u3128\u311f (uei) [Bopomofo] - E.g. for the character \u70ba, it\u2019s faster to use\u3128\u311f\u02ca \uff08uei2) as in Bopomofo, rather than w\u00e9i (pinyin)\u3128\u3123(uen) [Bopomofo] - E.g. for the character \u6587, it\u2019s faster to use\u3128\u3123\u02ca \uff08uen2) as in Bopomofo, rather than w\u00e9n (pinyin)Certain phonetic sounds are not particularly visible in pinyin, but more visible in Bopomofo, giving Bopomofo more accuracy. For example\uff1a the vowels in pinyin such as en and eng can sometimes be hard to differentiate in terms of sound. It has often been described that the difference between en/eng is that the latter is slightly retracted/centralized with the velar nasal final. However, this is quite hard to understand and can be difficult to those who are not linguistically savvy. But in Bopomofo, en is \u3123 \uff08en) and eng is \u3125 (eng) . When making the sound \u3123 \uff08en) , it sounds like \u201cn\u201d \uff0c which is essentially a tongue tip nasal vowel \u820c\u5c16\u97f3. When making the \u3123 \uff08en) sound, your mouth is less opened (more closed up and smaller) with retracted nasal sound and more vibration in the nose. When making the sound \u3125\uff08eng) , it sounds like \u201cng\u201d \uff0c which is essentially a tongue root nasal vowel \u820c\u6839\u97f3. When making the \u3125\uff08eng) sound , your mouth is more opened (larger) with retracted nasal sound and more vibration in the throat. Thus, \u9580 \u3107\u3123\u02ca \uff08m\u00e9n) is easier to differentiate from \u8499 \u3107\u3125\u02ca \uff08m\u00e9ng \uff09The same applies for ing / ong/ iongControversy with the consonant x , q in Pinyin. x - should strictly be more accurate to use \u201csh-yi\u201d or sounds like \u201cc\u201d in English. This can be confusing in pinyin. I would prefer to use \u201csi\u201d. In Bopomofo, it\u2019s \u3112 (si / see) . So, for Chinese character \u7fd2\uff0c Bopomofo is \u3112\u3127\u02ca (si-yee) (pinyin: x\u00ed)q - should strictly be more accurate to use \u201cchi\u201d or \u201cchee\u201d . In bopomofo, it\u2019s \u3111(chi). So, for Chinese character \u6c23\uff0c Bopomofo is \u3111\u3127\u02cb \uff08chi) (pinyin: q\u00ec)For romanized phonetic system for Mandarin, I personally prefer Tongyong Pinyin, as I find it to be more accurate.
