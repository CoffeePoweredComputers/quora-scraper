            "answer_text": "Um\u2026 Sort of\u2026 If you have been taught/have been in that specific field of \u2018science\u2019 long enough, then - yes, the words used (designed/created/common) therein are easy for those in the know. For those (such as myself) who are not in a field using scientific words, say, an astrophysicist or the like, then yes, they are difficult. However, the same applies to almost any field. some using terms such as hot desk or collar and board, to name just a few examples. Does everyone know the meaning of those slangs specific to their fields? Personally, I\u2019ve always liked S.O.B. As anybody/everybody knows, it is short for a swear (son of a b***h) - but nurses mean S.O.B. as Short(ness) Of Breath. How\u2019s that for a technical term? :) ",

Even an apprentice ( no reference to a pun on trump intended ) and excellent on-site help will lead to an intimate , and usual application of the knowledge of the requisite terminology \u2026or of the appropriate jargon! Tech courses are a desired activity! ",

My husband has a friend in Scotland who told him he could send some scientific papers but he wouldn\u2019t understand them. The friend has a PhD but he couldn\u2019t answer my husband\u2019s questions regarding some of the items contained in the treatises. Science has become a grant-empowered desire to make something of nothing, then seek more grant money to further investigate. Hope this helps, Kat ",
