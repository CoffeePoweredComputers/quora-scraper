            "answer_text": "To name a few, here are some:  1. Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) The Story: When the kingdom of Liones falls into the hands of its traitorous Holy Knights, Princess Elizabeth is left with no choice but to seek the kingdom\u2019s most wanted criminals\u2014the Nanatsu no Taizai (Seven Deadly Sins)\u2014and ask them for help. Despite the group having been missing for ten years, Princess Elizabeth never lost her faith in them; instead, she believes that everything that has happened so far was premeditated by the evil Holy Knights of the kingdom, who are brewing a devastatingly dreadful plan. Now traveling as the \u201cRusty Knight,\" Princess Elizabeth stumbles upon the Boar Hat Bar\u2014the travellng bar where fate has arranged for her to meet the Dragon\u2019s Sin of Wrath, Meliodas. The Similarity: Nanatsu no Taizai is a grand adventure-action anime. What makes it great is that it follows a very well-balanced formula that actually makes sense. The battles aren\u2019t just mindless fights where the characters throw in everything they\u2019ve got; they are set up in such a way that you feel the excitement and thrill in every turn and twist. And the adventure\u2014it\u2019s true to its name! The characters are on an exhilarating adventure with surprises jumping out now and then. Lastly, the plot is extravagant and highly engaging! It\u2019s funny when you need it to be comedic, and it\u2019s serious when the situation asks for it. Truly, this anime, much like Hunter X Hunter, can get you really involved and engaged with the story, it progress, and its characters. 2. Naruto The Story: Called Naruto (the first half) and Naruto Shippuden (the second half), this epic ninja tale tells the story of Uzumaki Naruto and his legendary ninja quest to become the Hokage of his village, Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village). Having been shunned all his life because of the \u201cnine-tailed demon fox\u201d sealed inside him, Naruto has always longed for recognition, which shapes his mischievous yet lonely personality. He\u2019s not that talented, and most of the time gawky, but he has a big dream and a big heart, all of which will bring him to the grand plan destiny has for a gutsy ninja like him. The Similarity: Not counting the countless mostly boring fillers,Naruto deserves recognition for being an epic ninja anime. From the very first episode, you see how all the main characters are growing into something brilliantly meaningful as the story progresses. Through thick and thin, everyone is always interesting. And the battles, they do get a \u201csuper power\u201d feel as the story progresses, but they\u2019re still very intense and exciting nonetheless. Overall, you feel some ups-and-downs watching Naruto, depending on how you interpret it and how you keep up with its main plot, but its similarity with Hunter X Hunter is quite profound if you look more closely at the themes. 3. Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic The Story: Magical labyrinths called dungeons have suddenly appeared throughout the world, and they promise immense wealth and power to those who successfully conquer them. It\u2019s not that easy a task though, because countless have tried only to meet their untimely demise!Somewhere in the world out there is a young man named Alibaba Saluja. He dreams of conquering a dungeon one day so he can realize his dreams and aspirations. One day, he meets a boy named Aladdin who seems like a normal boy, but whose entire identity and existence is a mystery. Later on, both Alibaba and Aladdin find themselves on an adventure together, trying to conquer their very first dungeon\u2014Amon\u2019s Dungeon! The Similarity: Magi might look very magical and innocent at first, but actually, it\u2019s darker than anyone would have thought. Some characters in this show just seem to die off in a very untimely and unexpected manner. Though it has its light and warm moments, the underlying plot is serious and dark. Similar to Hunter X Hunter, Magi leads us on a world-class adventure with jubilant characters in a realm full of despair and depravity. 4. One Piece The Story: Following the demise of Gol D. Roger the Pirate King and his revelation of an unbelievable treasure (the \"One Piece\"), the golden age of pirates commences, with many pirates setting off on their own sea-faring adventures, seeking the One Piece and the title of Pirate King. One of the budding pirates is Monkey D. Luffy. With his unorthodox (actually unpirate-like) ways, he sets off on a gigantic voyage with the \u201cStraw Hat Pirates\u201d to search for reliable and powerful crew members, find the legendary treasure One Piece, and ultimately become the Pirate King! The Similarity: One word: Adventure! One Piece is one of the grandest and biggest when it comes to adventure, and that\u2019s where it is the equal of Hunter X Hunter, withOne Piece actually taking the lead). The only difference is that One Piece\u2019s battle scenes aren\u2019t that well-thought-out and strategic; they are more power-and-punch clashes. But, in terms of story, plot, drama (not quite), action, comedy (one of the greatest points of One Piece), and adventure\u2014One Piece is a really great anime series to watch! 5. Yu Yu Hakusho The Story: When Yusuke Urameshi, a troublesome delinquent teenager, suddenly dies because of a selfless action\u2014he saves a kid from getting hit by a car\u2014he finds himself a ghost, not knowing what to do next. As a ghost, he is tested by Koenma, the son of the ruler of the afterlife, to see if he\u2019s fit to return to life and be a spirit detective. Yusuke passes the test of Koenma and returns to life. But now, as a spirit detective, he has to help in investigations of the supernatural entities in the world (the demons) and capture them or battle it out with them if necessary. The Similarity: If you\u2019ve watched both Yu Yu Hakusho and Hunter X Hunter already, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019d notice the vast similarity in both, especially the characters. There are a lot of character-counterparts: Yusuke and Gon, Killua and Hiei, Leorio and Kuwabara, and Kurapika and Kurama. Besides that, the overall themes are quite similar. It just so happens that Yu Yu Hakushois older and already one of the classics. But all that having been said, the sameness is rooted in the fact that both anime were created by the same person: Yoshihiro Togashi. 6. No Game No Life The Story: Shiro and Sora are both known as the legendary gamer \u201cBlank.\" As a brother and sister sharing a very deep bond and living as Hikikomori N.E.E.T.s, both have managed to break the limits of gaming and begin questioning whether they were born into the right world. One day, a message from the god of another world arrives, asking if they would want to be summoned to a different world. That god is a boy named Tet who is the one true god of the world of Disboard: a world where there is no murder and crime, and where conflicts are resolved by games. Now, Shiro and Sora will grind their way from the bottom to the top in order to gain the right to challenge the one true god, Tet himself. The Similarity: If you liked how the battles were laid out in Hunter X Hunter, as if everyone was fighting a battle of not only power and strength but of mind and wits, then you\u2019ll surely find the same satisfaction withNo Game No Life. Although No Game No Life has little to no physical combat or fight scenes, it makes up for that with its mind-blowing mind battles/games. In the world of Disboard, strength and power usually have little effect in a battle; what matters is the power of the mind, in order to pull out brilliant strategies and prodigious tactics in the blink of an eye. Like Hunter X Hunter, No Game No Life is also set in a fantasy world full of mystery, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like it just as much. 7. World Trigger The Story: When beings from another world, known as \u201cNeighbors,\u201d suddenly appear in the heart of Mikado City through a dimensional gate, they bring destruction in their wake. Fortunately, an organization of mysterious yet powerful people known as the \u201cBorder\u201d jumps into the fray to stop the neighbors\u2019 invasion. Now, Border serves as a task force securing peace and order in Mikado City, ensuring safety when neighbors suddenly attack.Years after the attack and the formation of Border, a mysterious boy named Kuga Yuuma transfers to a school in Mikado City. His identity is a mystery and his goals are unknown, but he is an experienced combatant, and claims to be a Neighbor from the other world. The Similarity: While Hunter X Hunter is set in a more current world and time, World Trigger is on the Sci-Fi side of things. And while Hunter X Hunter has better story development and action scenes, World Trigger has entrancing elements of its own. For one, the battle scenes in World Trigger use the power of the mind instead of just sheer strength. The plot is also full of surprises and potential. Also, even though the main character is already quite strong (Kuga Yuuma), he has room for much growth and development, as do the other members and major characters.

            "answer_text": "Similar to Hunter x Hunter in what aspects? If it\u2019s something like how the main character goes down the typical Shounen route I recommend these anime. (By the way, anime is a plural itself. You wouldn\u2019t say sheeps, so you shouldn\u2019t call them animes.) Boku No Hero Academia Strong people in crazy costumes with superhuman abilities. Very shounen, but minimal fan service, and the characters are all unique, entertaining, and intelligent! The main protagonist is also in an underdog situation, but just like Gon, we also get to see him earn a new powerful ability (like how Gon learnt about Nen). The genres are Action, Comedy, School, Shounen, Super Power. Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica Do not be discouraged by your first impression of it, however, prepare to suffer. At first glance, it seems like pretty happy-go-lucky series to watch for fun and a bit of good action. As you keep watching, you realise that it\u2019s not as happy as you first thought. Just like Hunter x Hunter, with how everything started going dark. Both are dark, violent, and edgy, the difference is that Madoka is a magical girl anime while HxH is an action adventure fighting shounen. Although HxH has more lighthearted moments than Madoka. The genres are Drama, Magic, Psychological, Thriller. Here\u2019s a few that some other people have already suggested, but I would also suggest as well; Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic Or later known as The Kingdom of Magic, is also another shounen type anime! It shares a lot of features as Hunter x Hunter as both series look like light comedy/action at first yet both end up having much deeper and darker stories. And also despite their bright colours, some dark themes get explored and in both series, the characters are not afraid to kill people here and there. Basically, unlike many shounen action shows, they instead focus more on ethics and training in a more serious way. Despite the characters being fairly young, they are very mature for their age. Genres are Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Magic, Shounen. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood It\u2019s also a remake of a shounen anime. Both have 'magic', alchemy and aura, except with the former, the source is external, then later internal. Alchemy is based off medieval historical musings, aura is modern parapsychology, but it also seems derived from Chinese Chi. Just like Hunter x Hunter, the main characters are on a journey to find something and meet many different (interesting) kinds of people along the way. Additionally, there are themes of vengeance, friendship, honour, and pride that are explored many times throughout both series. The genres are Action, Adventure, Drama, Fantasy, Magic, Military, Shounen. Every anime on my list has some kind of lack of a stable relationship between father and son. Just like Hunter x Hunter! What a coincidence! Enjoy~ ",
