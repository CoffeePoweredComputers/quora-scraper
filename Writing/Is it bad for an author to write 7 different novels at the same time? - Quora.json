            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an each to their own situation. One thing I hate about writing advice (and a lot of advice in general) is that there is an assumption that because it worked for one successful author it will work for everyone. Even good writing books and advice should always be taken critically and tested because individuals are all different. I think the most important, universal advice that does mostly work is just write - get the words down, any words Set a personal daily target you know you can beat and stick to it, unless you can\u2019t one or two days in which case it\u2019s fine. Multiple projects is something I do. Not seven (unless you count the ideas ticking on over in my brain that haven\u2019t yet made it to page in which case more than 7\u2026) but I currently have 3 actual ongoing, in progress writing projects. Only one of them is a novel, the other two are a novella and a short (both of which are commissions for two different anthology projects). When I finish one I will likely have another step in to take the place vacated by it. The reason I do this is to maintain work when it is difficult to progress a project. There can be a number of reasons this happens, not least of which is situations where motivation on a project wanes and I need to step back and do something else while my brain works on a problem. For example, about a month ago I finished the first draft of the novella. I focused on it exclusively and powered through to the end. I then decided to put it to one side and forget about it - let my mind \u2018clear the cache\u2019 of the \u2018idealised version\u2019 so I can look at it more objectively and spot the flaws easier. I had a writer\u2019s group meeting due so I switched to the novel which is the project I am mainly presenting there every 3 months. I worked on that for a few weeks and sent off a new extract to the group to read about a week before the meeting so they could read it. Once that was done I reverted back to the novella and began to make edits. I have put the short on the back burner for a while now (things were not working with it) but I may return to it once the novella is sent off to the editor of the antholology. The novel will be an ongoing project inbetween shorter ones. Incidentally, the novel was originally a short done many years ago that I presented to my writing group to see what they thought, expecting the worst. The overwhelming response was \u2018when do we see the rest of this novel?\u2019 So, yes, you can work on multiple projects if that is how your brain and organisation abilities work. But you may need to prioritise if you want to actually get something to completion. So, maybe bring one to the forefront and focus, keeping the others ticking over to work on when you can\u2019t work on that (waiting for edits to come back is the worst for that). ",

No, as long as you\u2019re not robbing Peter to pay Paul, and not starving one to feed a multitude. I could probably write 7 at a time, but 1) why would I want to? 2) five of them would stink to high heaven and the other two would be questionable. 3) writing 7 in sequence? Yeah. I could probably do that. If you can pull it off, more power to you. ",
