            "answer_text": "Hard to teach when students are talking. Hard for students to listen and learn if they are talking at the same time as the teacher is teaching. It\u2019s that simple. Plus it\u2019s rather rude. You are in a classroom to learn. If the teacher is talking or instructing then you should be quietly listening and concentrating on what is being taught or said as an instruction. If you are talking then you missed something of the conversation and the person who you were talking to missed it to along with 2 or 3 others who could hear you in the background. So you disturbed 5\u20136 people and prohibited them from hearing what the teacher had to say. I guarantee that it was more important than what you had to say. Once the lesson is over you are usually given time to work on homework and that is the time that you can discuss the work and not socialize. Socializing is during your break before the class starts or during lunch and after school. You can talk during group work time as well but that is work time not a social time. There is a time to talk and a time to be silent. Students need to learn that etiquette. It\u2019s what happens in the real world and you need to be talk when to talk and when not to. ",
