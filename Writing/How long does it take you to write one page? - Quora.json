            "answer_text": "I have no idea how long it takes me to write a page, Addie. I just start at the beginning and keep going until I\u2019m finished. That might take days, hours, or minutes. I\u2019ll explain what I mean, but first let me note the time so we can see how long this page takes. I drafted it last night in a little under fifteen minutes. Now editing starting at 9:06 AM. And the answers are: If you mean how long does it take me to think about my answers to questions, that can be anywhere from a few seconds to several days. Right now, for example, I\u2019ve got eleven draft answers waiting to be posted on Quora, but I haven\u2019t submitted any of them yet. I think I\u2019ve decided that some of them didn\u2019t have to be written in the first place. I\u2019m calling all such posts \u2018think-abouts.\u2019If you mean how long does it take me to get a draft on paper, the answer is \u201cNot long at all,\u201d since I type almost as quickly as I can talk.If you\u2019re asking how long it takes me to write a page of final copy, then the answer really is \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That\u2019s not only because I\u2019ve never timed myself; it\u2019s also because it depends on what I\u2019m writing.THAT WAS THE FIRST ANSWER. Here\u2019s the second one if \u2014 Oh, #%^! Enter the dreaded technical problem. I want to get rid of that \u2018a,\u2019 but the computer isn\u2019t letting me. I\u2019m taking time out here: two for snarling and wishing I could replace this laptop with a new one and eight to stretch and get another cup of coffee.)ANSWER #2: ZERO TO FINISH LINE\\ (9:26 AM) When might writing a single page take several hours? When I haven\u2019t clarified for myself exactly what I want to say. At times like that, I just keep writing in order to discover what I was aiming at. It always turns up, sooner or later.When what I\u2019m writing requires frequent stops to fact-check, to look up book titles, medical terms, or such things as a list of factors making breast x rays so hard to interpret. (I\u2019m not a physician, but I\u2019ve learned a lot during my 18 years as a volunteer breast cancer advocate. )When I\u2019ve got to be extra-careful about how I phrase something. Words used carelessly can do so much harm that, especially when it comes to women with b.c., I feel obligated to comb through my posts, finding and replacing words that\u2019re little \u2018time bombs\u2019 \u2014 words that linger in the mind and then, several hours latr, explode \u2014 with safer, less scary words. Ok, it is now 10:27, which is abt one hour from \u201cFINAL DRAFT at 9:26.\u201d Subtract, say, 15? 20? mins for coffee, some stretching, two incoming phone calls at abt three minutes and \u2014 okay, three incoming calls, but this one didn\u2019t even take a minute. Oh, and a bathroom break. And three for the technical annoyance. And a wrong number just now. And now a long incoming text \u2026hang on\u2026 Sigh. Let\u2019s use 9:26 to 10:27, \u2019cause between the phone calls, texts, and the doorbell a moment ago, it suddenly became 11:01. Some days are just like that. Plz do the math. What\u2019ve we got, start to finish, in terms of time? Somewhere between thirty and forty-five minutes? More? Less?  NB: I\u2019m sure others can write their answers in less than half the time it has taken me, so please don\u2019t assume that it\u2019ll take you as long as it takes me to turn out a page of text.

            "answer_text": "I hate answers that begin with \u201cit depends\u201d but it depends. If I\u2019m writing fiction, and I hit a spot in the book where the plot is clear, it can take about 15 minutes because I\u2019ve been writing it in my head for some time. On these days, I can write about 3,000 words over a three to four hour stint. I\u2019m a slow (and bad) typist and I try to edit as I write. My first drafts are clean and, as one of my critique partners pointed out, \u201cBetter than most people\u2019s fourth drafts\u201d and I don\u2019t revise much. If I\u2019m writing something like a press release, it may take half-an-hour. Part of my learning to write stems from the years I spent in the print media, as a reporter and editor at such dailies as the San Jose Mercury-News.. I learned to frame a story quickly and write fast so organizing my thoughts and developing a linear flow comes easily to me. I think everyone should work under a deadline at some point because it forces you to be cogent and careful with words. ",
