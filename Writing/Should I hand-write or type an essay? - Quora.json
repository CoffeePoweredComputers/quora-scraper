            "answer_text": "You should use whichever method is easier for you or comes more naturally. The purpose of the essay is probably not to look professional or personal but to show the judges some aspect of your sincerity or need or ability. I have never been a judge on a scholarship panel so I don\u2019t know what they look for but I have applied for scholarships. Following the instructions is important. Guessing at their motives for the instructions is futile. Just get busy writing; meeting that deadline is important and so is qualifying and following instructions. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely type it. Remember that the people who will be reading your essay will be reading many, many essays and the easier you can make it on their eyes, the better it will be for you. Even if your handwriting is gorgeous, it is easier to read typewritten essays than handwritten ones. If you are more comfortable handwriting, then by all means hand write your first draft, but then find a computer and type it out. Use at least 1.5 line spacing, 12 point font, preferably in an easy-to-read font, such as Times New Roman. Use one inch margins on the sides, top, and bottom of the page. Don\u2019t pack the page with text. Make it easy on the eyes. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Given this scenario, if you feel that your hand writing is neat and grammar up to par, I think that hand written application will stand out. When I think about your question, I asked myself: Considering that computers are readily available why give the hand written option. But than again, I\u2019m prbobly overthinking this. Food for thought - Handwriting in itself can reveal personality and traits. Wish you best of luck! ",
