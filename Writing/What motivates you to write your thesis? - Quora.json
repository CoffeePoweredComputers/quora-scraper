            "answer_text": "I guess you are talking about the day-to-day motivation that gets you to the desk in the middle of your thesis, right? (And not the motivation why to write a thesis in the first place.) For me, there have always been intrinsic motivations (I am curious about the question I am looking at, I want to understand the topic in depth etc.) and extrinsic motivations (some deadline is nearing, my co-author is waiting for my input, etc.) In my opinion, these two types of motivation have a different role in different stages of the thesis. At the beginning, there should be a strong instrinsic motivation. You are still free to choose an exciting question, think about the research design, look for collaborators etc. The longer the thesis goes on, the more important the more \u201cadministrative\u201d tasks become (footnotes, actually writing legible copy, producing graphs, choosing the right statistical tests, formal reqeuirements etc.) and the less intrinsically interesting the task becomes. This is where extrinisic motivations need to kick in. If you have trouble in this part, it is thus helpful to create these on purpose: Schedule regular meetings with your supervisor, try to visit a conference, present your work at workshops etc. ",

The second is to take advantage of free services, for example, http://writingeek.com/thesis-writing-service.html. And in order to motivate oneself, one must understand the reason for procrastination, depending on the reason, the motivation may be different. ",
