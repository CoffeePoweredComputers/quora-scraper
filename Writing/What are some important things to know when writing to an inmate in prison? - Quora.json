            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are some important things to know when writing to an inmate in prison?\u201d As has already been mentioned here by several people, the prison staff is going to read all mail first. But I\u2019m not sure that everyone quite wraps their brain around the idea of that. It\u2019s is not the same as shouting to someone in a public resturant and having other people overhear your outburst. You\u2019re mail is litterally being \u201cintercepted\u201d not \u201cput on speaker.\u201d Depending on what you write, your mail might not be deleivered at all. That nudy pic will not magically slip through, but it might find it\u2019s way home to some correction officer\u2019s bathroom without your approval. Plus, you have your address oin your letter, so they know who sent it. And even if you try to use a false address they still know who sent it because the post office takes a photograph of every letter them move and they can quickly descover from the short list of correspondents of someone in prison, who is writing that individual and what return addresses dose that person typically use. Plus they can pull up the DMV records (if they\u2019re really curious). And I know this sounds far fetched because \u201cwho\u2019s really going to read all that mail\u201d, well I got some bad news for you, Correction\u2019s officers really don\u2019t have that much to do. So if they\u2019re told to read every letter, that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re going to do. However, aside of the embarassment and no privacy, there are bigger considerations. If you divulge incriminating information in your letters, you may become the subject of investigation yourself. But enough about you, the real thing to take into consideration is what you write in your correspondences can impact the prisoner you\u2019re writing (and I do not just mean on the emotional level). The last prison riot I was ever caught up in was sparked by an outside letter to a single prisoner that he never received. For those interested and would like to look it up, I\u2019m talking about the Buckingham roit of 1996. Virginia Warden Stabbed Now they fabricate a bunch of cospiracy theory plots to conceal what really happened, but I was there. The truth was that Dennis Webb\u2019s mother passed away (the only person in the world he had left), and when the letter came in to inform him about it the Warden chose not to deliver it. Instead, the warden opted to have Webb thrown in the hole without explanation. So Webb didn\u2019t know what was going on, other than that the warden was a prick. But the warden was waiting for the funeral to pass before informing Webb that his mother had died. So eventually comes the day, Webb not understanding at first that the funeral was past requested a furlow but the warden dismissed the request and told Webb that he would be released from the hole as soon as the warden felt like he\u2019d come to terms with his mother\u2019s death. So that\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s what started a roit after Webb was released from the hole the day after Christmas. That\u2019s the power on mail in prison. ",

            "answer_text": "Make sure it's a pen pal thing. Keep it civil and make no promises you can't keep. Inmates have rough exteriors but alot of them feel alone and feel nobody loves them. When you write don't get emotional by promising love. Don't write about sexual things. If you decide to go see them than the relationship moves to another level. If you feel some kind of attachment then than you can write about more personal things. See when it comes to inmates you have to be careful because deep inside they are emotional. When I was in prison I was in a emotional prison as well. Sad or mad was all I knew. All the other feelings were surpressed for many years which has caused me problems in the past concerning relationships. Just keep it friendly and not get the inmate upset or jealous in anyway. It starts out like any relationship and needs to grow positively. Remember don't make promises you can't keep and lead no one on. Just think your letters may change someone's Life. ",
