            "answer_text": "What you pay to a freelance writer beginner or otherwise should be based upon the following: the amount of work involved - the more it is the higher you will pay.The skill of the writer - ask for references or writing samples to gauge whether the writer is a fit or not.What the work is worth to you - how much you expect to make out of the piece of writing.Quality of writing you desire - you can find really good writers who, of course, will charge you more, and some equally bad ones who will either give you shoddy work or none at all and keep you hanging around endlessly.Your turnaround time - if you wish to work on a deadline, you would be wise to go with freelancers who have a proven track record of quality work and punctuality. For great and good freelancers, you will have to give out more.When working with a beginner, do not squeeze the life out of him/her for a paltry sum. If they are worth their while, they will quickly get better commissions and move on to greener pastures. You can reduce the amount by a bit say 15% over what you would pay an established writer with similar skills and quality of work. Sometimes, you can strike pay dirt and get a really good writer who is eager to build a portfolio for future jobs in exchange for a cut in the price. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't waste time asking question on quora on paying a 'beginner'. Instead ask the writer to provide few samples of his/her writings. Anyways you wouldn't be going, at any cost, above the industry standard. But if you can have a look at the sample writings beforehand, it'll help you decide whether to go with the writer or lookout for someone else. ",
