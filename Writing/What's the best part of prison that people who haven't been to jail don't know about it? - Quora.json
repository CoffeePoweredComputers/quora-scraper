            "answer_text": "One of the places I worked had a guy start that was recently released from prison. He wanted to make a go of changing his life around. This guy was on time for work, hard working, tried his best at every task. He was well motivated offering the boss a free paint job to the bathrooms, if the boss bought the paint. He held true to his offer and after hours he painted the bathroom. He moved up a bit pretty quick as he should have. With a few wage increases he was able to get out a bit and met a girl with a child\u2026soon they moved in together. He did his best to provide and take care of his new \u201cfamily\u201d. They saved up and bought a used car that he worked on in his spare time bringing it from close to salvage yard condition to something that ran and looked pretty good. After a year or so his girls family members had some health issues and wound up staying at their apartment. It was extra food for the table, car he bust his butt for was in a couple fender benders as they needed to borrow it. Insurance went up, landlord wanted more money as more people in apartment\u2026this guy put in as many a hours as he could, took a 2nd job and was still falling behind. Going from job to job with little sleep took a tol on him, he wasn\u2019t the happy go lucky guy anymore. Even though he was still trying to do his best he was making big mistakes and he knew it. Boss was giving last chances. His girl started getting on his case for \u201cnot being there\u201d and one day this guy came into work saying it was better in prison. He had his three meals, worked out, got to socialize and didn\u2019t go to bed beat to hell getting ragged on. We did our best to talk him away from doing something stupid\u2026but that weekend he got himself arrested for robbery I believe and back to jail he went. I think for him, the best part of prison was to get away from responsibility and the daily grind of life. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re going to get some confusing answers because jail and prison are two entirely different things. Jail is typically less than a year and is merely a lockup for short-timers and people awaiting trial or transport to the penitentiary. I did my time 50 years ago though I recall it as if it were yesterday. I met a few people that actually became friends even after we were released. I also had a couple of truly profound LSD trips, and being there didn\u2019t allow me to sit up at night, have lights on, play music or have any other distractions. I went DEEP into my own subconscious and had profound spiritual experiences as a result. As for the prison experience itself, unless you really enjoy abject terror or shaking in your boots every minute of the day, fearing that you will be gang-raped and turned into an unpaid sex worker at any moment, there is NOTHING to recommend it. I CAN, however, explain why people keep going back. Most of them start when they are children. I mean that literally. The juvenile prison system isn\u2019t much different from full-on prison. It especially includes the advanced studies in criminal thinking, learning to rape or be raped anally, and experiencing life at the end of a sadistic guard\u2019s club. It does offer one thing, though. It offers PREDICTABILITY. We humans LOVE being in our comfort zone. In fact, many people\u2019s comfort zones are like bomb craters full of broken glass and rusty razor blades. But they are, above all else, familiar. We have a craving for familiarity - it\u2019s inborn because the familiar is what keeps us alive as children. Or it\u2019s supposed to, anyway. So perhaps you\u2019re wondering how somebody can do 15 years in the joint, get out and then after two months of being reminded about screaming kids, brutal parole officers, and the many temptations - after realizing that the world isn\u2019t going to ring a bell or buzzer to get you up in the morning, tell you when to eat, sleep, or shit - coming to grips with the fact that you simply do NOT know \u201cthe rules of life\u201d anymore? These folks will throw a brick through a window and stand there, waiting to be picked up, given more time, and sent back to prison. Because even though it closely resembles the Hell described in Medieval Literature, it\u2019s FAMILIAR. Being your own boss is MUCH harder than having every second of your day programmed and timed. Working an actual job is very hard compared to the mindless tasks most cons must do to while away their time. Drugs are FAR more expensive compared to the street economy, and everyone you EVER did business with, hung out with, or made friends with is GONE. I was very fortunate that I was only in for a year. I still had friends, family, a home town that accepted me, my youth, health, and reasonable sanity by the time I got out. If I\u2019d done two years, MAYBE I\u2019d have still been OK. But anything like 3 years or more? I seriously doubt that I\u2019d be a free man today. I was also not particularly criminally-minded, other than my willingness to break the drug possession laws. I wasn\u2019t a thief, didn\u2019t usually lie, and was utterly nonviolent. That made things harder during that year, but when I got out, I simply resumed my civilized life, dropped a LOT of acid, made a lot of music and got laid a WHOLE lot. So yeah, that\u2019s one other good part of prison. Getting the fuck out of there. ",
