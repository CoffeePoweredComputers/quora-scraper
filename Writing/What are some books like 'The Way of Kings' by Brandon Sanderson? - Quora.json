            "answer_text": "I agree with Viktor about The Wheel of Time series. I\u2019m thinking of sweeping epic fantasies that have complex plots and several viewpoint characters. I would also suggest that you read Mistborn, which is Sanderson\u2019s other best-known work. It\u2019s a trilogy, followed by another trilogy that takes place in the same world, a few hundred years later. Pat Rothfuss\u2019s Kingkiller Chronicles are awesome. You would love them. He\u2019s only released 2 of the 3 books so far. But these are in first person, so they aren\u2019t as complex with regard to multiple viewpoint characters as the Stormlight Archive is. And of course there\u2019s Game of Thrones, which I personally don\u2019t care for, but they are big, epic, high fantasies. There\u2019s also Terry Goodkind\u2019s Sword of Truth, which comprises 17 books in a loose series. The first book, Wizard\u2019s First Rule, was pretty good, but IMHO, the series sort of devolved from there. You could also check out Melanie Rawn\u2019s Dragon Prince books. They\u2019re a bit slower, but have good characters. Interesting fact\u2014these are the books that got Brandon Sanderson into reading when he was a kid. Specifically, it was the cover art created by Michael Whalen that appealed to him. The Rainwild series and the Liveship Traders series by Robin Hobb are great, but not as heavy on the action and fighting. They\u2019re more character focused. But they take place in a rich world. The Malazan Book of the Fallen Series by Stephen Donaldson is also a monster of a series with 10 books that are each around 250k words and dozens of viewpoint characters. The first few books were good, but after about book 4, I started having a hard time with them. The plot wasn\u2019t quite as cohesive as I like, and didn\u2019t follow the same characters very much. There is also Tad Williams\u2019s Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series. Classic high fantasy. I haven\u2019t read this series for 20 years, but I loved it when I was 15. I could keep going but that\u2019s enough to give you some good options to consider. ",

A grand, epic story with a large scope set in a fully fictional world (also known as 'high fantasy') with a detailed geography, culture, magical system and so forth?
