            "answer_text": "There\u2019s actually a LOT to consider, not just ONE thing!  \u201cPlot\u201d, \u201cSetting\u201d, and \u201cCharacter\u201d are the three cornerstones of writing. To make some solid fiction, all three have to have real depth and structure. For setting, this means you, as the writer, have to really do your research and take your time developing what you want. For instance, in a fantasy based story with magic as part of it, your setting is structured in such a way as to inform the readers about the story you want to convey through that setting. For instance: A fantasy world where magic has always existed and is their version of \u2018science\u2019A magical world where magic seems random, until a kidnapped computer programmer from our world figures out how to write out magical spells like computer code. (The Wiz Biz by Rick Cook\u2026 a highly underrated fantasy series!)A world where magic has just appearedA fantasy world where magic is part of the universe and almost like a religion, despite the Galaxy having technology to travel faster than light (Star Wars)In each of these different settings, even though they all use \u2018magic\u2019, magic means something different to the characters inside that world because of the way the world is set up. For instance, in Star Wars, the Force is something that exists, but not everyone can tap into it, despite being a part of it. However, the character journey of good and evil for Luke Skywalker is greatly explored through his training and mastery of the Force, which is a part of the setting. To enhance this, George Lucas puts Luke into different places within that setting: Tatooine, a place with little life and little connection to the Force, Hoth, (same, but cold), Dagobah, a place teeming with life and an easier place to connect with the Force. Along with physical locations, part of the setting is the Galaxy\u2019s history, which includes a long conflict between Sith and Jedi, two main groups of Force users. The Galaxy, its history, how the Force works, and how it affects the lives of the people within that Galaxy are all part of the setting of Star Wars. I picked this example because despite any narrative flaws in the movies, the setting is OUTSTANDING. George Lucas created a very creative sandbox that we all wanted to play inside. Part of the fun of Star Wars is being in that Galaxy far, far away. That\u2019s YOUR job as a writer. The Universe of something like Star Wars has history, culture, a depth to the amount of races and beings inside of it, and (in the original trilogy and prequel trilogy), a system of magic with a well-defined set of boundaries and limits.  So for whatever your fictional world is, the setting should have bearing on the story, plot, and characters within it. Putting \u201cHamlet\u201d in space can be done, but unless it\u2019s bringing something to the story, you might be distracting away from the important elements of your vision. Let\u2019s take \u201cThe Abyss\u201d as an example.  What\u2019s the setting? It\u2019s set in the Cold War era, (filmed and released just a couple months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, ironically)It\u2019s set on an oil rigThe oil rig is deep underwaterMost of the action happens while there is a large storm on the surfaceAnd for the most part, it\u2019s our \u2018normal\u2019 worldEach of these elements is important to the story. Being set in the Cold War sets a vast amount of the conflict in the story between the oil rig operators, the Navy SEALS led by Coffee, and the Aliens in the deep. The secrecy in the SEALS\u2019 mission, the threat felt by the aliens over the nukes, and the way the Aliens want to respond to human threats are all tied into thisBeing set on an oil rig is actually a brilliant move, because it sets the stage that the main protagonists are blue-collar workers. They aren\u2019t scientists or military, they are simply people trying to earn a living day-to-day, and therefore SHARE the outlook of many of the people in the audience. Most people just want to live day to day and be happy.The oil rig is deep underwater; this provides two interesting developments for the plot: first, that Aliens can be discovered below us instead of above us, and two, it gives us a thematic symbolism that everyone is in over their heads. lastly, just like the title implies, it physically puts the characters into a place where they are staring into the abyss\u2026 which leads to many of the metaphoric points brought up through the story.The setting is also during a large storm. Skipping the symbolism, this provides logical reasons why the group will be cut off and left to their own devices for most of the story, and ups the tension in the plot.Lastly, it\u2019s set in a mostly \u2018normal\u2019 world. This connects the audience immediately because the characters\u2019 world is pretty much their world too. When the radical element of alien life is exposed to these \u2018normal\u2019 people, we\u2019re set up by the setting and characters to believe they will have many of the same responses we do. In something like Star Trek: The Next Generation, meeting Alien races is commonplace and the crew of the Enterprise have little fear or apprehension doing so. But in our normal world, where Aliens have never been discovered, the reactions can run anywhere from wonder to fear, which is what we see in the film. Hopefully, these examples give you some ideas to chew on. Your setting is VERY important to your writing. As much as possible, you want to use your setting to support the bones of your plot, characters, and story. This happens by being consistent within YOUR WORLD that you create, and by thinking about what the setting means to the characters. It shouldn\u2019t be arbitrary. Your job as a writer is to use every tool to enhance the story. Even if you\u2019re writing a teenage love story between two kids who eventually fall in love, picking your setting(s) will vastly inform the audience about that character. Are these kids meeting in a small town, or a big city? Are they on vacation in a foreign place, or next door neighbors? Where do they work? What is their location filled with? How does that environment affect these characters and the way they perceive the world and the action of the plot? There are a lot of teenage romance stories; I remember one where it was a boy on Earth trying to have a long distance relationship with a girl on the moon. A movie I saw recently called, \u201cThe Last Time\u201d was about two teens from different high schools meeting and falling in love after meeting at a party. Similar stories in terms of genre, very different stories in terms of setting and how the setting impacts the relationship. So get thinking, get writing, and HAVE FUN!!! ",

            "answer_text": "What should people consider when making a fictional world? Ask yourself - \u201cwhat do the people eat?\u201d. A good answer will make your world more realistic than most fantasy and cyberpunk I\u2019ve seen out there. Now, you are the world-builder, so you have the right to say \u201cfarming works like in Stardew Valley\u201d, and have a small farm in the outskirts of the city provide all the needs of the whole city. But it helps if you say it outright - it will both make your world more fantastic, and answer a lot of silly questions. If you\u2019ve never played Stardew Valley, it\u2019s a game where crops take 4\u201312 days from planting to harvest, and the main limit on the amount of crops you can grow is how fast you can plant them and water them. But in real world, before farmers got mighty machines powered by gasoline, most of the population was busy farming and much of the country\u2019s territory was covered in fields growing food.  Picture: modern farmland. So if you\u2019re making a fantasy world where farming is impractical (because everybody outside of city walls gets killed by monsters), I hope you have prepared an answer as to how people survive.
