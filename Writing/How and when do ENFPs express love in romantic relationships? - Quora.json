            "answer_text": "I am a 44-year old female ENFP. Actions will vary between the sexes, so I can speak from a female perspective. I am very in touch with, understand, and trust what I feel. My default is being affectionate. This is universal among ENFP\u2019s. A sign that your ENFP is into you is a show of affection, like touching you\u2026 A LOT. This includes hand holding, kisses, snuggles, and any manner in which we can be in your personal space. I don't express a feeling of \u201clove\u201d verbally until I know for a fact we are both experiencing the same feeling. So, I may feel it without saying it. My actions, however, will scream it. My words will also be very telling. The \u201cl\u201d word may not escape my lips, but my other words will undeniably express it. Everyone is different and I don't know that my response is type-specific. A lot of writing about ENFP\u2019s details people who struggle with committing. I believe that is determined by maturity. I prefer a committed relationship because it feeds me on a deep level. Information about ENFP\u2019s touts the fact that once an ENFP commits, it is a lasting commitment. My advice is to have a straightforward conversation to see if you are on the same page. It will help you to know what is realistic to expect from him next. ENFP\u2019s do well with straightforward communication that is tempered with a kind tone. Say what you mean but don't say it mean would be a good ENFP mantra to describe an effective means of communicating with people (male or female) of this type. Good luck. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe it would be good to have a discussion (or better yet, read the book together) on love languages. It's possible that he's giving you very clear signs that you are overlooking because your love languages are very different. Love languages vary by person / personality types (probably due to nature vs nurture and life experiences or inner child issues) but for me I perceive/feel love in this order: Words of affirmationActs of kindnessQuality timePhysical touchGiftsBut I tend to favor expressing romantic love in the following order: Acts of kindnessPhysical touchQuality timeWords of affirmationGiftsMaybe there's something wrong with me because I don't feel love the same way as I express it\u2026LOL. \ud83d\ude05 Also, if you're interested - for non-romantic love I would move physical touch to number 4\u2026. Now that I've matured some, I have a pact with myself that I will never be the first one to say \u201cI love you\u201d to a romantic interest\u2026although I may be feeling it long before it is spoken (because I fall fast and hard). The reason behind this is that those words mean a whole lot to me (words being at the top of my list, right?), but it is a normal response to reciprocate when someone says that to you - even if you're just on the fence about it. When my SO says it to me I want them to really mean it. I don't want it to be just a reaction\u2026so I will wait till they are ready and say it when it comes from the heart, unprovoked. ",

I cannot remember the name of the book but I was reading through it a few years ago at the public library in my area. This book tells about the different categories and gives examples of what the people would be like in the different categories. Maybe this will help you. You can possibly find more explanations on the internet if you search \u201cMeyers-Briggs\u201d test and the categories. Too, you could try talking to your boyfriend and in time he may learn to open up to you. Sometimes, it is just a matter of learning about the other person and learning to trust in the other person so that you can reveal your emotions to that person. You may just need to give him time. Sometimes when we cannot relate to another person, this may be one reason that you realize that this person is not someone that you are going to have a relationship with. We can only give the time and interest to a relationship to find out if that other person is someone that we are compatible with. Good luck. ",
