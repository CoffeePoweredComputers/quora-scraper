In place of pivotal you could use essential, key, or played a crucial role. I'm not sure what you mean by fringe benefits, you may want to elaborate. Scholarships, financial aid, and fringe benefits effectively aided my application to this program. ",

Without passive voice, you say \u201cScholarships, financial aids, and fringe benefits were effective in my application to this program.\u201d I can\u2019t tell exactly what you mean by this sentence. Are you applying for \u201cthis program?\u201d Or are you telling someone how you were able to \u201capply yourself to\u201d this program? Meaning \u201cwork hard on it?\u201d Because of the financial aid you got? If so, say something like \u201cI could better apply myself to the _____ program because of the help I got from my scholarships, (etc.)\u201d ",

If, for example, you are running down all the hoops you had to jump through and all the trouble involved, then, if the financial aid \u201cfinally\u201d pulled you through, the use of \u201cfinally\u201d would have some bearing on the message. If not, then you should omit it. Note that T-shirt has a hyphen, unless you spell it out as tee shirt or tee shirt. May the force be with you! ",
