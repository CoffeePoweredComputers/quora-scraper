            "answer_text": "You can find a lot of sources from where you get notes . There are Made easy hand written notes available, ACE academy notes available. BUT , I would recommend you to prepare note by yourself. Because other\u2019s notes are made from their perception , so it may not good for you. So my opinion is to read book , or study video lectures available in youtube or may be you get help from class teachers , then you prepare your notes. No need to read different books for one topic that actually waste your time, so read and understand the concept , Prepare short notes , write down formulas , diagram , that will help you definitely. And also one thing, reading own hand written notes more affects your brain , you can remember things better. Thanks. ",
