            "answer_text": "Not possible. Assuming you're addressing Fictional works, all writers are subject to criticism and comparison. If an novel was truly incomparable, it would be heralded and celebrated by all. And deservingly so, in my opinion. But my answer to your question is no, with an example.  Recent example: J.K. Rowling was as poor as it is possible to be in the UK without being homeless and she began writing Harry Potter in the aftermath of her mother's passing in local coffee shops. Her idea would go on to influence a entire generation (I argue and say two generations as I was born in the late 90's and still experienced Potterfever) of children to read. I'm sure someone can interject and add the correct number but she was rejected from a large number of publishers prior to her work being picked up by Bloomsbury I believe.  If it was a truly incomparable work that publishers could have predicted would bring them millions of readers and dollars in sales; I highly doubt Rowling would have struggled to publish her work. One reading of her manuscript would have sold the publishers. Did it? No. And yet we can sit here and look at her incredible success today. ",
