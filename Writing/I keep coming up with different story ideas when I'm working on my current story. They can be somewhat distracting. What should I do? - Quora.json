            "answer_text": "A lot of writers self-sabotage when their WIP (work in progress) gets difficult. Yes, you can ignore those ideas, but really what you need to do is pay attention. This is your subconscious talking, and sometimes your subconscious is smarter than you might expect. Has your story taken a dull, predictable turn? What if the new story idea is in fact an abstract suggestion for a better course to take? For example, I\u2019ve been working on a story that\u2019s getting pretty abstract and symbolic, and I\u2019ve been worrying that it\u2019s so far out there that the reader won\u2019t be able to connect. My brain starts thinking about the new S&S series I plan on writing when I\u2019m done with this trilogy. What\u2019s the appeal of the new S&S story? It\u2019s down-to-earth, gritty, immediate. My WIP is getting all spiritual on my ass. So, maybe I should take a hint from my subconscious and bring some aspect of my WIP back down into the real world. Maybe I should jerk my character from the spiritual world back to reality, which will endanger everyone and make it that much harder to return and solve the spiritual problem he\u2019s facing. These new ideas may relate more to your WIP than you realize. Examine them as if they\u2019re dreams, and you\u2019re a psychiatrist analyzing them and relating them to the patient\u2019s real world problems. You may end up with a breakthrough that will help you finish your WIP. Good luck! ",

Review these items say, weekly - you may find that some of them are relevant to your original project and can be incorporated.
