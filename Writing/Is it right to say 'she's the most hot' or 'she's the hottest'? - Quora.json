            "answer_text": "About a century ago the first phrase would have been considered proper grammar and I believe in England it still is but in America there has been a conscious effort to minimize descriptives to get right to the point. Therefore the word \u201cmost\u2019 is rarely in used in favor of the \u2018est\u2019 adjective. Most Smart \u2014 smartest \u2014 but does not work with \u2018intelligent\u2019 because \u2018intelligentest\u2019 is just wrong and \u2018most intelligent\u2019 works. Most Pretty \u2014 Prettiest. But when we look at the word \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201cmost bitch\u201d does not sound right but \u201cmost bitchy\u201d does \u2014 yet \u201cbitchiest\u201d is short and to the point, and \u201cmost\u201d preferred. (see\u2026not preferrest). ",
