            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re asking whether it\u2019s important to have a subject at all, then yes, in most cases. A formal letter is called this way because it has certain \u201cform\u201d requirements. A subject is a part of this form. If you\u2019re asking whether the content of the subject important, then it depends. A subject that is to the point is a good help in getting your letter read in time and by the right person, as they will know better what it is and what it can be about. A good subject is a demonstration of you not wasting other people\u2019s time and being considerate with information. A subject that is simply \u201cInfo\u201d, or \u201cImportant\u201d, or \u201cThis is a letter from John Doe\u201d, is annoyingly redundant. In online communication, it also comes off as spam, which can result in it being discarded by accident. If you are writing a letter that is not spam, that is important, and that should reach someone you want to make a good impression on, then you should put some effort into the letter subject. But if you\u2019re writing a short letter to e.g. your boss in a small company with whom you\u2019re on good terms and a letter is merely a formality to be filed away into company inside correspondence for future reference, then you can make do without a proper subject.
