            "answer_text": "It could have been one of these three: (1) Colony, which was about a colony on a new planet that discovers the native life form can perfectly imitate any non-animate object. Not to ruin it for you, but they all get eaten in the end. (2) Beyond Lies The Wub which involves a crewmember bringing a large porcine animal onto the ship. The crew decides to eat it, then discovers that it is intelligent and talks alot. They eventually do eat it, but the Wub has left the body of the animal and taken over the body of the captain. (3) Oh, to Be a Blobel! is a love story about spies in the Human-Blobel war who had undergone irreversible physical modification to become the other species. Humans became Blobels, disgusting single-cell, protoplasmic species, while Blobels became equally disgusting humans. ",
