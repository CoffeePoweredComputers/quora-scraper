            "answer_text": "When I served, there was not a set number of letters that could be sent, but limited time in which to do so, and only in the later weeks of training. Most of his time is going to be spent studying, getting his bunk, locker, and uniforms (even underwear and t-shirts) ready for inspections, practicing for inspections, marching drills, exercising (PT), cleaning things, etc. What little time he does have when he\u2019s not being told what to do, he may be taking the time to rest, and reading the letters you\u2019re sending every single day. I can tell you that getting a lot of mail, or getting unauthorized packages will bring unwanted attention to him. My then fiance sent me a huge box stuffed with snacks\u2014 entire boxes of little debbies, Apple Newtons, AirHeads, some pictures of her, and a pair of her perfumed panties in a ziploc baggy. Fortunately, I was able to hide that last item before the T. I. came into the room. Nevertheless, I got fussed at, and the T.I. said I had 5 mins to go downstairs and eat as much as I could in those 5 mins and throw the rest away. Also, much to my squad mates\u2019 dismay, I wasn\u2019t allowed to take anyone with me to share the load and prevent so much food going to waste. So I would say, don't expect too much in the way of receiving letters, but appreciate whatever you get, and please do not send excessive mail or any other packages to him. He will not want to be on his instructor's radar because of that, and he also has to keep his locker inspection-ready, and that will become increasingly difficult to do if you send him lots of mail.

But in Army Basic (IADT), other than going to church once a week, mail was one of the few privileges privates had. I didn\u2019t get to make a phone call home until almost three weeks into the program, but I was able to send and receive letters once a week, beginning with the 2nd week. There was no limit to the number of letters (other than my ability to write and pay postage). But there were times when I didn\u2019t *get* letters until two weeks after they were sent, due to bureaucratic bull that all military people sometimes encounter. (And have you double-checked his address?) So it is possible your guy isn\u2019t getting your letters in a timely fashion, and it is also possible he just isn\u2019t much of a writer. In our modern age, can you honestly say he\u2019d ever written you that many pen and paper letters BEFORE he left? It is also possible he may face some hazing (from his fellow airmen, and/or his superiors) for getting a pile of lovey-dovey letters from you, and he might be trying to silently discourage you. ",

He is much more worried about you forgetting him right now. Believe me. The first weeks of Basic is an assult on his body and mind. \u2026and each day when the DI's are done with us, all we can do is collapse into the rack and just like that\u2026.we are out! Exhausted. Be patient. He will undoubtedly see one or more of the guys in his platoon get a dear John letter. It happens often. My girlfriend wrote me two months in and informed me she loved my brother . And that she had aborted our baby. So yeah\u2026he has you on his mind each night. Once the letters start, they will come pretty regular. And don't stop writing. It's the one enjoyable thing in boot. Good luck. ",

Don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re letters are probably the bright point of his day, week, or however often he gets mail. Keep it up. After basic training, he\u2019ll go to tech school, for more training. He may have time to write you there, but possibly not. Just ride it out. He\u2019ll get in touch with you when he can. ",

You should hear back by the 3rd/4th week of training though. I think this a cold splash of water in the face, but once he signed on the line, you automatically became probably 5th or 6th in his immediate list of priorities. Welcome to the military life! ",

By about the 3rd or 4th week it was a little better flow and depending on the TI or the whole class not screwing up that they would let us have some time to send letters.
