            "answer_text": "This can happen a couple different ways: If they\u2019re a larger YouTuber who gets a lot of views it\u2019s possible that the company that owns the phone sponsors them and gives them the phone for free to review.Also on that, if they\u2019re a large YouTuber, and get a lot of views, they probably make enough money to afford the phones.YouTube pays out an average of $1 for every thousand views (that watch ads), meaning if they get an average of 100K views per video, that\u2019s $100-ish dollars. Minus whatever YouTube\u2019s cut is. ",
