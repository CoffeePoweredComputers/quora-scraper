I think it would be a wild twist for him to admit that he was a sexually abused child. If it wasn't for him saying he had to face secrets that were in the past, he could have come out as a gay man. But I don\u2019t think that is the set-up. Nor will he admit to being a closet liberal. He could also be referring to something that happened in Vietnam along the lines of the My Lia massacre. But I think that would be a stretch. I'll go with my first choice, perhaps he even killed his abuser and ran off to join the Army. Whatever it is we will soon know. Rambo has had a long and wild career career, it is a shame to see it go. Perhaps there will be a prequel.
