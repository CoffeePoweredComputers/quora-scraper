            "answer_text": "Great question, participating in research projects while you're still a medical student might prove challenging sometimes (we're busy people), but at the end of the day it gives you an edge over the others. It's real world experience and proves you have the right knowledge and motivation to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge.   You have basically two options: Start your own independent project: you'll have to come up with an interesting and feasible idea, gather resources and look for mentors and guidance.Join an existing project: I'm sure that there are a lot of gifted scientists in your medical school, doing research in all kinds of fields. Most of them would be more than happy to have you on board; they'll help you learn the ropes and provide you with the needed resources.Each one of these alternatives has pros and cons. While developing your own idea grants more freedom and an extra feeling of accomplishment, you'll also have to do a lot of work validating your idea and gathering the resources (money, material, patients, ...) to work on it. If you join an existing project, you may eventually be given some freedom to work on your ideas, but expect to work a lot to earn the researchers' trust. Don't worry about publishing right now. Focus on doing great work and answering the unsolved problems out there. Once you do, it's really easy to send your paper to scientific journals or, if you chose the second approach, your research mentors will take care of it for you (and your name will be on the authors' list!). Remember to organize your time and allocate specific weekly time slots to work on the lab, read on the latest findings in your field and refresh your Statistics knowledge (this book is awesome). Working on a research project is stimulating at an academic and personal level. You\u2019ll grow as a young scientist, improve your skills and, most importantly, push the boundaries of human knowledge. Adapted from How to Start a Research Project in College ",
