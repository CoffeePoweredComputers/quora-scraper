            "answer_text": "\"Suggest me a song\" is incorrect but your sentence would be understood. There are certain English verbs where the preposition is generally omitted from the sentence when there is an indirect object, such as \"he bought me a car\" or \"she gave the baby a toy\" or \"John told me a story.\" The verb \"to suggest\" is different because you must include the preposition. Here are some examples: The chef suggested a seafood dish TO us. I suggest a book TO you. The shopkeeper suggested a gift FOR her. The most common way to express your example is: \"can you suggest a song for me?\" or simply, \"can you suggest a song?\" ",
