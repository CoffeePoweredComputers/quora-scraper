            "answer_text": "I have grown up in an environment where English is not the mother tongue, and I speak English fluently, without an accent. I strongly believe it is possible to do. Here is what I did. Writing For a few years in high school, every week, I would take an English newspaper, and read articles. I would have a copy book where I would write each new word I found, the definition, and an example of how I might use it. I would do the same for every book I read. I would also have a copy book of \u201cexpressions\u201d where I would record things like \u201csine qua non\u201d or just interesting ways of saying things, metaphors, similes etc. This is how you learn different styles and become more flexible as a writer. It helped me understand formal writing, conversational writing, as well as vivid descriptive writing for stories and such. Growing your vocabulary and reading different types of writing will help you quite a bit. Once you\u2019re great at writing fluently, then the speaking part comes pretty easy. Speaking The easiest way is to make friends with someone who speaks fluently and can correct you. Don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes, make many mistakes and let your friend correct you. That is the fastest way. I moved to Canada when I was 19. Before that, I only spoke English in English class. My written English was excellent but I just didn\u2019t have a lot of practice speaking it. All our teachers spoke French or Creole. I had a bit of an accent, and was not used to listening to English being spoken sooooooo fast. Being around Canadians and also watching some TV helped me understand their English quickly enough to keep up. One problem some of us ESL folks have is we speak like we write - too formally. This is especially obvious in North America, where conversational English is the norm even in business. You can easily start to pick that up by watching TV with the captions on, reading local newspapers in English, etc. You can apply the same concept as above and look up words you don\u2019t recognize. Eg. I didn\u2019t know that \u201cpop\u201d means \u201csoda\u201d, which I used to call \u201cfizzy drink\u201d. If you\u2019re a college student, you might find urbandictionary helpful in understanding all the obscure lingo that college students somehow seem fascinated by. Speaking without an accent There\u2019s two parts to this. One is mimicking the sounds. The other is the melody. By that I mean pay attention to the emphases, which syllables they fall on, does the tone go up or down, that kind of stuff. As a musician that part came a little easier for me. It might also be easier for you if you speak a tonal language (I don\u2019t, so I\u2019m not sure about that). I often feel that English is a tonal language without the proper signs to indicate which tone to use :-) To practice this, you can record yourself. All phones have a voice recorder now. Record and listen, and compare to how a native speaker sounds. What is different about yours? Can you get closer to the native\u2019s pronunciation? You can always ask a friend to help you if you can\u2019t figure out what you\u2019re doing differently. Hope that helps!

            "answer_text": "If you are coming into English without the formal education provided by our education systems, then you will have learned English as a second language at your home country in a foreign language program, which is combined with your primary language and common subjects. This means that your word sense, grammar, and knowledge is comparable to that study in your primary language and according to your education system and its most frequent materials. It is also situated with your government over that schooling, which is setting standards and bringing norms to all schools. English as a second language is very common in both developed and undeveloped countries, where knowing some English can go a way to communicate with those who are native in English or who use English as a primary language. You can call them in your respective study and progressing state to study English, those natives are using English as a first language. Toward that end, you are learning the most always when you communicate and follow along a native speakers work, as long as it is governed in some acceptable relationship such as a contract or formal institution. The basic answer toward your fluency from intermediate, is to enroll in the education system in an English-speaking country. This is the same effect as applying for international study at a country where English is the language of the law and public, expected for most citizens to conduct business and enjoy their citizenship. You should take a formal study at university or take a formal examination from the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. This or an examination that is equivalent in official usage and state approval, as well as public recognition, will make you more studious and wanted from faculty such as in university, or good on the market with employers who need more accreditation for their foreign applicants. You should take initiative and study English and take such a formal test, rather than use an experience to improve your English and get acquainted with the language, unless that is your only option. To take a major coursework at a university as an international student, however, is a practical and common way to go about learning English as a second language and furthermore developing it. ",
