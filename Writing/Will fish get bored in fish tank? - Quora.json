            "answer_text": "Just from my observations with goldfish, when I rearrange things or add new decor, the fish seem to be drawn to the opportunity to explore and experience something new. The behavior looks very different from the anxious reconnaissance exploration I describe at Goldfish are social animals . When they're exploring a novel stimulus within a familiar environment, they don't appear to perceive the novelty as threatening. They appear to be drawn to it because they experience something positive about exploring something new. They expend energy swimming all around and up and down and in and out of the novel stimulus, continuing far longer than it would require just to determine that there's no danger and also no food associated with the novel stimulus. Clearly experiencing a novel stimulus is something worth energy expenditure for its own sake. In other words, they enjoy it. It seems to me that any creature that's capable of enjoying novelty would also be capable of suffering boredom. Here is video of my goldfish immediately after I introduced a waterfall to their basement pond: Waterfall! After a few hours they stopped the group swimming back and forth. After a few weeks none of them seemed to go out of their way to play in the waterfall current. The novelty had worn off. But when I rearrange the plastic boxes so new current patterns are created around them, they show the same pattern of exploring and apparently enjoying the new experience, showing high interest at first and then gradually losing interest until I make another change. I like to change their environment every few weeks to keep their world interesting. ",

            "answer_text": "#Fish-tank Yesss\u2026 Fish will get bored in any size of tank\u2026 Because fish are mediated and habituated in naturally and basically in their life cycle in large size open water body than that of so-called tank. Tank is a small place where fish could not did freely movement, gases exchange, feed intake etc as they did in the open water. On the other hand, the person who keeping fish in the tank, might oftenly be stocked fishes in crowded densities, resulted impure water, oxygen deficit, co2 and ammonia surplus etc. that causes fish unhappy, unhealthy and bored mostly and genuinely\u2026!!!
