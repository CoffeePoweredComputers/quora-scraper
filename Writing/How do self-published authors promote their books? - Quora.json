            "answer_text": "Unless you have money, the task is daunting and you have no guarantees that anyone will take you seriously or be interested enough to buy your book. I have no money, and therefore I have to rely on various social media sites. I have published for over three years and social media are my only venues for advertising my work. I include Quora as social media, where I have mentioned certain books I have published on Amazon if my answers have some relevance to the mention. After two years of promoting myself on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn. MeWe and Quora, the number of books sold has been minimal, and not even sufficient for trending. If you have money, one way to promote your work is to to take out small classified ads in Newspapers around the world. You need to research several aspects such as total paper circulation and the cost for a small ad. The ad will usually comprise something about the Author (name) and genres (novels and nonfiction) and the Amazon link. Sometimes some newspapers charge per word and others charge per column inch. Submitting your book to newspaper or magazine book reviewers is, in my view, wasting time since the Traditional Publishers often pay critics for some generic review of their authors and this avenue of advertising is usually a monopoly for the established publishers. If you think this is a gripe then just look at the generic reviews by name critics: \u201cPoignant and Thought Provoking!\u201d - \u201cA classic, in the making!\u201d - \u201cRelevant and heartwarming!\u201d - \u201cA must read book!\u201d YouTube, creating a video and showing your work, and possibly reading some, can also be helpful but is all dependent on how many people come across your name or work, accidentally. As in all social media, you can pay to grab a wider audience, but this is usually not cheap, and again, you can show people the best book ever written, but you cannot force them to part with their money to read your work. I currently have over 580,000 views to my answers on Quora. I do have some followers on here, too. I have yet, however, to find this translating into sales of my work. It is all like gambling unless you have the resources of a large and established Publisher. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Malik, Social media is a great friend to self-published authors like myself. It gives you platforms to find friends, share your posts and encourage potential readers to learn more about you as a person and author. That last part is significant. I think someone has already said about not spamming sites, especially promotion sites on FB for example. To get your posts noticed, you have to be seen as someone who will also encourage other authors in your genre, offer advice, and be friendly. The most effective free way of promoting your books is to build an audience. Create your own personal group on FB or MeWeEncourage readers to join your group by posting a link to it at the back of your books.Make posts about things associated with your story - invite comments.Have competitions on your group and offer small but appropriate prizes.Post teasers from your latest WIP to your group - letting your readers know they are getting an exclusive look into what you are doing.Be yourself and share things about yourself, so your readers can see you are more than a machine that writes stories. I honestly think my puppies have more of a following on FB than I do lol.Friend and promote other authors in your genre - join author takeover events, offer copies of your books as competition prizes, and become known in your genre.That list is only the tip of the iceberg of course, but hopefully it will give you a start. Most of all, have fun with it. Marketing is a huge fact of life for all authors, especially those who self-publish. Of course, it helps if you\u2019ve written a good book. Have a lovely day :) ",
