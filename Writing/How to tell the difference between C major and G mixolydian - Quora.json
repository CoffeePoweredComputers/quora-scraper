            "answer_text": "At first glance, these scales might look the same, because they contain the same notes: C Major: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, CG Mixolydian: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, GBut they are different! Firstly, they start and end on different notes. Therefore, the series of intervals that make up each scale is different. As a result they will sound different when played against certain chords in a chord progression. The best way to tell them apart is to listen to the chord tones of each scale. To get the chord tones of a scale just select the following notes from the scale: 1st note, 3rd note, 5th note, and 7th note.So for C Major, the root chord will have the notes: C, E, G, B.This is a C major seventh chord.For G Mixolydian, the root chord will have the notes: G, B, D, F.This is a G dominant seventh chord.If you play these chords on a piano with your left hand, and then play the respective scales where they came from with your right hand, you will notice a slight difference in how they sound. It\u2019s all because of that 7th note! If the scales were identical, then G Mixolydian would need to have major 7th note in it (F#) to match the major 7th note (B) in the C major scale. If it did, then the scale would no longer be G Mixolydian, but in fact G Major (or G Ionian). If I was improvising over a chord progression in the key of C and I was using seventh chords in my harmony, I might actively target the Mixolydian scale on the on the V chord (G dominant 7th) because it would resolve nicely to the tonic chord C.

            "answer_text": "You would have the same problem with any of the modes utilizing the notes of the C Major (Ionian). How do you distinguish C Major from D Dorian, E Phrygian, etc? The answer is a bit subjective, but if the melody seems to revolve around G, and end on a G, then you\u2019re probably dealing with G Mixolydian. In modal music, we do not speak of a \u201ctonic\u201d but rather a \u201cfinalis\u201d - the note at which the melody comes to rest. I\u2019m amazed at how much attention is paid to modes on Quora. The modes as we know them are a 17th century construct; an attempt to explain Ancient Greek music - about which we still know nothing - and the church modes associated with Gregorian chant (circa 6th century). They are of little historic or practical use. We do teach them, but I think they get a lot more attention than they\u2019re worth. Much as we now speak of Major keys and their relative minors - always built on the sixth degree of the relative Major, any Major key carries with it, a set of relative modes. For example, given D Major and its key signature of F# and C#, we can now speak of an E Dorian, F# Phrygian, G Lydian, A Mixolydian, B Aolian (relative minor) and C# Locrian. And BTW, even the 17th century theorists did not go for the Locrian mode due to the tritone between its finalis and its fifth step (I\u2019ll refrain from the term \u201cdominant\u201d in a modal context).
