Not only two examinations, sometimes its so usual that some of them keep failing all the examinations, but at last in the board exams they grab the ranks. So, Never underestimate yourself with the result of one or two examinations. Until you keep working hard with the desire to get 90+. All The Best! Nikahath ",
