            "answer_text": "\"Art of Seduction\" by Robert Greene dives into the psychology behind love/lust and the human desire for connection. Although some use this as a manual to seduce and lure people in, the book can give the reader insight to what people actually want in relationships. The author divides the book into different types of people, different types of seducers, etc. The book is honest and because it is right, it can be used to play mind games with others.  In order to have a successful relationship, I believe you must first understand what the other wants and needs. Then you must learn how to read the other person's unspoken signals. Of course, learning one's partner takes time and years. I think it would be wise to pick up this book and learn the potential needs and wants of the other. By the way, the \"seduction\" is not how to fulfill the partner in bed. It's about the seduction of the mind. ",
