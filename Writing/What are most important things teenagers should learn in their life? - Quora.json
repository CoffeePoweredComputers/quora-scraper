            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a lot I could say, such as don\u2019t focus too much on technology, or love your parents, or simply survival skills. But there\u2019s one thing that I believe every single teen without exception needs to learn. Yourself. The teen years are a time of change, instability, and lot of insecurity. Our bodies are different than they\u2019ve ever been before, and our minds are going crazy. We really don\u2019t know who we are. So we try to define ourselves through others. We let our clothing, or our music, or our friends, or our intelligence define us. We let superficial things become a part of our personality. I bet if you were to ask random teens at a high school how they would describe themselves, most of what they would say is superficial characteristics. Nothing deep about their emotions, their strengths, or their weaknesses, simply words about how they act, and what they like. We need to know ourselves. We need to know what, deep-down, is our true self, that we will always be regardless of our friend group. We need to discover for ourselves what we love, what we hate, and how we\u2019ll always be.  That\u2019s hard, because everywhere we go we get stuck with labels: The bully. The nerd. The try-hard. The jock. The emo kid. But none of those are really describing who you are, they\u2019re only describing the stereotypes you fit into, and the roles you fill. Descriptions like that fool us into thinking those simple words represent who we really are. They don\u2019t. If you got to know people better, the labels will have a lot more depth: The guy who belittles others to try to help his self-esteem. The quiet boy who doesn\u2019t want to risk rejection with friends, so he spends his time learning about fictional universes. The girl who wants to push herself to be the best person she is, because she loves the thrill of achievement. The boy who struggles with body image, and confidence, so he uses sports to build himself up and prove what he can do. The girl who feels like nobody wants to talk to her, so she avoids everyone, and embraces anything to set herself apart.  Basically, teens struggle with identity. After all, the other struggle teens have as we get older besides puberty, is deciding where we want to take our life. What will we major in for college, will we even go to college, what sort of job would we love to have, etc. Those are hard decisions to make, and without any idea of our true identity, only what others think of us or what people we identify with\u2026it\u2019s all the harder. Now I\u2019m not saying our identity is completely formed in the teenage years. There is plenty of development to come in our 20s, and a lot of maturing yet to be done. So of course no teen should have 100% of their identity figured out. However, we need an idea. We need at least some core aspects of ourselves that we know will stay true, and that will be important throughout our lives. Things like your faith, your morality, your emotional strengths and weaknesses, and your passions. Those are critical to the rest of our lives. If there\u2019s one important thing teens really need to learn in life, it\u2019s their identity. ",

Smoking, pills, drugs, and drinking till you throw up is not \u201cfun.\u201d They are not rites-of-passage that all kids have to partake in to qualify their teenage years. They are life-long habits that follow you well into your twenties and thirties. Almost everyone I know that started smoking or doing drugs in high school, STILL DOES in one form or the other. I heard Steve Harvey say it best when he said, \u201cSin will keep you longer than you wanted to stay and cost you more than you wanted to pay.\u201d Use this time to develop your interests and talents. Life will be a lot more fun in the long run, trust me. 2. Take a stand and be your own brand. Be you. Don\u2019t know who you are? Well, you\u2019re in good company because neither do most of your friends. But a good first step in finding out who you are is to not be what others are as a default. You are an original, act like it. Originality is found in authenticity. Don\u2019t ever try to bend your values or your personality to match someone else\u2019s or to fit in. There is little value in being a copy, but an original is priceless. You are priceless. Don\u2019t devalue yourself by being a copy. 3. You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out. You might look around and think that everyone else has it figured out, but they don\u2019t. They are good at blending in and pretending. Some people are just trying on their confidence while on the inside they\u2019re shaking in their boots! Don\u2019t measure yourself by others. Remember, you aren\u2019t on the same time table as someone else. You are not expected to live life in the same order as them either. 4. Your choices should have far more to do with your values than your friends. It may look like others are moving ahead into adulthood and you\u2019re being left behind. But this is not true. You don\u2019t need to worry about not having had a boyfriend/girlfriend and thinking you\u2019re the only one not having sex and all the other things that can preoccupy a teens mind. You are not in competition with others. Remember, you are an original so your choices should have far more to do with your values than your friends.

You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out. You might look around and think that everyone else has it figured out, but they don\u2019t. They are good at blending in and pretending. Some people are just trying on their confidence while on the inside they\u2019re shaking in their boots! Don\u2019t measure yourself by others.

You don\u2019t need to worry about not having had a boyfriend/girlfriend and thinking you\u2019re the only one not having sex and all the other things that can preoccupy a teens mind. You are not in competition with others. Remember, you are an original so your choices should have far more to do with your values than your friends. 5. Character is everything. Strive for personal integrity. Be a person of your word. We live in a world that puts a lot of emphasis on success and money and fame and popularity, but none of that can lay a finger on a person who has deep character. Deep character will get you further than all of the above. So, go deep and then go deeper. Go deep in kindness. Go deep in courage to do the right thing. Go deep in humility. Go deep in grace. Be upright in what you say and do. 6. You are not weird. ALL people are quirky and complex. Whatever you are thinking or experiencing in a certain time in life is not specific to you. Other people have been there, too. We are all normal in that we are all unique. 7. If you have to choose between being respected or liked, choose respected. They are not the same thing. You can be liked by everyone and not like yourself. Liking yourself comes from respecting yourself. Respecting yourself comes from not compromising your values and beliefs in order to be liked. 8. You will outgrow people. They will outgrow you. It\u2019s okay. Some people are meant to stay for a lifetime and most aren\u2019t. You will be betrayed by people you hold dear. But don\u2019t let bitterness take root in your heart. Give it to God and forgive them. Learn from it and move on. But don\u2019t be surprised by it. We are all broken, flawed people susceptible to acting in inexcusable ways. 9. Be thankful and you will be happy. If you ever find yourself feeling down about something, start counting your blessings. It\u2019s all about perspective. 10. Take personal responsibility for yourself. If a relationship ends badly, were there red flags? Were you compromising yourself at your own expense? If you can\u2019t afford your bills, are you living above your means. You can\u2019t live in victory if you\u2019re stuck playing the victim. Choose to see the unlovely about yourself and your actions. You can\u2019t change others, but you have to own your actions before you can change yourself. 11. Be humble. Don\u2019t ever think that you couldn\u2019t be in someone else\u2019s shoes. It only takes a few bad decisions or unexpected life circumstances to wipe you off your feet. Don\u2019t ever think yourself more highly than others. 12. Say I\u2019m sorry. When you hurt someone (and you will) say you\u2019re sorry. Be quick about it. 13. Learn from other\u2019s mistakes. Don\u2019t learn the hard way. It\u2019s hard. It includes embarrassment, set-backs, long-term consequences, etc. But when you do make mistakes, and you will, learn from those, too. 14. Be confident. Don\u2019t be embarrassed if you don\u2019t know something or when you make a mistake. None of that defines you as a person, your character does. Confidence comes from knowing your worth. Remember, you are a priceless original. 15. Be smart not just educated. Being educated is not the same as being smart. My father was always the smartest person in the room and he barely graduated high school. You will meet lots of educated, non-smart people. Don\u2019t ever think someone\u2019s degrees are more valuable than someone\u2019s knowledge of how to hunt and skin a deer. There\u2019s more than one way to be smart. 16. Live like God is right beside you because He is. This thought should comfort you, guide you, and scare you, at times. Seek him and you will find him. After all, you were created by him and for relationship with him. It only makes sense that you should know him. 17. God Every house needs a foundation and every life needs one, too. God is mine. Make God yours and your foundation will be strong. When the big, bad wolf comes to blow your house down, and he will\u2026your foundation will matter. 18. Cultivate a good work ethic. It will get you further than good looks or natural talent. Theodore Roosevelt said Far and away the best thing life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing. He is right. It is one of the biggest gifts life offers. 19. Never just settle in and give up. Put in the work, but know when to walk away. Like the Hall & Oates song says the strong give up and move on, the weak give up and stay. 20. Laugh and Love. Laughter and love really are the best medicines. It really does lighten a load. Laugh at yourself. Laugh at others, but not to their face. LOL. Laugh, and laugh, and laugh some more. Life is funny and we take ourselves too serious sometimes. Surround yourself with people who make you laugh and marry someone who laughs (it will make all the difference) and laugh at your feeble attempts and then love yourself for trying and try again. Set your life cycle to laugh and love and repeat and your load will be lighter. ",
