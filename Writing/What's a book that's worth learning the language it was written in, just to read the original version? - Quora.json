            "answer_text": "Most books originally written in a Latin language beg to be read in a Latin language. It might be true for Mandarin and Swahili as well. I just don\u2019t know.But all translations from a Latin language, be it Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian into English are losing half of the music. Around the 19th century, English started to bleed syntax. As of now, it has maybe 20% of its original syntax, let alone that maybe 70% of its humongous vocabulary is useless for the basic reason that readers don\u2019t (want to) know it anymore. The problem is not losing per se, but losing precision on one hand, and musicality on the other. There are books so powerful that are able to transcend this phenomenon. For example \u201cA Hundred Years of Solitude.\u201dTranscending though doesn\u2019t mean that the book gives the English reader the same as it gives to the Spanish reader, it just means the story was so powerful that the mutilating translation didn\u2019t manage to kill it completely.
