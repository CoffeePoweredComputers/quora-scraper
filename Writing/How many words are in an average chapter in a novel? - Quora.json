            "answer_text": "Each chapter is a mini story in its own right, so to work properly, just like any story, each chapter must have, as a bare minimum, a beginning, a middle, and an end. Or to put it another way every chapter needs a three line plot. This consists of: A premise \u2013 what is the scene about.A complication (one per scene) \u2013 (But) what difficulty do the characters have to overcome and how do they overcome this complication.A trigger \u2013 How overcoming the complication triggers the next complication that needs to be overcome in the next scene.Each chapter may be a single scene which follows a simple story arc, or may comprise of several simpler scenes, each with a beginning. Middle, and end, that together form the story arc. I prefer to use a variation on the classic eight-part story arc. However, unlike the overall Story Arc, most chapters do not end with a Resolution, but with the trigger for the next scene in the flow of the story. This keeps the story moving and the reader turning the pages. The trigger would normally by a consequence of the complication or difficulty tackled in the scene/chapter. If it is the last scene in a chapter, then classically the trigger could be a cliff-hanger to the first scene in the next chapter or the next scene involving that character. Here is a Scene Flow infographic I devised for my website that applies equally well to structuring chapters.  So your issue is not, \u2018how long can I make a chapter\u2019, but whether your chapter makes sense as a story in its own right and within the larger context of the novel. Unless you are really trying to hammer home a point, it is usually best, to manage reader expectations, to keep chapter about the same length. Hope this helps. Nick ",

            "answer_text": "A friend once said to me, \u201cWrite your word count to your story, not your story to your word count.\u201d Some well known authors, like James Patterson, write very short chapters, sometimes only a single page. Others will write theirs four or five thousand words long, though that\u2019s pretty rare. Around two thousand words is fairly normal, but it just depends on your style as a writer. Even if the scene you\u2019re writing is starting to get lengthy, don\u2019t force a break that will feel unnatural. That being said, shorter chapters tend to work better for young adult novels. Younger readers have shorter attention spans and need more frequent opportunities to pop that bookmark back in for a breather. King uses subchapters in many books, oftentimes having several on one page. This makes it easy to put the book down whenever you need to. In the end, write your story. Worry about numbers later. It would be a travesty if someone had convinced Tolkien that his novels needed to be kept to an industry standard length. ",
