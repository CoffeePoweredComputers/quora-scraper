            "answer_text": "Before telling you how can we use keyword in URL let\u2019s understand what is URL and why its good to have keyword in URL. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a webpage address which is is made up of a domain name and/or subdomain name for example: http://www.xyz.com/ (xyz is a domain name) and http://www.abc.xyz.com/ (abc is a subdomain). The other part of a URL i.e. known as permalink is made up of text that specifies a unique page or post. A page\u2019s URL is visible and used in web browsers. URL is most noticed and visible when we share our content on social media and displayed in the search engine results. A well-structured URL having keywords give an idea to user about what content they are going to read. It also looks better when shared on social media, appears more professional on search engine results pages, and improves a page\u2019s ranking abilities. After creating your page, identify the best keyword, which gives an idea about your page, is related to your product or services, has high search popularity and has low competition in search.  Once you are done with content and keyword, include the exact keyword in your permalink portion of URL. You can use keyword research tools to choose best keywords. While most CMS automatically create a URL when a new page or post is created, you can edit the permalink portion of the text to optimize it for search engines and users. ",
