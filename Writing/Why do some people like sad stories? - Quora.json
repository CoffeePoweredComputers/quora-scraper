            "answer_text": "Part of the reason is what psychologists call identification. Most humans have empathy for others, it\u2019s part of our psychological makeup as social creatures. We can imagine how others feel because we know how WE would feel under the same or similar circumstances. That is identification in a nutshell. On an unconscious level it reminds us that deep down inside we\u2019re all the same, that feeling sadness is part of the shared human condition, we can *identify* (sympathize) with others. Logic doesn\u2019t really apply to human emotions, but it certainly is reasonable behavior. From an anthropological viewpoint, this empathy (identification, sympathizing) would bond together members of a tribe, which typically would have around 50 people. Sociological studies show that, even in modern crowded urban and city settings, most people have around 50 others (friends and co-workers) that they associate with on a regular basis\u2014their \u201ctribe\u201d. So, sad stories, movies and songs, reinforce that feeling of \u201cbelonging\u201d that is part of our evolutionary heritage as social animals. ",
