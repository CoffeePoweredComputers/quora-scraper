            "answer_text": "The standard (usually unwritten) rule is you should be plus or minus 10% of the wordcount. Which in this case puts the absolute upper limit to be 1,650. You are 200 words over that. Now, the reason word counts are usually in place is to teach you how to be concise and to make the professor\u2019s life easier. Rule one of any educational assessment is: Absolutely don\u2019t, under any circumstances, do anything that might annoy, piss off or otherwise make the life of the person who is marking it more difficult than it has to be. They set those limits because that is what they are willing to sit and read. If you are breaching that rule you have to be absolutely damned certain that what you are writing is interesting and important enough to make them want to read to the end. Otherwise, you are risking them stopping at word 1,500. Now, before you consider an increased word count, consider the following. - Check for superfluous words. Have you repeated yourself? Used 10 words where 5 would do? Used any unecessary clauses? Note how this very section could easily lose a lot of words because I have repeated myself\u2026 - Check to make sure you are answering the actual question. Many students make the mistake of assuming you need to include a lot of information in an essay that does not add to the argument. Cut out the fat - kill your darlings. If you are writing an essay on the function of mitochondria, you don\u2019t need to start with an explanation of what a cell is or what an organelle is or what other organelles do. The question is \u2018describe the function of mitochondria\u2019 not \u2018write all you know about cell organelles\u2019. Have a clear plan in place that outlines what you need to include to answer the question and stick to it. - Make use of images and appendices. They do not count in your word count so you can put a lot of information in there and refer to it in the text. Most people can easily reduce their work significantly by doing the above. I am fairly confident you could lose 200 words that way. You have to assume that the question can be answered to the standard required by the professor in that limit otherwise they would not have set that limit\u2026. ",

If the professor recommended about 1500 words and you write 350 more than that\u2014you\u2019re writing 20% more words than what was recommended. If your professor is a stickler, they might penalize you for straying too far outside the directions. On the flip side, the professor might not care at all. There is something to be said, however, in being a concise writer and maybe that\u2019s the point of the word limit. ",
