            "answer_text": "Phillips Andover is older, better and\u2026 superior in all ways. Go Big Blue! Ok, some bias is clearly evident. It\u2019s not my fault everyone knows that Andover is the preferred destination and Exeter is the backup if you can\u2019t get into Andover\u2026 (sorry, it\u2019s a myth, but my blue roots made me say it anyway- if someone goes to Exeter, they are Phillipians, and deserve that credit!) They are both prestigious, old secondary boarding and day schools with an excellent and diverse curriculum. There are some curricular differences, mainly due to the high level of expertise amongst staff- staff are individuals who use their expertise to develop their students. Exeter isn\u2019t in the middle of one of the most expensive real estate areas in Massachusetts, so there are some constraints in building they can avoid that Andover is stuck with. It isn\u2019t of the same age as Andover (founded 1778, 3 years earlier than that juvenile upstart Exeter, and in this case, those years matter), Some of their sports facilities are superior. But, the feel of studying in the Oliver Wendall Holmes library, or reading English in a classroom designed by Bulfinch, cannot be surpassed. Nor can leaning against Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s headstone while reading Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Ok, they can be surpassed. By watching Big Blue thump that rotting Red\u2026 sorry, I\u2019ll stop about football. If you went to Andover, or Exeter, you would understand why I go on and on. Inside America's best high school \u2014 a boarding school that costs $53,900 a year and feeds students into the Ivy League (Andover Version) What It's Like To Attend The Best Boarding School In America (Exeter version) Me? True Blue. By the way\u2026 Andover\u2019s football record versus their little brother\u2026 73 /54 /10 Smug, no, not me. ",
