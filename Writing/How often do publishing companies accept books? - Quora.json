            "answer_text": "As often as they publish them. So look at a publisher\u2019s list for a given month, count the new (non-reprint) titles, and that\u2019s how many books they accepted in a month. I don\u2019t have any recent numbers handy but I remember that when I sold my first novel in 1979 Del Rey Books published six titles a month, of which at least two and sometimes as many as four were reprints. Let\u2019s say it averaged out to three per month. That means Del Rey (as of 1979) bought thirty-six books a year, or one every ten days. Meanwhile, they received several hundred submissions a month. The number of submissions has skyrocketed since then \u2014 back then you needed to use a typewriter and street mail, there were no word processors yet (unless you count ROFF, which I don\u2019t), and computer printers were big clumsy things that only printed in dot matrix. My understanding is that every publisher receives thousands of submissions per month now \u2014 but they still only buy enough to fill their publishing schedule. ",

They accept books they feel they can successfully publish, that meet professional standards and generally meet a specific need in the market (or that they believe will create one). Most books are rejected. I would hesitate to try to put a better number on it than that. ",
