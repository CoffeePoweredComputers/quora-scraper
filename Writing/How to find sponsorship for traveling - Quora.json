            "answer_text": "Best way would be following: Plan an international route on bike and target SUV Car, Sports Bike companies to barter with you. Companies instead of providing money gets agreed to pay for your fuel and sometimes even provide the vehicle as wellInstead of asking for sponsorship, why don\u2019t you do freelance work and earn online. You just need to carry your laptop everywhere. Making money online is not tough now a days. You just need to identify your strength",
