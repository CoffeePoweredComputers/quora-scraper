            "answer_text": " 1. Changing Government Systems I want to make the world a better place. There are certain areas in our society that need radical improvements, such as the government systems. For example, isn\u2019t there a better system than democracy? Now we are hundreds of times more people than during the Roman times, we also have the greatest intellect, and we can\u2019t think of better ideas for better government systems? I find that really strange. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying that democracy is a bad thing, but the fact that it is based on ideas so old is a bit troubling. I mean we live in the 21th century and we cannot find better solutions than democracy? Can\u2019t we find better ways to fight corruption? You can double check everything and make it corruption-free, you can establish an internet-based system where people go and vote on a daily basis and so on. That is a worthy goal in my opinion: how can we develop better government systems, without corruption and with more educated people and more educated decisions from both sides?   1. Changing The Educational Systems I also want to change the educational system. I think we shouldn\u2019t expect brilliant people like Einstein to arise randomly. We should do something in order to help that happen. Personally, I find what I\u2019m doing at the moment extremely successful at developing my intelligence. That is why I want to have an educational system were children can learn how to become confident and more aware about the type of person they want to be. People are not aware of that yet, that they can choose a different direction in life. I\u2019ve talked to a girl today in a product manufacturing company and she firmly believed that she couldn\u2019t achieve what she really wanted. Because she had not been told that she could become the C.E.O. of the company, she didn\u2019t think that there were possibilities to change her life, without having to work so hard for making a living. It is like we have these Internet firewalls that keep us captive in a fixed mindset, which doesn\u2019t allow us to evolve properly out of the fear of the unknown. \u201cMy father was a doctor, therefore I\u2019m going to be a doctor too, not because I like it, but because it runs in the family.\u201d Something like that.    3. Bulding a Community I want to build a community around me of the most interesting people. The idea of people with common interests and principles can lead only to progress. We should all become a community, not a simple society. A community implies more cohesion and a stronger mutual acceptance. Speaking of that,   4. Uniting The Humankind sounds good. Another worthy goal would be to combine all the nations into one country. Deny the human race for a greater humankind. We are called humankind, but we aren\u2019t really kind in that way, and I find that disturbing, because we fight between each other and we have wars. Perhaps we could avoid that if the world was one country run by the people, democracy wise. If we solve one issue after another, I think all these are achievable.  Changing governments and education, uniting the world. How can we do that? ",

            "answer_text": "Having a goal is important, but not essential. Those of have no goals, (in french we say : Ne pas avoir de but, but in the youger people, to not have a goal means saying stupid things). I know you will say there's no point relating to the question. But having a goal is intelligent. There's my point. Why at first set a goal? To accomplish worthy things? That's an egoist point of view, you just want to sceal your invitation letter to heaven, but you do it for yourself. For me, a worthy goal, is a goal wich helps community, children, or at least something that will make more than just you happy. A worthy goal might be pride. And yet if it's egoist pride it's not the same. I started thinking about success and having goals when I got 22 or so. I had deviance (I watched too much and too deep porno) and drugs habits (smoke weed everyday as said Snoop the doggy dog). As I grew up, I started to meet younger and younger people on the net. (Think about it, I started surfing at 12, so growing up made me get along with youngers). So this beeing. I realised the youth was having more problems than I had. And I started to cry, cause I am an altruist, I don't want the youth to live the shit I lived. I don't want the teenagers to suicide, to take drugs and to wish to become soldier or lose faith at all. I met many teenagers since my 22. But I always kept falling in love with those 13 15 17 yo guys. This is very personal, but I had to seek out help. My psychologist confirmed a borderline diagnosis and helped me out. He asked me if my goal was to have sex with those teenagers. I said no. I said, no... I want them to be happy, I love them, I don't want them to part off me. He made me realised I fell in love with them as a father and not as a boyfriend... This gave me hope. And so, I estimated myself not beeing a pedophile or a teenophile anymore (I started watching porn young, and I was used to teen porn since my 16). I can't say I completely quit. But my worthy goal is to protect every fuck**** child and teen I meet or met. I know about drug deals, some mafiosos are very dangerous and will prostitute the teenagers profiting of them. I wish I wouldn't check porno. But this is less important than to keep away the children I meet off the porno, off drugs... I try not to fall in love, but when I do, I tell them look I love you and will help you out. I'm never into cam porn, filming or anything, don't worry. I only teach them that life is hard, that they must study, keep off porn and drugs. I stopped smoking weed 4 years ago. Had some rechutes, but I succeeded and I was hospitalized last year in psychiatry because I was going crazy suspecting my neighbors to be pedophiles and to acquire teen sex. The police officers didn't believe me and kept saying i hear voices. So I was interned 9 months, and this kept me raging. I needed to protect the children. My worthy goal, as you may find out, was to fight pedophilia. But as I'm not a police officer, I had no powers. I was kicked out of my appartment and as such failed in my opinion. But the goal was worthy. My protection of teenagers on the net is still worthy.Teen porn sites are many, you may not know but there are so many porno videos that sometimes I find one where the guy looks like my wolf as shit.But when I ask my virtual son (cause some accept me as a vitual father), he says, stop making portraits, you draw very bad. But they are proud of me. Some of them know I love teen porn, but I swear they are proud of me. Cause I don't ask them nothing, when they need credits for a game and their parents won't pay shit... Who gets the credit card out of his wallet? It's me, but never have I asked anything. I'm not rich, and sometimes I lack food in the end of the month. But i am fucking proud man. Cause my little brothers or virtual sons play endlessly, on the net. They don't check porn (I guess), they don't smoke weed. They study. My wolf wants to become a soldier. I teach coding to his cousin, and Alexou loves when we play minecraft on the server I rent just for us two. These stories are great love stories. A worthy goal, can be to help the youth to live better lives. It's easy to do. And this is called sacrifice. But if you ask them, is he a good guy?They'll say yes. Adrien cries sometimes. Cause he's ashamed of asking me so many games. I always say : don't worry. Don't cry, man. Cheer up, And what does he say? I love you dad. I don't have a wife and don't have children at home. My children are 8 thousands kilometers away, they don't even live on my continent.I don't give a fuck, we're proud of eachother. Do you know how many years I've cried? Not beeing able to touch them? Take them in my arms? I cried many years. No wonder why I'm proud of not having committed suicide, the children want me alive. And they want me happy. And yes, sometimes parents say, Who the fuck are you? But those are like me. They're over protective XD. So that is one worthy goal. You can't say it's fake.    ",
