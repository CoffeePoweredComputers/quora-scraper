            "answer_text": "As I was taught, a memo or memorandum is a written report principally for use within an organization. This could be compared with a report, which might be used to communicate outside the organization. Email is just a medium, so it can be used for multiple purposes, from making a decision with colleagues to chatting with friends around the world. Many email messages are memoranda or memos, but not all. ",
