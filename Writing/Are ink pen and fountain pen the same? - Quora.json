            "answer_text": "Well, most people would agree that if it\u2019s a writing instrument that uses ink, it\u2019s a pen. Otherwise, it\u2019s a pencil, a piece of chalk, or something else. That covers a lot of different types of pens including ball point pens, roller balls, gel pens, felt tip pens, technical pens, and of course, fountain pens, among others. Under ordinary circumstances, the word \u201cink\u201d is redundant, unless you trying to distinguish the writing instrument from the thing that pigs live in. I would submit that there are other ways to communicate that particular distinction. So, if there is a fountain pen and a pencil laying there, and you say, \u201chand me the pen\u201d, you will likely get the fountain pen. On the other hand, if there are two pens, a ball point pen, and a fountain pen laying there, and you say \u201chand me the pen\u201d, the person might ask \u201cwhich one?\u201d, and if you replied \u201cthe ink pen\u201d, they would probably understand that you meant the fountain pen, even though the ball point pen also uses ink, since the fact that it uses real ink is a defining characteristic of a fountain pen. So, yes and no, but mostly no. A fountain pen is a type of ink pen. ",

            "answer_text": "My dear \u2026 They may be the same while it is about the writing but when it comes with regard to flow of ink standard the ink pen fails at many times because due to air or vacuum that is created during the flow of ink\u2026 So in this regard though there may be some similarity in both but they differ according to the flow and the weight of the ink they put on the paper\u2026 ",
