            "answer_text": "If you plan to be a hack, and write to what is trending in an attempt to make money, and have no other reason for writing, then you can keep an eye on the movement of books in some of the larger newspapers. Most large papers have a section that will show the top 10 selling books. When you look at these and notice movement up towards the number 1 position, then if you can knock off a similar book in a couple of weeks and attempt to compete with the titles already selling. If you wish to write and write something of value, without any preconceived desire for money, then the ideas that come to you will be ideas of subjects that mean something to you, or topics which spark you into wishing to teach what you know, or just commenting, in book form, your individual point of view. If you have an idea that gels into a book you can write within a couple of weeks then I would say it appears that you had a pretty good idea. Now the chore is getting people to read it. ",

A writer tries seventeen ideas, and one emerges as being fertile. The writer writes, then revises, then shows it to writer friends. Maybe it succeeds. Either way, there\u2019s always another project.
