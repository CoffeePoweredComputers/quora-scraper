            "answer_text": "Responses are necessary in the human civilized community, be it of a formal or informal nature. Giving an acknowledgement of any mail sent to you is the form of this very response, which gives an assurance to the sender that you have received the mail. In a formal context therefore, the way you word your acknowledgement becomes a matter to be taken care of. However, it leaves a good impression on the sender if you say something extra too.  Here are a few steps that may lead you to give a proper acknowledgement: Send the acknowledgment as soon as possible. A timely response is crucial in the business world, even if the information in the email isn't time-sensitive.Edit the email's subject line, if necessary. For example, you might need to indicate that you have attached a document to the message, or that updated information is included in your reply. If you don't need to edit the subject line, the \"Re:\" field will automatically be filled in, notifying the recipient what email you are responding to.Write a complete sentence indicating that you got the message, as well as when you will be taking any action in regards to it. It's more professional to state, \"Hello Steve, I received the email this morning. I'll follow up with you later in the afternoon\" -- which lets the sender know that you will prioritize getting back to him -- than just writing, \"Got it. Thanks.\"Update the recipient on any relevant developments. You can accomplish two tasks at once here: acknowledge the original email and keep the recipient in the loop regarding pertinent information. There's no sense sending a second email that says, \"By the way, the meeting related to the contracts you sent me has been moved back to 4 p.m.,\" when you are already having an email conversation regarding that topic.
