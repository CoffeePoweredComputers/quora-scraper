            "answer_text": "You can't get Sponsors for blogging. But. . . .  Lots of bloggers get Sponsors. But it's not the blog the sponsors care about. It's the audience.  When you can grow your audience and get them engaging, Sponsors will want to be part of that experience.  So your first job should be your message. You really want to create an audience of like-minded people because when you're amongst your kind you're more likely to comment and engage. Plus your blog posts will resonate with a much higher percentage of the crowd.  Your second job is to create community and engagement. Not only should the audience be there, but ultimately you're of no use to a Sponsor if you're not influential. So get them talking, questioning, trying, buying, sharing.  Your third job is to track, measure and understand the community so you can codify who you speak to and share that with potential companies.  Your final job is to know in your heart that you can be of service to those who want to Sponsor you. Don't take the money just because. Work with companies who you can help. Because if you can't help them. . . what are they paying you for? We've got a great call in our Blogging Concentrated community on developing media kits, sponsor decks and one sheets. Would love to have you on board. ",
