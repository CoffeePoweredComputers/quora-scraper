            "answer_text": "Advantages: The most versatile script in India. See below (Source: Wikipedia) for the number of languages that can be written in this script. It is fully phonetic (like the IPA). Unlike English and French, if you read a word written in this script you cannot possibly mispronounce it. You might get only the accent wrong.  Though Gujarati is mentioned in the list above, it is written in a slightly modified form of the Devanagari script. The consonants are rounded off at the corners and the short horizontal line at the top is omitted in Gujarati. Only the vowels are different. More than 600 million people all over the Indian subcontinent use this script and many of those who use Dravidian scripts can read Devanagari too. It is the most ubiquitous script in India. Disadvantages: For decades, typing was a hassle for most of us. The keyboard is complex and requires special training. Unlike English and the European languages, experts were needed to type in this language. This made Devanagari a late adapter in today\u2019s computer and smart phone era and it lagged behind English. For years Indians typing / messaging in Indian regional languages used the imperfect Roman script to send out messages in local languages. Even now many do it but many have now reverted to the better and more accurate Devanagari script. However with phonetic transliteration, Devanagari has now caught up. We now type the 26 Roman characters available on any QWERTY keyboard and it takes just a few minutes of training and a week\u2019s practice to be able to type facilely in Devanagari using Qwerty keyboard. The software does the conversion in the background. Software like GBoard when used with Voice dictation makes typing in Devanagari a breeze. You talk. Gboard types it almost flawlessly. Unlike in English where GBoard hears \u2018By\u2019 and does not know if it\u2019s By, or buy, or bye and when it hears \u2018to\u2019 Gboard does not know if that is \u201cto\u201d, or \u201ctoo\u201d or \u201ctwo\u201d or \u201c2\u201d, Hindi / Devanagari voice typing is straightforward and the output by GBoard requires very little editing. I use it extensively on my smartphone to type out my Quora answers in Hindi using Devanagari. Tailpiece: Added for fun. Using Gboard, I had dictated \u201c I am meeting \u2026.\u201d Gboard typed \u201cI am eating\u2026.\u201d This does not happen in Devanagari! \u2014 Edited to add: I am thankful to Mahesh Gujjar who told me about this site for speech to text conversion in a variety of languages. I tried it in English and Hindi and it worked perfectly for me. Speech to Text Online Notepad. Free \u2014 ",

            "answer_text": "Advantages Quasi-phoneticity in usage: All languages incorporating Devanagari as their script use it phonetically although there are some variations that essentially prevent it from being completely phonetic across all its languages. The almost phoneticity helps tremendously in speech-to-text transliterations, preventing ambiguity as long as the speaker\u2019s own pronunciation and accent is correct. To incorporate variations, some speech-to-text transliterators allow users to choose language first. [ The common variations in pronunciations are as follows: \u0910 and \u0914 can be spoken in 2 variations \u2014 \u0905\u090f (a\u0113) and \u0905\u0913 (a\u014d) i.e. as their constituent vowels, or as a slightly longer form of \u2018a\u2019 in \u2018max\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 in \u2018often\u2019. Both would be considered correct in modern usage.\u090b (r\u0325) is spoken as \u2018ri\u2019 in Hindi while as \u2018ru\u2019 in Marathi and Konkani\u091c\u094d\u091e (j\u00f1a) is spoken as \u2018gya\u2019 in Hindi and \u2018dnya\u2019 in Marathi.] Usage in multiple languages: Devanagari is used as primary or one of the scripts in multiple languages across northern India, western India and Nepal. This implies a large set of languages can be read (although not necessarily) understood by a person who can read Devanagari. The languages include Sanskr\u0325ta (historically, primary script was Brahmi), Hindi (also written in Arabic script), Nepali, Apabhramsha, Konkani, Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Maithili, Braj Bhasha, Sindhi, Haryanvi, Newar, Kashmiri, Magadhi/Magahi, Sadri etc. Devanagari is also related to Nandinagari script used in southern India, and therefore, a person who can read Devanagari may also be able to read Nandinagari. Devanagari letters in Chandas font (Source: File:Chandas typeface specimen.svg - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chandas_typeface_specimen.svg))  Chart of Nandinagari (Source: File:Nandinagari script.png - Wikipedia)  Chart showing similarities in Indic scripts (Source: File:Examples.of.complex.text.rendering.svg - Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Examples.of.complex.text.rendering.svg))   Disadvantages Need of relatively larger symbol set: Since almost all languages using Devanagari use it phonetically, it requires a larger symbol set to accommodate them. Devanagari keyboards need to accommodate following symbols: The 13 vowels and 31 consonants found in Sanskr\u0325t. These are usually common across languages that use Devanagari.\u0972 and \u0911 found in Konkani and Marathi, as well as \u090d, \u090e and \u0912\u0933 found in Odiya and some other languages\u0961 \u2014 essentially a graphic convention included among the vowels in order to maintain the symmetry of short\u2013long pairs of letters (with \u090c).Diacritic marks found in Vedic languageVarious m\u0101tr\u0101s i.e. vowel notations over consonantsNotations for half-consonants, including 3 for R (\u0930) \u2014 curved upward slash (eg. \u0930\u094d\u0935 rva, \u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e rv\u0101), single downward slash (eg. \u0915\u094d\u0930 \u0917\u094d\u0930 \u092d\u094d\u0930 \u092c\u094d\u0930) and double downward slash (eg. \u091f\u094d\u0930 \u1e6dra \u0920\u094d\u0930 \u1e6dhra \u0921\u094d\u0930 \u1e0dra \u0922\u094d\u0930 \u1e0dhra)\u2014 when it is combined with a consonant.Compound consonants that differ markedly from constituent consonant symbols \u2014 \u0915\u094d\u0937 (\u0915\u094d + \u0937), \u091c\u094d\u091e (\u091c\u094d + \u091e) and \u0924\u094d\u0930 (\u0924\u094d + \u0930\u200b)\u200bThe symbol halant (\u094d) that marks a consonant without any vowel notation (since every consonant inherently has a vowel in Devanagari)The symbol visarga (\u0903) that represents a slight \u2018h\u2019 sound at the end of the letter is written of.The nasal symbols anun\u0101sika (\u0901) and anusv\u0101ra (\u0902)The symbol avagraha (\u093d)The stop symbols \u2014 \u0964 (existent in almost Devanagari using languages) and \u0965 (existent only in Sanskr\u0325ta)The subscript dot (\u093c) called Nuqta, that changes the pronunciation of a consonantThe subscript bar ( \u0952) to accommodate implosives found in Sindhi and Saraiki.Additionally, a Devanagari keyboard may accommodate the symbol Om (\u0950) and the symbols for numbers.Speech to text transliterations: Since most languages incorporating Devanagari as their script use it phonetically, text to speech transliterations are relatively easier, but there are a few peculiar challenges, even if incorrect accents and mispronunciations are not taken into account. Diphthongs present a challenge \u2014 In Sanskr\u0325ta, diphthongs are merely single character vowels (\u090f \u0910 \u0913 \u0914) but Hindi and few other languages allow consecutive vowels without need to conjoin them eg. \u0906\u0907\u090f (come), something not allowed in Sanskr\u0325ta.\u0910 and \u0914 can be spoken in 2 variations \u2014 \u0905\u090f (a\u0113) and \u0905\u0913 (a\u014d) i.e. as their constituent vowels, or as a slightly longer form of \u2018a\u2019 in \u2018max\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019 in \u2018often\u2019. Both would be considered correct in modern usage. (Stated previously) Now, how to transliterate from speech to text?Avagraha (\u093d) \u2014 This symbols presents challenge specific to language. In Sanskr\u0325ta, it is used for prodelision, and should be represented in Latin as apostrophe between letters of a word eg \u0936\u093f\u0935\u094b\u093d\u0939\u092e\u094d \u2192 \u015aivo\u2019ham. In Hindi, the usage is for prolonging of vowels eg. \u092e\u093e\u0901\u093d\u093d\u093d! \u2192 \u2018M\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3\u00e3!",
