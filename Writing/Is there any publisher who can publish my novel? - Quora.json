            "answer_text": "This is for traditional publishing only. You find a publisher who is publishing books similar to yours. Then you go to their website, and you find the Submissions Guidelines. You follow them to the letter. This is your first test. If you cannot be arsed to follow a simple set of guidelines, why would they ever bother trying to work with you? Let me explain the process here. See this? This is an actual slush pile (where unsolicited manuscripts go)  Generally someone like a secretary goes through them and rejects certain things automatically. (Believe me, I am not making this up) Things like manuscripts with illustrations, manuscripts handwritten, written in crayon, written on a yellow legal pad, written on one long continuous scroll, or basically manuscripts that don\u2019t conform to the formatting. Also, the initial sorter rejects anything that is based on someone else\u2019s property, like, for instance, a Game of Thrones book by someone other than GRRM, or a Star Wars novel. Then they sit there until the First Reader gets to them. There may be more than one First Reader. They are generally someone the editor trusts, who shares the editors taste. The First Reader reads the synopsis and the first page. That weeds out a lot. Then he reads the first chapter. That weeds out more. Then he reads the first three chapters and the last chapter. If the manuscript passes all that, he takes it home and reads the whole thing. If it still passes muster it goes to an assistant editor where it goes through the whole process, and finally to the editor. The longer your book takes in this process, the higher up the chain it got. However, editors are crazy busy. The fact that you got a personalized rejection letter is something; usually it\u2019s a form-letter. But because the editor had very little time, he was only able to dash off a note. Always remember this mantra: Publishers are not in the business to publish books; like any other business, they are in this business to make money. Thirty or forty years ago, editors could publish niche books they really believed in, knowing that the others would make up for the losses on the oddball books. Not any more. Publishing companies are now owned by media conglomerates, and editors are under incredible pressure to make every book pay off. You have two options here if you get a rejection letter. You can rewrite your book, or you can try somewhere else. If you keep getting the same reaction, then your only option is going to be a rewrite or self-publishing. But I can absolutely guarantee you that if your writing is any good it will always take about a year for you to get an answer. And never, ever say \u201cI\u2019ll never submit to X again!\u201d That\u2019s just cutting off your own foot. Admit gracefully that you didn\u2019t write a book that fit what they were looking for at the time and move on. They didn\u2019t insult your firstborn child. The book just wasn\u2019t what they were looking for and they had the courtesy to give you a short answer why. Try sending it somewhere else. Remember: when it comes to sending an unsolicited manuscript, so far as the publisher is concerned, this is not you\u2014  THIS is you\u2014-  And there is an entire room full of people like you just waiting for their manuscripts to be read.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been a full-time author nearly all my whole adult life (which is a fairly unusual thing). Of all the advice I\u2019ve heard about the business of writing, one comment sticks in my mind: \u201cThe good Lord didn\u2019t intend anyone to make a living this way.\u201d Calvin Trillin said that. His point is that every writer has to invent a career for him or herself. No one\u2019s going to do it for you. That means there aren\u2019t many hard-and-fast rules to being an author. But one generalization ends up being true for most people: You need an agent to land a book contract with a big, commercial publisher. Why? It guess the answer is, that\u2019s just the way the book publishing business works. It\u2019s a division of labor thing. Today\u2019s editors don\u2019t have time for vetting completely unknown authors, proposals, and manuscripts. Agents do. That\u2019s how they earn their commissions. How do you find an agent? Pretty much the way you find anything else. Google \u201cliterary agents\u201d (and turn on your Internet-scam radar). Avoid anyone who wants to charge you a fee for reading a manuscript. Legitimate agents earn their money from commissions and get paid when you do. A good resource is Literary Marketplace. A one-week subscription (which is all you\u2019ll probably need) is $24.95. You may be able to avoid that at a public library. Once you\u2019re logged in, Literary Marketplace has a comprehensive listing of agents. Most agents specialize to some degree. Take down contact information for those representing authors in your field. It\u2019s then up to you to pitch yourself and your project to an agent. The pitch will initially be an e-mail with suitable attachments (r\u00e9sum\u00e9, proposal, etc.) If you were in an impressive writer\u2019s program at college, mention it. If you\u2019ve got a huge number of followers on social media, mention it. But mainly you need to talk up your book in the most compelling way possible. An agent doesn\u2019t expect perfection, but make it as polished as you can. And if the first agent isn\u2019t interested, try another. Repeat as needed. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step, and by far the hardest one, is to make sure that your novel is something a reputable publisher believes they can sell to readers. Seriously, that\u2019s by far the hardest part. You have no idea how many people think they\u2019ve done it, and are completely, utterly wrong. You cannot possibly assess your own work realistically; it\u2019s just not human nature. To some extent you\u2019ll always see what you meant it to be, rather than what\u2019s actually there for a reader who knows nothing about you. But once you have your novel ready, you settle on the best publisher who handles that sort of novel \u2014 don\u2019t bother trying to sell a horror novel to a romance publisher, or hard science fiction to a mystery imprint. If you don\u2019t know who the best publisher in your genre is, go to a library or bookstore (not Amazon, for complicated reasons) and look at who published the best books in that field, the ones most similar to your own. Go to the publisher\u2019s website and look for \u201cSubmission Guidelines\u201d or \u201cFor Authors\u201d or something similar, and you will find instructions on how to submit your novel for consideration \u2014 either that, or you\u2019ll find something like, \u201cWe do not consider unagented works.\u201d If you find guidelines, follow them exactly. Do not deviate in any way. Do not think you can stand out by doing something different. This is a test; if you can\u2019t follow the rules, then it\u2019s not worth their time and trouble to work with you. There are literally millions of other writers out there. Using a non-standard font or inserting a hidden message on page 50 to see if they actually read it or anything else \u201cclever\u201d will get you on the blacklist as a troublemaker; it will not help in any way. Believe me on this. If they don\u2019t take unagented submissions, then find an agent. Start your search at the Association of Authors' Representatives website. Again, don\u2019t try to be clever. Publishers and agents don\u2019t want clever except in plots, and not always there. Be prepared to wait six months for a response. After six months, if you haven\u2019t heard anything, it\u2019s acceptable to make a polite inquiry. If this all seems to be horribly unfair and weighted against beginning authors, it is, because there really truly are literally millions of you and there is no reason for a publisher to waste time and effort trying to treat you all fairly and kindly. Publishers and editors are not in business to be nice to beginning writers; they\u2019re in business to make money by selling books. If you follow all the rules and get your novel onto an editor\u2019s desk, she will start reading it and will give it a fair shot \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean reading the entire thing, or telling you what you did wrong, or trying to help you fix it. If she\u2019s bored or annoyed after three pages, she doesn\u2019t need to read the whole novel; there are hundreds more in the queue, after all, and a would-be buyer in the bookstore wouldn\u2019t read further than that. She\u2019ll just give it a form rejection. So \u2014 how do you get your novel published by a reputable publisher? Make it good enough and commercial enough that the editor will buy it. Rejecting everything else is how that publisher became reputable. ",

            "answer_text": "First, before you do the last draft of your manuscript, read the bestselling of the books that your book will compete against. Analyze what they do well, even if they\u2019re badly written, that leads your target readers to prefer these books to others of the same type. Then re-read your own work, with an eye to that \u201cpayload\u201d and how to increase how much of it you deliver. Re-write your work to do just that. While you are doing this, define your target reader. Obviously, those who attempt to market to too many different types of reader end up selling far fewer copies than those who stay focused. Then figure out where those folks can be found (and remember it might not be directly connected to your type of book). And look in those places and others to find out how the bestsellers are marketed. Book marketing is rarely easily identified as marketing by the uninitiated. It may not even mention the book. But it does involve the author saying things that will interest the target readers, and leaving a trail that leads to the book (in bylines, bios, and profiles). When you have done all that, develop your own marketing plan (usually with the help of a handful of books on book marketing or book publicity). THEN you research how to query and submit to the publishers in your market segment. And last, look at the front and back matter of your successful competitive books, and query those agents and editors who are thanked in those books. Maybe you even mention that you\u2019re querying them because they did such a good job on XYZ book. Good luck. ",

Publishers only deal with authors who have been brought to them by agents. Period. (With VERY few exceptions.)

Submit your manuscript according to those guidelines and hope (pray) for the best. Good luck! ",

It's a business and for the most part, they do not like taking risks.  If you write in a genre that is very popular, and they like your novel, then you will probably be signed up. This is not as easy as it might seem, but if you don't secure the interest of a traditional publisher, stay very far away from some of the small 'wannabe' publishers. A very simple test you can apply to a publishing company or individual is to check how much they are asking you to pay them in the contract. If you are asked to fund your own publishing, run away and keep running! You are better served self-publishing.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the question, let us begin with the language. English? Hindi? Spanish? that will help you narrow down your list of publishers. Next, the geography. Are you primarily targeting India? Or are you looking at the international market? For India, print might be the way to go, because the ebook market is still at a nascent stage. Next, let us understand what your novel is about, i.e what genre it falls into. Have you prepared a shortlist of the publishers who typically publish books in that genre? For example, a publisher of academic textbooks may not accept your proposal for a Science Fiction book. Fourth, at what stage is your novel? Is the manuscript ready, or it is a work in progress draft? I had sent the three sample chapters with my proposal to many Indian publishers even before I had finished writing the novel. Would I ever do ti again? Probably not, but the logic was that they take about 3 months to respond, enough time for me to finish the manuscript. Which brings us to the next point: what is the timeline you are looking at to release the novel? Does it mark a special occasion? Are you planning to tie it with an event? On the MyKitaab Podcast, one of the guests wanted to release their book around the same time a major Bollywood film was going to get released. Finally, let us look at What is your \"why\", that is why did you want to get your book published? Is it for improving your brand/ visibility? How about stepping into a full time writing career? Do you believe that you have a story to tell to others? There is a publisher who will be able to provide you with solutions for the above major reasons (and there could be many more). Some would be traditional publishers, others could support with self publishing, some Vanity publishers (stay away from them!) Choice at the end of the day is yours. Of course, you can also go through literary agents. ",

            "answer_text": "Finding a publisher takes research, lots of outreach, and patience. Some publishers will only deal directly with agents. And others are inundated with submissions and only except a few new books a year. There are a ton of books out there on how to plan a strategy to get noticed by traditional publishers. However\u2026 Due to a long list of reasons, traditional publishers are not able to publish all of the great work out there. And so, for the vast majority of writers, obtaining an agent, and then actually getting a traditional publishing deal has a very slim margin of success. For those folks, self-publishing or hybrid publishing are the only choices. It\u2019s not easy to self publish, but if you\u2019re driven, you will see your book on sale globally. And then you need to let readers know your book is available thru marketing. PublishDrive is one of the top ebook distribution platforms in self-publishing. They offer authors access to thousands of digital libraries and 400+ online stores including all the majors: Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Google Books, Apple Books, Kobo, and many, more. They have a built-in marketing suite with free and paid options including Amazon advertising. They offer free online tools, details financial and sales reports, and a group of great people - book nerds every one - behind the scenes making sure that all goes well with your ebook. Pay a fee only if you sell books: pay PublishDrive 10% of your ebook\u2019s cover price for distribution and pay a standard percentage to the stores (varies by store) you choose to distribute to on the PD platform. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "It kind of depends on if you want to try and get with a big publisher or a smaller publisher. The only reason I would recommend a smaller publisher is if they have a good marketing plan. Marketing is key. Any publishing company can publish your book, but if they aren\u2019t willing to help you with marketing, then I\u2019d suggest you save your pennies and do it yourself (self-publish). Self-publishing isn\u2019t really doing it yourself - you\u2019d hire an editor, someone to do the cover design\u2026 but you\u2019re the manager of the publishing and you get all the royalty at the end of the process. If you want a traditional publisher, then you need to find an agent. The best place to find an agent is the Writer\u2019s Market book. You can find it in your local library. It\u2019s a large book and put out almost every year. Another way to find an agent (a bit faster way) is to go to writer\u2019s conferences that have agents that are taking book pitches.

And even if you've got good answers for all of them, it's by no means a guarantee that you're going to get it accepted. You will no doubt discover there are several publishers who are willing to accept it if you pay them - be very, very cautious with these.  There are a lot of predatory houses out there that will attempt to take advantage of people who don't have a lot of experience with how the industry generally works.  Be extra cautious if they come to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi there, Disclaimer First: I am one of the founders @ Notion Press Publishing. If you have already written your book, you have a few options. 1. You could approach any top traditional publisher like Penguin, Harper Collins,, Hachette etc. and submit your manuscript for a review. however, traditional publishers get bombarded with hundreds of manuscripts and take a long time to even go through them ( if at all they do ). More often than not, they also reject first time authors due to a perceived risk of publishing an unknown name. 2. You could subsequently approach a self-publishing platform similar to Notion Press and work with a team of book experts who will take care of the entire publishing process and bring your book out to the market. In this guided publishing model, you will own 100% of the rights to the book and take home 100% of the profits from book sales. To know more about how this works you can check out the website link given above. 3. Your third option would be to publish it by yourself by using platforms like KDP or Createspace. This would essentially require you to take care of every aspect of publishing ie. cover design, interior formatting, editing etc by yourself. Such platforms are mostly free to use and take a commission from each book sale and pay out a percentage of the profits in terms of royalty. ",

If you can find a good agent (and there\u2019s a website called Tracker, that actually lists agents and what kind of books they are looking for) you are on the right path. But frankly, I think it\u2019s tougher, much much tougher for first time writer\u2019s with a novel than writer\u2019s of non fiction books to get published. Go that route and be prepared for rejections. Be persistent and work up a good short pitch for your novel. Good luck on what could be a long and winding road. I have been writing for half a century\u2014but my books are non fiction. Yet I know even with a lifetime of writing behind me, producing a novel makes the road tougher and rougher! Off you go, and good luck.\u2014ivor davis ",

You need to first find out what you want from your publisher and also the kind of publishing that you may wish to employ. For instance, if you want to publish traditionally, or via partnered publishing, or via indie publishing. Explore each and every choice carefully before making a choice. As and when you choose one publisher and the method of publishing, ensure that you research enough about their background. Talk to some authors who published with them, and study their ways of marketing. Make an informed choice. ",
