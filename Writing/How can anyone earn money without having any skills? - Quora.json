            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t easy to make good money with no skills. Because skills are so broad. That includes anything from business schools (marketing, sales, strategy) to money-management skills (budgeting and investing) through to 1,001 other things including technical skills like engineering. In reality, most people have skills. Some are highly-skilled. Some low-skilled. Some in the middle. However, I will make one point. A middle-skilled person, can beat a highly skilled person in some situations. The reason is simple; the market doesn\u2019t give a damn about fairness. Look at it like this. A doctor is one of the most highly skilled jobs;  Some are paid very well. Especially the experienced ones. In many countries though, doctors aren\u2019t paid well. Even in rich countries, most doctors aren\u2019t paid well until 40+. Junior doctors aren\u2019t paid well. Nurses much worse. Many sales and marketing people earn more, many small business owners producing what many would see as crap products, are earning more. Is that fair? Probably not, but the market doesn\u2019t care about how high a skill is worth. Just 30\u201350 years ago footballers were not paid much money. Now the very top ones (top 1\u20133) can make up to $100M+ a year. Again the market cares about supply and demand, not fairness. So if you can create a service that is considered useful, even if it isn\u2019t highly skilled, you can do well. Just look at people like `InstaGram influencers`. They can make loads and produce nothing of value for most people.

            "answer_text": "A few ways actually SeniorityBasically work at a place long enough that you get promoted or advance based off your tenure with the company. This happens through call centres, many retail (grocery and otherwise) have systems like this in place. This will get you paid and also into a management position which is nice for the ego and the pay. Hours workedSo your take home is your hourly rate x your hours worked. So to make more you need to increase one or the other. Work your normally day job and take on as much overtime as you can if that gets you into a better pay situation or can help you advance or any extra benefits that can come from this. Alternatively to that work a second job. I worked 2 jobs for about 9 years so its very possible, diversifies your income for safety and if you work in a bar/club etc, then you actually save more cause you can\u2019t go out those nights and spend money. Talent definedThis is quite an odd question as your basically saying \u201cI am not good at anything, what can I do?\u201d Well you can get good at something. No body is entirely useless at everything. Numbers can baffle some people but they are good with there hands. Some people are bad with there hands but like using and working with computers. Find an area of interest and see what careers can be built around this interest. Cheer up! :) Do the jobs no body wants to doCleaning, etc isn\u2019t a job anyone aspires to or is delighted to do. You can however work as a cleaner and clean a space spotless and take pride in this success. You can then use this work completed successfully to get recommendations for other places, etc. and try to build a company in an area people don\u2019t want to be. OpportunityEveryone at some point has opportunity present itself. Prepare yourself as best you can for it by being as educated as you can, having a savings fund to help you capture these chances. Its all good, relax. Hourly rate x hours worked = Money \u2026 So maximise both as much as you can. Don\u2019t move job too often and make sure you break your balls. ",

            "answer_text": " Thanks for your question. I don\u2019t know you, but I can assure you have some kind of talent, you might just don\u2019t realize it. Actually, there is a lot of people without talent making money. If you ask me, I am in the Internet/affiliate marketing niche and there is way more talented people than me\u2026 I am not the most talented but I am persistant. Tell me, are you persistant? stubborn (in a good way)? Those things will become a necessity when trying any type of venture. If you just stick to it (it might sound cliche) and refuse to quit you will make it. It might not always be so easy, but that is the truth. Of course, having someone who can help you and guide could of course help you accelerate the process. That being said, there is plenty of ways you could make money. The question might be, how? would you like to start an online business? offline? A combination of both? If you don\u2019t currently have a talent, could you learn a skill? For example, it could be Graphic design and then you could offer your services on Freelancer - Hire & Find Jobs or Upwork, the world's largest online workplace. Here is a pic of freelancer:  And here is a pic of how the Upwork site looks like:  If you are interested in doing microjobs you could take a test at WorkMarket, an ADP Company: #1 Freelance Management System and become a transcriptionst. From my personal experience you might be able to earn around $4 - $7 dollars per hour. The site looks like this:  Another site could be http://transcribme.com  Other type of ventures could be to start an online business either as a product creator of affiliate for a digital/physical product(s). Here is a post I made related to affiliate marketing: Robin A. Palmer's answer to How do I make money online?

As a data entry operator, you might be expected to do a number of tasks which might include typing a set of data into a spreadsheet, transcribing pdf or image files into Microsoft Word. The scope of work for data operators are endless.you will find better opportunities that can pay anywhere from $10 and more. 2.Fill Up Online Surveys Businesses, researchers, and government agencies use surveys to understand their customers and constituents better. This often requires acquiring real-time survey results very fast. That\u2019s where survey sites come in.You can register yourself as a survey taker and earn anywhere from$1-$3 per form from these websites.Survey Sites Include Swagbucks,Google Opinion Rewards,etc. 3.Work as a Customer Service Assistant As E-commerce grows at an unprecedented rate, especially during this lockdown, buyers are eager to learn more about the businesses they deal with before making a purchase. This means that there is more room for customer query managers who can answer questions timely and generate sales with excellent customer service. 4.Copy Trading The idea behind copy trading is simple. Instead of picking your own stocks and assets to place your investments in, use social trader tools to find expert traders whose trade you can copy. So if an expert you chose allocates 1% of his investment in an Apple stock, you\u2019d also have 1% of your investment directed towards the same stock. 5.Test websites Web designers design websites for general people like you and me and want to ensure that everyone is comfortable with the website. Also, thanks to advanced testing tools, designers can also study your behavior to find out how they can maximize clicks (and sales) by changing certain elements with in the website. So it is only natural that companies and designers pay their target audience to test out their website. Thanks For Reading Hope It Helped You ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, just about everybody has something to offer, and I\u2019m almost certain you have skills. You typed this question on Quora, right? Well, clearly you can use a computer or smart device, which means you have access to resources available to market yourself, improve or enhance your skill sets, study and learn new things, and discover opportunities. Start by finding out what you truly want in life, juxtapose that with your passions and interests, and determine how you can align these values. For example, I want to earn sustainable wealth that will enable me to provide for my family today and tomorrow. I want to leave my children and their progeny with security and peace of mind when I\u2019m gone. I enjoy cooking, writing, making videos, offering advice, and searching for areas in the market I can exploit. So, I eventually opened a food cart in my community (the first of its kind) and provided my own food delivery service. I recognized a need for something in my community, connected my passion for cooking with the skills I have in marketing, and provided a service that enabled me to capitalize on the opportunity. There are literally a million things that you can do to earn money. You just have to find what drives you and where there is a need in the market (or where you can create that need). Invest in yourself by improving what you have to offer. This doesn\u2019t have to be accomplished through formal education; continue doing what you\u2019re doing right now: inquiring on social media, utilizing online learning resources like Kahn Academy, YouTube, and Quora. You began with a very broad question, now begin to narrow your scope and inquire about specifics in your areas of interest. ",

            "answer_text": " By becoming the middleman. In a nutshell, you simply connect a buyer who require a particular service to someone who can provide that service, and then you pocket the difference. You don\u2019t need any skills to deliver that service, because you\u2019ve found a vendor who will do that job for you. Okay, maybe you\u2019ll still need a bit of soft skills to co-ordinate with your vendor to enure smooth delivery for the customer. But that\u2019s just the bare minimum that you need to make this work. We are not talking about rocket science here. Here\u2019s an example. Let\u2019s say you want to set up a Fiverr gig selling SEO services, but you know nuts about SEO. What do you do? You simply hire a cheaper vendor from SEO Clerk to do the job for you. So every time your gig receives an order, you simply pass the job over to your vendor at SEO Clerk to deliver the service. You earn your keep as a middleman just like that. Come end of the day, you still know nothing about SEO. There are also many resourceful tools out there that will help you perform a job without the need to hire a vendor. Proofreading is a good example. Do you need to be perfect in English in order to be a good proofreader? Of course not. Because you have a jolly good friend in Google Docs to help you out! Simply copy and paste onto the Google Docs, and let it go to work by helping you find the grammatical errors and then correcting them. Of course, you\u2019ll need a skill here. But we are talking about how to use a Word document here. You should know how to use it, right? I hope my answer has opened up a few possibilities for you. All the best!

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a short list to help you get started: 1. BookScouter Here\u2019s one perfect for students or avid readers! BookScouter is a website that allows you to sell your used books and textbooks to the highest paying site. Simply enter the ISBN number of any book and you\u2019ll instantly be shown a list of different prices from about 40 book buyback sites. Choose the one that pays the most and sell your book to them. Textbooks and school-related books often cost a ton of money and you only use them a couple times in your entire life! Why not sell your textbooks to pad your pocket a little bit? While there are tons of website available to sell used books, personally I think BookScouter is the best. All you have to do is locate the ISBN number of the book, and the website will search over 40 different buyer sites to locate the ones that will pay the best price for your used book. 2. Ebates You might have seen this one in a TV commercial! Ebates is slowly becoming one of the biggest cashback sites. Basically, you earn a certain percentage cash back if you shop through them. They have almost any online store you can think of. From Amazon and Walmart to Best Buy, Target, and much more. So if you shop online, I think it\u2019d be crazy not to use a cash back shopping site like Ebates. It\u2019s like getting free money for buying something you were going to buy anyway. Don\u2019t forget to check out their Double Store for double cashback on purchases made through qualifying stores. 3. Microsoft Rewards You search online, don\u2019t you? We all do. Perhaps even multiple times a day. Need Extra Cash for Free? If you like getting paid for surveys, and are going to join only one site, I would recommend you choose Ipsos-iSay. Ipsos is the most fun and well-paying panel. Give it a try to see how you like it. It is free anyway! Click to Join Ipsos Now! Well, now you can earn free gift cards just for doing that! Sign up with BingRewards for free, then search as you normally would. For every search you perform, you earn a certain number of points. Once you have enough points, you can redeem for gift cards, meal discounts, and even airline points. I\u2019d venture to say an average searcher could easily earn an extra $100 a year using BingRewards. 3. FatWallet FatWallet is one of the oldest cashback sites offering some of the highest cashback percentages on some of these stores. For example, you can earn up to 4% cash back for shopping through eBay, up to 6% through Groupon, or even as much as 27% through Angie\u2019s List! 4. InboxDollars InboxDollars is what you would call a total rewards site where you earn rewards for pretty much everything you can do online, anything from shopping and visiting websites, to taking surveys, playing games, watching videos, and more.

They constantly add new earning options. Plus, they offer sign up bonus as well. Sign up today and get a $5 sign up bonus. 5. UserTesting What could be easier than visiting a website and then telling the site owner what you think of their site! And the amazing part is that you get paid for testing websites. They do this so they can test the functionality and user-friendliness of their website. Create A Better Customer Experience | UserTesting is a site where websites owners and everyday people, like you and I, are brought together to help each other. The site owners get his/her site tested by real people, and you get paid for doing what you already do dozens of times every day. How much money can you make, you ask? Different user testing sites have varying rates, but Create A Better Customer Experience | UserTesting pays a flat rate of $10 for every site you test. 6. Swagbucks Who hasn\u2019t heard of Swagbucks by now! Just in case you haven\u2019t, SB is one of the most famous online rewards sites. So famous that they have even been featured on many media outlets such as ABC\u2019s Good Morning America show, and even Forbes. Like InboxDollars, SB will pay you to visit the website of their sponsors and participate in activities like shopping, surveys, and more! They use their own form of currency, called Swag bucks, which can be converted into real cash. You can even download their app for your Android or Apple devices.

Gomez PEER This one is as easy as it gets, although some of us may take issue with the privacy situation. Here is how it works\u2026 Install their free app on your computer and go about your day! That really is it! It basically leverages your system\u2019s idle resources (such as unused processing power, RAM, and bandwidth) to test the performance of many of the world\u2019s most popular websites. What\u2019s in it for you? For every month you keep the app installed, you earn cash which is paid to you via PayPal. And just how much you earn depends on how much idle resources were used from your PC. It\u2019s not much money, probably a few dollars a month or even less. But then again, you are not really doing anything. You\u2019re just letting them use your PC\u2019s unused resources. Basically, you get paid to turn your computer on. Takeaway As you can see, it doesn\u2019t take any special skill or know-how to make some side money with these sites. Sure, none of these are going to help you quit your day job, but they allow you to earn a few extra dollars mostly for things that you already do online. And best of all, none of these money making ideas and options require any special skills ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such a thing as no skills. There is laziness though and that affects the individuals from exploring their skills. Keep in mind that there are classic set of skills obtained usually through school/training but you should not limit yourself to these. I think the most important skills are the natural set of skills that you are born with. As an example, some people are natural born salespeople. I know a guy that did not finish 5th grade but can talk you in to buy whatever he is selling. Another example is these motivational speakers \u2026 they don\u2019t know how to do anything but they know how to talk about things in a way that they make you do things. My personal opinion, you can be successful without learned skills if you know how to explore your natural skills, and you could do great if you are able to combine both. ",

Earning Passive Income This category would be more aptly named low-effort income. It\u2019s rare to literally make money by putting in no effort. To learn more, check out Nat Eliason\u2019s guide. You could spend a year creating something that employs other people and has a ton of growth potential, or you could spend a year making something that kicks off $5,000 a month. Just keep in that mind that basically nobody makes a living this way, and you may be happier working on a career. Freelance Ask your relatives and friends if they need any work done. Do the work. Then, scale the business. You\u2019ll probably learn a lot in the process. In summary, I recommend that you go out and put in action.
