            "answer_text": "Hi there, What you\u2019re doing so far until now, you know that Self-harm is NOT \u201cworking\u201d for you: STOP doing harm to yourself, in mind and body you STOP. There is much stress in the world these days as a result of many pressures on high and low levels (govermnent/laws vs the people). Sorry, but you have to ignore this for now, but know that your family is difficult as a result of \u201call that\u201d. Kindly BE patient with your family for now. Eventually things are going to change for the GOOD but it\u2019s not now yet. BE patient as you can. So you gotta change \u2018things\u2019, turn \u2018things\u2019 around until your Life DOES \u2018work\u2019 for you. You need a new Mindset and Perspective on your Life and your Lifestyle. The above 3 sentences are \u201cwhat you need\u201d, so you must understand these \u201cbasics\u201d. You must understand that if something\u2019s not working, then you must CHANGE things until it IS working. now\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 You ARE here for a reason, no matter alien or human. Everything happens for a reason, there is no coincidence. So you are here for \u201cthat\u201d reason, but you\u2019re probably going to find out LATER what the reason is. So for now, best is to go-wit-the-flow, to give yourself some Peace. NEVER ignore your feelings, because that\u2019s exactly part of the problem. (Always follow your heart/mind > which are actually your Instinct and Intuition thoughts). You came here looking for an Answer to your problems because you FEEL / SENSE that something\u2019s not right, so Compliment yourself for making this first step to your change. You need to understand your mind more: so you can learn how things work, how YOU work. Knowing your mind is easy, and it will give you Control over yourself and how you see that Life impacts you. But first you must look at your past Life and \u201csee\u201d what has taken you to this moment in your Life: WHAT has caused you to feeling so lonely, depressed, sad. Once you know what caused the problem, you can start to \u201cwork\u201d on a solution. Think problem-solving oriented always (from now on). That\u2019s how things \u2018work\u2019. See my past Answers, find out where I talk about the Conscious and the Sub-conscious and you\u2019ll see that 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131-Countdown trick. (The countdown-\u2019trick\u2019 is actually the ONLY way how you can make the right choices in Life based on your own Instinct and Intuition, without OVERthinking. (That overthinking is the Trouble). . So\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Point is that you need change, but BEFORE THAT, you need to talk again to your mom and some other family and maybe friends. You must make them understand how you feel and what\u2019s happening, and also what CHANGE you need to make in your Life... Now, in my Quora Spaces page there\u2019s one post that tells you how to have/make a GOOD successful talk, so follow that information, it\u2019s very short and simplified for you. CHANGE >>> In the following paragraphs are just a few key Lifestyle aspects that you change in your Life and you share this Answer with your mom, family, friends > as that will start many more other changes inside the family how you all live together with eachother. BETTER. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Now\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. I\u2019m going to present you with a few Lifestyle changes that will help GUIDE you to your own change. (Plenty more I could say but that\u2019s impossible because your Life is big and this Answer would be waaaaaaay too long. So let\u2019s focus on important Lifestyle aspects that YOU can change and this will be the start of you forever-changing > optimizing yourself continually, daily in your Life. For you to be SUCCESSful, you must become Confident, Strong and Empowered person. Nops, faking it doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d. We\u2019re talking about changing the core of you until your Life is all about GOODness: Goodness-you + all things/people that impact you must be about GOODness too. There\u2019s no need to be afraid of anything, {just be afraid of fear itself}, then avoid fear and start to be busy with the good things in life. Give your goodness, and more goodness will come back to you. (Law of attraction). But know that Nature works slow to change, and so will you, So give yourself a year or more to get where you want to be, (mostly) trouble-free and your peaceful-happy self. Then also know that the road of change that you will go on, you will still encounter some setbacks (read: relapse) every-now-and-then, because in this cultured world, trouble influences just come your way every now and then. Take it for what it is and give yourself some space to feel down every now and then. But you must stay on the road to change, improving yourself. First, you must realize that there is no perfect life, you don\u2019t need to be happy 100% of the time, life needs to have some ups and downs, but that must be in balance. The balance is not 50-50 (as many people think/believe), but in fact it is 85-15. That\u2019s the percentage of healthy Balance that you must live by, in today\u2019s world. 85% and 15%. This \u2018percentage\u2019 will keep you in peaceful-happy \u2018mode\u2019; it will make you grow so you can become strong, confident and empowered. When you do everything to solve your troubles, you will gain so much experience, and as time goes by you will become optimized and you will be able to deal with the troubles that come your way. but if you want to go on this \u2018road of Change trip\u2019, you really need to change a lot, so be prepared. There\u2019s always a good solution to solving problems, know that. Under in this Answer there\u2019s a section where I mention your highly intelligent brain, and how to stop yourself from OVERthinking, using a \u201cTrick\u201d that\u2019s actually not a trick. You asking your Question here means that your Instinct is working correctly, it\u2019s keeping you from harm. So it\u2019s good you came here. Everything happens for a reason, there is NO coincidence, bad luck or whatever. Scroll down and you will see that my Answer to you is long > because your Life is BiG, (there are many External Influences that impact you every moment of every day) > and so in my Answer I will mention \u2018KEY TOPICS\u2019 and aspects of your Life > so you must READ IT ALL. [Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep things SIMPLE and to-the-point for you]. Let\u2019s Start: >>> It\u2019s important that you must FIRST ask yourself the question, step 1: WHY did this happen to me (HOW did it start, and how could I GROW to become like this \u2026 ) So to get understanding of the WHY, HOW and where it GREW; (this first Question) starts with this \u201cStep 1\u201d. I use separation lines to make the key topics clear to you in sections, step-by-step: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Step 1. Easy-way = you look back at your Life from childhood until now > you WRITE. Writing is GOOD for you, it helps you to look at yourself \u2018from another side\u2019 (Like you are in a helicopter and looking down, that way you can see more. You can imagine it\u2019s \u201ca Boss\u2019 view on your Life\u201d. Like that). So write your \u2018Biography first; use a notebook or write \u2018things\u2019 down in a file in your computer. First use half hour to write down the big lines of your Life that you can remember, and then stop it. Another day, like after tomorrow when you feel like it, you\u2019ll fill in more details of what happened back then. Good things AND bad things, all the important points in your Life. You will see that your Life is very interesting so far, and you have already learnt a lot. Your Life-story is even interesting for you to share, who knows will somebody every make it into a movie. (but that\u2019s not necessary, you can feel free to share it with others though). From the moment when you feel that your Life-story (Biography) is \u2018done\u2019, you should have written everything in around 2 or 3 pages. When your Biography is good, feel free to continue writing every evening daily about what happened every day. That\u2019s you writing in Diary-style. Again as said: it\u2019s GOOD for you, diary-writing helps you in the evening to see HOW GOOD you could feel this today, and in case it wasn\u2019t good; then you immediately find out WHAT the Problem was, and you will make sure to AVOID/STOP/END/ELIMINATE/DELETE that from now on. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - From now on, you will start Living ! DIFFERENTLY From now on, you will Live more \u201cin the Now\u201d: 1 day at a Time. Today. Forget about tomorrow (other than doing your school homework). It\u2019s your \u201cMISSION\u201d to make your TODAY > GOOD. Know that your Past you cannot get it back and you cannot change it anymore, so accept your past as all learning lessons. Know that your Future tomorrow is not here yet, so you can\u2019t be busy with that too much. Limit yourself to looking only at TODAY, 1-day-at-a-time. Know that you can\u2019t \u201cPlan ahead\u201d too much, because Plans always change. That\u2019s part of a future where you are not yet, so you MAY NOT think about the future too much yet now. Focus on TODAY !! only this is your first step of CHANGE. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Point is: you really MUST change. STOP thinking the wrong way, and START caring for your inner-you. Know that your CHANGE will come to you in another way that you expected. Know that it\u2019s ALL going to be OK. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + So here comes Step 2 that will make everything more \u2018OK\u2019 for real: You do that using Zen-Meditation, it is free, simple, easy, and you do it fast. Around 30 minutes every day at a time when it is convenient for you, you said, and basically you\u2019ll be sitting quietly - sitting straight - breathing slowly as you count every breath (in series from 0 to 9). How-To do Zen is described easily and to-the-point in my Quora Spaces page; you will find the Link below under. It means that it will take some 4 weeks or maybe a bit longer, before your inner you will find you. You will know it and feel changed when Time starts to disappear because sometimes it will feel like you just sat there for 15 minutes and in fact 30 minutes have already passed. Once your inner you finds you, then you feel differently and you will be more \u2018a whole\u2019: One-you > You will be more complete than you are now. That is why meditation is a requirement in life for you, for all people, actually. It means that you must do it, but only doing it once or twice to try it out; that is useless, life doesn\u2019t work like that. The good things in life take time, nature works slow to make good change, and so do you. Understand that. So your \u2018recipe\u2019 is: Every day 30 minutes Meditation, sitting and breathing where every breath is counting from 1 to 9. Just DO it. Zen gives you that \u201cGood Vibe\u201d that you need to CONNECT and SHARE. Last note on Meditation: You can ask other people to JOIN you, it\u2019s surprisingly GOOD to do Zen together, you can ask your parents/friends to join even. :-) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + I wish that I could tell you that there was something FAKE that you could do, like eating a pill, or talking to a shrink or something else, but those EXTERNAL things are not helping you to solve your Problem, because the real problem-to-solve is on your INSIDE, it\u2019s inside of your Thoughts and feelings (those are your Mind). You must see: understand/realize/believe that this whole life, everything, it all takes place inside of your thoughts (Mind) giving you your Feelings. So we are talking about your Mindset, and also your Perspective on the things that come to you/impact you. \u2018Fake\u2019 change, or just changing one specific aspect of your Life (such as for example not staying up until the middle of the night anymore or maybe not drinking any alcohol anymore) All that does nothing, it doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d. Lying, Faking, Keeping secrets, Cheating > that all does NOT \u201cwork\u201d > lie to somebody else only means that you are lying to yourself. Growing a GOODness-Life means that you must think about CONNECTING and SHARING (what you can), and with lying/cheating and all those badness things, that makes you Fail at Life. You just DO your GOODness-Life and you will succeed at everything, no matter what others may tell you or want you to believe. Those people\u2019s words are fake themselves. Don\u2019t get stuck with such fake words/opinions. Your Life is about you becoming and staying your True inner (peaceful-happy) Self and stop to cheat/lie/fake to yourself. (I am saying this because YOU must make yourself strong, confident and empowered, that is the Road of Life that belongs to you.) \u2026 there is no [other] fake way to do your GOODness-life. How you see Life happening and what you think on that is all called your Mindset and Perspective. (remember this) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Nature works slow to make Change; so for you too: it takes Time \u2026\u2026.. So, in order for you to come to the biggest part of your real total change in your life, expect that it will take a year, maybe more. And that\u2019s all OK, because you will really manage your whole life from a new perspective, with a different mindset. You being the best version of you. Once you have changed enough to be your new and refreshed, you will have become peaceful happy, that will be your inner feeling. That inner feeling will help you to grow every day from good, new experiences that will make you strong, confident and empowered. That is your best version of yourself. It\u2019s possible that there will be some setbacks, because external influences change how you feel about certain things that happen during your day. Know that it\u2019s all OK. You are a normal human being, you are intelligent, and that you are just trying to understand everything, you are going with the flow. And that also means that some things will influence you in the wrong way. So allow setbacks to happen, it is completely normal. Know that it\u2019s all OK. = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Now\u2026\u2026\u2026 Looking at yourself later-on \u2026 How you will slowly grow into your total change. It\u2019s BiG, understand that. You need to be totally a GOOD person. There\u2019s a Law in the Universe that works\u2019 1 simple way only: GOODness grows more Goodness. (Badness also grows more badness, so you must stay away from that). You need to be totally Responsible, at every aspect of your life, you must come to the point where you have the same respect for your family, that ant in front of your feet or the bird in the tree, and that piece of plastic trash that you see in the street that you pick-up and put in the trash-bin nicely. Eat natural healthy foods and drinks, and you can snack for around 15% of the Time. read a bit more below where I mention the 85-15-principle. Stop brushing your teeth with Fluoride, get your toothpaste without that. Laugh MORE, think less, think more GOODness stuff. Always be clean and organized : in your house/room but also in your thoughts. (And eventually you\u2019ll become more responsible out there in the streets, in the World. But that\u2019s for long-term, like after 2 years or so). You will slowly become peaceful-happy, and you making a good day for yourself every day, living life the best to your possibilities; all that will make you strong and confident + empowered. That will \u2018give\u2019 you control over your day. I will tell you again now: what you have been thinking and feeling in your past; that has resulted in your strange thoughts and feelings that you have so far until now, so those are not really the right ones that make you Grow Goodness. So, you conclude for yourself: forget everything that anybody has ever taught you, and start to discover things for yourself. Find some different opinions of the people, those in favor and those against, and then you choose and decide what you think that is correct/\u2018works\u2019 for you. It\u2019s OK if YOU think that it\u2019s OK. If it\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d (not OK) >>> Then you will walk away from it. It means that with everything, you always remove unnecessary information, you deduct until you come to simplicity. Keeping things simple is what will work for you, \u2018complexiticity\u2019 does NOT work for you. (Nor does it work for anybody else, for that matter). = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = PAY ATTENTION NOW >>> This section is MOST important for you . ( I\u2019ll explain your Thoughts + the TRICK you must always Live by ! ) Your Life is based on how YOU think. You are intelligent. Automatically > you OVERthink\u2026\u2026\u2026 OVERthinking leads to BADness. OVERthinking leads to depression and muuuuch more stuff that you don\u2019t want. STOP OVERthinking with your Thoughts ! Your Thoughts are made up of 2 simple \u2018parts\u2019: your Conscious (Thinking-)you ~ daytime. And your SUB-Conscious you (That you that is asleep; \u201cthe other you\u201d). your SUB-Conscious you INCLUDES your Instinct + your Intuition. When you first \u201cThink\u201d about something > that is your Instinct + your Intuition. (Your Instinct and your Intuition are already inside of you, designed to keep you safe from harm). Instinct and Intuition thoughts take only 1 to 5 seconds. After those 5 seconds\u2026 your OVERthinking starts \u2026 So STOP OVERthinking with your Thoughts ! TRUST in your own Instinct & Intuition > your first \u2018original\u2019 first thought > that = the right Thought. The TRICK = DO A COUNTDOWN > count back from 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 and then you canNOT think about that-something-that-you\u2019re-thinking-about. You will go DO something-else. Change your Mindset. DO this Trick - LIVE IT - and Change will happen for your whole Life, this video here shows you how it\u2019s done in \u2018real Life\u2019: [ The video is called: \u201cUse This To Control Your Brain - Mel Robbins\u201d, the key part of the video starts at 7:00 ] = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = It\u2019s important to eat the right Foods (and Drinks) to grow your body and mind, so here are some other points about your Life that you will \u2018Change\u2019 : You must eat natural healthy foods. Now, having said that, I know that you will still snack, you will still want to snack. So for that, you have my 85-15-principle that you will apply to most everything in your life ! 85\u201315 means that you\u2019ll eat natural healthy unprocessed foods 85% of the Time, But it\u2019s OK for you to snack 15% of the time. A bit = OK: 15%. You must be happy 85% of your day, and 15% of the time you can let others influence/impact you as that will give you \u2018other\u2019 thoughts/feelings. So now you understand how to DO your days based on that 85% and 15%. Use it always. IF you reach more than 15% of trouble/problems in a day > then you will STOP / Shutdown and focus more/only on the 85% Goodness. Like that. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ From now on, you must DO 1 good deed every day. That can be anything, like keeping the door open for somebody that comes after you when you are entering the supermarket, or maybe you pick up that piece of trash in the street, and you dispose of it in a nearby trashcan. Doing a good deed Grows your GOODness, and your goodness will start to grow more (Law of Attraction). Give yourself plenty Time for change, be patient with yourself and \u201cstay on course\u201d: continue moving forward/straight no matter whatever happens. Know that you are not alone. Connect MORE with your Family and friends, and other people near you and DO things that you LOVE TO DO ; maybe you love dancing, singing, playing boardgames, swimming, bowling or even going Camping > Go DO \u201cit\u201d: do it better than ever before, no matter what that \u201cit\u201d is that you love to do ! MASTER what you love doing, be the best at it and then your specialism will get you at Work good, for your inner self-Value, along with you earning some money too for Life-expenses. As I already said, your Life is BiG, there are many people/events/factors that influence you, some good, other not good, divide everything in either good or bad, and whatever is Bad you must avoid/end/eliminate/delete/remove from your Life. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ I cannot possibly mention all other factors in your life that impact you every moment of your today. This Answer is already very long, yet it only includes a few aspects of Life. So I have written my Quora Spaces page called Perspective-Mindset , where you can find more topics on your Lifestyle that help guide you to that different mindset and perspective on your Life. I have also written many other Answers over the past years, you can also browse through those, so you can read through some other relevant answers/information. [ My small note: I still need to Organize my Quora Spaces page better, so for now, just browse through it just a bit \u2018here-and-there\u2019 only. ] Start today, and see where you expect yourself to be a year from now, give yourself plenty time but stay on that road that takes you to your total change: you becoming your best version of yourself. Once you have made all changes to yourself, you will be totally different, that new person, strong, confident and empowered. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Conclusion: This IS all YOUR LIFE, you can easily continue to \u201cDo your Life\u201d your way how you have been doing until now today, but you can here because you discovered that that\u2019s not the right way for your Life. So just RE-READ my Answer again, and start to USE / Practice those \u2018things\u2019 I have told you. You\u2019ll have the Lifestyle that will attract people to you and then you\u2019ll feel confident and you\u2019ll not feel Lonely again anymore. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - If you feel that this Answer is logical and that it makes sense to you, then you may want to browse through my Quora Spaces page Perspective-Mindset > read up on some other important Lifestyle topics as a guide how-to make Life \u201cwork\u201d for you better. You can also consider reading up on some of my other [relevant] Answers. Feel free to message me with your Question(s) or update me on how you\u2019re doing/growing.

            "answer_text": "Hello, and thank you. It\u2019s my honor to answer. Prayers for you and yours. There\u2019s a saying nowadays that I absolutely hate, and it is used all the time: \u201cnew normal.\u201d Back in the day\u2026 have to laugh, because it wasn\u2019t so long ago, denial was considered a psychological problem. It meant that a person was having difficulty facing his/her troubles head-on, so his defense mechanisms kicked in, and he found a way to push it into the background of the background, so to speak, and do all he could to avoid it. It was considered a problem, because ultimately it led to more physical, emotional, and mental stress. And it led to drugs and other problems. It\u2019s because there is no healing down that path. Now, the phrase \u201cnew normal\u201d seems to have replaced awareness that denial leads to compounded problems. Call it: denial of denial. If people are dropping like flies from the pandemic, shooting each other, hating on each other, fighting for their \u201crights\u201d to be hedonistic, being mean-spirited and cruel to animals, now, all of a sudden, we can just adroitly declare it \u201cnormal.\u201d \u201cNew, yes, and because we have the \u2018liberty\u2019 to call whatever we want the truth, the new normal is normal.\u201d Now\u2026 bear with me\u2026 yes. It has everything to do with your question. It does, because, if everyone is pressured to accept the evils in this world as normal, to inhale deeply the \u201csoma (Brave New World)\u201d of denial, then what happens to people like you who don\u2019t feel a part of this world? It\u2019s been going on a lot longer than now, but it\u2019s come to a head. Things haven\u2019t been normal in the world for millenia. We\u2019re born imperfect. Cruelty and hatred without cause are a sordid part of history since the start. And for every right thing a person undertakes to do, there is resistance. Bright, intelligent doctors, scientists, inventors have been laughed to scorn. Truly sincere devout people sent to the cross. The list is long. To some, this is supposed to be accepted as \u201cnormal;\u201d that\u2019s what is deemed \u201cappropriate.\u201d And if a person, like you, and like me, doesn\u2019t feel a part of this world, we are \u201cnot normal.\u201d \u201cNew\u201d or otherwise. Another example: stand up for good causes, and you get a label: \u201cactivist.\u201d But unmotivated, lackadaisical ones who don\u2019t get involved are never called \u201cpassivists.\u201d They are \u201cnormal.\u201d There are many who feel they\u2019re not part of this world. Jesus said His followers are no part of this world. That His followers don\u2019t receive \u201cthe spirit of this world.\u201d But there also, my dear, must be a keenly felt sense of balance, here. For, as sordid and sorry a mess this planet is right now, there are great, solid foundations of good no evil can touch. And yes, they exist on this planet, too, not just in heaven, and they exist right now. Among loving people who care. The fruition of these will never be overthrown by \u201cnew normals\u201d or whatever label given to what\u2019s reprehensible. Personal integrity, peace, spiritual liberty, adherence to a standard of basic decency, courage, caring, kindness, compassion. And faithfulness. As a loved family member once said to me: \u201cGOD will only permit them to go so far, and no further.\u201d No one can destroy the strength of this fruition. So, you can feel alienated from the spirit of this world, yet be a great light in the world. It sounds like you\u2019re troubling and punishing yourself where you have done no wrong. And much of it is that you\u2019re confusing feeling alienated from the world with \u201cnot belonging in this planet.\u201d And because of that, you are not only trying to cut yourself off from the ills in this world, but you are cutting yourself off from all the good. You belong here if GOD opened your eyes. And if you\u2019re wondering why, well, I\u2019ve had lots of days wondering why, myself. We don\u2019t always have to know everything HE knows. We just have to take each day and ask: \u201cWhat can I do, today, to effect some good, to emit even a tiny beam of light? Maybe I\u2019ll call someone, check on her, make sure she\u2019s okay. Or maybe I\u2019ll be a good listener, even if I don\u2019t have all the answers.\u201d You have said your family is stressed. Ask yourself what you can do to alleviate some of their burdens. Help clean house? Let them know you love them and are there for them? Remember, as much as you need support, you also have the blessing of being a support for others. Just praying for them and for yourself effects much good. You are heaping way too many expectations on yourself. Let go of the baggage. And pray for help with the self-harm. Coming to a better, clearer understanding of the whole picture is great healing. If you need human help in the way of a therapist, don\u2019t hesitate. Something is triggering the self-harm as well, a way your thought patterns are working, which need a change in perspective. Peace. GOD bless. Find your path. And be patient. ",
