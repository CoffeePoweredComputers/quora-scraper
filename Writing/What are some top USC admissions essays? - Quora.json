            "answer_text": "\u201cDear Admissions Officer: This is the point where I\u2019m suppose to tell you what a \u2018great\u2019 guy I am, and probably how much time I\u2019ve unselfishly donated to the community at some level\u2026 but that direction would be a tall tale, and I\u2019m sure your desk is already stacked high with such yarns. You will note that I have maintained a 4.00 GPA over the past 4 years, and for me, that didn\u2019t come easily\u2026 I had to work like a dog\u2026 and thus having leisure outside of enjoying meals with my parents\u2026 I have had zero time to pursue much else. I encourage you to note that my GPA, and SAT scores are indicative of a high likelyhood of success in most any Major at the Big-U that I settle into, and I won\u2019t waste your time indicating \u2018exactly what my \u2018life\u2019s ambition\u2019 has been to pursue,\u2019 because frankly, I don\u2019t know yet- such is life. Therefore, unlike some of my imaginative competitors for empty chairs in your school, I prefer not to waste your time with any yarns.\u201d Have a nice day! ",
