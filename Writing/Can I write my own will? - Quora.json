            "answer_text": "Original question: Can I write my own will? Yes, you can. If your will is going to be complicated, then it might be worth having a professional do it, but the vast majority of people don\u2019t have complicated wills. There are many templates available, just get one that fits the regulations in your country and fill it out. Just use plain language, there\u2019s no need for any \u201clegal-speak\u201d, and you should read it over carefully to make sure that it makes your wishes clear. ",
