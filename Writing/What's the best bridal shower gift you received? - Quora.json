            "answer_text": "In 1965, a neighbor and good friend of my mother gave a large baby shower for me, with all the neighborhood women plus some others. The women brought gifts, but what I remember was really the activity for the party. Everyone picked an iron on pattern, and embroidered it onto dish towels. Beautiful , soft, large, all cotton cloths. As we chatted, everyone sewed. Most women could do at least a simple running stitch, and some could do a lot fancier ones. I got a lifetime supply of these towels. I gave some to my mother, and we still have a number of them up at our summer cabin. My grown son and daughter each have a few, and I have several. They are from a different era, have outlasted my marriage and almost all these lovely women. They all put their initials on them. They really meant a lot to me. ",
