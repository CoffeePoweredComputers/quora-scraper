            "answer_text": "I think everyone will have their own way of doing this. For me, I decide on the plot first. Other things follow on from this - the situation, the people and the style of writing. It's important to determine who your target audience is going to be - adult, child, etc., and the style of the book - complicated plots target a more adult style, while less complicated one targets a younger reader. The subject may not be suitable for a younger reader. For example, a plot about the higher echelons of the church may not be suitable for younger readers, and similarly plots about the teddy bear's picnic would not suit an older reader. ",

When I create the plot, which is the first step when writing a book, I research the topic, around the topic, and about the sub-topics within the topics. That helps me with writing as well: when the topics and sub-topics are ready, and I am all set to create scenes, I can write freely. :) ",
