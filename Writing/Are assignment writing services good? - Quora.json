            "answer_text": "Yes! It is indeed very helpful, provided you hire a trusted and reliable assignment help agency. With several agencies and freelancers available, it becomes really difficult to hire a trustworthy assignment service provider. While hiring, make sure you hire an experienced academic agency. You can also check with your friends if they have taken such service before. One such assignment help agency that I am aware of is Thoughtful Minds. It is a 14-year old academic help agency in India that offers assignment writing services in more than 15 countries like USA, UK, India, UAE, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, etc. Hope this helps. Good Luck! ",
