            "answer_text": "Be sure you are either a genius or have something completely original to say. At the very minimum be sure you are exceptionally talented. There are far too many books published each year as it is \u2013 and, as any publisher will tell you, the majority of them are bad. Writing a whole book is a very arrogant thing to do (writing a long one is breathtakingly arrogant), since it assumes that the reader should spend hours, maybe even weeks, reading your work when he could be reading Shakespeare or Dickens or Homer or Proust... There are so many great works/masterpieces of poetry, science, philosophy etc out there that it would take the average person 200 years to read them all \u2013 if not 2,000! ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is simple, put your butt in the chair a few hours everyday without fail and stare at a blank page. Not to discourage you further, and to put it more graphically, as Hemingway did: \"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.\" Sorry to sound glib, but to write a book is hard, hard work and an extraordinary commitment is needed. Without that commitment, you\u2019re living a fantasy. Good luck, and congratulation for even considering it. I\u2019ve been doing it for forty years and it doesn\u2019t get any easier. But if you stick with it, work through the confusion and despair at feeling lost, it finally gets done. ",
