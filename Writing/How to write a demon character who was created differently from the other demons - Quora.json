            "answer_text": "I probably shouldn't be sharing my own ideas for characters of mine, but I shall if it will give you either an original idea or a concept you could borrow. There are a few possible scenarios you could use for creating demons. Some that I've established for my own fictional works are as follows:  (Showing a picture of Griffith because why not? His origin of becoming a demon was well-written so it fits?) -Have demons be born from the negative thoughts and emotions of mankind: This is basically how a vast majority of demon characters I've written have been born. -Make someone an artificial demon: I have a few characters in mind that fit the bill. Two of my OCs were once humans who had committed suicide. Their souls were taken by a Demon Lord who replaced their hearts with highly corruptive demon hearts, erased their memories, and altered parts of their personalities to change them into different beings. Technically, the two of them are half-demon, but that part of them has forever altered them, meaning they can't be human, anymore.   (These are visual representations of them made in Jump Force. Kind of another reason why I showed a picture of Griffith first. Additional details to note of these two is that they wear black attire because it stops the corruption from their hearts from turning other humans. Physical contact with their skin is nearly impossible, hence the black clothing to protect others. They can technically adjust where their corruption is to perform physical contact or even just to take a bath with people [something the girl likes to do], but to do so they usually place the corruption into their eyes and cover them with thick black blindfolds. With the corruption in their eyes they can turn someone into a crazed demon with just one stare.) -Let a human fall into darkness: Basically like creating an artificial demon, but a full conversion from a human soul to a demon soul. Someone like Griffith has done a similar process, but with a lot of sacrifices along the way. The method I am referring to is to let a person choose to become a demon, either during life or after death. The same demon lord that made the two characters I showed off helped turn a human woman into a demon that became one of his and his lover\u2019s best supports (and a lover to both of them, as well.) Those are all of the methods I remember coming up with. You may either borrow one of the methods for your own characters or come up with something of your own making through them. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually have an OC who\u2019s technically a demon. Thing is, though, he\u2019s not a full-blooded demon-he\u2019s what\u2019s known as a Nephilim, or the unholy union between a demon and a mortal woman. So you could do that-make them a half-breed rather than a pure-blooded demon. If you wanna go a more science fantasy route, you could make them an artificial demon-that is, they were genetically engineered in a laboratory using dark magic and science. I\u2019ve always found things like that interesting. If it\u2019s traditional fantasy, it could be a demon who was born good rather than evil-that is, he questions what the point of being evil is. Or a bit more cliched-they could be made by some sort of wizard who needed a guardian or something. ",
