            "answer_text": "I suppose you\u2019re talking about the number of hours we spend writing or preparing our writing? The only answer I can give is \u2018as much as we\u2019re able to\u2019. For me, it tends to be one or two hours a day, depending on my health. I know others who only work on their books on the week-end, because they don\u2019t have time during the week. Unless you\u2019re talking about \u2018professional\u2019, full-time writers, who don\u2019t need another job to feed themselves and their family. And then, the answer is much the same: as writing is their main job, they tend to spend their whole day on it, \u2018as much as they\u2019re able to\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends on the person. For example, Ernest Hemingway was writing every morning, but Khaled Hosseini like the element of surprise and spontaneity without any frames. You can read interesting article The Daily Routines of 12 Famous Writers about them and others. I typically write for one to two hours each morning. I may spend an additional hour editing my work that evening. Other writers I know go write intensively for several months before taking a break for a few weeks. ",
