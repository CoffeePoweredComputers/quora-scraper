            "answer_text": "I have real affection for more than one, among them Nation and The Wee Free Folk, both by Terry Pratchett, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, Montana 1948 by Larry Watson, and Deadline by Chris Crutcher. What they have in common and what puts them on my \u201cfavorites\u201d shelf is that each is exquisitely, poignantly, painfully *human* in scope, characterization, conflict and theme. Stories to make you weep, then celebrate our incredible ability to do the right thing when given even just the sliver of an opportunity. ",
