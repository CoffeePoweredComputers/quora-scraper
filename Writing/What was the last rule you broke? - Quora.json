            "answer_text": "I do not recall that I ever did! I am a MUSLIM; I live by the RULES prescribed in the Holy Qur\u2019an. The Quran, the last revealed Word of God; (the Final Testament) is the prime source of every Muslim's faith and practice. It deals with all the subjects which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His creatures. At the same time it provides guidelines for a just society, proper human conduct and an equitable economic system. Morality is so malleable that just thinking about breaking a rule can change the way we behave. Character isn't the real driver; it's social and situational forces that strongly influence bad behavior. Often, not a lot of conscious awareness goes into when or to what extent we push ethical boundaries. We might break the rules under some conditions and in some mindsets, but not in others. And, of course, in knowing why we transgress, we can defend our actions\u2014for better and for worse; however this goes against every Muslim's faith and practice. ",
