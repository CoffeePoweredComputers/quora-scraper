            "answer_text": "If the site doesn't publicly display an author you could try the following. 1) In your web browser view the source code. (In most browsers use a right click win, hold click mac to bring up a box where you can select view source.) Look to see if there is an author name in the meta data. It will be near the top and would look something like this: <meta name=\"author\" content=\"Heidi Adams Cool\" />Typically this is the name of whoever built the site. That person may or may not be the author, but could put you in touch with the author. 2) Go to Page on whois.com and put the domain name in the box where it says whois lookup. This will provide contact information for the site owner. Sometimes it is private and may be in the name of the hosting company, but it may give you more info. Good luck. ",
