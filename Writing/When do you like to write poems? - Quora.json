            "answer_text": "when everyone else was just starting to read I was already read chapter books. By the time I was in 4th grade I had already read many books that are considered to be classical literature. It wasn\u2019t until I read Shakespeare\u2019s Midsummers Night Dream, did I find a certain attraction towards poetry. My fist poem was called \u201cDaydreams\u201d it consisted of imaginary and innocents. My poems progressed as I grew. When I was in middle school I had notebooks filled with poems. All of my poetry no longer seemed as simple and innocent as my first if anything it grew more emotional and more in depth. My poetry had morphed into life lessons that most kids my age at the time didn\u2019t even know existed yet here I was writing about such powerful words. Many of the topics i wrote about were about heartbreak, loneliness, hiding emotions, and society and I would understand the words and means but I shouldn\u2019t have because none of these things should of effected me. I like to write when something happens that I have or have not been through, I write poetry because I\u2019m learning/experiencing life as I do it. I get to experience emotions that I have yet to be aquatinted to. I write to understand the situation one is or could be in. Ex: Unrequited love I write about loving someone but knowing that the reader will never have that someone whom they live. By writing a poem about this I get to understand what it could feel like to be that person. I get to see feel the emotions and know the thoughts one could have being in that kind of situation. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to think that there\u2019s a different time and place for each type of poem you write, at least that\u2019s how it works for me. You can write about your contemplation of the universe, when it\u2019s 2 a.m. and you\u2019re sitting in your room, in the dark, looking out the window. Everyone is asleep, except the thinkers and the dreamers, and it\u2019s almost like time has stopped. It\u2019s just frozen there. You can write about the great, big skies, and the ringing light of the stars, as time ticks on, and you\u2019re just sitting there. Watching the world go on. You can write about the sweet nostalgia from last summer, when the afternoon\u2018s rays of sun are seeping in through your curtains, or when you\u2019re taking a walk in the fading heat at 5 p.m. Picture orange and yellow trees surrounding the road as you walk, earbuds in your heads, and a sweater around your shoulders. The world could be melting in a soft gold light, like pine needles and dead leaves, and you\u2019re there to write about it. You can write about that sense of restless freedom, when it\u2019s 10 a.m. and you\u2019re waking up on a cold, but sunny day. Remember when it was winter break, and you had all the time in the world. Remember your adventures in the snow, and December\u2019s frosty kiss. Remember the crispness of the air outside, and the everlasting longing to run out there in the middle of the night. Remember that when you write. You can write about the people you\u2019ve met, and the people you\u2019ve known, when the sun has set at 8 p.m. and you\u2019re sitting in a rolling chair, on the sixth floor of an apartment building. You can see the world from here, can\u2019t you? And it seems so big, but yet so small. The sky is losing its shades of amber, and they\u2019re turning into purple. Traffic lights are blinking, and cars are speeding by in a blur. You can write about the wonders of the world, and you can give someone a reason to stay alive today. Write about that when the rain is pouring at 12 p.m. and you\u2019re at school, watching droplets fall from the grey clouds through the windows of the cafeteria. Write that when the thunder is crashing down on you while you\u2019re in class, sounds of rain pattering on the sidewalk outside. ",
