            "answer_text": "Two parts I have to answer your question on what to write about and solving writer\u2019s block. Let me start with Part Two as it is jazzier. Part Two: A clever trick exists among creatives. At night before they slumber, they pose questions to themselves. How will the writer get the fiends to expose themselves? How will the artist paint onto a canvas what is inside his mind? The poet asks what word rhymes with newfangled yet means timeless? Some folk sleep on a problem. A creative takes this a step further by instructing his subconscious to solve the problem by listing parameters and then posing questions before bedtime to get the answer. Overnight. An extension of this technique is to, when the answer starts to burble out of the subconscious, stuff it back down again. This increases the copaceticity of the solution when it emerges a second time. Go for a third and a fourth! Part One involves conscious reality where one identifies what one wants to say. What is important to you to talk about? Have a cup of strong coffee and imagine a friend is about to stop by and you want to speak from the gut. Just speak from the gut. Sometimes a mere sentence about a thought will generate in the mind a whole story, essay, or theme. Sometimes setting up a question will prompt from you, or from the cup of coffee, an answer. \u201cWhat do I see when I look out of a diner window?\u201d That question to myself got me a 5,000-word story. If one is honest with themselves, ideas will flow. If one is dishonest with themselves, write about that. And just to let you know, the answers to the questions above that I\u2019ve received while writing my maniacal publications are: One morning, the writer realizes the fiends would think themselves invisible, after all, they had coated each other with the lemon juice that creates invisible messages on paper? \u201cWe cannot be seen, now we can rob banks!\u201d For the writer, this was the answer on how the fiends would expose themselves. The artist awakes with the thought that he himself should be painted as crazily spinning in the center of the canvas against a background of an insanely-painted city scene. This, the inability to adapt to everyday life! The poet had a dream. The newfangled of today mattered none as time always found a way to become untangled! The rhyme that he was looking for. And yes, with practice one can accomplish Part Two with a little time even in the afternoon while making a pot of coffee or whatever. ",

            "answer_text": "More than likely, you have plenty of ideas, but aren\u2019t confident enough in your ideas to actually put them on paper. Simply not having an idea is rare. Exercises to become a better writer: Write every day. They can be writing exercises. Take those ideas as simply write them as an exercise. You\u2019ll find that some peter out quickly, but others will take a life of their own. As my own example, I did that, and wrote a couple of scenes, then decided I needed to write some backstory for that character. I\u2019m now 300 pages into the sequel of the first novel, and that first bit of writing still hasn\u2019t been incorporated as the backstory itself has become the story. That first bit may never see the light of day in the novels as the character has diverged from my original thoughts, and that\u2019s okay. Do those writing exercises. Don\u2019t expect too much out of them. Use them like you would a set of weights, to build those writing muscles. Practice dialogue. Practice exposition. Practice combining them. Practice 3rd person limited, as that\u2019s the most personal and acceptable style that\u2019s read. Practice changing your style, from shorter, choppy sentences for action scenes (whatever the action might be) to longer sentences for those non-action areas. If you tend toward outlines, then outline. If not, then don\u2019t. Everyone has their own style for putting a story together. I have my ever-growing cast of characters, with some of their basics in the list, and am realizing as some reappear much later that I\u2019ve forgotten exactly what they look like, so I need to go back and read how I described them\u2026and see if that\u2019s still true or needs to be changed or tweaked, or maybe I need to add a detail or two earlier on.
