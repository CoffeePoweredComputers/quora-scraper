            "answer_text": "Nonsense, Harry. A book can certainly have more than one main character. My current book has 5 \u2014 a young girl, her three aunts, and a young gent. Perhaps we\u2019d better define \u2018main.\u2019 In this context, I define \u2018main\u2019 as characters around the First Main, who proceed through the plot together, with one clear goal before them, meeting and overcoming obstacles as one. They are together in the beginning and together at the end. They all have a stake in the outcome and a common desire to see it through, albeit for different reasons. Mind, there are pitfalls here. Each character must be clearly and vividly defined; there should be no chance of one being mistaken for another. Their (personal) goals should be different, their way of meeting the world different, even their voices can\u2019t sound alike. They must not walk or talk alike, though of the same family. I admit, this takes a lot of work, but who wants to be thought of as a lazy writer? ",

            "answer_text": "How many heroes should be in the novel? As much as you can hold. In \u201cWar and Peace\u201d by Lev Tolstoy there are more than two hundred named characters. In the tale Frog-Prince - only two. It is believed that three - the optimal number of main characters in the genre novel. One character is the lack of conflict situations: it will be difficult for the reader to empathize with him. Two is better, but someone else is needed who will bring chaos in the relationship between the two main characters. Three - just right. But even an intellectual novel and mainstream should not be overpopulated. If the reader begins to get confused in the characters and forget who is who, this is a bad sign. ",
