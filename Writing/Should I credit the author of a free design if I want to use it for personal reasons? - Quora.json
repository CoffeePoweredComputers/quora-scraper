            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s the thing. The site says you must credit the Author and that\u2019s cool. The Author is giving away his creation for the small cost of including their name in a small print line that pretty much everyone ignores even in store bought cards. They\u2019re not asking you to include the Author\u2019s name spread across a whole side of the card like a book title. BUT! (Yep, there\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d) It seems you\u2019re only making one of these and pretty much the only person who\u2019ll get to see it is your friend. Store bought or not your friend would have most probably concentrated in your best wishes and ignored this small print crediting the Author so as long as you\u2019re not planing on printing a run of these and selling them, no matter how cheap, its okay to skip crediting the author. Tho as a designer myself, even if i know the line would be mostly ignored, it\u2019d still be nice to be credited. After all, you considered this Authors work worthy enough to hold your Birthday wishes for your friend so he must have done something right and all he asks is for a little love in a tiny line. ",

Perhaps you can change the design a little and hand color it, then you can say that the image was adapted from an original design by __________. It\u2019s always ethical to acknowledge the source. If this is a friend, s/he should appreciate the gesture and not worry about where the original design began. But why not create your own design? and then there is no problem. ",
