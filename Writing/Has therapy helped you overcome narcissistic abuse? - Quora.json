            "answer_text": "Once upon a time on Quora I answered a question similar to this. I stated that, in my experience, therapy helped me tremendously. I was viciously attacked by commenters. There is much debate about this subject. Some were so sure of the lack of value in therapy that they went on to state that since I suggested it had value, I must be a pretend victim of narcissistic abuse. They stated the stoicism played a role in my beliefs. That as I suggested it was beneficial in helping me gain a perspective on forgiving - in so much as I had decided that forgiveness was (for me) giving up the right and desire to get someone back. Therapy is a road that is open for anyone to travel. Yet, traveling the road merely looking at the ground is missing the point. The motivators for seeking help in therapy must lie in self. When you find yourself stunted in recovery, like hitting a plateau in dieting. For me, I was stunted. I was stuck on self pity and labeled myself a victim. While bad things do happen to good people unjustly, this can be a harmful obstacle in consideration when you allow the embitterment to linger based on this decision. For me, and I can only speak for me, I had to find a way to self actualize again. It wasn\u2019t enough to move on from the trauma. I had to challenge the trauma. I had to relive the trauma and decide to define the experience as outside of self describing as victim. Okay, so in realizing I had been a victim, doesn\u2019t that make me a victim? Not today I decided. But it wasn\u2019t until therapy helped me realize that belief i had come to hold of myself and challenge it. While I HAD been a victim, I was clearly NOT now. NOW, I was getting somewhere. Exactly where I was getting was another thing that therapy helped me decide. In victimology 101, in therapy, I learned all the facets that said label carries with it in potential to stagnant recovery. Some may decide that reaching a certain point in recovery is all they need. But, the ridiculously overkill tendencies in my persona forced me to dig deeper. We are who we are TODAY. Therapy helped me realize this. I can choose how I define myself in evaluating beliefs held. When I was discarded, my beliefs were forged in victimology and I was backed into a corner by those beliefs. At first, I blamed the narcissist for backing me into a corner of self pity as he smeared and left me naked and alone - traumatized. The shock of what happened left me paralyzed like a deer in the headlights, unable to move. Therapy helped me recognize I was allowing someone else to define me. I changed those beliefs and guess what? When I began labeling myself as survivor, I BECAME a survivor. I guess those that attacked me as coward and \u201cstoic\u201d in my decision to hold myself accountable with the help of therapy, are in some ways, correct. Maybe what I\u2019d been through was just too much for me. Perhaps they were stronger, braver, and in holding on to their anger and bitterness, that is what worked to propel them onward after trauma. At the same time, I do not judge others. I take only my inventory. I consider every angle. I have decided that the narcissist has right to be a vile, creepy user as that is his inventory also. It\u2019s not my job to judge or fix anyone, I\u2019m not equipped to do so. It is only my job to challenge myself. If they are able to decide that that way of surviving trauma works for them, so be it. How do the Swedish say it? s\u00e5nt \u00e4r livet (Such is life). I was stuck. I am not stuck now. Therapy, for me, were the \u201cjaws of life.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I did my own therapy. I do have the training as you see, to take myself on that journey, however there were a couple of things I discovered that enabled me to heal. The answer is on a question someone asked me, and it is about learning and actively and truly loving myself, and healing my past. There is a process I did to do that, and the outcome of being determined to heal is that I did. So yes, therapy can help you heal if you have a therapist who understands about narcissistic abuse. That it is 99% related to abuse in the past, which sets a person up to be abused as an adult, and that self love is a major part of the healing. I wrote an answer related to this, sharing my healing process and journey. If it resonates with you, great, if not, then I hope you find the right path for your healing. However do know that it is very possible. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Sometimes people just integrate the abuse into their past and reach an acceptance of it, but others can reach the point where the events have no emotional charge whatsoever, and no longer influence their choices in the future, based on fear. Here is my link and I wish you Healing. :-) Carol Raethel's answer to How did you learn to love yourself? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe therapy is helping me overcome the narcissistic abuse I have been subjected to, yes. I also believe that therapy can be a very beneficial tool for personal growth whether or not you have an issue to reconcile. The only way to know if it will work for you is to jump in and try it. You will get a variety of responses to your query and each will be as unique as the person answering because therapy is such a deeply personal thing. A simple yes or no answer will be of little use I\u2019m afraid. Another interesting aspect that further complicates things is this; all of the hard work is done by you and most of that is done outside of the office. This can make it difficult to really assess the proper value of therapy sometimes. Therapy is an investment in yourself. If you have been abused your self is something in need of and worth your time, effort and finances. ",

            "answer_text": "Therapy has been helping me enormously to overcome abuse. Narcissistic or not, the abuse is just abuse and leaves very deep wounds. Although I tried to suggest to my therapist that I suspected my abusers were psychopathic, he has never engaged with diagnosing those who abused me. We instead focused on how to take distance from them, how to understand my defense mechanism, how to handle the fact that I\u2019m still functioning in \u201csurvival mode\u201d sometimes, even after 30 years. This has been very helpful. What also helped was to accept that those abusers will never change. The reasons for that are not important anymore for me. It\u2019s a closed book I am not going to open any time soon. ",

Then my father died which was a lucky break- and then I discovered EMDR, which was REALLY helpful! I highly recommend EMDR. Then I did more therapy with a CBT therapist.
