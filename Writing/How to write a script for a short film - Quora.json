            "answer_text": "Now, you haven\u2019t mentioned the length of your play! For adapting your play into a short film you must first develop a good screenplay. Any film below the duration of 30 minutes can be called a short film, so you have to adapt your play that way. If your play is lengthy, then you\u2019ll have to intelligently develop the scenes so you can say your story in a short duration. But, if your play is a Shakespeare sort of drama then you may have to work very hard to adapt it for screen. You can get back to me if any other help is needed. GoodLuck! ",
