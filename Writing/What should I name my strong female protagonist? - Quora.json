So don\u2019t think of your character as a \u201cStrong Female Protagonist\u00a9\u2122!\u201d think of them as you would some other character who\u2019s walking around in the background and name them accordingly. After all, thinking of them as a \u201cStrong Female Protagonist\u00a9\u2122!\u201d and giving them a \u2018super special, ultra-unique, badass name\u2019 is the first step in scrubbing away all their flaws and turning them into a Mary Sue. Just name them something simple and relatable, something that reminds the readers they\u2019re just as human as everyone else. ",

            "answer_text": "The best name for your protagonist should be one that you choose. Look at the setting, the character's personality, their world's history, all these can affect your name choices. Do not be ashamed to choose a simple name. Personally, I have been waiting for the opportunity to name a female character Sam, which although it is simple is a great name for a character. One big thing to consider when using a simple name would be the full version. For example Sam might be Samantha. If you want more ideas for names, my hidden gem is a site called Fantasy Name Generator, which provides all sorts of names for not only humans of all kinds but also other species, magical beasts, pets, places, and much more.
