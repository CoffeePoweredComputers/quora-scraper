            "answer_text": "From a an unbiased citizen\u2019s view, Yes. Consider the events that happened during the election campaign, and the moves initiated by Narendra Modi during the last two years and something is really evident which can back this fact.  The man who came with an idea of hope and change, is yet to deliver something which could reflect in the grass root level. His silence on the intolerance issue was questioned but denied. The Oil prices dropped in the international market to the lowest in the history but he could not do anything as he promised to reduce the same. The value of Indian rupee would increase according to his promise yet it is declined as the days passed. The current move of demonetization would drop the GDP of India. The percentage of Jobless graduates increased in the last two years. The other big promise of black money and the Swiss account holders; the names are yet to read out. The article 351 is still making noise. The attacks on Dalits rose into a larger number. The circulation of photoshoped images became a fad among the BJP followers. India was even opposed by South Africa when it came to the NSG. Uniform Civil Code is still a distant dream. Pakistan is still provoking even though Narendra Modi had dinner with the leaders of Pakistan, meanwhile the people who support Pakistani artists became anti nationals and traitors. Moreover, the number of anti nationals increased in India in these two years as for most of the BJP followers, the definition of anti national implies the people who criticize the government. People are asked to prove their nationalism and patriotism. Whatever be, sometimes people forget the fact that actions speak louder than words. When the Prime Minister of India cannot find the time to attend the Parliament session, though could not respond to the questions being asked; he could go out of the house and accuse the people who criticized his move as \u2018Black Money Holders\u2019. Media captured when he laughed hearing about the trouble the Indians are facing while he was in Japan, then he melodramatically broke out to stand a chance against the opposition and now he accused the opposition parties as black money holders meanwhile BJP government is afraid to bring political parties under the Right To Information Act. The issue is that, people will support all the good moves taken by the Government or Narendra Modi. His words are convincing but deceiving. The 2014 elections is a good example of the same. To be heard, people do not need to be louder or dramatic; to be heard actions are more than enough. ",

When he was not speaking against them you had problem and when he spoke against them still you have problem. Please clearly state what stand he should take? By the way talking against Pink revolution and Gau Rakshaks are two different things. Pink revolution spoke of large scale production and export of beef which needs to be arrested. Though I am not against people consuming Beef I am totally against of Cow Slaughter for exports. Gau Rakshaks are bolt on Hindhiism. They attack anyone found with dead cattle without understanding the complete facts. Thanks to them people are even afraid to clear dead cattle lying on the road. They've no respect for Cow they are just using the cow agenda to gain popularity. Such act of violence needs to be condemned strongly and Modi did that. Please don't try to politicise by confusing both the things together. ",

When he assumed as PM, his assumption that Gujarat is India and tried to do what he did in Gujarat is a set back. His approach to issues in a autocratic way and disregard to democratic traditions are big draw backs (luckily BJP doesnot have majority in RS). As a politicians he needs to use his oration skills to survive within the party and with the masses but he has to show to India that he is capable of implementing. His big problem is there are too many issues he takes them at the same time and tried to push over every one as he feels 5 years would be over before he could achieve all he wants to achieve. Another I see in him is double act or polarised so to say, one is when he is in the midst of public another face when is among parliamentarians or inside parliament. His monologue and rhetorical are necessary to keep the general public with him but ultimately action speaks thousand words. He want to start everything possible now so that implementation will happen in next two years before he completes five years in office unlike UPA which woken up in last one and half years and fruit of actions (Aadhaar, Jan Dhan accounts, etc) actually benefited the NDA ",

But it also shows his careless use of words and irresponsible character. He is not an articulate person (well that is not a big problem). But he is also arrogant.And ignorant of his arrogance as well.To me this govt. is like a Farah Khan movie, which tops the box office because of star actors having large fan-following. People may say those movies are made for entertainment and people also like it (see how much it earned). I don't have any problem with that. But I would like to see good movies and definitely better people holding top governing posts.He likes to blare out in public and hold 'Man ki Baat' but hardly appeared in a press conference and answered questions. (Except that interview with Arnav and Sudhir Chowdhary!)There was a time when being a politician and being a corrupt person was synonymous with the mental perspective of general people. (I don't want those times to come back, The awareness about Polity and Politics have increased.)But, It disappoints me, that here at Quora, People are O.K with a politician lying and duping people of their votes just because he is a politician and an eloquent speaker.And rhetorics have begun to seem fine and laudable.

He talked about how he would ensure responsive and good governance, and bring about economic development. He categorically stated that these did not need new laws, new Acts of Parl, that these were already in place, and all it needed was good execution. Those were the times when BJP was blocking Parl. Once in power, he changed tack completely. He issued the Land Ordinance thrice in a row since he was unable to get it passed as an Act despite a 60% majority, and because of extremely poor handling of Parl affairs. His GST Bill is getting tripped in the same way as BJP was tripping the UPA-2's Bill. NaMo, as GJ CM was one of the BJP CMs who were dead against it. He is beginning to look like a bag of hot air within 15 months of winning a landslide victory. ",

            "answer_text": "The use of rhetorics in Narendra Modi's speeches is to get his message succinctly across. He has given us some catchy phrases like:  Lions Step,  First Develop India,  Look East but Link West,  Effective and Easy Governance, to Democracy, Demography and Demand , G - All. These phrases create an instant impression and emphasize what Modi stands by.  He traverses a wide range through his speeches from  historical to philosophy to technology , global to local with remarkable ease.   If you are further interested in an analysis of his speechread my post What makes PM Modi's speech stand out  ",

New govt in Bihar is going to get it soon. Rajnath Singh ,the home ministed has reaffirmed, immediately after his party's defeat.His offer of Rs 50000 crores package to JK was also not a rheroric,ask it from Mufti there. ",
