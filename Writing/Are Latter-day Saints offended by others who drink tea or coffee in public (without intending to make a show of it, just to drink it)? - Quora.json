            "answer_text": "TLDR: Mormons don\u2019t mind your coffee. As long as you don\u2019t judge us for saying no. I can\u2019t speak for all Mormons, though I\u2019m guessing that my point of view is somewhat common. I don\u2019t drink coffee or tea, but don\u2019t really fault anyone else for doing it. If they weren\u2019t prohibited by my beliefs, I\u2019d probably be all over it too. Salt Lake City (not my hometown) even has a few hot chocolate cafes, allowing Mormons to pseudo-participate in the attractive caf\u00e9 experience. Most of us don\u2019t care about your coffee. Truth is, we might even be a little jealous. The attitude is a little different about alcohol. From a distance, I see how it could be useful as a \u201csocial lubricant\u201d and occassional escape, and getting soused looks like it could even be fun sometimes. But I\u2019ve also seen firsthand how much alcohol complicates and sometimes destroys lives. A lot of violence, crime, poverty, familial abuse, accidents, death and imprisonment wouldn\u2019t exist without the help of alcohol. And since my life seems pretty great and fulfilled without having touched a drop, I ask myself, \u201cWhy does society seem to rotate so heavily around this stuff?\u201d I mean, if you take the just-landed-alien-researcher point of view, you might realize how heavily our culture leans on alcohol to help us have a good time, as if our brains weren\u2019t capable of experiencing pleasure without it. So to a Mormon, alcohol can be sometimes perplexing, sometimes annoying, sometimes infuriating. But most of the time, it\u2019s just whatever. Drugs are another level entirely. With the exception of marijuana, which kind of sits at or below the level of alcohol, drugs are a no-go. Too much addictive and destructive power there. Which leads to a final point: addiction. Because we don\u2019t drink coffee, tea or alcohol, do drugs or smoke, Mormons are in a position to think that the rest of you people are silly to succumb so easily to your addictions. Of course that would be hypocrisy. Because most of us would be just as hooked on coffee or wine or whatever, and we\u2019d defend it just as passionately, if we\u2019d only ever started. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Seriously, no. We (Mormons) make covenants with God. One of these is known as the Word of Wisdom found in Section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants. You can read it online here: Doctrine and Covenants 89. Non-Mormons, ie: Everyone else on the planet, are under no such covenant and can act for themselves. Many of the answers here point to this already; and likely better than I could explain. So I\u2019ll add a little color commentary from my childhood. For background, I was raised Mormon in \u201cThe South\u201d or the southern United States for our international friends- this is not the Mormon mecca that Utah or Arizona are. I was taught, from probably before I could walk, that smoking and drinking alcohol, tea, & coffee was bad. Story 1 - Coffee: I was a slow learner in school. Reading, in particular, was hard for me to pick up on. I had a private reading teacher for a couple years in early elementary/primary school. My teacher was an \u201cold\u201d (to a 6 year old every adult is old) Jewish woman. She was the best! She gave prizes and had fun, simple books for me to read, etc. One lesson she had brought a mug of coffee out onto her deck to nurse while we had a lesson. Being an ignorant, self-righteous child, I told her it was bad and asked her to please move it where I wouldn\u2019t have to smell it. Yep, that was me\u2026super intolerant, know-it-all, HUGE jerk. She was nice enough to oblige me and only explained the situation to my mom when she came to pick me up. My mom was polite and spoke to me later\u2026part praise for recognizing what it was and that I shouldn\u2019t have any\u2026mostly discipline for presuming to tell an adult anything. Story 2 - Tea: When I was 9\u201310ish I was at a family reunion. This was a yearly event but this year would prove to be \u201cspecial\u201d. Our extended family would rent out a fellowship hall of a community church in a very rural area. My immediate family would travel for close to 2 hours to get from \u201cthe big city\u201d to this, um, undeveloped area. My immediate family and my grandmother were the only Mormons in the family. The event was organized by a pair of sisters that were ancient (note the distinction from \u201cmerely old\u201d). Anyway, part of any good family reunion in the south includes a meal. Picture a meal prepared by Aunt Bee from the Andy Griffith show times about 20. We had lots of country grandmotherly people in that family tree that loved to make people smile. Fried chicken, biscuits, casseroles, and desserts that\u2019d make you drool all year hoping that you could get to them before the other cousins could devour them. Normally, we drank water because when I was younger, my parents would walk us through the line and fix our plate & get our beverage*. This was my first year \u201cfree of the shackles of parental oversight\u201d. So I piled food on my plate and went to get my water. A nice relative that I didn\u2019t know saw me, a small kid, trying to handle a plate so full of food that only a 10 yr old boy could assume he could eat it; kindly stepped in and offered me a glass with something in it. I declined and asked for water and she insisted\u2026so I relented. I was beyond arguing with adults over seemingly small details (see Story 1). I politely took the glass and went back to my seat\u2026and ate like I meant it. After crushing a good portion of the mountain I had collected on my plate, I reached for the glass. I had no idea what I had in front of me so I sniffed it. Not coffee, and no one would give a kid booze (there wasn\u2019t any there but I didn\u2019t know that)\u2026it just smelled kinda sweet. I looked at it again. Light brown, maybe red-brown and sweet smelling. It had to be apple juice! Self assured that I was right I took a big swig and was not impressed. The juice wasn\u2019t very fresh, but it was wet enough for me to keep eating. After finishing the plate of food and most of the glass of juice, my dad came around to the kids table and asked how everything was going. I said something like, \u201cGreat\u2026except this juice tastes kinda off.\u201d He told me what I\u2019d done (remember that for Mormons, tea = bad). I felt horrible that I\u2019d sinned (think Jew or Muslim eating pork accidentally). I ran to the bathroom crying and got sick and lost all that lovely food. *if our family wasn\u2019t eating at home, beverage = water. My parents wouldn\u2019t pay for soda. SUMMARY: I was a dumb kid that didn\u2019t understand that the world didn\u2019t revolve around me. I did and said things that now I find offensive. It is my position that everyone that lives through childhood can probably dig up stupid events where they said or did something that they look back on and think, \u201cIf I had a Delorean, I\u2019d go back and beat the crap outta myself for even thinking that was a good idea!\u201d TL:DR- Non-Mormons are welcome to do as they like. As the question states, \u201cjust to drink\u201d shouldn\u2019t bother anyone. Original Question: Are Latter-day Saints offended by others who drink tea or coffee in public (without intending to make a show of it, just to drink it)? ",

            "answer_text": "Nope. At least I'm not particularly offended, and it doesn't seem like the sort of thing that's worth getting worked up about. I kind of like the smell of coffee, though I've never had any. It pleasantly reminds me of the smell of burning wood, which I have also never consumed. I don't think there's a society on earth that doesn't consume a fair amount of coffee and tea. It's extremely common nearly everywhere. It might raise an internal eyebrow in a heavily-majority Mormon community, simply because it's rare, but you're still unlikely to get bothered about it. Coffee and tea are just not worth the mental energy for taking offense or getting outraged. They're not that big a deal. There's often a few coffee drinkers in Mormon congregations too, and by and large, it's treated like any other mildly unhealthy habit. ",

            "answer_text": "Although I\u2019m sure counterexamples exist, I\u2019ve never heard of a Mormon offended by someone else drinking coffee or tea (although the same isn\u2019t true of alcohol or tobacco consumption). There are plenty of Starbucks and similar shops in Mormon-dominated Utah, and you\u2019ll see your share of Mormons (including baristas) there, often drinking hot chocolate, herbal tea or flavored steamed milk (Mitt Romney is said to enjoy vanilla steamers). And although we in my family don\u2019t drink coffee, we have kept some at home for when coffee-drinking guests come to visit. I can\u2019t back this up with any official studies, but my observations would indicate that most Mormons don\u2019t see moderate coffee drinking by nonmembers as a moral issue \u2014 and certainly not in the same category as alcohol or tobacco. Many do believe it\u2019s unhealthy, but many also see the coffee proscription as related more to obedience or self-discipline than to health. Most who see coffee consumption as a vice recognize that as vices go it\u2019s quite low on the list. It may interest you to know that the church-owned Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii has coffee (but not alcohol) on its menus \u2014 often served by Mormon students from the nearby church-operated university.

As a devout Mormon, I've always been taught that we all have freedom to make our own choices and show others kindness, love, and charity when their decisions are different than the ones I would make. If I viewed, say, you with contempt and anger for drinking tea and coffee (which many Mormons do anyways), then I would be passing a much more serious transgression than consuming an ultimately harmless substance- I would be acting contrary to Jesus Christ's own teachings and judging others for simply drinking something. In short, we really don't mind at all when others drink coffee or tea or really do anything. So long as it isn't directly affecting or harming us or people we care about, then we're completely accepting and loving. I can guarantee that. ",

My 78 year-old mother, a member since she was 13 and long-time temple worker, is meticulous about always watching every session of the semiannual General Conference as it is broadcast live from Salt Lake City. Once I asked her why she is so strict about that. She said that just in case they announce coffee is OK, she doesn\u2019t want to miss it. Coffee drinkers are just normal people doing a normal thing.

I can give you a hundred reasons for why alcohol is objectively terrible for the human body and for society. I still do not get offended at the sight of people drinking alcohol in public. Why would I care about coffee and tea? There are certainly various health benefits from abstaining from coffee and tea, but let\u2019s be honest, there are numerous things that we could have in our health code that would be significantly more beneficial. I think it is clear that we were given this commandment primarily for the sake of developing discipline. That being the case, I hardly expect people outside of my faith to abstain from coffee and tea by default. That said, I do hate the smell of coffee. But that may be because there is a mental connection with my time working at a gas station. ",

There is nothing inherently wrong with coffee or tea, and the Word of Wisdom is just that, a word of wisdom, \u201cgiven to the weakest of saints.\u201d Adherence to the word of wisdom is a simple sign between a believer and God that they are willing to obey all his commandments, no matter how small. Those who believe that God speaks to prophets today as He has always done have the opportunity to pray about and personally determine if the Word of Wisdom in general, or avoiding coffee and tea specifically, is something that has been revealed by a prophet, and if that is something meaningful as a sign to God about such belief. Others drinking coffee and tea are not offensive at all. ",
