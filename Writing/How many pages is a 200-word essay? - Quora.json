            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that 200 words isn\u2019t really an essay. An essay is a specific thing - a form of academic writing that involves a question being introduced, discussed (often with two or more opposing views being explored in detail with evidence presented) and then a conclusion being written. 200 words? You may have something of an introduction to an essay but not a very detailed one. More likely you have a short report on something. Academic essays usually run to min 1K words and often average at about 2K though it depends on how much your tutor is willing to actually read when marking. That means you would likely spend 200 - 300 words on the intro, 200 - 300 words on each of the paragraphs discussing the question and maybe 100 - 300 words concluding. You cannot do all that in 200 words\u2026 I am guessing the reason for this question comes from a concern about the length of the piece of work. Students always worry about size\u2026 OK bad joke there :) But it is true, page numbers and word counts concern students a great deal. Truth is that size does not matter. The reason for the word count/page count limits is to act as a crutch to allow you to develop the skills to be appropriately concise when those training wheels are taken away. You are being limited in order to train you how to work within those limits so you only select what is essential to be included in the work. The problem is that the limit becomes the whole problem and students obsess about getting to the word count instead of writing what they need to answer the question and then editing to fit the count. To answer the question, it is less than a page (around 2 and a bit pages if the question is mistyped and you meant 2000 words) depending on font size etc. However, don\u2019t sweat it - just write the damned essay and worry about the word count and how manh pages it will take up later.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m curious and concerned. You can use Quora, seem to grasp English with some facility, but choose not to answer the question yourself by googling or searching multiple possible search engines. Hmmm-hoping your not too lazy or just rely on any answer. To succeed one needs to extend some effort- quess and check as a minimum. I often confirm my suspicions or reinforce my knowledge by checking availabile sources; and google is available anytime-any subject. I digress. Back to your troubling question (8 others wanting answer to this or similar): words per page or how many pages is 200 words? Well Google says: \u2026no check it urself! I say which could be true or bunk:depends on script size and line spacing. I always print in big block-Big Bird style and so I may only get 4\u20135 words on 3 lines on average. Now I use some big, audacious or capricious terminology so given context of sentence and structure this average can go up or down like lots of things: IQ, effort, interest, fact, fiction\u2026sorry digressing a bit again. ( Did I mention my middle name or pen name?) My style of print would equal 7\u20137 1/2 pages for 200 words. That\u2019s why my style is not published :nor very readable-too much page turning, no supporting graphics etc but easier for visually challenged readers who aren\u2019t too picky or don\u2019t object to my style, content or relevant nonsense.
