            "answer_text": "If you are just starting this wonderful journey of reading START WITH HARRY POTTER. 1st thing that will come to your mind now IT IS for KIDS that's OK all who haven't read it think the same.But don't make it a permanent stereotype.It may have started as a children's genre but in the further books it just becomes more n more interesting. 2nd thing that will come to your mind  I have already seen the movies what I'll do with the booksAgain I'll say that don't make it a permanent thought.Aura of the books is completely different than the movie.If you have seen the movie you'll know the main plot BUT the books has even more (really a lot)  For example an iceberg On above the ocean it seems too small That are the moviesUnder the ocean it's about 10 times bigger That are the books. The time you'll experience reading it alone You'll not feel aloneTrust me it will be like you are part of the book Do one thing Read at least 3 parts ( but don't forget 4th book is where it starts getting a hell out of interesting because the story turns upside down) Rest is your choiceAlso never hurry reading any book(Unless it's a course book)You have whole life You don't need to read as many books as you can but to read the books properly Enjoy every bit of it. Thanks for reading PS if you like the books plz reply me back Also if you didn't like them ",

            "answer_text": "Begin with classics.They are wholesome,sufficient and engrossing enough to lure the interests of beginners. Some authors worth exploring :- Charles Dickens (eg. Oliver twist, Great Expectations)Enid Blyton( If you wish to revisit childhood adventures , she's your answer.)R.K. NarayanAlso, when you are a beginner , you should look for books having simple language but deeper meanings. A few classics suffice this outlook. At last, Have a great reading experience :) ",
