            "answer_text": "I never really understood the craze of logging my boring life in a notebook as if I can debug my life by printing my actions (a debugger woe). I held this firm belief till my student life, that is till the time when my days were all the same with no special occurrences whatsoever. Then came a time when I started working and realised that my days are now going to be a different kind of same. There was a transition in my life and a lot of emotional roller coasters. Did I have the patience to log them? No. Do I remember them? Also, no. Have I grown as a individual? Yes but I can\u2019t track it. Here is the catch! I never really viewed journaling as a life tracker. I saw it as a daily ritual to make your life seem interesting or saying mundane things in a fancy way (like \u201cI did my assignments\u201d as \u201cI laboured 3 hours to reach the finish line of today\u2019s herculean tasks\u201d). It is now that I have realised a journal\u2019s true purpose: To track your thought patterns. Do I suddenly feel like the loser of the century? Is there any evidence attached to this claim? What brought about this thinking? It all can be logged.To record occasional epiphanies. I have ideas. A lot of them. Personal or societal or just plain imaginations I like to talk about to a fictional audience. Writing them is a proof of your own quirkiness (and a handful of data, if ever you want to write a book)To save cunning smart strategies/dialogues. Navigating in life is already very messy but what is messier is if you have faced a particular situation before but can\u2019t seem to remember how you dealt with it (happens with me a lot to be honest) so there\u2019s that.To just rant. A random thought dump is like running your hand along with a pen horizontally in squiggly handwriting until you feel like you have filled enough pages. I won\u2019t say it feels good but it does relieve you.If you are someone like me (short term memory loss candidate) then journaling is great to spy on yourself and have some perspective on past else it\u2019s all just a mix of memories out of which half are conveniently curated by you to feel better.Personally, I don\u2019t try to engage in aesthetics of it like I used to and that is a one less big burden and I just focus on getting my findings on paper. It helps. And might just change your life. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. I start to have journals way back in my secondary school when I was 13 years old. Now I am 26 years old I am still writing although not on daily basis. I find it is theraupatic in a sense that: I note down all the achievements and adventures I had, and when I had a bad day I can just flip through and pep talk to myself, \u201cHey I achieved this and this. Don\u2019t give up!\u201dWrite down all the plans, goals, and targets which I can say that I achieve most of it despite sometimes it may not be within the planned timeline.If I had a bad day, I will just write down to let go the emotions/feelings and at the same time write down on how to solve/ tackle the things that made me having bad day.And if I have a fantastic day, I also write it down! Reading it back would make me smile.Do I encourage you to have journal? Yes! Start small, you don\u2019t have to write everyday. You can start on weekly basis and slowing moving to daily. All the best! ",
