            "answer_text": "Because agents get approximately a billion manuscript\u2019s a day (maybe more), not to mention the work they do with their current clients. There just isn\u2019t enough time in the day to give them all a fair shake, so they take short cuts. Agent says they only take literary romance and you sent them a sci-fi action adventure. bin! (I actually did this, quickest rejection I\u2019ve ever gotten - like under 90 minutes) Didn\u2019t follow the submission guidelines: bin! Started \u201cto whomever it may concern\u201d: If the author can\u2019t be bothered neither can the agent, bin! (or worse you spelt their name wrong) Manuscript is under 70K or over 130k (for adult fiction), maybe if you\u2019ve already made a name for yourself, but not from an unknown (remember they have to sell this to a publisher who will have to front up more to print longer books), unfortunately bin\u2026 Synopsis is too detailed, gives too much away. Author is way too close to the story and may be less open to edits, bin. And all this is before they\u2019ve even gotten to your first page, and writing a covering letter is very different from writing a novel. So even if your actual novel is the a masterpiece your covering letter could still be lacklustre and that\u2019s enough to put people off.   ",

            "answer_text": "Because there are so many of them. The only way to cope is to be quick to reject a project. This means the slightest imperfection is an excuse to dispense with a manuscript and move on. Most slush pile entries are hopeless and over 99% will be rejected, and anyone who spends any time on the 99% will die. Too much time will be wasted. Time is a precious resource. Make sure your manuscript is perfect, particularly the first page. And, make sure your market strategy is well-defined. If there are great reasons you expect success, don\u2019t bury them, present them right away. The key is to stand out. It\u2019s not fair, but anyone screening manuscripts is making snap judgements and trying to get your project off their desk and into the reject pile as quickly and efficiently as possible. ",
