            "answer_text": "No they are not better or worse, just different. This is due to the wine cultivation laws, the terroir, and the varietals, some of which are almost ubiquitous - the merlot grape, for example, and a myriad which are autochthonous: bianchello, biancolello, erbaluce, just to name a few whites. In the lower price points you find perfectly drinkable whites, reds that compete with any other geography. In the mid-high and high pricepoints there are outstanding wines, some of which, the Barolos from Piedmont, age better than some of the French wines. It\u2019s really a matter of taste. ",

Is really impossible to find out who produces the best wine because the wine production are different from one country to other. If you drink a Rivera del Duero from Spain, has nothing to do with a Super Toscano or a wonderful Bordeaux. Just find the one you like the best ",

If it's a 3 Euro Lambrusco vs a Grange or Hill of Grace from Australia, open the Australian and be careful where you throw the Lambrusco away, because it might harm the steel sink in the kitchen. Now an aged Barolo pitted against a \u201cMontagne Sup\u00e9rieur\u201d (masculine form, no \u2018e\u2019) is also a very unfair fight in favour of Italy. So\u2026 \u201cit depends\u201d seems a good, fair and correct answer once again. Italy is a wine country and has been for literally millenia, but so are and have been France and Spain and Portugal and Switzerland and Austria and Germany. And the New World has been pretty good at learning how to turn grape juice into wine as well in the last two centuries. ",

As a result, the reason Italy is so renowned for their fine wines is simply because they have been doing it for so long and have become experts at refining it. Because of their long history with making it, the rest of the world does tend to regard Italy as home to the best wines. ",

The best ones I have found and it\u2019s all about personal taste only, were in Sardinia, and Croatia. As I said, it\u2019s just a matter of personal taste not a hard fact. The Germans make some really great sweet white wines and non sweet. ",
