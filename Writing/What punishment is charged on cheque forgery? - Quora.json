            "answer_text": "The penalty may vary by state in the US. In some, forging checks of $250 or less is punishable by up to one year in jail and a $3,000 fine; but when the amount of the check exceeds $250, the penalty increases to up to five years in prison and a $10,000 http://fine.In One thing to keep in mind is that the penalty does not end after the jail time is served and the fines paid.
