            "answer_text": "i dont think it will die, as a language i find AS3 usefull i like a scripting language with the structure as3 has, i mean, this scripting eyecandy we are promised to get with ES6 is there for a reason and the reason is that larger scale software needs structure to be mantainable.and thats what adobe did with as3, it is mantainable because it is not a simple scripting language, it was made to be build RIA's or what now we call: web apps.Now, the player itself, it probably wont die because it is useful to create X plataform appsbe it for desktop or mobile with the AIR.they are continously working on it, it is not native but it is good i see a lot of posibilities in it thanks to stuff like FLASCC ( c/c++ for as3 )the native extension support,.the starling project i was afraid of flash being killed because as3 is my \"mother language\" ;)but seeing the potential AIR has for X plataform development and seeing that as3 is a nice language to write i dont see flash player dying anytime soon, its pretty good to build apps for different plattaforms. if it dies:a lot of people may have to move to a similar plattaform that lets them build X Plattaform apps. lets hope there are more of this in the future and that those platts are implemented in a nice mantainable language and not just a scripting language. but if you work on medium size projects you probably know some other languages and alternatives.there are some nice projects done in C/C++, java, python ( at least known to me, surely there is one for almost every language ) to build X plattaform apps ",

            "answer_text": "Content that wasn\u2019t updated to use modern web technologies will stop working for non-enterprise users. Enterprise users can leverage Harman - Adobe Partnership to keep their Flash content in the short run but they should still consider migrating content in the long run as Harman doesn\u2019t provide free software for end users, just Enterprise level support. Adobe Animate CC is a reskin of the Flash Authooring tool but I believe it\u2019s still meant as a migration tool more than a Flash authoring content. Adobe AIR support was also migrated to the Harman partnership and their download links only gives yoou the SDK, not the runtime that your end users need to run your AIR apps. IF Flash developers haven\u2019t migrated their apps to web-based technologies in the two years since Adobe, Facebook and browser makers announced the deprecation there are some serious problems, particularly if you\u2019re still relying on Flash and noot the versions of your apps yoou created for iOS.
