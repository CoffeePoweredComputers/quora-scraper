First thought, is it legal in your state to operate a motor vehicle without a windshield? Then other things come to mind, ever catch a bug in your eye at highway speed? Not a problem, I got some nifty RayBan sun glasses\u2026 but it\u2019s night time! and it\u2019s raining and it\u2019s cold out and\u2026. Note to self\u2026 get windshield replaced. ",

But since it had the capability to fold down I could do this, but use eye protection for obvious reasons. That\u2019s the only exception I can think of. (And yes, it was FUN) ",
