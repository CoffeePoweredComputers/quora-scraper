            "answer_text": "Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're asking which is better of the following options:  Create a site on wordpress.com,along with other bloggers.orDownload WordPress from wordpress.org and then build a new site from scratch and have it hosted elsewhere with your own URLI guess one analogy you could use would be that if you were opening a small shop of your own, choosing option 1 would be like renting space in a mall. You control most things like overall look and color scheme etc, but not everything. The mall administration still controls stuff like security, access, common area maintenance, how the utilities are handled, and whatnot. Choosing option 2 would be finding an empty lot along Main Street and building the entire shop yourself, using materials and methods provided by a \"kit\" you downloaded from WordPress. And you can tweak everything, right down to the what kind of doorknobs you want to use.  Option 2 requires more effort, takes longer to learn, but also results in better control. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the website. If you provide some additional information I can elaborate the answer.  For small websites (personal or commercial) a site built on WordPress is the better choice as it is easier to maintain it. There is only one platform you have to learn and only one backend to edit everything on the website. WordPress has grown into a nice CMS and gives many choices how stuff works.  If there are more pages than blogposts, it could be a better choice to distinguish between blog and website. But in that case a different CMS (eg. typ3) would be suitable and there you have again to create a blog inside the CMS.  So the question is rather which CMS suits you best than if you want to integrate the blog in the website or the other way round. ",
