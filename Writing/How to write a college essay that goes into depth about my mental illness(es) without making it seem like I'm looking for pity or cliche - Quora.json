You want to say things that are true, but not things that would count against you in the admissions process. You should consider whether this topic is especially suited to your audience and whether reading it would make you appear an especially desirable student for the school. Your essay might well be interesting, but I would guess it would make your reader uncomfortable and thus reduce your chances of admission, perhaps dramatically. Mental illness cannot be addressed successfully except perhaps with a highly skilled professional writer as a guide. And even then, it would be risky. ",

            "answer_text": "Accessing the self is a valid approach. Case studies would seem normal if those were about someone else. Discount or debunk analyses which are not relevant. Literature is up in the air over whether a talking cure is true, but social symptoms are significant, superstitions less so. Switching to verbal is a way around suffering, whether or not it involves swearing. Empathy is good, more would have been better. At any rate know what the mind attempts when healing itself so modes of discovery are interesting. Awareness is prized, values are another example, as is CBT. Learn how the language unfolds. Thesis and conclusion may be patterns within that. If the intention is to cope, then there would be a way to find the right rules to reach limits and confront the culture. ",
