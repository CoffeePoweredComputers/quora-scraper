            "answer_text": "The best answer I can give is have the reader see the character(s) do, then let the character(s) be. Doing is action, whether it be a race for life, a fight for possession, or climbing a mountain. In doing, the character(s) is/are taking action to proceed toward their goal, successfully or otherwise. That\u2019s up to you to decide. After the action, though let the character(s) rest, reflect, observe, and plan. Get the reader inside each character\u2019s head. Make the relationship between your readers and your characters intimate. This is the time to do it. Vivid portrayals of your characters, and their inner voices and conflicts will maintain the pace. I like to play the \u201cjust when you thought it was safe\u201d game. Just when the character is resting, relaxed, and contemplative, without warning he\u2019s hit by a shit-storm and has to move quickly, for it may even mean his life. This adds surprise to your story that will make the reader gasp, if executed well. Caution: make the 911 frenzy relevant to the story and believable. You have so many options at your disposal. Use the ones that fit your story and never be predictable. Not knowing what\u2019s going to happen next or how a character is going to think or react will leave the reader panting for the next chapter. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of it like planning a trip somewhere. In order to have a good vacation, you obviously need to go out and do things. You want to see great art or go scuba diving or learn to tango dance. In a novel, this is the action of the story. Nobody (for the most part) wants to read a book where the characters just sit in chairs and think about things for five hours. We want to see people fall in love and catch murderers and get into sword fights. At the same time, however, you don't want your trip to be nonstop activity. If you're a smart traveler, you'll build in some time where you can just sit in a cafe with a glass of wine and process all the experiences you're having. In a novel, these are the down time parts of the story, where we just get to spend some time with the characters and understand how they're feeling. To borrow an example from film, many of Miyazaki's movies are famous for this--there will be long stretches where the characters are just together on a train or eating a meal in silence, and the viewer has some time to simply be in the world with them--before moving on with an exciting story, of course. An example of a movie with poor pacing, in my opinion, is Star Wars: The Last Jedi. At the end it features numerous battle scenes, one after the other, not leaving the viewer any time to rest and reinvest in the characters. I for one just felt exhausted by the end. When you're feeling more confident with it, pacing can be a powerful tool for controlling the reader\u2019s experience. Moby Dick, for example, has a famously tortuous chapter about the science of whales--it forces the reader to wait and wait, experiencing the endless tedium of life on a whaling ship before getting to the big climax. Other stories--such as thrillers or erotic novels--thrive on the energy of non-stop action. Think about how you want the reader to feel as they go through the journey you're planning for them. ",
