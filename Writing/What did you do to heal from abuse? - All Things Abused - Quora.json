            "answer_text": "I am still new on my road to recovering from narcissistic abuse and I am starting to see the significant impact this abuse has caused in my life, especially regarding my individuality. my thoughtsmy behaviormy speechmy ability to judge people and situationsmy personal hygienemy memoryI started reading more about NPD and quickly found myself almost obsessing with educating myself on what had happened to me. Abuse is extremely confusing for the victim and more often than not we will question ourselves instead of the one who is abusing us. This is why it is so important to educate ourselves so that we can understand that we were not the ones at fault and that we are worthy of love, respect and our individuality. I am now moving on to the next step of my recovery by reading up about what I am experiencing as a result of the abuse I went through with. This is very hard for me, it is devastatingly heartbreaking to recognize and relate to the undeniable hurt and suffering, broken and torn hollow shell that has been left behind by the soul eating narcissist. I am on the lookout for a psychologist but I am very cautious about this, as this is the stage where I will be given tools to help me cope with everyday life and situations. Thus it's very important to choose correct. Ask questions before you choose a psychologist eg. Are you familiar with NPDAre you a victim of NPD abuseDo you have experience in recovering from this specific abuse.I wish you all the best in your recovery! It works if you work it, So work it, YOU ARE WORTH IT! ",

            "answer_text": "I did a number of things to heal from abuse. I did not know until later in life that I had been abused other than verbal and emotional. In a sense my whole life I sought answers, therapy, EST, and more therapy, then al anon. But it wasn\u2019t until my last narcissistic relationship that I woke up and healed deeply the trauma bonds I had formed with my father. I set about to heal as quickly as I could since I was not young anymore. I started looking at healing methods and started putting together a book. I continued seeing my remarkable therapist. I wrote the book and followed my own advice as I went along. It took determination, faith, love, letting go, persistence, help from above, overcoming fear and anxiety, and many techniques, both energetic, spiritual and emotional. Some of them are releasing practices, and others physical like walking in nature, yoga, meditation, pet therapy, mindfulness, making a daily gratitude list, praying and believing things would be all right, healthy friends, eliminating negative people from my life and many more practices I wrote about. Within a year or so, I felt like I did deep healing and forgave my father, and all past ex\u2019s who were narcissists. I became whole, joyous and free. ",

            "answer_text": "Healing from years of abuse It took me years. when I was in my early 30\u2019s I started acting out becoming verbal, and pushing my wife and child around, being severe in discipline which was unlike me. I recognized I was acting like my dad who had abused me for years. My wife, daughter and I sought out therapy and with the help of Jesus Christ and 5 years of digging very deep into my past. I grew to understand the root of rage and hurt that drove me into the cycle of abuse. I stopped and grew into the man GOD intended me to be. It is not easy be well worth it to find the roots and cut them out. ",
