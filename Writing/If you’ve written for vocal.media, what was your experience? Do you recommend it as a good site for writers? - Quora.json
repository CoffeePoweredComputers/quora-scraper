            "answer_text": "Yes, I wrote one simple article to test it out and despite submitting it, it never went forward. I wanted to test how visible articles on this site was and what means were provided to generate traffic. It looks like a good site. However, article writing is a lor of chug and plug that can generate cash but you spend a lot of time going nowhere. It helps if you pay to submit your articles to submission engines and have them promote your work, based on my experience at Yahoo! Contributors and various other article sites. At this point in my career, article writing is a distraction from writing literary essays, a market I would love to break into. My focus is on this. It is what I went to school to do. Articles that are newsworthy are the most profitable. Writing them is excessively stressful. Articles on other subjects like technology, science and politics tend to pay well, but it is not what I'm doing. Vocal.media is having an essay contest that I'm interested in contributing to, I hope I have time to do it. I don't know if anything I write for this will generate cash, but the challenge is worth doing just for the doing. I hope to be more involved but with my current workload, I don't know. It would help to have a pyrpose for being on the site. Like a promised book publication. ",
