            "answer_text": "It starts with understanding that not every writer is a great writer, even professional ones. Couple this with the word author deriving from the same root as authority \u2014 meaning that the value of an author is more about her/his originality and creativity of thought as it is her/his writing ability. I\u2019ve worked with fantastic thinkers who aren\u2019t very good writers. And this brings us to editing. Even the best of writers need an editor. And the worst of writers badly need an editor. The collaboration between writer and editor is where the magic occurs. Excellent writer-editor partnerships are what you are typically experiencing from the most acclaimed of writers; sadly, the editors get far less credit than they are due. Typically, the writer brings a wonderful jewel to the world, but it\u2019s the editor who polishes it to a marketable and award-winning shine. A broader way to look at this is a relationship of creator and improver. This is what produces the magic across many forms of art and communication. Professional speakers have speaking coaches. Musical acts have producers. And writers/authors have editors. Essentially, the goal of the improver is to provide visibility to the creator\u2019s blind spots. In any form of art or communications, these blind spots include emotional attachment to the creation, repetition, wordiness, lack of cohesion or focus, unresolved pieces, and much more. Now, the problem\u2026 Whereas the creator is quite often very willing to work on spec (speculation\u2026 no guarantee of income), the improver is usually for hire and not working on spec. To bring this back to book publishing, a solid and professional editing job on most any manuscript is going to run well into the thousands of dollars. It is almost always the most costly part of publishing a book. Sometimes a book project will even involve multiple editors. (Here\u2019s a great article on the different types of editors, as well as the difference between and editor and proofreader.) So, it\u2019s very common for a self-publisher (also called an author-publisher) to: (a) have no awareness of the importance or even need for an editor, (b) not have sufficient money to pay such a person, or (c) both. This is especially true if this is the self-publisher\u2019s first book. And so, these books \u2014 by the masses \u2014 make it into the market. Likewise for books that are not just badly written (and thus badly or not edited), but also those that are badly designed, laid out, and typeset. But what about books from established trade publishers? Yep, these can be \u201cterribly written\u201d as well, although at a rate far less than that of self-published books. I\u2019ve found that the sweet spot for most trade-published books to be those from mid-size publishers. Small indie publishers usually still struggle with the financial investment of a book. They make it work, but sometimes the writing is not quite stellar. As a result, the focus is often on bringing books to market that are outstanding in some other way \u2014 uniqueness of thought, targeting an underserved niche market, an author with great potential, a highly creative book concept, etc. Conversely, with the largest of publishers, many book projects get lost in the cracks. Simply put, if you\u2019re an authors who low on the totem pole at a major publisher, you aren\u2019t going to get the editorial attention that Stephen King\u2019s or Barack Obama\u2019s books will get. Sure, you may get a great editor, but you may not. It\u2019s kind of like the doctor you\u2019ll see at a large medical practice: a crap shoot. Mid-size publishers, on the other hand, often have an ideal combination of resources and attention to each project that produces a quality result more often. Last, all of this was answered excluding the very real possibility that \u201cterribly written\u201d to you is not to someone else. Not long ago, I heard someone say the Harry Potter books are badly written. Umm\u2026 no. The writing just doesn\u2019t connect with you. That\u2019s not bad writing; it\u2019s just a bad fit. So, keep in mind that writing is also extremely subjective. Likewise, some writing isn\u2019t meant to be astonishingly good. Nonfiction author Robert Kiyosaki often jokes that he always wanted to be a best-selling author, not a best-writing author. And I doubt Dan Brown ever got too depressed that his mega-hit The DaVinci Code was often critiqued as having the writing of a fifth-grader. So, part of what makes writing good is knowing how to connect it to the intended audience, which may very well not be \u201cgreat writing\u201d by some people\u2019s standards. Once again, this is a big part of the value of a writer\u2019s secret partner \u2014 the editor. Thanks for the A2A! [Answered: Why are there so many terribly-written books?

Tell us what you have a problem with, and we can better answer what you\u2019re trying to ask. I\u2019ve heard bunches of people complain about Dan Brown\u2019s writing, but clearly, a whole heck of a lot of people LOVE his writing. \u201cTerrible\u201d is very much in the eye of the beholder. For instance, I rarely find a literary novel I like, yet there are people who will only read it. If you\u2019re saying there are a lot of books out that are ungrammatical and constructively unreadable: correct. But nearly all of those will be self-published books, because it\u2019s so very easy these days to put a book out for free. MOST self-pubbed books are good! But there are a pretty significant number that needed either to not be published at all, or have significant editorial work done to them prior to publication. ",
