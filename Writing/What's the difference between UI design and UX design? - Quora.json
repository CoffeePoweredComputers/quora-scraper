            "answer_text": "I'll give you two answers: one is academic and one is practical. If you're short on time, feel free to skip to the practical response.  :) Academic Response UI Designers\"UI\" stands for \"User interface\". Traditionally, that means the actual buttons, text, and pixels that appear on the screen. So the UI designer would be responsible for everything about how a web site or application appears in the interface - this would include visuals (e.g. \"Are the buttons pink or blue?\" \"Do they have gradients or are they flat?\") as well as overall architecture of the page (e.g. \"We should put the Sign Up button at the top of the screen because it's the most important thing\").  UX Designers\"UX\" stands for \"User experience\". This is a much broader and higher-level discipline than UI, because it includes not just the interface, but also all the systems and interactions that support it. For example, the UX designer should care about what happens when a frustrated user calls the help desk as well as how pixels appear on the screen.  Interestingly enough, because this role can be so high-level, sometimes the UX designer usually won't pay so much attention to pixels. Instead, he or she will work with either a visual designer or a dedicated UI designer (maybe a junior person on his/her team?) to polish the visual execution of the user experience. Practical Response Clearly, there's overlap between these two roles in the academic definition. In my experience, most businesses use the terms UI and UX interchangeably. The definition of the title depends entirely on the company.  Generally, what they mean is: the UI/UX designer is a person who is responsible for strategizing, organizing, and executing an interface that accomplishes that company's business goals. Depending on the team, this might include any combination of the following deliverables: User researchOverall strategic directionWireframes & prototypesVisual designs applied to the wireframes/prototypesUsability testingService design (rare but increasing, thankfully)Front end development (sometimes)TL;DR  It really depends on the company, but most folks in the industry use the terms interchangeably.

            "answer_text": "The ketchup bottle analogy is wrong! Stop referring to it! It\u2019s a misleading way to define it, so I\u2019m going to correct this.  Bad analogy - Part of UI (User interface) in this example is the appearance (shape, material, visual design) of the bottle, which is applicable to both, so saying the bottle on the right is UX and not UI is incorrect. There is an experience in using both bottles, so to say the first bottle is UI and not UX is also incorrect.  This is the correct illustration of the actual difference between UI and UX at a basic level. UI is the user interface. The interface is what we use to dispense the ketchup, which in this case is the glass bottle. It is the shape, the material, and also includes visual design of the label. UX is the overall experience of using the ketchup bottle. Using the squeeze bottle would provide a better user experience because it is easier to use compared to shaking it out of the glass. This is a basic definition. Why do I say this is basic? That\u2019s because UI has a much deeper element which cannot be separate from UX, and this is something more designers need to realize. I\u2019ll explain why. Most refer to UI as the look and feel, layout, font, etc, with emphasis on the visual factor, which is not incorrect, but it is incomplete. In this case, the visual factor of the shape and material of the bottle determines how we actually use it. The appearance of the squeeze bottle being upside down also teaches us how it should stand naturally, and that we should hold it in a more unconventional upside down way. If the label was designed poorly, we might get a poor impression. This means that UI actually impacts UX. Because of this, UI is also a part of UX, and cannot be entirely separated from it. Many designers try to draw a definitive line between the two, but that is actually the wrong way to look at it. So understand on a basic level, UI refers to the visual appearance while UX refers to the overall experience, but on a more advanced level, UI is also a part of UX, and cannot be separated entirely from it. \u2014- I\u2019m also going to teach you this as part of my personal philosophy- The best designers do not try to define the boundaries between UI and UX, but conquers them instead. They do not think in limited forms such as being a UI designer, or a UX designer exclusively, but can assume formlessness and be both, and much more. Keep this thought in mind, because the more you can do, the more competitive and successful you will be. This is the principle of formlessness, my personal design philosophy which I wrote a book about.
