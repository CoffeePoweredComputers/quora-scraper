            "answer_text": "For what it is worth, Dante indicates Mohammed to be in Hell. He is seen in 9th ditch of the 8th circle Hell, the 28th Canto of the Inferno, that first part of the Divine Comedy. Therein it is said contained more agony and blood than in all the wars of earth combined. All loped off limbs, cloven faces, divided entrails, and bodies \u201cburst open from the chin to where one farts.\u201d Ripping open his own chest, Mohammed tells Dante: \u201c\u2026Look how I rip myself! Look at how mangled is Mohammed here!\u201d \u2026 \"And all the others whom you see down here Were sowers of scandal and schism while They lived, and for this they are rent in two.\u201d (Inferno 28:30\u201331, 34\u201336)  Mohammed is shown to be in Hell by virtue of his iniquitous deeds. He, as a sower of discord, created schism in the very fabric of the peace of Christendom. He cleft the Blessed Trinity of the Godhead in two and called it unity. And for this fraud, he is himself is bisected and mangled in so many ways. These souls with Mohammed here are divisors of church, state, and family. They defrauded the unity of God, and disjoined what God intended as to be one. For Jesus prayed for these Mohammedans too, as it is written: \u201cI pray\u2026 that they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.\u201d (John 17: 20\u201321) And threefold Mohammed did this, in religion, in society, and in family. Indeed, for Mohammed by his sect, clove the worship of the One Triune God in twain. He sowed discord in the state, and sectioned away the very Holy Land, the inheritance of the Christian people, and despoiled the Eastern Churches and those of Spain. And by the sword he destroyed the family of Abraham, and set again, one brother against the other. And for this, being cut off from the living was not enough. Dante gives good reasons for Mohammed to likely be in Hell. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither, at this point. Judgment Day has yet to come. As to where he\u2019ll end up: it would be sacrilegious to guess. While it\u2019s true that no one comes to the Father except through the Son, it\u2019s also true that God saves who he saves, and vice versa. If I only had to go by Muhammad\u2019s beliefs at the time of his death, I\u2019d say Hell, save overridding intervention by God. That\u2019s because he called Jesus a righteous prophet, but not the Son of God. If he and the Jinn he purports provided assistance in the writing of the Quran knew as much about Allah as they purported to, they would have concluded that Jesus was God\u2019s Son. An intimate knowledge of God only comes from truly walking with Him. Had Muhammad walked that walk, he would\u2019ve seen the nature of God in the actions and story of Jesus Christ. He could\u2019ve done this with pure logic, and with no faith at all. But, not only did Muhammad fail in this regard, in no wise in his writings did he ever express the ultimate heights of love as does the story of Jesus. He nailed God\u2019s righteousness and purity and judgment and justice, but he missed the substance of what God is: love. We read in the Bible that during Jesus\u2019s death, between the time he was crucified on the cross and the time he was resurrected from the dead, that he preached to those who died in the wilderness in the world of the dead. That means that there is hope after death. Who\u2019s to say how Mohammed has spent the last 1500 years in death? Maybe he\u2019s a Christian. ",
