            "answer_text": "Let me begin by saying that the comments that follow assume that your rejection followed an interview. If the process didn\u2019t get that far, it probably won\u2019t even get past their spam filter. If you\u2019re going to send a thank you note, there has to be something you can say thank you for, doesn\u2019t there? But let\u2019s assume you did at least get an interview. Even though it\u2019s always a disappointment not to be offered the job, a thank you letter is going to go down well, Ales. Let\u2019s look at why it\u2019s a good idea. To begin with, they won\u2019t be expecting it because very few candidates will take the trouble to do so. Secondly, they were sufficiently impressed with your resume/C.V. to offer you an interview. In that sense, it wasn\u2019t a rejection. You can thank them for that can\u2019t you? Sending a thank you note leaves an impression that you\u2019re a person with a positive attitude who can handle being turned down without getting all bitter and twisted about it. There\u2019s every chance that they will keep your name on file for when they have another vacancy in the future. Finally, to make sure that your thank you note doesn\u2019t get spam-filtered, I\u2019d suggest sending it as a letter addressed to your interviewer rather than email. ",

So few people even bother to do the bare minimum courtesy of letting someone know they weren't hired, and it actually takes some time on the part of the person who sent you the rejection letter, so I think it's worth acknowledging that they did something they didn't strictly have to do for you. So I'd just say, \u201cI'm disappointed of course, but I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to let me know.\u201d This does two things: it acknowledges the effort they put in, and it will probably help you to feel that you're being classy and taking the high road.

We went back to the candidate who had sent a thank you email and hired them.  They were great! If it had not been for that thank you email, we would probably have readvertised the job. People always appreciate being thanked and while it might not get you the job now, you might find that if you apply to them in the future, your name \"stands out\" to the hiring manager and you get given another shot.
