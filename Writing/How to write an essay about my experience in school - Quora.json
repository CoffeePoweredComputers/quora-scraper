            "answer_text": "Do a brain dump first. Get a pen and paper and start thinking. Take your time thinking and when your mind is filled with a lot of random thoughts and subjects, start writing. You don\u2019t have to be organized, it doesn\u2019t have to be about any particular subject. It can be as random as possible. Just think and write and continue until there\u2019s no thought left in your mind. Once you\u2019re done with that. Do something else, let your mind rest and let it reset. Shift your focus. That\u2019s because your mind needs a bit of distraction. Once you\u2019ve diverted your brain from this essay. Come back to it. It\u2019ll come up with a fresh-er perspective. Now, you can check all the thoughts, organize them, review them and edit them. Go through the editorial process, take your time and organize everything. With the organized list of thoughts, you can write up a bunch of headings. Write the headings in your preferred order and then all you have to do is expand on each heading. Without even knowing, you\u2019ll end up with a pretty nice essay that has all the things you want to write in it. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to decide what kind of experience that you want to talk about first. This can be anything, such as an inspiring or embarrassing moment. If you can remember the experience well or perfectly, it just adds on to making it an easier essay to write. Then, brainstorm and write the essay. The order you can go with is the following: Chronological: Beginning to end. Set the events up by the sequence of time in which they occurred. Importance: Start off by the order of the events that was most important to you, and explain the events that built up to that specific event. ",
