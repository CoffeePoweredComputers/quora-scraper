            "answer_text": "Sure, cannabis can help stimulate your creativity. So can going for a run, a sip from a nice scotch, or even a conversation with an old friend. The point being, anything can be used as a tool in the creative writing process. That being said, cannabis offers many benefits that can help with writing when used appropriately, and some shortcomings that can become a hinderance when used excessively. When writing, I enjoy concentrates and uplifting strain options as I feel that I have more control over the creative process with these choices. While I love smoking cannabis flower, I find it to be more recreational and relaxing, even if used in an energetic setting, than I do other mediums. Edibles and concentrates with uplifting terpene blends ensure that I won\u2019t fall asleep on the couch when I\u2019m trying to work. As a writer, cannabis helps me narrow my focus, intensifying my attention to the subject at hand and the voice of the piece. This can be incredibly useful in freelance and ghostwriting situations as you attempt to write from someone else\u2019s perspective, tone and personality. It can also help you table topics and distractions that impede your ability to focus on your writing. We all live chaotic lives full of obligations, rewards, goals, relationships, and the unplanned, which all can make it hard to sit down and put pen to paper, especially in a creative format. Cannabis can ease you into that mode and allow you to enjoy the task at hand with minimal distractions. Most would agree that cannabis can stimulate your imagination as well. When your bran is processing cannabinoids, it often \u201cconnects the dots\u201d in ways you might not have if you\u2019d chosen not to smoke. \u201cHigh Ideas\u201d and the concept of \u201cstoned\u201d thinking have a basis in truth as cannabinoids are mind-altering and can allow you to think in new ways and of new ideas. It\u2019s well documented that many individuals that are hailed as visionaries, especially in the technology field, have experimenting with cannabis and mind-altering substances as a way to allow them to think differently about their situation to come up with unique, breaking edge ideas. All of this should be taken with the grain of salt that cannabis is not for everyone, and the positive effects of cannabis are seen through moderation and effective titration. If you take a puff and realize cannabis isn\u2019t for you, don\u2019t try to consume more thinking that you \u201caren\u2019t there yet\u201d or that in larger amounts the situation might change. Similarly, if you enjoy your cannabis experience, know your limits and consume accordingly; use it purposively to enhance your efforts without consuming so much so that it hinders them. If you notice certain strains or types of cannabis that you prefer, such as edibles or concentrates, selectively purchase options for both personal enjoyment and creative use, respecting the variety of applications that the different cannabis plants can offer.

            "answer_text": "I am a professional writer/editor and I use cannabis daily, but I had to learn several lessons to get to the point I am at today. Not all strains are created equal in terms of creativity. I\u2019ve mentioned this other answers - I actually spent a good deal of time experimenting with different strains when I entered the legal industry in Colorado. I have a notebook where I would test different strains, write down their effects, how long it took to onset, how long the effects lasted, and if there were any side effects. Part of my process of this experimentation included attempting to write a paragraph while I was \u2018under the influence.\u2019 Here\u2019s what I learned through my assessments: Hybrids worked best for creativity for me. Strong sativas usually made me too racy to focus, while heavy indicas distracted me and made me foggy. For me - any derivative of OG Kush is a creativity killer - I couldn\u2019t write to save my soul after smoking this strain, lol.Limonene is a God-send for creativity. If it smells of lemony, citrus goodness - I am all in. I can bang out 1000 words in no time with a little boost from this essential oil.Anything with a high CBG content is uplifting and energizing.Also, although it\u2019s wildly debated whether Hemingway actually said it or not - but \u201cWrite drunk, edit sober\u201d is good word of caution. If you write under the influence of anything - for the love of all that\u2019s holy (speaking from experience as an editor) - USE YOUR GRAMMAR CHECKER!!! Or at least read it back to yourself later, have someone else read it, or just have Word read it back to you, so you can \u201chear\u201d it from another voice. Chances are \u201csober you\u201d will hear it differently than \u201cstoned you\u201d did while you were writing it. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I think it depends. I published a story that came from drinking in an old barroom in San Francisco. It is a pretty good story (I think) with some visceral impressions of the bar and situation. I don\u2019t recommend anyone drink constantly while writing, but what are you trying to accomplish? If you are writing about the people who may drink too much, you can\u2019t really go there unless you have had a few instances of being drunk, that\u2019s my opinion. I was sitting one time at a dinner with a guy who has had a well-known book in print constantly since the 60\u2019s. I told him, \u201cI used to think I was creative, but I discovered I was just f\u2014-ed up.\u201d He seemed to find this humorous if no less true. I am able to get in touch with the parts of myself that are less than flattering. Yes, I do think I am creative, but getting in touch with my weaknesses is important. Drinking may be one weakness. I have never been addicted to alcohol or drugs, but I do have an addictive personality. Frankly, I think no great character in fiction has ever been written that does not display weakness. So, does alcohol boost my writing creativity? Not at present but it has in the past. Just don\u2019t overdo it or get involved in underage drinking, alcoholism, or drinking and driving please. ",

For Christmas one year, I was probably 18 or 19, we didn't have money so we made each other Christmas presents. She made me a journal. The front page a carefully hand designed cover with hole punches and pretty twine to hold the paper to it. I was thrilled! I wrote in that thing daily. I packed it in a box and it sat for a couple of decades before I rediscovered it. How excited I was to find it and read the poems from the younger me who was always in love and always writing about so many things! That's what happens when you smoke too much weed. Your memory goes to shit. So there I was sitting on my couch thumbing through pages and pages and endless pages\u2026. \u201cGot high with (insert name) today.\u201d Pretty much it. Over and over again. Wtf I thought! I wasn't the least bit creative! I was just high and that's it! Very disappointed.

            "answer_text": "When I composed this answer, none of the other answers mentioned the crucial issues of dose and constituency.  The outcome will be dependent on how much marijuana, which variety, its form and how it's administered. For thinking outside the box, a tiny smoked or vaped dose (say 50 mg of the dried flower, a match head sized portion) of a low myrcene, high-THC cannabis variety that produces a little pinene and limonene makes for an excellent creative stimulus for writing, especially if that variety produces a little CBD (comprising around 10% of its total cannabinoid content.)  A 50 mg dose of this type of cannabis flower when smoked should deliver around 2-4 mg of THC, which is the threshold of psychoactivity.  The class of cannabis variety commonly called Haze, derived from Colombian, Thai and Mexican landrace genetics is ideal, (though contemporary Hazes contain little CBD, so it can be added by taking a tiny dose of oral CBD tincture).  Understanding the basic pharmacology of cannabis enables a user to tune or fashion its effects, especially when dose is carefully monitored.  I find the hyperfocus and increase in associational thinking from low doses of specific varieties of cannabis to be of great assistance when writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Its 6 AM in the morning and I am working on my next story. I write short stories and have just started with writing full time. i am compiling a series of short stories encapsulating different professions of different people I have come across, during my lifetime. Recently I interviewed a friend of mine who is an avid trekker and mountaineer. I asked for his experiences and did a bit of research of my own. Everything went south when I started writing. Having had only a few experiences of myself in trekking, it is a difficult task getting into the mind of a professional one, and create nerve-binding narrative and intricate storytelling out of it. Chronicleboat.wordpress.com So I turned to my best friend of years. Weed. The paragraph that I had written at 6 in the morning, considering it my most productive time, turned into 2 full pages and they were with dialogues which I usually despise as a writer. The marijuana actually helps you in concentrating on the topic and the storytelling. It brings beautiful nuances out and helps you pen them down. Every now and then you may deviate from coherent storytelling but that is just reversible collateral damage. Not a junkie, not n addict. Just a functional stoner. ",

I'm going to write my Stairway to Heaven!\u201d My sister and I sat and smoked a fuckton of pot. 20 minutes later, we were sat across from each other freaking out about how we looked exactly the same. She starts laughing then I started laughing because I knew that I must look how she looks when she laughs and for some reason, that was the most crack up thing that has ever happened to me. Following that, we just stared if into space, starting thoughts that were never finished. We would try to have a conversation but the pauses went on for so long that we forgot what we were talking about. I didn't write my stairway to heaven that day but I did eat a packet of Doritos so fast that I kept forgetting it got ate and kept looking around to find my bag of doritos that I was sure I had. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know if it makes you a better writer. But in my case, at least it made a more productive one. I used to work as a reporter for a local newspaper, and my job had three big parts to it: coverage of local events, a column on politics and a coln on local \"sociological\" issues.  When I first started, I could only do the first since it required almost no creativo effort. I judt had to be at the events, and write down what happened. Getting the two columns was sort of a promotion; now I could finally write freely. Thing is, when I got this, I would spend most of my time thinking about the column, and coverage job started to seem excruciatingly tedious. After a few months, so did my columns. There were times when I just couldn't find any joy in what I was doing, my job became mechanical...it was all just a long agony of dullness and repetitiveness. Marijuana helped me, as it made able to find joy in such dullness. When stoned, everything would become interesting, so I could write about anything. I hardly believe this is the answer you were looking for. Writing, sadly, is not always a magical and creative process. Sometimes it's work, and it's dull. And MJ can help you make it a bit more interesting. As it would do with any other job, I guess.  ",

But it is almost impossible, and should not be done if you want to do it properly well, to follow a line and build up a final product.Because you get tripped in thoughts and it is more hard, it is actually struggling, to carry on the same thought. There is no continuity between thoughts, or at least is harder to be, because when a new thought arise I find myself so interested in that new one that I just follow it.  It is not a drug to use when you have to be concentrated on something specific.Marijuana, as hallucinogenic drugs, make you very concentrated but you can't decide the subject. It changes all the time. ",

They once said in an interview that, if you know anything about being high, it's that you don't get a lot done. The biggest myth about writing is that \"creating an idea\" is difficult. After years of practice, the ability to create a great idea is trivial. The other part of the equation, the discipline to sit down and flesh it out, is actually the hard part. I also want to point to Kevin Smith, who does get really high and creates stories. Interesting fact about Smith, though, is that he didn't smoke much pot when he was starting out. He talks about this in some of his podcasts. It wasn't until after he became a disciplined storyteller that he started smoking a lot of pot. So I want to reiterate, once again, that the difficult part of writing is gaining the discipline and patience required to follow the story to its logical conclusion. ",

It's not so good for final draft work, because you're not usually as focused. It gives a pleasant flow of new and different ideas, but it's hard to really hammer out one single idea fully, because you'll be in the middle of it, and then some other idea will be prompted that feels just as good, and you need to jump to write it down before you lose it. Marijuana is kind of a bad substance for sticking to one predetermined rigid task. Can be a nice way for a person to brainstorm the start or the initial notes of new pieces. Not so good for finishing at polished production quality. ",

After filling the pool with there victorious sweat, they finally made it to the I.S.P. Following is a glimpse when an Indian Army Soldier was struggling with his emergency message recorder, which Indian government introduced when the families of martyrs demanded for the last words of their deceased family member. He said: I \u2665\ufe0f you all. We were shot by these pakistanis. Ahhhhhhhhhh . I just want to say that avenge me. Bharat Mata ki Jai. And the same message boiled up the blood of the Indian Army, and the Secret Service guys were extremely angry at this hypocrite country, especially those \u201cbrothers from another mother\u201d. They decided to avenge their closed one, nonetheless their motherland, India. They planned and they went out to kill those bloody enemies. Hehhhhh , no body was left, each and every one of them were killed. And so our soldiers celebrated this victory under the hood. After collecting the reports, they started coming back to \u201cApna Bharat\u201d. Suddenly one of the soldiers stepped on the bomb below his feet and . Everyone was popped up in the air. And our soldiers slowly-slowly fell into the sleep of death. But wait.... , the brothers anyhow survived this fierce attack. When they opened their eyes, they both were admitted to two different hospitals by the Kashmir\u2019s Army. Because one was already filled, so one had to go to different hospital. They both were treated but hey hey hey... they both lost their memory. Nahhhh... nothing.... they were completely confused about what was going on. Well, one was so seriously injured that he was then shifted to Australia\u2019s hospital. A few days later ... the one who was in Kangaroo\u2019s country. Something stuck his mind, a blurry scene flashed out his memory. It disturbed him for days and days. He ran out of the hospital secretly as he somehow did remember the parts of training received by him at the Indian Secret Agency. And he leaved the hospital so far, so nobody can\u2019t even find him. He worked for a farm for years, sweating all the day. But he didn\u2019t give up on his secret agent abilities. He decided to join Australian Army Force. The other half of the story was in India, after getting healed day by day. He later re-joined the army. But the same problem, he too didn\u2019t remember anything not even the skills he learned. But he determined so that he could become the big show of the group. And it happened. But the same blurry scene flashed out in his memory. In the midst of world war News reporter: It is so sad to hear about the death of thousands of soldiers. No country isn\u2019t even thinking to back off. My friends, this seems to be the last world war fought among countries. Good bye and stay safe. Australian Army, as being possibly the biggest army in the world, tried to take over the world. After beating each and country, they got mad, that they did not even think about their friends. And they landed on India, possibly the last and the 2nd strongest nation was alive. Australian army secretly found a way to Kashmir and after choosing the best possible plan, they started firing on Indian army. But as being the strongest contender from both the armies, the brothers chose to go on their own. They ran fiercely, and caught each other armies fighting. They both went to kill each others soldiers. While in the midst of running, the same scene eventually stuck in their mind when they saw each other running after the army. They both stopped at the place. Some fuzzy thing started running across their mind. They both wondered, do I know you bro? And yes.... nobody knows from where, but memories busted in each others' mind. From childhood to the point where they last survived the attack when they both worked for the same secret agency. At least for them, noise just went away. It was a very special and emotional moment for them, they started crying, they dropped off the weapons held by them to kill each other. They ran and hugged each other very tightly. They cried a lot, like then, they felt like complete. Suddenly from nowhere an already threw grenade dropped near the brothers. As soon as they could realize, the bomb busted out and once again they met the same fate which then brought them closer to their deaths. After shedding the last few drops of tears and blood. They hugged, not each other but their ultimate end. This was the story which I wrote when I was on \u2601\ufe0f 9 ",
