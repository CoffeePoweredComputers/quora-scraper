            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny, I have just stumbled upon this question after yesterday stumbling upon a recent interview between Stephen King and George R. R. Martin, in which Stephen King answers this very question. Stephen King manages to write 6 pages a day! I know\u2026 daunting isn\u2019t it. It makes sense though, doesn\u2019t it? How else would he be able to pump out as many incredible novels as he does if he wasn\u2019t writing so much every single day? (He does also mention that yes, he does indeed complete his 6 pages EVERY DAY.) I\u2019m not sure whether you\u2019re asking this question out of pure curiosity or if you\u2019re looking to learn from the greats.Regardless of that, do not be intimidated by this and think that you must match it. Every writer is different.Some may write 1 page a day, or 6 pages a day, or half a page a day.Others (like myself) may be more comfortable doing a fixed amount of words every day. Whether that be 100, 200, 500, to 1000.It does not matter how little or high you go, as long as it works for you! I MUST, however, stress the importance of completing your daily quota every day! The power of making writing a daily ritual/habit is massive! If you can create a solid writing routine, schedule, time, and daily quota then you will be spewing out quality writing left write and center. Just don\u2019t be intimidated by the greats. Focus on yourself, and take one step every day. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be one of those greats too! ;) Hope this helped xD ",

            "answer_text": "Stephen King seems to be one of the most prolific writers of all time. His novels can be extremely long and wordy, so one would think he would write an immense amount of words daily. However, this is not always the case. In his book On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft, King speaks on his writing speed. He would set a daily goal of about 2,000 words. This would add up to about 180,000 words in three months of writing. He also said that three months was the maximum amount of time it should take someone to finish a first draft. If it takes longer, it will get tougher and tougher to delve back into the story with the right frame of mind. In addition, King can often become involved in marathon writing sessions. He wrote The Running Man in one week.
