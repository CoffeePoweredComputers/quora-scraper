            "answer_text": "Using online plagiarism checkers could be a safe bet, although these won\u2019t check if your idea for a story has already been used before. For that, simply Googling a phrase or sentence (that you feel represents your story best) would suffice. But as long as you\u2019re able to defend yourself against accusations of plagiarism (read: don\u2019t plagiarize) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem if your story sounds similar to someone else\u2019s. Harry Potter and Barry Trotter are about the same thing; that doesn\u2019t take away any of their merit as stories, individually. Most American sitcoms and Indian serials have the same stories. That doesn\u2019t mean people don\u2019t watch (or read) them. There are very few writings in the world of which humankind can truly say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 else like it!\u201d so write away! ",
