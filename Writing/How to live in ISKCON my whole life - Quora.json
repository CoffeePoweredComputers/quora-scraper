The purpose of starting this organization by Srila Prabhupada is simply to spread the message of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who is non different than Lord Krishna Himself. His message is to revoke our lost link with the Lord, to make us revive our lost consciousness through the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare! So whether you are a student or a householder, it does not matter. Please start chanting the holy names of the Lord and read Srila Prabhupada's books. Visit your nearest ISKCON temple or center and associate with the devotees there. Take prasadam. By connecting yourself with ISKCON, you will live with ISKCON. Once you associate with devotees, they will explain the temple programs and various other services where you can be involved. Hare Krishna ",
