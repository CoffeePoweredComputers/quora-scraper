However, they do not provide the required exposure and neither do the talented writers get rewarded. I recently found an app online named Kalaathon - which is a virtual stage for people who wish to share their talent and also stand a chance to get awarded with exciting cash prizes up to Rs. 5000 on a weekly basis! Kalaathon is a talent network where you can create amazing content and showcase it to a massive community that share similar interests. There are a lot of artists in the world that goes unnoticed. You can showcase your writings, quotes, poems, shayaris, etc. through pictures as well as videos in your voice.

You can download the app from Kalaathon - Best Talent Sharing App - Apps on Google Play. For more information, you can visit their website Win Cash Prizes Online! Cheers!
