            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. When writing a novel, do you start with the characters or the plot? It depends. If you get an opportunity to write a Power Rangers story(not fanfiction) ( I am picking Power Rangers randomly because I never have and suspect I never will), do you start by thinking about characters or plot? You may think you are starting about characters, because that\u2019s what you know you are going to write, but chances are you are starting with plot, trying to find something interesting for those characters to do that hasn\u2019t already been done. Or are you? Did you start with the idea that the story would be about the Yellow Ranger because he\u2019s your favorite? Then maybe you started with characters. Personally, when not writing a media tie-in (yes I have, no, it wasn\u2019t fan fiction), I tend to start with neither plot not character. I start with REALLY COOL IDEA. Then I see if I can make a plot out of it. Or, sometimes, I wonder what kind of character would be in the middle of that REALLY COOL IDEA and that will help me create plot based upon what that character will do. Those usually turn out pretty well. It\u2019s kind of like starting in the middle and working backward and forward until the story is done. I have started with what I thought was REALLY COOL CHARACTER. That didn\u2019t work out so well. Not horrible, mind you, but, meh. I may revisit someday if I get a really good idea/plot idea for that character again. I may not. I have started out with REALLY COOL PLOT. More than once. Those worked out better, but, again, meh. Forcing characters into plots causes problems. They don\u2019t want to follow the script you\u2019ve lain out for them, they get REALLY COOL IDEAS of their own and try to do that instead. Then the plot starts to feel \u201cshoehorned\u201d into place. All in all, I don\u2019t think there is a \u201cwrong\u201d way to do it, there are just ways that work better for some people. I hope that helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle said to start with plot, and let that dictate character. Lejos Egri said to start with character and let that dictate plot. Thomas McCormack, in The Fiction Editor, points out that writers actually start out in all kinds of different ways. He gives plenty of examples of writers that you know and admire starting in wildly different ways. In the movie Rounders, Matt Damon\u2019s reads cards well enough that he can tell everyone at the poker table what they\u2019re holding. That fascinated me, but the movie didn\u2019t explain how he did it. So I decided to write a story in which someone\u2014someone smarter than me\u2014does that. If I write the story, explaining how the character does it, then I\u2019ll know myself how it\u2019s done, right? So that\u2019s how I started that story, neither plot nor character, but situation, a single plot point in a larger story. Then I created this plot where a woman\u2019s husband gambles away their mortgage payment, so she has to learn to play poker and manipulate her way into a men-only game, and win back the money her husband lost. She\u2019s really mad at him. So then I created the woman. Who can she be? How stable is the marriage? Will she stay with her husband after he\u2019s been this irresponsible? Will she instead go with her husband\u2019s boss, the guy who made him play poker and then bankrupted him because he didn\u2019t have a poker face? Or will she go back to her old college boyfriend who wants her back? What kind of woman can be torn in this way? What\u2019s her backstory? Who is her confidant, the person she tells her secrets to, so that the readers can know what she\u2019s thinking without an omniscient narrator? What history makes her so forthcoming with that person? And who else is in the game? What are they thinking? How does she know what they\u2019re holding? Then the big surprise. They say, \u201cNo surprise for the author, no surprise for the reader.\u201d In the big hand, the climax, when she\u2019s raised the stakes so much that if she loses, she and her husband will have no house, no car, no money, no valuables. They will be flat broke. She glances at her husband and sees that he trusts and admires her. She\u2019s been angry at him for risking too much on a poker game, but he absolutely trusts that she\u2019s doing the right thing when she does that. She forgives her husband, right in the middle of the critical hand. The story, see, wasn\u2019t really supposed to be about that. But it turned out to be so important that I didn\u2019t even finish playing out the hand. I jumped to the final scene, where the players show up at her house, which she and her husband still live in, so she must have won the big hand. All of which means that I had to go back and develop the anger plot. When did she get angry? What is the changing texture of the anger? If the climax is when she gives up her anger, then all the other major plot points have to be about that too. In the next draft, it has to be a whole new story. Which means that maybe I don\u2019t put in a lot about how she reads people\u2019s cards. And that\u2019s okay, according to Anne Lamont (Bird by Bird). She says that when your story is done, you are supposed to take out the original seed that it grew from\u2014but which no longer fits as part of the story\u2014and put it back in your toolbox so you can use it again. That seed, she says, is your life\u2019s work. All of which is just to illustrate that you can start any way you want, as long as you start. By the time you\u2019re ready for the second draft, it may be a whole new story anyway. The Fiction Editor will tell you the dangers of different initia. If you start with character, you should check to see whether you ever developed an engaging plot, for instance. ",
