            "answer_text": "Creating a profile on Fiverr is quite simple though time-consuming. It has a good user interface but if you\u2019re still stuck on some steps there are many videos on youtube for guidance. After getting sorted with all the initial steps, the harder part is getting gigs on Fiverr. There are a lot of seasoned writers on Fiverr, so you would be competing with them. In order to beat them you need to understand what do they offer and how much do they charge for it. If you are starting out, you must charge lower in order to get gigs and get reviewed by customers, once you\u2019ve gained enough reviews the work shall pour in with automation. But the main part is patience. When I started out I got my first writing project on Fiverr 25 days after my profile listing, and after that, there was no looking back. Now I have created a team of experienced writers, at Impulsechitra we help budding writers improve their writing skills and provide them with the guidance needed to get projects and work with full freedom creating a career line for the worthy.

            "answer_text": "Your question does not with your skill. This is not what I want to share with you but seems like you need one platform to start and settled. Don't get offended from my first statement because you should believe in you and what you have. I understand the situation is not as good as earlier. Stay focused and you will earn a good amount of money from freelancing. You should register more than three freelancers website. Always Remember, skill is everything to have a better life. Go on youtube and watch some videos to register on fivver or more other websites. ",

            "answer_text": "Create a gig which has a price at the lower end initially and once you start getting assignments you can increase your price. Also, try to add at least one feature in your basic plan which almost all other people (from your service) are providing in their advance gig. This can attract customers. It worked for me! Honestly speaking Fiverr is not a good place to work as they delete your account with any stupid reason, any moment of time. I can only advice you to not stick to one place for freelancing. All the best! ",

Just visit every seller gig and check what they are offering in what price, then think of something better you can give clients. Once you are done with the R&D just try to create your own gig. Happy selling :) ",
