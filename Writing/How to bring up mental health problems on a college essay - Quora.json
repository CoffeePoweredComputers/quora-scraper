            "answer_text": "Cautiously. Have someone familiar with school policy and procedure and the ADA look it over carefully. Your mental health issues are confidential and should stay so as much as possible. University officials might be sympathetic, but it is not wise to count on this. If you have a disability from a mental or physical illness, the school is forbidden by law to discriminate against you and must make all reasonable accommodations to help you get your work done and graduate. This may well include a reduced class load. Certainly talk to your physician, and consider consulting an attorney familiar with ADA regulations and laws before submitting anything in writing. This being said, the University may be understanding and helpful, but in case they are not, you should be familiar with your rights and get help from someone with experience in these kind of situations.

            "answer_text": "From your question, I assume you already are a student at that college. You are in one major, which you could continue to pursue, and want to transfer to a different major. For example, there are many colleges for which a Business major is only for juniors and seniors. Everyone must major in economics or some mathematics and then as a second term sophomore they must Apply to transfer into the business school. In that case you will probably be Rejected, because you have not taken sufficient courses. You may have to stay for an extra year, and \u201crepeat\u201d sophomore year and then apply next year for two years in business. Typically if there is an application process, it is because that major is generally oversubscribed and the college has to limit the number of students in that major. If that is the case, by taking only one class this past Fall, you have eliminated yourself from contention, no matter what the reason. Therefore, plan on staying for an Extra year at your college, continue in your current major and then petition to transfer next year. All the best. ",
