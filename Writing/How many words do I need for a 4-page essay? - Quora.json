            "answer_text": "A four-page essay, depending on the size of your handwriting or font. will take approx. 1000 words. If you have been asked for one such, may I suggest you aim for 1050 > 1100 words? But absolutely no more than this. To be slightly under 1000, say, 950 words, is a length more likely to suggest to the instructor/professor that you struggled to get to the end and then gave up. Perhaps you found something more interesting? To serve up say 1050 words is more likely to imply that you went over the limit (however reluctantly) because the title/topic interested you. Too, imagine the teacher is taking the family out to the movies, time is running short and he/she is struggling with that rather long last sentence you wrote \u2014 as the kids are screaming and shouting, jumping up and down in the hall in their impatience to get to the Lion King on time! Your name will be mud! Good luck and enjoy the essay. ",
