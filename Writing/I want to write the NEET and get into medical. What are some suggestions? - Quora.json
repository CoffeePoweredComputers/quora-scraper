            "answer_text": "Getting into a medical college is not a big task. All it requires is consistent efforts. Almost every person you ask would suggest you work hard for the exam but a very few would suggest you to work smart. Working hard is no doubt beneficial but working smart is anyday better. NEET consists questions of Physics , Chemistry and biology. A total of 180 questions divided in 45,45 and 90 questions respectively. I'll try to share some points where you could work smartly and boost up your ranks and your chances of getting into the medical college:- Don't try to master physics or chemistry unless you've mastered biology. Biology is the most scoring subject and comparatively easier than the two. Many students compromise biology for the sake of performing better in physics or chemistry.Solve as many questions as you can. Reading text is great but not solving enough questions would be a sin. Since most of the questions in NEET are repeated from previous years questions.Revise abundantly. One of the most common mistake students do is not revise topics regularly. Don't do that.Stick to the syllabus and don't read unnecessarily. You have a limited period for the preparation so during those time don't study unnecessary things.Apart from these, Eat healthy, take proper sleep and excercise atleast for half an hour to get your mind work at it's optimum. This point might sound cliche but is the first step in preparation.All the very best! \ud83d\ude0a Peace out! ",
