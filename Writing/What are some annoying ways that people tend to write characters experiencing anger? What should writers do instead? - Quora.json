            "answer_text": "Nearly all the furious CH I have read about immediately spew their rage in alll directions, shouting, cursing, throwing things, drawing guns. You get a definite sense that the CH is mad, but almost with the next breath they settle down and the story goes on. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s annoying but it is prevalent. This kind of thing leaves me unsatisfied. If a CH acts/reacts like that, I get the sense that something has happened that is annoying to them. Do you? Of course you do. OK, they get mad, spout off and quickly calm down and the story goes on. Almost at once I begin to question their reaction. If their rage diissipates so quickly, how important can it be, really? I would much rather see the CH smile, walk away with their rage pushed down under pressure, where it seethes unseen until it bursts out in some form of violence. I feel much more in tune with their emotions that way. The best example of this is the CH called \u201cthe judge\u201d in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian \u2014 a beautifully realized CH. Throughout the story the judge is scorned, mocked, reviled over his habits, yet he never retaliates \u2014 that is, until the end. The judge taught me that not every emotion needs to be blatant to be felt deeply and lastingly \u2014 a valuable lesson. ",
