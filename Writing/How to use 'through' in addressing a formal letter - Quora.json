            "answer_text": "How can I use \"through\" in addressing a formal letter? Without some context, this question is meaningless. If you clarify what you really want to do, you will probably get an answer that is actually helpful. My closest guess is that you might be addressing a letter to a particular person but wanting that person to pass it on. In both usual cases, you would not normally use the word, \u201cthrough\u201d. If you are addressing a letter to a specific individual \u2014 say, to Mr A Planner \u2014 within an organisation, but the letter should first go through the organisation\u2019s filing systems, you would write something like The General ManagerLitchfield City Council42 Bent StreetLITCHFIELD 2990Attention: Mr A Planner (You can abbreviate Attention to Attn.) Similarly, if you were writing to a particular officer regardless of who that officer is, you might substitute that position, so: The General ManagerLitchfield City Council42 Bent StreetLITCHFIELD 2990Attn: Senior Development Control Officer The other common situation is where you want one individual to pass a letter on to another individual, where you usually use c/- or c/o (meaning care of): Miss Jenny Plannerc/- Mr A Planner7 Duisburg DriveLITCHFIELD NORTH 2990 Similarly, if you wanted to invite Mr Planner to a Parent Teacher night, but only had his work address, you might address it Mr A Planner, Senior Development Control Officerc/- Litchfield City Council42 Bent StreetLITCHFIELD 2990 (The italicised description is optional, but could be handy if the Planner family is a big one in the Litchfield area, and you don\u2019t want a letter to Andrew Planner to go to his Uncle, Alf Palmer, one of the Council clerks.) Another way in which you might use a preposition \u2014 though \u201cby\u201d, rather than \u201cthrough\u201d \u2014 is if you are sending a letter using a particular means of delivery. This is of little importance these days, as most distance mail is delivered by air, but you might want to add a box at the top of an envelope containing the words, BY AIR MAIL or just AIR MAIL on the top left hand corner of the envelope. This is more likely to be an issue if the Post Office is offering some unusual means of delivery. If they are promoting the sesquicentenary of some traditional means, you might write BY CARRIER PIGEON However, it is probable that the Post Office would offer a sticker containing the same words. I hope that somewhere here your question is covered. ",
