            "answer_text": "You can ask for gift cards but do it with taste. My wedding clientele is mostly upscale and they never include any information about gifts / gift registries and such in their invitations, whether it\u2019s for their bridal shower or wedding celebration. If guests ask and want to give something, the information is communicated personally (by the couple or the parents) in person, by phone or via email. As other Quora users stated here before me, you shouldn\u2019t assume that people give you gifts however, it\u2019s customary. Just don\u2019t make it obvious for them. ",

And traditionally, the person being showered opens the gifts and carries on about them. That\u2019s kind of pointless with gift cards or money. And it\u2019s always rude to ask for money, I don\u2019t care what Honeyfund tells you. Everyone needs something; that\u2019s why there are registries. If you truly don\u2019t need a thing, then don\u2019t have a shower. Problem solved. ",

There was a shower I attended where the couple asked for gift cards to Home Depot. They had been living together for a few years and moved into an older home that needed some work. They had household things that one needs to begin a life together. Honestly, I would have rather just given them money, but I gave the gift card requested ",

But, remember the tradition started when older women helped brides get set up in housekeeping by giving them practical gifts that they knew were needed. Never be so presumptious as to tell others what to give you for a gift. Be grateful that people came to help you celebrate. ",

Better to let the person know who is throwing you a shower to spread the word for gift cards through friends and family who will be attending the shower . Also it\u2019s bit anti climactic to watch someone opening gift cards for their presents . A few are fine but all gift cards ? ",
