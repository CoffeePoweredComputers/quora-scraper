            "answer_text": "I\u2019d be very cautious and reluctant to reference an unattributable source. If you are using a .pdf put out by an organization with no specific author noted or identifiable, you cite the organization, date of issuance and reference or version number - but even at that, you still have, in effect, cited an author, the organization. But, if there is no way to identify or associate the .pdf with anyone or anything, that gets tough. I suppose, on the other hand, if you have, for example, a trove of historical documents, one of which has no identifiable source, you could always reference and cite the trove or collection of documents. The more I noodle this over, the more it gets convoluted for me. I think the honest and most direct response would be to say that I have not had to do that before (citing a document with zero capacity to attribute it to a source) and go back to the first sentence in my answer: I\u2019d be very cautious and reluctant to reference an unattributable source.

There are ways to cite works with unknown authors, often it\u2019s done by just putting ellipses or a dash where the author\u2019s name would go, or parenthetically : (author unknown). ",
