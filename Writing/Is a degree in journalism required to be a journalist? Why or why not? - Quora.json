            "answer_text": "No, but it helps. You should at least take enough courses to pick up the basics, however, and if you actually want to get a job with a news organization, you'll need either a degree in journalism, some pretty significant published work, or family in the business. That said, some of the best journalists I have known did not have degrees in the field. A couple were economists and one was a sociologigist. Several have been lawyers. Several decades ago, I was taught -- by the then-president of The Associated Press -- that it was a good idea to gain some expertise in the area one planned to cover. I tried to take classes in criminology and psychology as well as majoring in journalism, did a few ride-alongs with police officers, then spent most of my career covering business and finance. Oh, well. I guess that's a roundabout way of saying you should learn the basics. Interviewing, reporting skills, copyediting and proofreading, ethics, and here in the U.S., First Amendment and copyright law are all good areas to have a solid grounding in. Today, you need to understand copyright commons and how online media comes into play. Are tweets copyrighted? What's the legality -- and more importantly, the liability -- of quoting from WikiLeaks and Wikipedia? When are they, and their brethren, credible or quotable? So yeah, there's a lot to know. Good luck and thanks for the A2A! ",
