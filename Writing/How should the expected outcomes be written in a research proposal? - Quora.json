In this way, the expected research outcomes can be expressed holistically as: research that expands the current state of knowledge (at a certain cost)evidence for or against the hypotheses with the scope limitations of planned research methodexploratory findings that may yield new insights or lead to other researchpotential impact on policy or business (e.g., outcomes or new opportunities for individuals, businesses, institutions).",

Your expected outcome is to achieve \u201cA\u201d, but you need to write it in such a way that the significance is emphasized. So, if your goal is to make a more powerful rocket booster, your outcome is a more powerful rocket booster that will get us on the way to Mars, etc. Note that in your background, you may have discussed the need for enhanced space travel, for instance to Mars. So there is some repetition here. ",
