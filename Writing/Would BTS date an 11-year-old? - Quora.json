            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what brought your question up but i\u2019m not keen to knowing,,, And the answer to your question is a solid, 100%, No. The members are all in their 20\u2019s, Seokjin the oldest being 26(international age)/28(Korean). Age gap being about roughly 10\u201316 years, I don\u2019t know about their preferences about age, but I don\u2019t think they want such a gap even IF the person was of legal age. And honestly dating a minor, an elementary student/middle schooler would be deadass pedophilia and certainly very illegal. I hope you\u2019re not the 11 year old, and if you are, I\u2019m not gonna blame a child for dreaming about being with their favorite idol no matter how wrong. But just know even if you woke up one morning teleported to Seoul, speaking perfect Korean, suddenly changed to look like one of the members \u201cpreferences\u201d and suddenly had a chance to meet BTS, they\u2019re going to treat you like a child and nothing else.

            "answer_text": "The short and not so sweet answer is NO. The reason is because all of the members are in their twenties including the youngest Jungkook is 21 years old and the eldest is Seokjin who is 26 years old and with an age gap of 10 years or more it is highly unlikely they will date you even if you are of legal age.But if you are 11 and expect them to date,it won't happen sweetie because paedophilia is illegal and them being gentleman are aware of that and won't ever indulge in it.
