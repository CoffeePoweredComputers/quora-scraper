Which is it? Do they or don\u2019t they? Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s the latter. If that\u2019s the case, what about using the standard contraction for have (\u2018ve)? So it would be seems to\u2019ve. That\u2019s what we do it in other scenarios where the contraction isn\u2019t terribly common, e.g. shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve. ",

You write \u201cseems to have.\u201d If you really feel the need to write a contraction to show how the speaker is pronouncing it, you would write \u201cseems to\u2019ve.\u201d However, this is not standard English. Almost all English speakers would pronounce it the same way and everyone understands what they mean. ",
