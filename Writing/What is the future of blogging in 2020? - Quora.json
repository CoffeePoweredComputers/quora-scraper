            "answer_text": "You may be wondering whether right now is a good time to start a blog. Maybe you\u2019re facing unemployment or perhaps you\u2019re looking to create a change or even second income for yourself, and you\u2019re trying to imagine how a blog with passive revenue might help. And while I would like to tell you absolutely \u2013 I obviously love to blog and have helped thousands of bloggers get started and make improvements \u2013 if I\u2019m being honest, the answer is actually \u201cprobably.\u201d You should probably start a blog in 2020. Probably \u2013 not because of blogging itself, but more about what\u2019s best for you. Despite claims that no one wants to read long-form content, or that all content will be delivered via video, the fact is, Blogging is still a viable and effective medium for creating content and building an online business, even today.You can follow my guide on \u201cHow To Start A Blog\u201d to get help with the technical aspects like setting up hosting or WordPress, but that already assumes you\u2019ve made the decision to go forward. What if you\u2019re still wondering? What if you aren\u2019t sure whether your idea for a blog is really filled with as much potential as you dream it is? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you had a checklist or worksheet to help you figure out if your blog plan has merit? For that matter, do you need an actual plan? (Hint: if you want to make money, that means your blog is a business, so yes, you need a business plan.) So to me, the question of \u2019should you start a blog in 2020\u2019 is answered by taking a close look at your idea for a blog and doing some homework. You need to take the time to research your idea and verify that it has potential, both from an interest and a revenue perspective. Every day people are starting new blogs, new podcasts, new YouTube channels. Some of them find success, yet many fail. ",
