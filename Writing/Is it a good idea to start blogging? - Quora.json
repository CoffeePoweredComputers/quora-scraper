            "answer_text": "Why you should start your own blog. I really hope that the list below will encourage you enough to take action. Should I start a blog? It depends. Here are 11 things to consider before you start a blog. 1. Blogging is Easy Yep. Blogging is actually really-really easy. The hardest part is setting it up but I\u2019ve fully explained it on my homepage. If you are able to write emails, then you are also able to run a blog. Want to learn how to start a blog? With WordPress, you don\u2019t have to deal with any website creation or HTML that is time consuming and boring. The only thing you need to do is customize your blog with themes, add some cool plugins and write content. Once you get the grip of it, you will know exactly what to do. 2. Google Loves Blogs When your blog is ready, Google crawls your pages and it will be listed on Google search. It means you will start receiving additional visitors from the search engines. Isn\u2019t that great? Search engines help to bring new people to your blog that can become your new friends or future business partners. 3. Blogging Makes You a Better Person Having a blog will surely make you a better person. Why? Well, blogging obviously improves your writing skills as well as communication skills. You will start thinking more intentionally about who you are and who you want to become. Furthermore, when you send a job application, many employers look for employees who have blogs and write openly about their life and opinion. So it would be a definite \u201cplus\u201d for you. 4. Blogging Helps Other People You can spread your information and knowledge through blogging. Heck, you can even help other people with specific problems. Let\u2019s say you have blog about \u201cmother care\u201d. There are many women out there who are looking for help/solutions/ideas to raise up their children. Your knowledge or advice could be essential and very helpful. The same thing goes with any other blog topic. EVERY blog helps other people in their own way. I remember when I started to get emails saying \u201cThanks for providing such valuable information\u201d. It was very heart-warming and I still remember the feeling! 5. You Can Make Money with Blogging You must have been heard or seen people who are making a lot of money by just blogging. Yes, it\u2019s possible to monetize your blog. It takes time, but once you have enough readers you will start making some small, yet passive income. When time goes by, your traffic numbers will increase as well as the income. I\u2019m not only talking about some few hundred dollars a month, many people earn their living from blogging. I remember when I created my first blog that had almost 300 unique visitors per day at the end of the year. I spent many hours creating blog posts and adding new fresh content. I sold it for $2800 and it was my first money ever earned on the Internet or as an entrepreneur. In fact, I\u2019m still very proud of it and that\u2019s the point where things started for me. 6. Self-promotion and New Opportunities When you have a blog you basically have a \u201ctool\u201d or a \u201cchannel\u201d to promote yourself or make you look like an expert. You\u2019ll be amazed how many people start to respect you and I know many cases when employers actually contact blog owner directly to offer working positions or joint venture opportunity. This will open you a lot of doors that you might have not been aware or dreamed of. 7. Use Blogs To Stay in Touch Active people tend to have less time to sit on Facebook or any other social \u201cchat-room\u201d. Again, blog can help you to keep in touch with your friends, colleagues and relatives. They can easily read everything about your activities, ideas and success through your blog. Be wise and use this as a communication tool. 8. You Can Make World a Better Place When you have a blog, you actually have a voice. This means you can spread out all the things you like or don\u2019t like. And those things can help you to change the world. You have probably seen some blog articles or posts that have gone viral through Twitter and/or Facebook. Once they do that, they will get a lot of attention. Here\u2019s an example story how two young girls launched a blog post that helped to change their school conditions. For your information, they were only 9 and 13 at that time. 9. Blog Can Help To Grow Your Business Does your company have a blog? If not, then you are missing a lot of it. Blogs can impart a lot of things about your company. For example, your potential clients can read interesting stories about your company success, ideas, strategies and even new products that might turn them into regular paying customers. That\u2019s a huge opportunity that lot a of small and big firms are not using. Furthermore, companies who blog have 97% more inbound links (which means more traffic and visitors). 10. Blogging Can Become Your Hobby If you have too much free time and you are constantly browsing on the Web then you should really consider starting a blog. You will soon get addicted to it (in a good way) and you will start learning a lot of things. So if you are bored right now then what are you waiting for? You will get a lot of good and new experiences, there is nothing to lose. 11. Blogging Helps to Improve Writing and Argumentation Skills (extra) Back to the time when I was in college, my grammar, communication and argumentation skills were really poor. But these are very universal and necessary competences in everyday life and also in professional career. Blogging has had a huge impact on my writing skills since I started. Although it\u2019s not perfect, I feel myself a lot more confident. The more you write, the easier it becomes. Blogging is quite new but there has already been done research about blogging and enhancing writing skills. Some interesting facts There are approximately 130 million active blog readers in the US right now.90% of companies who blog daily have acquired at least one customer (probably much more) through blogging.80% of the US online consumers trust the information they get from blogs.61% of US online consumers have made a purchase based on recommendations from a blog.Blogging is most popular in age group of 20 \u2013 35 year old. It\u2019s over 50% of the total blogging population.Source: Internet Search ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Forget the \u201cbuild a business\u201d or \u201cmonetization\u201d aspects for now. Blogging is an amazing way to improve your writing, explore areas of interest in depth, learn the basics of website management and SEO, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly, develop clarity of thinking. Specifically, blogging develops at least 5 skills: Improves your writing \u2014 Most people cannot write well. By committing to a blog and sticking with it for at least 6\u20138 months, your writing will improve. The practice of writing blog posts \u2014 and the added pressure of making them public \u2014 is the practice of an invaluable craft. Keeps you current \u2014 No matter how passionate you think you are about a certain subject, there will be days (and even weeks) when you aren\u2019t inspired to write. Here\u2019s where the habit and consistency of blogging kicks in \u2014 it will force you to read more and keep current in your topic so you have ideas for additional posts. Teaches website management \u2014 No matter what platform you use, be it Wix, Squarespace, Wordpress, etc. publishing blog posts will force you to learn the basics of back-end website management and SEO \u2014 perhaps even HTML and social media marketing as well. Builds a portfolio \u2014 At the end of the day, you own the content of your blog \u2014 no publication or platform can change their algorithm or delete your posts. This is particularly true in social media marketing \u2014 hard to be a Vine star today when since its owners opted to close it down. Blogs provide ways for you to not only express your thoughts and (potentially) build an audience, but also build a portfolio of original work at your pace and on your terms. Improves your analytical skills \u2014 Writing blog posts require you to clearly organize your thoughts, write persuasively and edit ruthlessly \u2014 these are skills that spill over beyond mere writing into other areas of thinking and analysis. So yes - I think you should start a blog. Play with it, commit to it. In a year, you\u2019ll be amazed at what you\u2019ve built. ",
