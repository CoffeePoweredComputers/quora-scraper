            "answer_text": "Actually, the author below is partially right, but she missed a few important APA rules. When there are 3 or more authors, the first time you use that citation you will write out all authors last names only, up to 6. If there are more than 6, you write out the first 6 last names followed by\u2026and the final author\u2019s last name. After you have written out a citation with all authors listed, THE FOLLOWING time you use that source in the paper you may use the first author et al. For example, Let\u2019s say there are 9 authors to a paper you would write (Smith, Jones, Wright, Stevens, Errie, Pool\u2026Roads, 2020). Roads is the 9th author in the list, the ellipsis indicates there are other authors in between. From that point forward in your paper you will write (Smith et al., 2020) or \u201cAccording to Smith et al. (2020) blah blah blah.\u201d If there are less author\u2019s than 6 it would look like (Wright, Jones, & Stevens, 2019). Notice in a parenthetical citation, that just before the last author one uses an ampersand (&). If the first citation was used in a signal phrase, such as \u201cWright, Jones and Stevens (2019) state blah blah blah\u201d \u2026then one does NOT use the ampersand, but use the word \u201cand\u201d instead. I remember this rule by thinking \u201calways use words in sentences and symbols in parenthesis\u201d. Once you have listed all authors 1x in a paper, from that point forward you always write the first author et al. as seen here: \u201cWright et al. (2019) states blah blah blah\u201d or (Wright et al., 2019). If you want fuller explanation of this, see the \u201cPaper rule\u201d in the document The Easy Way To Master APA Paper Writing in 30 minutes or less . This document explains all the most closely followed rules of APA and it is written with lots of examples. ",
