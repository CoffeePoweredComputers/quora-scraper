            "answer_text": "\u201cThat being said\u201d is used at the beginning of a sentence when you want to indicate that what was said before is relevant to what is being said in the sentence. Some examples of this are: Yes, the chair was red. That being said, the chair wasn\u2019t the prettiest shade of red. I had absolutely no problem with Stacy. That being said, I don\u2019t think she would go out of her way to help me when I am in need. All the bookmakers had him as the favorite for tonight\u2019s match. That being said, I personally think the underdog has more than a chance of taking home the grand prize. ",

            "answer_text": "You definitely will not need to write \u201cthat being said\" in a formal document. Usually you see references to things stated earlier as \u201caforementioned\u201d, \u201caforestated\u201d, \u201cabove mentioned/stated\u201d, and other pointers to show something was stated or mentioned earlier. Principally, you will need a voice conversation or address to be able to validly use \u201cthat being said\". I totally agree that \u201cthat being said\" has a tone of authority to it, the sentence tends to impress a palpable show of assertiveness. There is however a way to sneak it in if you are so bent on having it in your writing, simply report what a speaker who used the sentence has said, a quote from a transcribed speech, or a dialogue in a novel, an interview whence the interviewer/interviewee is quoted and voila the magic is done.
