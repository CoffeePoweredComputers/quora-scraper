            "answer_text": "Before you get to how, you need to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d Why are you doing this? What\u2019s the goal? To present your family? To commemorate a deceased family member? To tell a story? There are many whys and you have to pick one. Then, you can start to address the how. for example, your goal is to tell a story about your deceased grandfather. You can start by saying he died and to revisit the past with an event from your youth where your grandfather stepped in to help you. Or maybe the first time you met him (but you do want something with action and progress. Coming to drink tea with him is boring) Then you progress over the years what grandfather meant to you and how he changed your life or made them better (or god forbid worse?) by showing more events and your reaction to them. The climax is you hearing about his death during your day and how life will be now for you. This is just an example for the goal of telling a story about your deceased grandfather. What is your \u2018why\u2019? Find it and then act on it :) ",

            "answer_text": "Start with details that you can publicly write about, both good and bad, without embarrassing them or you. Do an interview with as many family members as you wish and then cull the issues you find irrelevant to the design of your essay. Keep in mind the length of the essay, especially if it\u2019s a class project. Different teachers and profs want different things in your essay, make sure you have clear understanding of that as well. Writing is fun and IF you stick with it, you\u2019ll be amazed at how far you will go. ",
