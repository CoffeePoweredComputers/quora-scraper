            "answer_text": "I think that's fantastic! It's great that visualisation works for you. However, people are different. This can be seen from an online search around visualisation or just about any other topic. From such a search it's obvious there are many different views rather than universal agreement on any particular view, approach, fix and so on. If there were such universal agreement search engine algorithms and machine learning would make this instantly obvious. Therefore, while visualisation works for you it may not work for other people. The amount of effort it would take to objectively prove that it actually works for you would be enormous. However, such proof doesn't really matter unless you propose that visualisation is the one and only best way for every human to achieve what they want to achieve. If you were proposing to convince others that this is the best way you would need a response when asked, how do I know for sure you have in actuality visualised everything that you wanted to achieve and you have actually achieved these things?
