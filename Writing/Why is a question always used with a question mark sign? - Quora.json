            "answer_text": "To understand why the punctuation mark ? is used after a question, we need to understand how this particular punctuation mark came into existence. To understand the question mark and its use, it's helpful to know that in grammar, a question is a type of sentence expressed in a form that requires (or appears to require) an answer. Also known as an interrogative sentence, a question\u2014which ends with a question mark\u2014is generally distinguished from a sentence that makes a statement, delivers a command, or expresses an exclamation. History The origin of the question mark is shrouded \"in myth and mystery,\" says \"Oxford Living Dictionaries.\" It may date to the ancient cat-worshiping Egyptians who created \"the curve of the question mark\" after observing the shape of an inquisitive cat\u2019s tail. There are other possible origins, says the online dictionary: The question mark may have been introduced by Alcuin of York, an English scholar and poet born in 735, who was invited to join the court of Charlemagne in 781, says Oxford. Once there, Alcuin wrote many books\u2014all in Latin\u2014including some works on grammar. For his books, Alcuin created the punctus interrogativus or \"point of interrogation,\" a symbol resembling a tilde or lightning flash above it, representing the rising tone of voice used when asking a question. In \"A History of Writing,\" Steven Roger Fischer says that the question mark first appeared around the eighth or ninth century\u2014possibly beginning with Alcuin's works\u2014in Latin manuscripts but did not appear in English until 1587 with the publication of Sir Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia.\" Sidney certainly made full use of the punctuation mark when introducing it to the English language: According to a version of \"Arcadia\" transcribed by Risa Bear and published by the University of Oregon, the question mark appeared in the work nearly 140 times. Another possibility links the question mark with the Latin *quaestio* (\u2018question\u2019). Supposedly, in the Middle Ages scholars would write \u2018quaestio\u2019 at the end of a sentence to show that it was a question, which in turn was shortened to *qo*. Eventually, the *q *was written on top of the *o*, before steadily morphing into a recognizably modern question mark.\" ",
