            "answer_text": "Like Adriana Heguy pointed out, men still dominate the publishing world. Outside of genres where the primary audience is female, young adult and romance, if the target audience is not considered to be limited by gender, the most accessible gender the author can be is male. When a man is the author, the book is thought to be accessible by both men and women, when a woman writes a book it is thought to be more accessible to women. Just like if a the book is written by a queer author the audience is to be queer. This goes back to the idea in the western world that the straight cis white male is the default person. There are a plethora of books by this specific demographic, unless specifically stated, these books are viewed to be gender neutral in terms of topic, accessible to people of all sexual orientations, and zero mention of race therefore inferring that it is racially neutral. The more a an individual deviates from the \"norm\" of the straight cis white male, the more the book is likely to be viewed and marketed as a \"niche\"  This is not a condemnation of the straight cis white male, just a commentary of how that demographic is viewed tacitly.  Take the subject matter of a suburban couple after many years going through a divorce. If the author is male, this is more likely marketed as general fiction or literature, however if the author is female many times this is marketed as \"chick lit\" and the perceived difference is reflected in the covers that are produced for these novels. Which cover is more accessible to a wider demographic?      IMAGES: What Happens If You Flip The Gender Of Book Covers? Books with women on the covers, soft pastel colors, cursive typography, flora imagery, couples, and hand holding are things that tend to be included on the covers of female authors, as well as things that most men might not be as comfortable to be seen with outside the context of a romantic partner. Mostly likely due to the rigidity of masculinity, and how performative gender expression is in society, depending on how \"feminine\" something appears, regardless of the content, does still play a factor in if a male is going not only think that the book is accessible to them, but also if they are comfortable to be seen buying and reading the book. Also, to be honest, sometimes covers made for female authors just look so incredibly cheap and photoshopped together that I can understand how it can turn off the interest level for the book. Just look at the example, above and it is kind of obvious that one cover looks better than the other, and that is the cover that is a \"genderless\" reinterpretation of the real thing. If I saw those two books on the bookshelves I would be far more likely to pick up and look at the back of Heist Society by Alan Carter than Heist Society by Ally Carter. Who the hell is designing some of these covers?    Blerg. Sometimes it seems like publishers intentionally market books authored by females to drive males away. Making the book more \"feminine\" is not going to get more women to buy the book. Hell, I imagine that there are plenty of good series I have probably missed out on because the covers were so damned awful, and/or they looked like everything else. If anything overly feminine book covers is what makes people regard a particular type of book a frivolous, trashy, beach read which isn't missed when someone forgets it on a plane. So while I agree, that the gender of the author shouldn't matter the facts are that the way that books are marketed and viewed means that books of women are not given as much exposure. It gives the public the false impression that the books presented to us for our consumption are there without regard of the gender of the author, so when we pick them freely, we can tell ourselves that we picked them without regard of the author therefore there is zero bias in what we read as readers. The bias is not necessarily of the readers, but of decisions made by the publishing industry. Also, I just want to say that I do commend the OP for noticing how skewed their reading demographic and making an effort to expand their exposure to a wider variety of authors that they might have been missing out on. While I don't think that it is necessary to completely limit your reading to female authors, making a conscious effort to diversify is a good one. Some people can say that a narrative is a narrative and that the gender or background of the author has no bearing on the narrative. Maybe depending on the subject matter, but I don't buy into that excuse because it feeds into the idea that people's personal background and experiences in life have nothing to do with the work that they produce and the perspective they share with the world. Could a black woman have written On The Road? Disregarding the fact that if a black woman submitted the book to a publishing company at the time, it probably wouldn't have become the American classic it is today. It speaks of experiences a black woman wouldn't have access to, therefore I find it hard to believe for a black woman at that time to write about those types of experiences. Not that people, are unable to write a convincing narrative of people of whom they do not share the same background of, however, to do so one needs to spend significantly more time researching and understanding the experiences of a particular background in order to write a convincing narrative of it. It is much easier to write what you know, and great care needs to be made to write what you do not know that well. So that is why I think there is a difference between what is produced by people of particular backgrounds, and why it beneficial to actually read from different perspectives of your own, and not assume that your perspective is the default one. You may be surprised when something absolutely trivial is seen in a very different light when seen from a perspective you hardly ever hear or see from. Also, I think it might be particularly useful for more men, to read narratives from the perspective of women. (Please for the love of all things holy do not take that to mean romance novels. Ugh, please don't take those seriously, just like porn shouldn't be taken seriously.) Especially, since so many men claim to find women soo confusing, but hardly ever think to actually read books by women to help enlighten themselves. If you are going to take anything from this answer, just remember... romance novels are just porn for women. Everything in that genre is just as realistic as women ordering pizza to sleep with pizza men. ",

            "answer_text": "I have read more books by male writers than female writers, throughout my life, and I consider myself a feminist. But the literary world is still dominated by male writers (Research shows male writers still dominate books world). Thus, it is expected that anyone would read more books written by men than by women, because there are more of them. It is commendable that you choose to read more women writers; I don't really do that, for example. I usually read authors that appeal to me, regardless of the gender. But it is possible that there are fantastic women writers out there that are not getting the exposure that the male writers get, and we are all missing out. It seems that Quanta and other publishers are looking into this, which is great. ",
