He: \u201cYou had no idea how much of a problem you were causing.\u201d You: \u201cI did know I was causing a problem, but I had no alternative.\u201d Another reason you might want to stress \u201cdid\u201d would be if you wanted to say, \u201cI did know then, but I don\u2019t know now; I\u2019ve just forgotten.\u201d Most of the time - I\u2019d say 95% of the time, plus - you would say \u201cI knew.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The use of the auxiliary verb, \u201cto do\u201d has two uses. To form questions in using verbs that cannot be made by reversing the indictative word order. e.g. Are you? (to be), Have you? Can you? May I, might we etc . questions indicated by reversing the word order. We do not say \u201cLike you?\u201d but \u201cDo you like?\u201d and similarly for all other verbs. The second use of the auxiliary verb \u201cto do\u201d, is for empahsis. e.g. \u201cI do love you\u201d, \u201c I did tell the truth\u201d So \u201cI knew\u201d and \u201cI did know\u201d are equivalent in meaning, but one is more emphatic than the other.
