            "answer_text": "I'd think of it a little like going out to eat. Even if the meal is subpar, you are still generally expected to pay for it. You chose to try the place out, and that comes with a certain amount of risk. Sure, you can send it back and ask for something else - but it's going to be coming out of the same kitchen. You are also free to ask to have your meal comped, but I'm not sure it's fair to refuse to pay when they refuse to give you the (albeit somewhat inedible) meal for free. You make the complaint and kindly let them know that you won't be back (and please also tip the server). Don't get involved with having the original writer fix it if the writing was truly horrendous. This is a waste of his/her time and yours. As an editor I have done this sort of back and forth with unskilled writers before and I can tell you that what they say about polishing turds is true, especially when you're using the asshole that created the turd to do the polishing.  Along those same lines, you should also think twice before trying to get someone else to edit or rewrite it. If the product turned out as badly as you say, just get a new writer to start over from scratch. I can't tell you how many times I've been tasked with \"fixing\" a piece that would have been easier to rewrite from scratch. It's frustrating and not cost-effective. Sometimes you have to suffer through a few bad meals before you find your favorite restaurant. Chalk it up to the cost of doing business, and try the Italian joint across the street. EDIT: But I don't think you have to pay for the whole project if only part was submitted. You should only have to pay for what was completed. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, why was the article so off the mark? And what do you mean by that? Does it mean the article has terrible grammar or structure? Does it mean the article doesn't talk about the subject? You don't mention what the problem is. Whatever the problem is, who caused it? If the problem is grammar and structure that renders the article unusable, then you shouldn't pay. If the article is way off the mark because it's not the exact subject you expected, you have to take a look at the instructions. For example, if your instructions were \"write an article about hats\" and the writer writes an article about fedoras, and you can't use it because you sell many types of hats but not fedoras, then it's your fault and you should pay.  So it's not clear by the information you give who was responsible for the article not being usable, although you did specify that the article had to be approved before payment was made.  Take also in consideration the amount of money that is involved, which you don't mention. For expensive jobs, I think it's reasonable to make some edits, but not for dirt cheap jobs. Also, if it's a small amount, I'd say it's cheap to pay it and get rid of this writer than to stress yourself with this issue further. Again, you don't provide this information, so you'll have to judge this on your own. ",
