Your task here is to focus on the assignment and never let any trivial thoughts get into. If you want to read something more specific, here it is: Time. Don\u2019t count hours before the deadline expires. Yes, you lack time, but you don\u2019t have to get panic-stricken. If you do, you\u2019ll find it impossible to concentrate and fail to write an essay that complies with the academic demands.If you don\u2019t know who your target readers are, don\u2019t think as if they know the subject perfectly. If there are complex terms, ensure to explain them.Don\u2019t think your essay text is flawless once you\u2019re done with it. Check it. Check it again. Recheck it. Perfect has to limits.Don\u2019t think that your tutor is not going to notice \u201cthat tiny error.\u201d Use plagiarism software, grammar, and punctuation checkers to make sure the text is errorless.Best luck with your writing!
