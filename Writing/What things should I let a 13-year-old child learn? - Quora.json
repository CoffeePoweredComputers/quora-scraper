            "answer_text": "Everything! By the age of 13, kids are past all the developmental hurdles that may affect learning. They have an adult capacity for understanding, and a better-than-adult capacity for learning. They really can do and learn anything, and the more they do and learn at that age the more deeply they will understand it. In the modern world, we tend to treat teenagers like toddlers. That\u2019s a very recent phenomenon, and it contributes to all kinds of teen mental problems and suicide risk. Up until the industrial age, teenagers were considered adults. They were bar-mitzvah\u2019d or confirmed as adults. They were often sent away from their families to apprentice in a trade. 13-year-olds were even officers on U.S. and British warships sailing the world\u2019s oceans in times of war. One of the best things you can do for any 13-year-old is to treat them like a (young) adult, and expect of them what you would expect of any (inexperienced) adult. Encourage and support their exploration and growth! ",

            "answer_text": "You should allow them to learn anything that interests them. My thirteen year old grandson has expressed an interest in forensic science as a possible career. As a result he has recently enrolled in an online course which is an introduction to the subject. This will allow him to gauge whether or not the subject is one he wishes to pursue and therefore will dictate the subjects he will concentrate on in high school. If he decides, this path is not for him, he still has plenty of time to choose another route without wasting valuable schooling on a subject he will not need in the future. My only stipulation is that school work and accompanying homework comes first, then he is free to go online and work through this course at his leisure. ",
