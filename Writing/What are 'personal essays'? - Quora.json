            "answer_text": "As the name suggests, this type of essay focuses on you as a person. You may want to talk about something that happened in your life that changed your thinking (or behavior!), some characteristics of your family of which you\u2019re particularly proud, something you\u2019re particularly passionate about (a subject at school, a specific type of athletics, drawing/singing/dancing/etc.), or something about your friendships (a particularly close friend or your group of buddies). Whatever subject you choose, remember that you are the central character in your essay. The reader should come away with a sense of who you are. To accomplish this, you\u2019ll probably want to use the \u201cnarrative essay\u201d style. Once you have your ideas sketched out in rough paragraphs, you\u2019ll want to edit each sentence and paragraph to be sure that the word-picture you\u2019re \u201cpainting\u201d is vivid to the reader\u2014 descriptive action verbs, specific details of events, situations, and people. You want the reader to be able to see what you saw, feel what you felt. Remember, though: Everything you write must be factual. No embellishments, nothing invented to make it more interesting than the facts support. ",
