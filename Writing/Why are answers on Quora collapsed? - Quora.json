            "answer_text": "Answers may be collapsed for the following reasons:  The answer is a duplicate. When questions are merged, duplicate answers by the same writer may be collapsed, so that only one answer per person appears on a page.The answer violates Quora policy. Quora Moderation collapses answers that violate policy or if the account\u2019s name has been flagged as in violation of our real names policy. When an answer is collapsed this way, the specific policy that applies is always visible on the answer, and the author will be notified.The answer needs improvement to be helpful. Answers which are downvoted or which otherwise aren\u2019t helpful to the person asking the question may be collapsed until they are edited. Answers are collapsed for this reason based on a variety of signals \u2014 votes, the credibility of the voters, the credibility of the author, the quality of the writing, etc. Learn more at: What kinds of answers on Quora are not helpful?Some of the reasons above may result in automatic collapses of answers. If Quora Moderation collapsed your answer for a policy violation, you may appeal a collapsed answer at any time. If your answer was collapsed as needing improvement, the best thing to do is consider how you can edit the answer to make it more helpful. Editing answers to improve them may, in many cases, result in an automatic uncollapse. On rare occasions, Quora Moderation may uncollapse a minority opinion that was collapsed due to downvotes (see Quora's answer to What is Quora's policy on uncollapsing downvoted answers?). ",

            "answer_text": "No it shouldn't stop. Quora is designed around the idea of promoting shared knowledge and building up a vastly database of information from informed sources on a wide range of topics. Part of that process means ensuring that the best, most relevant, most knowledgable answers get pushed to the top.  Which is why there is an upvoting and downvoting function.  If the Quora community as a whole determines that an answer doesn't really address the question then it will be downvoted to the point of collapse.  Of course there are infinite variations and complexities here and it doesn't work quite like that. But that's the aim. And that's why collapsing answers works.  Otherwise you just end up with Ask.com - What's Your Question? with the most smart ass answer getting the most support. In regards to censorship?  Well consider this - if a publisher declines to publish a book, or decides to not reprint a new edition - is that censorship?  When a network passes on a pilot or cancels a TV show - is that censorship?  When radio stations won't play a certain song because of lack of sales and support - is that censorship? Because that's the broad brush you're using in this case.  Besides which QUORA is a privately owned company.  They can choose what they publish and what they decline to publish.  Freedom is speech means you are free to say what you want. It doesn't mean that any one person or one company has to provide you the platform upon which to say it. ",
