            "answer_text": "Hi - I do not have much to go on as far as your background or your program. Therefore, I can only give general direction. What are your interests? Corporate Finance, Investments, Investment Banking, Private Equity, Portfolio Management, etc. Pick something that interests you enough to obtain in-depth knowledge.Do you want to do an empirical or theoretical paper? Are you trying to extend the knowledge base on the topic? Test a theoretical concept empirically? Develop a tutorial for other students? The answers would definitely vary due to the level of technical knowledge necessary for topics appropriate for your program.Are you interested in artificial intelligence? If so, a paper on using machine learning for retesting older empirical research with new methodologies could be very interesting.Sorry that I couldn\u2019t be definitive. If you want to send me answers to the questions above, I\u2019ll be happy to guid you to an appropriat topic. Good luck. ",
