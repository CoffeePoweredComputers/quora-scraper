            "answer_text": "Writing can be a great career. It takes time to become a writer, and you have to put effort in just like you would with any other profession. (People seem to forget this. They think it\u2019s just typing words on a keyboard, but there\u2019s a lot more to it than that!) If you\u2019re going to expend the effort getting a job, it might as well be doing something you love. And if you can get a job as a freelancer or writer, or even create a writing job for yourself through a blog, why not? Most people I\u2019ve met who are writers love their job. They might not love it all the time, and every job has its challenges, but they\u2019re happy for the most part. Some people are just hardwired for this career path. And they all started out writing for love of their craft, whether they were paid for it or not. Happy writing! ",

            "answer_text": "I looked up the word, \u201ccareer\u201d in my Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary. Here is what is states: \u201ca profession for which one trains and for which is undertaken as a permanent calling.\u201d That clearly excludes certain occupations that do not require education, training, expertise, etc. Now, do you consider \u201cwriting a career?\u201d YES! Absolutely! I have never known anyone who writes who has never been a reader nor has studied writing as a mechanical obsession. Writers can work at writing and I have read biographical information about successful writers, both in the past and currently alive, that began as journalists and/or creative writers. Not all become household names and famous for all time, but many/most make a living at creating creative streams on a page. ",
