            "answer_text": "What are some tips in writing relatable characters? Context is critical. The world the character lives in and their attitude toward the life they are in the circumstances that define their understanding of life. The core aspects of character define how they will act and what motivates them. If these aspects are believable / attainable / admirable they will help the reader bond with the character. What are : The character\u2019s desire(s) \u2014 What is the thing they want for themselves, something they will fight and struggle to acquire or achieve.The character\u2019s goal(s) \u2014 People have short term and long term goals, they aren\u2019t necessarily the same as their desires. They may desire to please a parent or loved one through some selfless act, but have a separate goal closer to their heart. Note here that the goal may change as the stakes in the story change.The character\u2019s secret need(s) \u2014 this can be the same thing as the character\u2019s desire or goal, but in stories with some kind of epiphany or self discovery\u2026 the protagonist eventually exchanges their desire/goal for their need. NOTE: the character may be unaware of the need\u2014 it is critical the AUTHOR know though. In Star Wars, Luke\u2019s desire was to go to the academy and learn to fly. He sympathized with the rebellion but wasn\u2019t motivated to join the cause. When his aunt and uncle are killed by the evil empire his desire for revenge pushes him toward his need, and that is to find purpose in social responsibility and becoming a user of the force. So, Luke\u2019s secret need was to become a Jedi.What are the stake(s) for the character \u2014 these are the things the person cares about. What are the particular object(s) / person(s) / ideal(s) that when threatened or compromised will catalyze the character to defend them. It\u2019s critical that the characters have stakes they are unwilling to give up easily, because it\u2019s the antagonistic threat toward (or existential compromise of) that \u201cthing\u201d the story will joust over. Thematically speaking, this is the win/lose consequence that marks is the story\u2019s resolution apex. Meaning when there is no longer any threat or the heightened threat is reset to status quo, that marks the story\u2019s end. The \u201cstakes\u201d for each character are the win/lose consequence for them, and what predicates their engagement with the plot. Note here that side characters often have a stake in the protagonist. They main story problem itself may offer no incentive to take sides. However, the fact that the plot problem is screwing over the protagonist causes the character invested in the them to act.These attributes of character should bond the character to the world and plot:  ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of ways for you to create a relatable character. Some are better than others. It\u2019s important that you take the genre and the tone when considering how you\u2019re going to execute this. Before anything else, you should make sure that your protagonist takes action. A passive character is boring and annoys readers. This is the easiest way to create an unrelatable character that readers can\u2019t stand. Now here are a few techniques you can use. Have your character be an underdog: Everyone loves an underdog. There are many different ways that you can create an underdog story. For example, even Harry Potter is somewhat an underdog. When J.K. Rowling wrote her character in horrible circumstances suffering emotional abuse from his uncle and aunt, everyone started to immediately root for him. Have your character be an expert in something: Everyone loves people who are good at what they do. If you write a character that is amazing at what they do people will get interested right away. For example, Sherlock Holmes is incredible at being a detective. House was incredible at being a doctor. Now, if your character is kind of a jerk you should have him/her being really good at what they do. Also, be careful to not make everyone hate them for being too much of a jerk. You should also have emotional moments (use them sparingly for impact) that show that deep down they\u2019re good people. Sherlock with Watson. House with Wilson. Dean Winchester with Sam Winchester. Have the character have some sense of humor and wit: People remember how you make them feel. With your characters is no different. Characters become relatable and likable when people can remember them. One of the main reasons Tony Stark is so popular is because he makes people laugh/smile. Have them be nice: If you write a character that is genuinely a nice person, they immediately become more relatable. Now, you have to be careful because if they\u2019re too nice that may come across as perfect and you risk making people annoyed with them. The main thing you should worry is about creating 3-dimensional characters. Your villain should have a reason (even if it only makes sense in their minds) to be the way they are. Everyone has a good and bad side, make sure that your characters have this as well. The good guy should have a bad side as well. P.S Remember to show your characters being these things instead of telling people about it. Show a character helping someone in need instead of saying they\u2019re nice. Show them being underestimated instead of saying they\u2019re an underdog. ",
