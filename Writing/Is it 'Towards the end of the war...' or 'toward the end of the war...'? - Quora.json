            "answer_text": "According to \"www.grammarist.com\": Toward vs. towards Toward and towards are equally acceptable forms of the word primarily meaning in the direction of. Other than thes at the end, there is no difference between them. Some people differentiate the two words in various ways, but these preferences are not borne out in the usage of most English speakers. Neither form is more formal or informal or more or less logical than the other (the Oxford English Dictionary says towards is more colloquial in British English, but we see no evidence that this is true in 21st-century British writing), so you\u2019re safe using the one that sounds better to you.But while both these directional words are used in all varieties of English, toward is preferred in American and Canadian English, while towards is preferred in varieties of English from outside North America. These are not rules, however, and exceptions are easily found. History Toward is the older form. It comes from the Old Englisht\u00f3weard, which meant roughly the same as our modern toward.1 Towards is also old, however, as for many centuries the suffixes \u2013ward and \u2013wards have been more or less interchangeable and have given rise to parallel forms of many words\u2014for example, backward and backwards, and forward and forwards.2 Towards became the dominant form in the 17th century and remained ascendant until the Americans took up toward in the 19th century.
