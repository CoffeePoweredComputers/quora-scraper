            "answer_text": " Well, when you get your website live, Google spider/bot will crawl though it and index it to their engine. Simple!!!! But you know what?? Every day millions of new website, blogs, and forums are popping up in the web, so your website might be left un-indexed by Google spider. Therefore, it is wise to do it manually. For instance, you can visit Google search console and put your links there. Though it often works, sometimes it takes whole lotta time to get indexed. Another way is to create a backlink. You know, when you put the link of your website to another site related to your niche, your chances to get indexed fast will be much higher. However, it is important to know that indexing your website only on Google might not bring you enough traffic. Therefore, you should spend time indexing your sites on other major search engines like Bing, Yahoo, Alexa, SearchUk, Reddif and more. Yeah, it will take times to index your website in all those engines, but hey, it is worth it, right? Besides, you can easily outsource this work to a company like Total SEO. You know, for $25 bucks they would get your site indexed on more than 200 search engines and 100 directories. You can try it out here Website Submission Hope it helps Cheers\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "Want to Index website or blog on Google Search Engine? First of all, You have to create XML-Sitemap of your website or blog and don\u2019t forget to submit it on Google Search Console, It helps Google bot to crawl and Index all website pages. If you are still looking that your website has not been indexed by Google bot then you have to do another method which I\u2019m going to share below. Go to the Google Search Console tool.Click on the URLs Inspection option which is stayed on the header of the Google search console tool.Copy that links from your website that has not been indexed by Google bot or crawler paste into the URL inspection option.Google will fetch or check that given link that is indexed or not, wait for a while moment then Google will show you that your URL is available on the Google SERP or not.If Google shows you that is not indexed by Google then you need to send request to Google, this option you can figure out below.Wait for 3\u20134 days then check again your website has been indexed or not.",
