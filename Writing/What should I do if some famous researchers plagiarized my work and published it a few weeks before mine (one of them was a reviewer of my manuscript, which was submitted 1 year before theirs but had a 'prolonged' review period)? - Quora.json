I imagine there\u2019d be a relatively involved process, and I\u2019d want to have a pretty unimpeachable paper trail showing when I\u2019d started work on the relevant project and how far along I\u2019d got before the researcher in question got involved. Whether it would be a process worth pursuing would depend on what my university would advise me. It\u2019s not going to be easy, we can agree, but it probably comes down to how complicated it would be. ",
