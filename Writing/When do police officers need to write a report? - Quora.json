            "answer_text": "From a street cop\u2019s point of view? Any time we do anything\u2026 Investigating a reported crime. Stolen Property. Found Property. Towing a vehicle, for whatever reason. Arresting Someone. Continuing an Investigation, or any followup on a previous case. Victims reporting property loss. Domestic Violence, which has numerous forms, Restraining Orders, Rights Forms, additional reports *ALL* of which need to be perfect. Recovered Stolen Property, with or without arrest at the time. Motor Vehicle Accident, 2 cars per page, no limit to how many cars you handle. Struck Deer Game Ticket. In NJ, you can take a deer struck by a car, if you plan to butcher it. Bicycle Loss Report. Maybe it was stolen, maybe it was borrowed. Either way\u2026 mind you, I retired in 2003. These are just the forms I remember. I owned the thickest briefcase I could find, and was NEVER able to close it, I had some many various reports in it. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on department policy. A few agencies have officers write reports on almost everything they do during their shift, including motorist assists. For the most part, any call that involves what could be or is a crime, anything that should be documented and archived like a domestic disturbance without an offense involved like domestic battery, any call that may lead to a trial, any call that involves any physical contact between the officer and another even without an arrest would require a report.
