            "answer_text": "This is, basically, an absurd question \u2014 with all due respect. I just completed a 315-word blog post in about 15 minutes \u2014 but I started it a couple of days ago, then set it aside as more important things occupied my mind and time. I could have finished the entire post almost as quickly as the time I spent today finishing it. I knew what I wanted to say; I just didn\u2019t have time to type it all out (at my VERY high speed typing pace). As the previous answer noted, some \u2018articles\u2019 take longer than other to write. Before I retired, when I was covering local government happenings for a local paper, I often turned out 500\u2013800 word articles in well under an hour\u2026 after spending twice as long at a town or committee meeting. But articles requiring research can take, as the previous answerer noted, much longer. An aside: Sadly, you and SO many other Quora users don\u2019t take time to research your questions on this platform, as many/most have been answered before. I just happen to have a few spare moments to reply to you today. Normally, I\u2019d ignore you, because I have already answered your question numerous times here. I am tired of repeating myself! ",

            "answer_text": "I run a research blog. In order to come up with a content for my audience, I sometimes do a lot of personal study to familiarise myself with whatever I am dishing out and in most cases, I spend days on laboratories, reading and carrying out tests so as to be sure of the knowledge I'm passing to my readers. While this applies to most research bloggers, the reverse might be the case if you're not on the research niche. However, there is need to always dig further to ensure the authenticity of what you're publishing. For me, I Perform keyword analysis using semrush, moz or ahref depending on what I'm writing on. This way I also discover longtails to add as subheadings Find out if there are tests and analysis to be carried out Carry out the tests if necessary to have raw data which could be further processed to become and information. Writing is surely based on my findings Therefore, for a piece of content on my blog, it could take some 2_5 days to properly create a content. Incase where there is no need for tests, a day or 2 us enough to plan the content structure after which I spend 1 - 3 hours writing and configuring keywords in strategic position within the content ",

            "answer_text": "Estimates of an hour, day, week, or month usually depend upon how much feedback is demanded. Blogs are practically a stream of consciousness. Answers are quick because the question is a prompt. An introduction to or summary of prior subjects benefits from a system of reference. Articles take longer because of the literature review, pauses between multiple drafts for comparison and criticism, perspective and coherence. Longer wordcounts like a novel under Nanowrimo could be a couple of weeks or more. Try to hyperlink the ideas between different sources for depth. Stay concise by merciless editing. ",
