            "answer_text": "Here are many myths and false assumptions that continue to loom around software development. Even though the first programming language, Fortran, was created in 1957 and the World Wide Web has eclipsed the quarter-century mark, software development is still viewed as some sort of dark magic, thus making people hesitant to embrace new technology. There are also lots of myths out there which prevent us from fully comprehending how business processes can be automated or improved by top quality programming which can lead to significant time and cost savings. Let\u2019s consider ten of these myths that need to be challenged in the name of improving business efficiency. Software Development Comes with a Hefty Price TagPerhaps this is the most popular myth about software development. It is because of this myth companies do not harness the potential that custom software can provide which can improve their organization\u2019s efficiency.2. Users Have No Idea what they Know what they Want Even though there conversely exists a myth that customers have no idea what they want until you show them, regardless, software companies need to be both product oriented and customer oriented as long as they consider the speed of delivery to be important3. The Waterfall Method Still Works You would be amazed at the number of people who still believe that a system can be specified in detail, before you even build it. Not only is this almost impossible, but it is also inefficient to execute the development process in a sequence. While there also exists a myth that Agile lacks any planning whatsoever, the fact of the matter is that planning is just as necessary to the effectiveness of Agile as it is to Waterfall, but the difference is in the way the planning is done.4. The More, the Merrier Unfortunately, a myth exists that adding people to a development team makes it better and speeds up delivery. However, adding more people to a project tends to prolong the project\u2019s timeframe and causes friction due to issues in training and collaboration.5. Software Development has a Fixed Cost and Strict Timeframe Going back to the Waterfall approach, it is simply not possible to detail out the software before building it. Even though a lot of companies are lured in by the fixed price model, they must also remember that there are some hidden costs associated with it in terms of quality and additional costs incurred as the project goes beyond the projected time boundaries.",
