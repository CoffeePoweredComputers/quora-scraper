            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty simple, the most important thing is to include a link back to your blog or website. Don\u2019t forget your name, too. Make it brief, but you should ask the website owner how long it can be in total words. If it\u2019s your website, a lot is left up to you. You can do pretty much whatever you want, but the bio shouldn\u2019t be boring or overlong. Make sure you include your related background, your experience level, years of effort in your field(s), the year you began your work, and anything else that might be relevant that will \u201csell\u201d readers on your services or pastimes. And like I said, be sure to include all relevant links, with SEO-friendly links text on each one. ",
