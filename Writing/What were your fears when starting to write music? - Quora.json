            "answer_text": "Everyone\u2019s approach to composing can be quite different, although I have no doubt that many actual concerns and fears that some of us have may be similar in nature. I for one had all sorts of negative thoughts early on when I started to write, many of which I don\u2019t have now (and others that are very much still with me). These are just my own thoughts, and I\u2019d love to hear others\u2019 fears as well: Am I sounding like my heroes? When I was formally learning \u201cclassical\u201d composition, I was tempted to want to sound like J.Brahms\u2019 pianos pieces (opus 76, 117, 118 etc.), or at least that was my own impression every time I sat at the piano and thought I was coming up with something sad and romantic. But it extended to everything I was taking a stab at\u2026 In the mid 1990s I was worried my R&B ballads sounded too much like Brian McKnight and Babyface tunes, and my own band\u2019s dreampop/shoegazer sounds seemed to have textures and progressions that were Slowdive, Ride, MBV, or Pale Saints rip-offs. But the concerns were legitimate, and for myself, (a) framing my use of harmonic progressions and putting them on paper before composing melodic lines (independent of genre), and (b) writing on a different instrument altogether (i.e. writing pop ballads on guitar, instead of a juicy EP patch) helped to get my brain away from steering toward tendencies of my heroes.Did I just paint myself into a corner? Especially in pop songs, I found it hard to let go of sections that were the weak links in a song. The reason is that I\u2019d often come up with a progression and melodic line that I was convinced would work, yet either the melody or the sections that preceded or followed (or everything) would simply not click. Learning to let go of my own \u201ctraps\u201d and start fresh can still be a challenge, especially when the clock is ticking and I\u2019m under pressure.What\u2019ll people think of this crap? Confidence in one\u2019s own effort does not come easy in early stages of composition. As mentioned in #1, some of us may subconsciously gravitate toward our idols to the point of sounding like a poor farce, the development of thematic elements in classical music can (a) simply sound immature, (b) lack depth of harmony, or (c) lead up to awkward cadences, and pop song lyric writing will often lean on predictable rhymes and trite thematic ideas, rather than sounding both candid and fresh. It happens to us all, and maturity that accompanies acquired skill in the craft simply takes real work and time to develop.Is it enough? Learning to produce a quality demo took years to figure out, but with the learning of technology (tracking instruments/vocals well, producing an arrangement that \u201cmade sense\u201d, etc.) came a slow but sure resolution of an early fear that the sound of the demo itself would not be a distraction when it came time to pitch a track. Connected to the confidence issue is a reasonable concern that I might be just \u201cpooping out a track\u201d, instead of passing on a good effort that shows a personal commitment to quality and respect for the listener (even as a demo). Ergo, half-arsed demos are always a bad idea.Where am I going? Fearing a lack of growth in one's craft invariably can appear early on, and accompanies frustration stemming from comparing oneself to others, and (for some younger writers) not having a source of affirmation along the way. But to be sure, such fear continues to be a part of many writer's careers, especially during \u201cwriter\u2019s block\" dry spells, seasons of no work, or when one's compositions or arrangements start to sound painfully samey, among many other points of frustration one may feel over a lack of personal growth as a composer.What in the world am I hearing? Probably the biggest fear I had early on that continues on to the present is me worrying about myself not being objective enough: My arrangements might be better than the songs themselves, a chorus melody might be catchy to me (but not really all that good), and a mix may have better contrasting dynamics than the song structure really conveys. I often need someone else to level with me and give me a brutally honest first impression, lest I get drunk on my own hubris as a composer, thinking my compositions are above criticism. Operating a DAW with a HDD of loops and kits as a young composer and hearing the amazing stuff you can throw together without a pad of lined paper in sight can be remarkably empowering and you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re on top of the world. But I dare suggest that not growing out of such vanity is worth fearing. One should never be satisfied with who they were yesterday.",
