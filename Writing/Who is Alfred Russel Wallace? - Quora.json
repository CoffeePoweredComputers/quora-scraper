            "answer_text": "Alfred Russel Wallace was a contemporary of Charles Darwin, a fellow naturalist, whose ideas on evolution were very similar to Darwin\u2019s own. I believe, in fact, that Wallace reached much the same conclusions as his better known counterpart. There are those who argue, persuasively enough, that Wallace got there first! There\u2019s plenty more on Google and loads of book reading available for those who have the stamina - and the desire to see fair play! ",
