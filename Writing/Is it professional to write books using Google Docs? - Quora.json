            "answer_text": "I do it all the time. Google Docs is far easier to use than Word and for professional formatting (double spaced, 1-inch margins) works just fine. The only real difference I can find is that if you are formatting for Kindle and you want drop caps you do it differently in Google Docs. (you create a word picture and format your drop cap, then wrap around your text around the drop cap.) In any case, you\u2019ll need to download load as a Word doc anyway for submission. Google Docs has a wide array of add-ons that help you with editing your words. Pro-Writing Aid works directly in Google Docs now. Grammarly has a stripped-down version that picks up basic errors as you work, and Language Tool picks up others. SAS Writing Reviewer is a free tool that helps you edit your doc. You can add a free thesaurus to look up different words. Because most of these tools have a word limit, I write in separate chapters and knit them together with Google Merge Docs, which is another free add on. To outline and track my writing I created a multi-sheet Google Sheet workbook that takes me from outlining, through editing, through submission. Every page of the workbook is linked so that I only need to enter something once on the workbook. I link the chapter to the workbook for easy access, too. The Beat Sheet (Actually a wider document with other parts.)  The Top Row of the Story Map  These are just two sheets. I have other others, including workbook synopsis sheets for each chapter, character, setting and information sheets. So yep. Use Google Docs to write your book. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. You can use any writing surface that can hold the words. Google docs has the capability of being shareable. You can collaborate with other authors. It is a good word processor in that it has many features we associate with word processors and they are easy to utilize. It is constantly backing up your work and is not tied to your computer, which means if you had a house fire you would still have your book drafts. I\u2019ve never tried to make an ebook from it so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s easy or hard but that\u2019s true of a lot of word processors. It is not as robust or feature-rich as other word processors but I\u2019ve found it sufficient for a lot of things. I\u2019ve heard several professional authors discuss their use of it in a positive sense. Usually the collaborative aspect is the reason it was chosen, btw. I think the big minus would be that you have to work a little harder on organizing your work than with some other tools. I use ywriter6 when I need the organization.I find MS Word pretty easy to use but I prefer the older version I have when I\u2019m using it. I also like Evernote for first draft, because it backs up to the cloud, and OneNote it pretty good if you have to organize a pile of notes where you want to format them and move pieces around a lot.
