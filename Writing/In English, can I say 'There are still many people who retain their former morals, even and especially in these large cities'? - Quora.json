            "answer_text": "There is nothing so wrong with your sentence, but your word choice could be better. For instance, \u201cformal morals\u201d sounds quite strange. What other kind of morals are there? Are there \u201cinformal morals?\u201d If so, what would they be? So, what you want to say is not clear. Perhaps you want to say that many people keep their faith no matter where they live. The word, retain, has a slightly different meaning, as though to say these people are just holding on despite others\u2019 lack of morals, as though they are in a struggle. Maybe you are not referring to religious faith, but morality in general. Morality would be a better word than \u201cformal morals.\u201d Morality encompasses a sense of right and wrong no matter the grounds of that awareness. Conscience has a similar meaning. Hopefully, I have given you enough words here for to choose which works best for conveying your meaning. ",

And the sentence seems a bit stilted. Try: Many still hold on to the morals they grew up with, even when they move to large cities. ",
