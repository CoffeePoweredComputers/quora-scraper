            "answer_text": "Nihilist Your desire: the poem as immaculate starTo coruscate above the arctic pole.Unattainable aloneness. Crystal fire.Praising ascetics who died in perfectMuteness \u2014 sickened of humored mortality;Those who despised the muck of settlements,The villages of hearths, sad jokes and snowshoes.We, the tramping neighbors, keep the legends,Storing tall tales, crazed feats and expeditions;Though when we perish, vanished in the blizzard,It\u2019s not for ice light-blinded frenzied vision,But only from our accidental lives. We know the dripping eaves that tap out madness,The cave within the blackest of the nights,The howl that twists our guts in growing older,The wind that blasts our ears with rage of loss.We do not button up to get quite cozy;It merely fends off chill in being us.Brisk ballads have us dance our melancholy,Knit quondam joys in flash of quilted rags.Do woven words seem something less than art?They clothe the naked self in warmth of need. You cannot stave the fear that makes you run.May dreams awake you. Sleep is the rising sun. ",

            "answer_text": "A Poem about a poem is a challenging thing, It's like a poet's love and engagement ring. Emotions, feelings, gratitude, philosophy..... For a literature lover, a poem is a morning coffee. A combination of 26 alphabets, Collectively describes the depth and the crest ! The soul is submerged while a poem is composed, The veins are high, goose bumps froze ! Deep inside lies a beautiful world, Experiences matter to share with the world. A poem is not a poem indeed.... It's your heart's addiction just as weed ! Expressing the feelings into words, Freedom to fly just like birds ! A door once opened never shuts, Once a poet, always a Poet ! Edit 1: I've written few more. You can check it out @ www.loveatstroke.blogspot.in ",

Krishna Sameer Achanta has already written an answer with a rendition of the poem in Telugu here \u0c15\u0c35\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c3e! \u0c13 \u0c15\u0c35\u0c3f\u0c24\u0c3e! (Kavita! O Kavita!). Kavita is a Telugu word for Poem. Here is a translation of the poem in English. Kavita! O Kavita! In my youthful ambitions Surrounded by the aura of fragrant flowers In the days when I thought of you as A beauty that one can meet in auspicious moments In a beautiful garden, a beauty unreachable! The one that wanders on the paths of the sky! For you, my life a tapas* In my quest those minutes, that intoxication Your form invisible surrounded as you Were by the circles illusionary, feign. Weren\u2019t there times when I pined for you in my My cave, my pit, my darkness, in loneliness? Under your influence In my trained glances of perpetual pursuit In trances tranquil An invocation to the Poetic Muse In my brain which hung like Flowered arch of heaven What roars what languages and what pictures Passed through? What colourful and strange shades of Light and darkness did I see? Through what energies did My song acquire life? The collectives of battle cries from all the corners In sounds I had chosen for you; In the cloudy midnight sky Full of rain, the trumpets of the conch The beat of the drums in the Ferocious winds that reverberated in the Waves of the mid-ocean; That same night, In the thick of the forests Are they cries of different animals Crossing the boundaries of any rhythm? The deep inner endless music Within the stars, Earthquakes, the collapse of governments Rebellion, war Everything in your consciousness, The appearing as of your cosmic form Are they then the pictures that my mind\u2019s eye shows, The commentaries I hear When I think of you? The diamond that blossomed in the pond of fire The flying metal horse The music of the drum In the feverish cannon What else did I hear? In the sleepy midnight The inner music of a young mother, dreaming- Hugging her infant, just born, The sound of the infant dreaming Of an ancient life in strange sleep, In the hospital the sound of the blood flowing In the veins of a patient lying with closed eyes With the trance of the surgeon\u2019s spell In the twilight zones between life and death; The mad ravings of an alcoholic Slipping into a drain in an inebriated state! The starving stomach of a prostitute In wild demonic sex with half closed eyes Her sad experiences erupt in music, terrible The secrets that a head, beheaded, reveal A mad man\u2019s crazy mind sees cinemas And cries out, like a wolf The workers who have gone on strike The fires of hunger, the cries of the wives And children of workers on strike Screams! Cries of anguish The words of one million stars The songs of one billion waterfalls A hundred thousand echoes of waves of the sea I heard them! I heard them all, My Mother! The things I saw and heard They came In great numbers Crossing the graveyards like lexicons Breaking through the chains of grammar Leaving the tight python-like hold of the meter They came, the words In a fast pace, running, galloping They entered my heart! In that whirlwind circles of words That manifested the change In what streets I wandered Going in circles when In the music I thus created My sins and weakness purged And a joyous exhilaration filled my heart I awakening for you and with all my senses alert Whatever I wrote saw Breathed, my life entering a trance like State of Samadhi* The inspiration that mesmerized me Surrendering to that divine experience The music that emerged by The meeting of love under the star crazed... My veins as the strings of veena The kiss of the divine music At the end of my life, death at my doorstep The procession of those instruments of music That held me in the wild grip like an eagle\u2019s beak The music transcends the joys and sorrows A wonderful, profound, thoughtful, unparalleled Solitary, unique, transient and eternal moment divine! The Muse\u2019s heart who has given me this bliss Melting my heart, Grace Incarnate, Kavita! O Kavita! Perhaps on the day You created hunger feeding My ego while I was in my mother\u2019s womb Shapeless and sleeping, Infusing life to my inner and outer senses And sensibilities As I entered this world Experiencing the joys and sorrows And as traveller and a mendicant was In this world\u2019s journey Going about in confusion You, Kavita, appeared with a hand of assurance Drew me into your fold Made me clean and pure! The Graceful and The compassionate, Anupamita, One with no parallel Aparimita, One who is limitless! Kavita! O Kavita! Now, today, can you hear the sighs Behind my bold imaginations? That I will write some things and That my writings would reflect my world My passion shall reach fruition and My songs will reverberate in the hearts Of my race as an incantation I strive to bring my sky closer to my world My ideas will be the sparks that light the diamonds Which I shall share with my brethren The ends of your stole Fluttering causing waves My word as your temple My song as an offering to you I will offer heartily My creative fragrance sprinkled As pollen from flowers! Oho! Delight divine! Treasure trove! Mother! O Kavita! Kavita! Kavita! O Kavita! *tapas - Pennance; *Samadhi - Deep state of meditation Source: Avakaaya.com ",

May be me or just few Words are magicians in small formations Show their true colors with imaginative transformations Colors which will change the speed of light and distance of stars Colors which hypnotize you to travel with them at an unknown hour Where reflections are talking and so do silence Where flowers are walking cutting the path of violence Where creativity is your escape and solidarity your power Where words are speaking to the reader from where he starts Poems are a garage, garage where doors are plenty Plenty for imagination and a place where even words looks empty Where walls are your companion as they act like a silent friend Who will not get disturb even if you stare them till the night end Poems are reflections of words and words are hollow as reflection As they take shape when you give them direction The air is a free blackboard for a poet to see To draw something in it which someone might have forget to perceive So draw as air is plenty and rainbow could be more bright if you like to color it with a poem telling it HOW TO BE ALIVE?
