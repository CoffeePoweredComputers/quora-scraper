            "answer_text": "As a male writer, here is what I try to do when writing about female characters. The book I am (half-heartedly) working on has a number of female characters. The main principle I am working with is: every woman has her own character and her own purpose in this story. These are some of the women characters that will appear, and some of their goals. Shaaxla: a young woman whose culture expects her to accept an arranged marriage. She wants to marry a peasant in order to escape her overbearing father. Mhatsa: the mother of three young men, one of whom the princess wants to seduce. She wants to keep her family together and make do in her fictional culture. Sotlet: married to one of the sons. She\u2019s a nurse, and there\u2019s a war. Her goal is to heal people and to survive the war with her family. Aunt Antelope: she\u2019s from another fictional culture, and is travelling with her niece to live elsewhere. She is just visiting when the war happens, and her goal is to somehow live through things. But she happens to speak the enemy\u2019s language, and plays a key role. There are many male characters, but I hope the women will be seen as a significant part of the story. But the main principle is: every woman has her own reason to be there. When writing female characters, pretend each one is real and ask her: \u201cWhat kind of woman are you? What is your goal?\u201d If you can give an answer that isn\u2019t limited to supporting a man, then you are going in the right direction.  When the book is finished and published, you will be free to judge whether I have lived up to my goal, or not. Until then, I hope that is at least the right direction to go. ",

            "answer_text": " I think a lot about power when writing women. I think about where their power comes from in a society, a history, a universe dominated by men. But there is still power. Is it power in their beauty in their intellect or their womanness? I think about how I would use myself, have to protect myself and direct myself as a woman. I think of a woman as self conscious, maybe not always in a negative way but in a hyper aware way because of men. Men watching them, men strategizing about them, men trying to control them. Then I think about women who subvert that, women who defy that. In S, a novel, I wrote about 7 sisters and their mother using magic to escape post Civil War South to a hundred years into the future. I thought about what it meant to be defined by a man for their mother, about a man\u2019s principle control system for a Black woman being religion or from a White man, enslavement and what the intrinsic similarities were to the women. How both had a subverted, unaddressed but obvious sexual component. Then I thought about religiosity and them being hunted by a man, a cult from the past. I thought about Reconstruction and the value of a man to women and girls and the danger of a man with unchecked control over subjugated people. I wanted to write about women then who had no choice and suddenly were presented with a mindboggling choice of magic, of power, of time travel. But then the mother would be different than the daughters who left the time, the cult as children and grew up in the 20th century, right? For better or worse? I wanted them to be 7 different kinds of women but I didn\u2019t want to spend 50 pages on each one. I wanted it to be like slashes of color. That one is red, this one orange, that one blue, that one green and so on. I wanted their names to all start with S and I wanted to create a distinction of how men use and see magic and how a woman uses and sees magic. I thought a lot about why none of the 7 sisters had children, how their stalker was magically preventing it and yet how they didn\u2019t mind the absence. His press for them to bring him forward in time became an allegory to abortion, pro life rights, the options and controls on a woman\u2019s body. I thought really hard on how some women might not like that and then I threw in magic and sci-fi and a conflict. When I write women I want them to be what they are unapologetically. I\u2019ll fix the story to suit them. I wanted one sister, Sandy Ree to be tall, over six feet, a woman with a hot temper who had rebelled even against her sisters and fled, who had willingly sold her body on her terms. But I didn\u2019t want that to be her definition, I wanted that fiery passion to be her definition. I wanted her to be so full of energy that she chewed up scenes she was in, men she dealt with, I wanted her passion to abuse men, not a dumb woman. But the one who looks at her sister, possessed by a man/spirit from a hundred and fifty years ago and mocks her, suggests that a little donkey dicking can turn a girl\u2019s head. I wanted the kind of woman who would look into the impossible, the implausible, the fantastic and say something profane and silly and yet true. I wanted Mrs. S, their mother, the only mother in the book to discover the distinction in manipulating time and magic, and why it\u2019s different for a woman, a mother. What she\u2019s willing to sacrifice, the lives of others, animals or humans, verses what her male counterpart was willing to do, to kill. Why and why not. That no one else in the book or the battle knows what it is to be a person who has given birth to a living child, that a child is literally a piece, a part of a mother. That we have very little conception of what it means for one person to grow within another, that elemental connection. As my mother lay dying, my stepfather lost his mind. I was patient with him for months, years prior, but finally I was like you have got to go. Your madness is no longer welcome. Yes, I was in their house. Yes, a guest. Yes, I threw him out. He pulled a gun on me, had it cocked and pointed at me. And I told him to pull the trigger but to know that it would only free me from this mortal coil, it would unleash me, to truly deal with him. Or to get out because his affairs and financial madness would not ruin my mother\u2019s end. I told him he\u2019d abandoned his children so he did not understand the well, the depth, the near roar-scream, within me that had no words but feared nothing for her sake. There\u2019s a primal connection, especially when the child becomes parent and I understood my own feminine energy, the mother connection within me, past masculine violent anger, that said I have no name for this connection but I will obliterate you because of it. That\u2019s what I try to capture in women, that fury, that fire, whether dulled by no children or having 7, is there, in words, in eyes, in clothing, in movements, is what men desire to capture, love, control, and fuck. Know that men are geared towards that, boys are afraid of it, women are aware of it and girls learn it. Play with that and you can write a convincing woman every time.
