            "answer_text": "As a reader, I find that, if done well, having multiple subplots can enhance the story by making it feel more full and fleshed out. That being said, having too many subplots can definitely cause confusion for the reader. If you are worried about it I think your best bet would be to wait until you complete the book and then have a trusted friend or two read your work and provide feedback. Alternatively, if you are really worried, you could write a detailed summary of the plots and subplots and do the same as above, however it may not be an accurate representation of the finished product and so I probably wouldn't recommend it. I wish you the best of luck with your book. ",

            "answer_text": "Most novels have multiple subplots (without them, they tend to be a bit flat). However, when there are more than four subplots, this requires that you are more skillful in tying them together for the big picture. This may mean not jumping back to another subplot every time you reach an exciting cliff-hanger but taking the subplot all the way to a point of lower action (where there is partial resolution) before starting a new one or resuming another subplot. When you complete the rough draft, you will definitely need to have beta readers give you feedback. As the author, assessing how confusing the story is becomes difficult. You already know where it is going. ",
