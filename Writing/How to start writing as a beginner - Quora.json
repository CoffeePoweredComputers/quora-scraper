            "answer_text": "I didn\u2019t write for the first five years since I wanted to write. I thought I would churn out the all time best one piece article that\u2019s gonna shake the world. I would think up the next harry potter idea or next Game of thrones series and just kill it. I waited five years. Nothing happened. I never did anything. The golden moment never came. The right time never came. I thought I had to think up of something \u201cworth\u201d writing about. I thought people want to listen to my opinions. I started writing opinions. And nobody gave a shit. My opinions aren\u2019t what makes me unique as an individual. I didn\u2019t realize that. My experiences are what makes me unique. My experiences with BITS, my experience with depression, my experience with the girl I got a date with is what makes me different. When I started sharing those experiences than it actually started adding value to other people\u2019s lives. They could relate to the experiences. They could relate to my struggles. The way I handled those struggles added value to other people. I started my blog cum podcast Finding Zarathustra with the same aim in mind. I would talk to different people trying to gather their experiences and share it with everyone. These interesting people at my college would never otherwise come and share anything with the world. They might share their opinions but never their experiences. Something which is really valuable but they don\u2019t realize. So how do you start writing?Write about that day when your mom kicked you out of the house , about that day when you proposed to your girlfriend or about the time when you went for an internship but were made to do dumb shit. Don\u2019t write opinions. Nobody cares what you think of Donald trump. It doesn\u2019t add value to other people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s not what makes you unique. Your experiences make you unique. So my opinion on writing is not to write opinions. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that you are young. If so, I am really pleased that you are interested in writing. To be able to write well will give you more advantages in the future than I can even think of. And if you can write well, you can think well. There are a couple of things to think about. Number one is to read. Read books, read magazines, read articles, read those magnificent answers on Quora. Pick subjects that you enjoy and read, read, read. While you are reading pay particular attention how the author describes things. How does those words that the author put on paper provide an image in your mind? How did it get from your paper to your mind? The author says something well, and you can imagine it perfectly. Pay attention to to how the author does this. Number two. Start writing by describing things. Simple things. It doesn\u2019t have to be written well, but it must be written. \u2018I looked out the window and saw the grass. The grass was green with a little bit of brown mixed in. And there was a sidewalk\u2019. A short descriptive passage. Maybe tomorrow you will look out the window and notice something else. \u2018The grass needs mowing. There is a little lump of something there. Uh oh. I think it is dog poop. It must Mrs. Smith\u2019s dog from next door. My father is going to be mad.\u2019 Next, instead of looking out the window at your lawn, just imagine what your lawn looks like. Roam across and around and through your lawn in your mind. Let your mind explore your lawn. \u2018If I shrunk my self real tiny and walked through the grass it would be like I was in a jungle. It would be scary but fun too. Mrs. Smith\u2019s dog poop would look like a stinky mountain. What if I saw an ant? A grasshopper? A bug? Would it look like a monster?\u2019 And so it starts. By observing and describing what you observe you are training your mind to see things \u2014 things you normally don\u2019t see. You will look at a lamp on a table and notice that it needs dusting and that it has funny designs on it. You will look at your unmade bed and discover that if you look at those twisted covers and sheets in a certain way they look like waves on the ocean in a storm. Or maybe look at it another way you can see an animal, a sheep you think. And you wonder how a sheep got in your bed. Your mind learns to explore. When you mind explores, your writing improves and explores. Don\u2019t worry too much about writing a story that makes sense. Don\u2019t even try to write a story. Describe things. The describe how you feel about things. \u2018The grass makes me feel sad. I guess it is because it is so plain and flat. There is no excitement or fun in my lawn. Maybe if there was a tiny dinosaur lost in the grass jungle. Oh that\u2019s stupid. But you know if Marvin, that is his name, could make it to the sidewalk then he would know where he was. Maybe I should look out the window again and see where he is and where he should go. With Marvin I\u2019m not sad anymore.\u2019 Don\u2019t worry too much about making sense. Don\u2019t worry about punctuation and any of those rules. Just write about what you see and what you imagine and what you feel. Describe stuff. When you get to where you can write a lot of words about the simplest things, you are a writer. Most people cannot do that. You have trained your mind and your eyes to see things and your talent to write it all out. This is how I would advise you to start writing as a beginner. Go for it. ",

After you wake up, think about your dream last night. Sit at a desk with a computer or a pad and paper. Write down what you dreamt about. See which of your dreams interest you into spending time with them. Work on turning those thoughts into a story which has a beginning, a middle and an end. Write the beginning down. Revise it. Now go for the middle. Revise it. Now try to come up with an ending. Look at what you\u2019ve written. It\u2019s a good start, but not worth showing to someone. Go over it again, and change it till you\u2019re happy. Sit on it for a day and then re-read it. It isn\u2019t that good. Rewrite it. Show it to someone who will lie and say that they like it Now show it to two or three people with no emotional investment in you or your writing. They will give you some advice. If two strangers give you the same advice \u2014 make your story shorter or longer\u2014- take it. Rewrite it again. Rewrite it again just in case. Go to a writing conference that has \u201cpitch sessions.\u201d Pitch your idea to an agent or publisher. They should also give you advice and promise you that they will get back to you. They\u2019re lying. Rewrite your story again. Now, tell the agent or publisher that you\u2019ve taken their advice. They will tell you to submit your story. If they ask you for money, don\u2019t trust them. Find someone else, perhaps at another writing conference. Send out your story again. It wil be accepted. Write another story. You will have an easier time this time. Submit your story. It will be published. Sell your story to Hollywood. It will be turned into a television eries. Have the producers ruin your story by having a heroine burn down Kings Landing with a dragon. Feel depressed and not write for a few years.

            "answer_text": "I am no author or writer. I am writing this answer to show you , you can write. Trust me on this. No, I am asking you to trust yourself on this. To write, one must form sentences. No big deal. All you need to do to write effectively is to pay attention to what a sentence is and how to write it effectively. It is \u201cgroup of words that makes complete sense\u201d. See the two things in bold again, WORDS and COMPLETE SENSE. Get better at words by learning vocabulary. Start making sense by learning Grammar. All it takes to become a writer is use right words and knowing how to put them rightly. Didn\u2019t expect this mundane,boring advise which you know from kindergarden is to \u201clearn some vocabulary and Grammar to become writer\u201d, do you? But you see,I am writing now and have already written 50+ words which you are reading now. I am no master of vocabulary nor grammar. Infact, I am bad at them.If I am good at grammar, I would have written last sentence as \u201cI am good at neither vocabulary nor grammar\u201d.Without big words and weak grammar(I hope not without sense), if I can write this far, what is stopping you to become writer? I am coming to that. It is not vocabulary or grammar or some other stupid reason you think that is stopping you to write.Scrap that.Listen. It is you stopping yourself to write. Your little voice of hesitation stopping you to write.I repeat again. I repeat this because it is so important. You can write without great vocabulary and with no soild Grammar.All you need is to small courage to kill that little voice of hesitation and just write. Yes. \u201cJust write\u201d. Writing this unstructured/low standard/poor word choice/ containing wrong spellings like soild(in above paragraph) etc., are part of writing game. All, without any doubt, All writers write bad initially. You must be scolding your stars which made you read this stupid thing today.I am NOT sorry If I made you sick today. This is necessary,much needed,unavoidable for me or to any writer to get better at writing. Thank you! You got the message? Just write. ",

            "answer_text": "No matter what type of writer you are (writing novels, stories, poetry, short tales, quotes, anything to everything), these tips will help you improve your writing skills. Be Original - At first, this point might not come in your way. But when you've spent a lot time on writing, you will face the writer's block. This means that there will come a point of time where you lack ideas to write and you wish to copy (plagiarise) someone's work. Don't plagiarise! You will get pass through and you would write even better. Just be original. You know the consequences of not being original.Read - As much as you can. Read when free, read when busy, read when sick, read when healthy, read when stuck while writing, read when writing isn't that big of an issue. In short, read a lot. You might have seen this point almost on every answer on Quora! Still wondering why?Cut Using Adverbs \u2018very' & \u2018really' - This is something every writer finds the most difficult to do.The weather is very hot..You look very pretty \u2026Very is very important word....This is really amazing!I'm really honest\u2026See? How a sentence becomes ordinary by using \u2018very\u2019 & \u2018really' almost all time? Cut them. Improve your vocabulary, learn new better words that fit into your writings.   These will certainly help you. Write when writing, edit when editing - This point works wonders (not literally wonders though :D). Editing is an important and interesting part of writing. You refine, redo, reinvent your work. But make it a habit to write everything down now and edit it later.When the deadline is approaching, you have to finish and submit your work, right? So complete your writing first to make you have something to submit. Time left? Start editing!Remember, you have to show your writing, not your editing. So write and then edit it. Don't be in a rush to edit. The ideas you generated will be gone and you will get stuck editing. Write what you would like reading/Breaks - As simple as the title. Keep in mind while writing, \u201cis this what I would appreciate, admire, adore when reading?\u201d If yes, go on. If no, take a break.Listen music in your break. Get motivated to write.Read whatever interests you.Watch TV, movies, videos on anything you love.Your break can last from 1 minute to your entire life (not that long). You will get new, better, creative, innovative ideas. Don't worry. This happens to every writer. It will happen to you too. I guess this is enough for you to know about writing. Hope this answer helps you. Thank You! Edit - I was searching for this link : 30 Indispensable Writing Tips From Famous Authors This will help you better. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people tell you to just write. It\u2019s true, you should open your text editor and write what made you want to write a book in the first place. But if you tried that, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you got stuck. So, other people advise you to plan first. That\u2019s also good advice, but then you start hearing about plot, pace, action-reaction, scene structure, main vs. secondary characters, climax, and by inciting incident your head already starts spinning. Both of these tips are good tips, but since you\u2019re just starting out, both are rather intimidating. So I\u2019m going to suggest something a little bit different. Pick a situation. It can be anything. Choose a situation where there\u2019s a character, and they\u2019re somewhere in a setting, doing their thing. That\u2019s all. Now, think about a problem, a conflict that\u2019ll get into the picture. It can be something small or something big. For example, I picked a situation where my dancer character is dancing as usual. Then, she twists her ankle. Now, you might say, ok, she\u2019ll recover. That\u2019s where you go ahead and continue to keep the problem alive. For example, there\u2019s a big performance next week that\u2019s very, very important to her. But if she can\u2019t be there, what can she do? Well, maybe she can make sure the show won\u2019t run on its scheduled date\u2026 Somehow\u2026 You keep the problem alive, and the story stays alive. I explain it thoroughly here:  The reason I\u2019m suggesting this to you is because this method is simple and it\u2019ll be easier for you to start this way. The concept is simple in your mind when you\u2019re writing, and you can always keep going with it. After you\u2019ve written some things, remember the previous advice: Just write, because overthinking can kill your writing. And try planning, because it may help you not get lost. Keep in mind there are many writers who don\u2019t plan at all. It\u2019s a matter of personal preference and writing style. Another thing I can suggest is writing prompts, meaning, small ideas that you can develop into your own story. The internet is full of them, look it up in google. Here\u2019s one from my channel:  Finally, I wish you luck and don\u2019t forget to enjoy the process. There\u2019s nothing like storytelling. ",

            "answer_text": "People in our time have a wonderful resource in being able to write on computers, move chunks of prose around, save various versions, and avoid the old fashioned process of cut-and-paste, which used to require real paper, scissors, and glue. But we still have the task of getting it down, however randomly and poorly worded. You cannot edit and improve if you have a blank page. First, write down your ideas and words, any old which way, so long as you get them down. Then you can restructure your story or essay, and polish it up. Once you have something you regard as a finished piece, cut the word count by at least 20%. It will, believe me, be 100% better. Read it out loud to yourself to help you find lapses in continuity, bad wording, or \u201cmissing links\u201d \u2014 those places where you understand your chain of reasoning but no one else will. You might also have a friend read it and ask you questions. Buy \u201cThe Elements of Style.\u201d Skip other books about the process of writing. They are useful, most of them, but are best for more advanced writers, and can slow you down in the necessary task of putting the #$@&%*! words on the #$@&%*! paper. You should spend at least four times as much time writing as reading, and beware of falling into the Editing Zone, where like chewing your cud, no fresh grass ever enters the cow. 1,000 new words a day is a good goal to keep you out of the trap of too much reading, or editing the same 24,000 words for a decade and never actually getting your heroine past her first night in the ancient castle. Poor girl, her feet are getting cold. Get her out of there. Becoming a good writer will take years. But you can become a better writer, faster, by putting effort into making each piece as good as you can. Finally, read a lot. (But less than you write.) Shorter collections like essays, comedy, poetry, short stories and so on will show you how to tighten and streamline your writing and make it effective. Plus, you\u2019ll enjoy the reading, if nothing else as a welcome break from the writing. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of writing as a muscle that you strengthen over time by practising. It's simple as that: just write. Obviously not helpful, but you need to expose yourself to different ways of writing so you can really find what you want from it all. This also boosts your confidence with each new project you put yourself into. It'll be very very hard all along the way: You cannot start a journey of this magnitude and expect immediate success, or stardom for that matter. Writing is an art. All artists must SUFFER. But you may enjoy it. There are a few mentionable factors that you must consider: Peer reviews: You need feedback on your writing; constructive feedback. This can be achieved by having mentors, or having your own group of writers. More effectively is posting online where strangers get to criticize you from their couches.Reading: Obviously.Planning: If you have a complete plot for what you want to write, you might as well have 80% of the workload done. The other 20% is just jotting it down. Just... This will take care of plot holes and writer's block, and if you can get to the ending, you're technically a winner. :)Consistency: Is the most critical value in writing, otherwise you'll keep telling your friends about how you've been \u201cwriting your first novel for the last decade\".You only have so much time on this earth, which means you have only so many articles/books/blogs that you can possibly write before none if matters anymore. So go on: create, write before you can't anymore. It might take you 50000 fanfictions for you to be recognized; it might only take 2 novels. You might never be reknown or famous at all, and all your creations disappear in the abysmal internet, or charred in an attic fire. This broad range of possibilities is a test to the perseverance and passion you have towards an agenda: but isn't it the same in all of life undertakings? :) I hope for you the best in your journey. :)) Sonder.

Get a gig writing for a blog or submit to online mags. I started writing before the internet changed the face of books. I wrote, I took classes from community collegee, went to writers\u2019 conferences (you might be able to get a \u201cscholarship\u201d to one if you can\u2019t afford it) and I wrote every day. Again, read. Everything. After a couple of semesters of community college courses, after my first writers\u2019 conference, with no degree, I wrote to the editor of a local magazine and then walked in and got a job writing for that magazine. Pretty soon I was writing features. From that I moved onto a local newspaper. I went from writing straight news, ad copy, etc. to writing features for them including cover stories. I learned on the job. I had been writing short stories and poetry since I was a teen. Twenty years after high school I had my regular gig working a regular job and I had to do six hour turnarounds on articles sometimes. (Careful what you wish for.) Again read. Again, write every day and vary what you write so you don\u2019t get caught up just indulging yourself without improving. Look, I am not a household name. Never will be. But I have known hundreds of writers, some of them household names. Most writers ghostwrite, sell articles, edit, teach or whatever to make a buck. A lot have second jobs. Maybe you will be an exception to that rule. I hope so. But writing is rewarding in as much as you can often be proud of what you put out there. I have written some pieces that got letters because readers were moved by what I wrote. So, you know what? I will always have that even if I never have an award-winning novel. At this point, I would not suggest that anyone try to be a writer without getting a degree unless you can talk an editor somewhere into letting you learn on the job. It would be tough, but there you go. ",

Fiction, poetry, nonfiction, try a little of everything, whatever inspires you. The same goes for reading. In order to pursue writing, you have to figure out what you want/like to write, and the only way to do that is to read, write, and experiment. You also need to remember that, in the beginning, you're probably not going to be spectacular. You'll have potential for sure, but you must hone this potential in order to become a good\u2014let alone great\u2014writer. This will involve lots of practice, lots of feedback, lots of revisions, and lots of scrapped ideas. This can be the most frustrating part of being a writer but, for many, it's also the best. To see yourself get better and better, to see how far you've come and to just immerse yourself in the process of pouring your heart out onto the page and then refining it, gives you an incredible feeling of pride and accomplishment, even before you're ever published. If you're already engaging in that part of becoming a writer and are preparing to proceed to publication, your first step is to do your homework. Find out which publications and which agents would be the best fit for your work and, more importantly, might be looking for something like it. While you're doing this homework, make certain your work is ready to be published; workshop it, get other avid readers to give feedback, because most writers genuinely can't tell the true quality of their work, especially after working with it for days, months, maybe even years. The pursuit of writing is a long and challenging path but also rewarding. It takes time, patience, and perseverance, but so long as you never stop working on your craft, you'll find at least some satisfaction in your work. ",

You need to have an idea where you want to get before you can start moving toward getting there. From that point forward, you get started writing by\u2026 reading \u2014 articles, books, whatever on your chosen subject (unless you aim to write books; that\u2019s a whole nother discussion!). Next, you need to settle on a specific topic, and think through \u2014 \u2018thinking\u2019 by putting notes on paper (or a computer screen) \u2014 what you want to write on that topic. Do you need to do research? If so, do it. If you don\u2019t think you do (need to do research), you\u2019re probably wrong! If for no other reason than to confirm what you already know you know, do some research to confirm what you think to be true. Write an outline. If you don\u2019t know how to write an outline, ask a question here. Even after 50+ years as a writer, I still use an outline \u2014 sometimes just a mental one, sometimes working from the end back to the beginning: I want to get to Z; To get there, I need to have done Y, and before that, X. Some editors and writing instructors advise that when you think you\u2019re finished with whatever you\u2019re writing (assuming it\u2019s not a book!), take the last paragraph and make it the first one. Though I seldom do that in my blogs, http://Foodtrades.com and TheRewriteDesk.com, I kinda-sorta apply that logic in almost everything I write \u2014 except, perhaps, in answers on Quora. Here, it\u2019s sometimes necessary to clarify the question before formulating an answer. ",

Well, of course, we need to have just that basic language in place, and the rest depends on how badly we want to write! Honestly, the more critical things that we need for writing well are what all of us already have: a heart that beats for the world around us; and a head that can add a few interesting spins to those beats. I believe a piece of writing gets great because it connects and it works. Great writing is democratic because the writer appears to be one of us. Ornate writing can win us a few gasps but it doesn't usually connect. It reads lovely if you can get it right without going overboard, but nine times on ten, it may just not work.  When language rules our head, thoughts become secondary and we simply bead them into the language for the heck of it. It's like putting the cart before the horse. It's like forgetting to serve food in our silverware during a dinner! When the medium begins overpowering the message, we need to sit up and shake our head, and shake it hard. Yeah, times change, and what's great also changes. But whatever tugs our heart hasn't changed for ages. And it's content that does the trick, not language. sanjivashukla@gmail.comPosted from Quora on BlackBerryZ10 ",

            "answer_text": "As others have said, just start writing. Know that most of what you produce at first may not be very good. But that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s all practice and the more you practice, the better you will be. If you don\u2019t know what you want to write, pick up a pen or pull up your keyboard and sees what comes out. If you know what you want to write, start writing in that style (every form of writing is different. writing short stories won\u2019t necessarily teach you how to write novels). Watch instructional videos (youtube has them by the thousands), read instructional articles. Write every day. Write what comes to mind even if it feels stupid in the moment. Some of it will make more sense in retrospect and some will not, but you never know until you get it down on paper. Review it, improve it where you can, correct errors you see, give it a good polish. Cut out parts that don\u2019t make sense, don\u2019t need to be there, or drag down the piece. Elaborate on the parts that need elaboration. Rearrange things if necessary. If you\u2019re doing it right, you will be doing it more than once. And then get that writing out there. Answer questions on Quora. Start a blog. Get involved in a discussion board for people writing the same sorts of things you are. Make friends and, above all GET FEEDBACK!!! I cannot overemphasize that. The best way to learn to make yourself a better writer is to listen to what people have said about what you\u2019ve already written. Learn to ignore \u201cthis sucks, die in a fire!\u201d type reviews (they will only depress you and most are coming from trolls and assholes more than people who genuinely had a problem with your work). When you get \u201cthis is great, write moar!!!\u201d reviews, don\u2019t just smile to yourself and rest on your laurels. Politely ask for details and clarifications about what makes it good, and how it might have been better. And always pay attention to those precious \u201cthis could have been better in this way, this way, and this way\u201d reviews. They mean that someone was interested enough by what you just wrote to take the time to give you detailed feedback. And you can take that feedback and use it to self-improve. Write as much as you can. Know you won\u2019t always be able to write in a given day. Don\u2019t let that discourage you. Keep your goals small and know that failing at one isn\u2019t the end of the world. Remember, writing is a process, not a single event. It takes time and repeated applications of effort, over days, weeks, months, sometimes even years. But every bit you write brings you a bit closer to a finished product. And that means that ever word you write, whether you keep it or scrap it, is something to feel good about. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of the helpful tips that I\u2019ve gathered over the years are - Observe - Your observation skills, is the first aspect that marks the difference between a writer and a non-writer. For example, the way you describe a person\u2019s eyes should be different from a non-writer, which is possible only when you observe the concerned person more closely as compared to the others.Imagination - Your imaginative skills are as essential as your presentation skills. continuing with the above stated example, a writer would describe a pair of eyes as \u201can ocean of emotions\u201d, \u201ca reflection of heart\u201d, \u201chazel coloured dream\u201d and so on, whereas others may be comfortable with just \u201cdeep\u201d.Language - You should be proficient in the language you use. Grammatical errors are just not acceptable. You should also make sure to be aware of the intricacies of the subject, for example, what is a poem, what are the kinds of poems, their format, style and many other details.Presentation - How you present your work also holds a great deal of importance. It is human nature to judge the book by its cover or what can be called as the first look. Make sure that the presentation is at par with the content of the book.Content - The content should be well formatted, so that reading is a comfortable process for the readers. The drafting should be taken care of. Every time it is not necessary to make use of gaudy fonts, the written matter should be powerful enough to grab and retain the attention of the readers.Themes - Writing something that has been written by many, or is being written by many, doesn\u2019t sell in the long run. It becomes too mainstream. Choose a theme that you\u2019re well aware of and is unique. That will help you leave a mark on your readers.Just a note - In the present scenario, the number of poetasters has increased indefinitely. ",

            "answer_text": " I really like this question. It reminds so much of myself at the very beginning. Your starting point depends on the reason you would like to have the skill of writing. It could be (1) a tool to share your thought to the world via words, (2) a hobby in free time, or (3) a way of branding for your profession. From that, you can get on researching and practicing on your writing style. Personally, writing in general is an interest that I can show my love with the beauty of words, and writing in particular is to improve my English usage (I am not a native English speaker). Additionally, writing is an adequate way for me to express my viewpoint comfortably rather than standing in front of a crowd to speak. If you are an introvert, you will get what I mean. So, how can you start to write as a beginner? Find a BIG ENOUGH reason that you have to start writing.Read, read and read. It is the best way to searching for your writing style. If you have not had something in your mind yet, let can spend time to read some of your favorite writers on Quora, or the authors of your favorite books. If you are not interest in reading, I am not sure about writing either.Take it small. Do not rush to write a whole essay but a few lines are worth to give yourself a reward. Write about anything that makes you inspirational. Pick a topic that you can share with your friends all day.Always have a proper structure in your mind. Even if you call yourself a creative writer, the organization of your writing is a must. It makes your way of sharing is easily followed by the readers. The only thing related to creativity is your content.For more than 20 years of my life in the past, I have never thought that I loved writing. However, I am now extremely fond of writing on Quora. That is when I have found a BIG ENOUGH reason. Hope you find yours! ",

            "answer_text": "That was already your step one. You just wrote a question in one of the greatest site that supports content writers by providing them with contents to write or queries of other content writers to answer and I suppose that to be an achievement from your side already. But if you suppose to take up a career in writing, you need to finalize which makes you a better writer : content or creative. Some people tend to write creative content better and might even end of publishing novels that later turn out to be critically acclaimed for its imaginary story setup, like J.K. Rowling who wrote the Harry Potter series. Some people tend to write content oriented write-ups which are more easily income generating and also only needs a bit of a research where as the former might even take years for a person to be known and acclaimed. If you are talking about content writing here I have some real basic ideas like : Start and write on your own blog.Read and expand your vocabulary.Get yourself the knowledge about the current affairs and stay updated.But all this is not just enough to be a successful content writer with a wide skill set. I would recommend you to take up a course on content writing that might prepare you to become a perfect content writer or even secure your career as a content writer. After having done a really deep research in the topic I have ended up recommending IIM SKILLS to people who have the desire to do something in the content writing field, because like any other field you do need knowledge about how the work is to be done effectively so that you can get paid a real decent amount and have a secured job at some prestigious company . So what makes IIM SKILLS to be the recommended one from my point of view is that:It has tutors who are classified as Industry experts .They have a good field record for the past 5 years and has been the lead in the market.The certification they provide has international value and recognition.They also provide you with job placements and placement training programs that help you get placed in companies like Amazon who also basically help IIM SKILLS.I strongly recommend to take up this course and enjoy the benefits here or there are other institutes or websites that also provide you the option of this course like Udemy and EDX. Hope you are clear on where to start and head your career as a successful writer. ALL THE BEST!! ",

            "answer_text": "Anything big starts with baby steps. To start writing, before anything else, prepare your mind to not compare yourself with any one else. Your writing is a reflection of you, and you are unique. So don\u2019t compare your writing with that of others. Everyone has his or her own way of writing. So also don\u2019t ask for approvals from anyone.After that select good and appropriate platforms to showcase your writing where you can get maximum readers and support. Instagram, Quora or any blog page such as WordPress, Tumblr, etc.Make sure, you choose varied topics. Don\u2019t confine your self to any specific topic. Make material for audience with different topic interests.AND, the easiest part is WRITING. Write your heart out. Stay original and unique.Just follow what your heart says, and you\u2019ll reach your destination. xoxo",

            "answer_text": "I want to start by saying that nothing ISN\u2019T worthwhile. My sister-in-law did a blog for fun and isn\u2019t exactly a great writer. But, she made her blog fun and quirky through her writing and made it to 200k page views in about 10 posts? Anyone\u2019s work is worthwhile. I see everyone is telling you to write. Whilst this is partially true there is something that should be taken way more into consideration. That is reading. Writing is a practice, reading is where you get the knowledge. You don\u2019t read? Well you\u2019re going to struggle to get a grasp for how others write or how you should write for your readers. Writing will help to a limit. I have recently begun writing my novel (and I won\u2019t lie I have got a published short story) so I understand the annoyance/struggles of where you should start writing. A strong opener goes a long way. Start with a question to draw in your reader or something that is so descriptive and inticing that it will give your audiance goosebumps from the first paragraph.Make it clear and not clunky. God, I am a king at clunky writing in my first drafts. My writing style is unique and with that follows the clunkiest of clunky texts. It is so important to have something easy to read that doesn\u2019t detract from quality.Also questions always leads to answers and answers always leads to ideas. For example, ask yourself, what am I writing and why am I writing it? There are people out there who can assess your work if you\u2019re worried about being a lack lust writer (though, I wouldn\u2019t let something like this sway you.) What are you writing? And I wish you any luck! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cYour cousin was killed.\u201d I was working as a full-time maintenance manager in a manufacturing plant. It was a hot day like many others in the Northeast region of Brazil and at lunchtime, I was feeling weird but couldn\u2019t explain exactly why. That\u2019s when I received the news that my cousin was killed with 10 shots in the back. I was devastated. Even though I knew that it was common for normal people to get killed in Brazil, I would never imagine that would happen to my family. After the funeral, I was scrolling through Facebook and felt like I had to get something out of my chest or I\u2019d explode. I just wrote what I felt, pushed the publish button and went to bed. Surprisingly enough, over the next following days, I got over a dozen of likes and shares. My relatives read my post at the church meeting and said that many people cried afterward. At that point, I realized I might have a way with words and decided to take a step further and develop my craft. Since then, I\u2019ve posted on Medium, Quora and applied for writing jobs on Upwork. I\u2019m far from being the best writer but I can tell you one thing. There\u2019s nothing holding you back from writing. You shouldn\u2019t wait for a breakthrough, inspiration, circumstances or whatever to feel like writing. The only thing you should do right now is to pick a subject that interests you and write about it. After that, publish your work somewhere. That\u2019s it! Simple, but not easy. ",

Of course, part of that process is feedback. You can\u2019t tell the difference between word usements that are not so good and effective, insightful use of language if you don\u2019t have any feedback. That means letting other folks see your word usements, either by showing people your work even when you think it\u2019s not so good or by doing it in public places like Quora. But primarily, it\u2019s a matter of practice. You learn to write by writing. ",

I never even had any urge to write. Even when I had something to write, yet I never took the efforts. I read read read on how to start writing, how to refine sentences and create beautiful, engaging prose that inspires. But mind it, all this while I didn\u2019t try writing a sentence! So what changed? Why am I writing today? Because I have to start somewhere. You can\u2019t get better at anything without doing it. Sure, it takes efforts, but it\u2019s a phase. Just start by writing whatever trash you can. Gradually your mind will transform your vague notions into actual usable ideas and you\u2019ll learn to put those into words seamlessly. That\u2019s what I am doing. Starting with this answer as my first! Hoping to learn in the process and become a better writer to be able to express my thoughts clearly. Thanks! ",

When writing first chapters \u2014 of thrillers, especially \u2014 it\u2019s fun to hint at trouble, lies, secrets, and scandal, but not give away everything. In my novel, The Heiresses, I start with the lines: \u201cYou know the Saybrooks. Everyone does.\u201d This family is wealthy, NYC royalty, living a charmed life. But at the bottom of page one, things start to darken \u2014 I mention that every family member has a secret, and that they\u2019re a bit cursed. Who isn\u2019t tempted to read on about that? Use a setting as the inciting incident. I\u2019ve already mentioned the \u201cinciting incident\u201d \u2014 the story beat that really gets the plot going. Sometimes, a place itself can cause or be the inciting incident. If it is, why not start the character there (or at the very least, on a mode of transport going there) to dive right in? A great example is in The Shining, where Jack is at the infamous Overlook Hotel interviewing for a new job. The reader thinks this is going to be a fresh start for him and his family\u2026 but of course, they\u2019re wrong. Stephen King could have filled the first pages with exposition of Jack back in his old life, but starting the novel at the hotel \u2014 which is a character in itself \u2014 plunges the reader into the story. Up the stakes within the first few pages. In a thriller, it\u2019s always great to start with a murder, a body found, or someone going missing \u2014 it sets up the problem and goal for the rest of the novel.

            "answer_text": "Before you can begin writing, you need to know what you are writing about. First, look at the writing prompt or assignment topic. As you look at the prompt, note any key terms or repeated phrases because you will want to use those words in your response. Then ask yourself: On what topic am I supposed to be writing?What do I know about this topic already?If I don\u2019t know how to respond to this assignment, where can I go to find some answers?What does this assignment mean to me? How do I relate to it?The best way to learn how to write is to start writing a paragraph.A paragraph has following parts: Topic Sentence: Give a short introduction about the topic that you are writing about. Supporting Sentence One: In the Supporting Sentence one, Tell about the advantages and disadvantages of the subject. Supporting Sentence Two: In the Supporting Sentence Two, explain the topic with detail. Supporting Sentence Three: In the third and last Supporting sentence, include the example\u2019s about the topic. Concluding Sentence: As you can see in the picture down below, In the Concluding Sentence refers back to the topic sentence and sums up the main idea of the paragraph.  A paragraph should be neither too short nor too long. As a general rule, avoid single-sentence paragraphs. If your paragraphs run longer than a page, you are probably straining the grader\u2019s thought span. Look for a logical place to make a break or reorganize the material. Indent each new paragraph five spaces. ",

            "answer_text": "How to start writing? The answer is simple pick up a pen and a notebook and start scribbling. I mean seriously, start scribbling. The very essence of writing is well, writing and a creative mind. There will be thousands of blogs, articles and people on the net advising you how to write a story. But, think of all the great people who lived centuries ago but their legendary pieces of literature still exist. Nobody at that time would have told them how to write it. They did what they did because they had a story to tell and they loved the means of conveying it i.e. by writing. As baby steps you don't even have to write a story, write about anything, ex. Your favourite place, food, artist or write down your opinion of the things happening around. Build a connection between what you have in your mind and what you are writing. Read more books for references and ideas. Slowly you will begin to understand where your strength and weaknesses lie, hence you can improve. If you want to dwell deeper I suggest you make an account on pinterest and choose writing as an interest. It is very helpful. In the end, writing is all about enjoying the process and finding your voice in the narrative. You have to be patient, it can be frustrating at times. ",

If it is creative, then you need to expand your imagination to earn a rather steady income because you get paid for your imagination here. But the content writing is a lot more productive although here you need a bit of a knowledge on how to approach the issue and handle the content,which is why you will be needing to attend some course that helps you get a better understanding on the issue to begin with. As i went on digging a little deeper you will need a certificate of international standard to work as the content writer at companies like Amazon where the salary scale is much more better. And the only institute capable of promising you a internationally recognized certificate will be IIM SKILLS.You should visit their site to know a bit detail about their course and read the reviews once you are there.I recommend IIM SKILLS because: The outstanding user reviews from the students who have taken up their course for content writing.Tutors are Industry experts and you will have expert guidance.The courses have lifetime access and hence you need not shift your priorities or rush.They provide job placements and placement training programs to get you through interviews of companies like Amazon.Also the certification is of international standard and will be acceptable anywhere in the world so that your content writing life does not have to stay within your country.These are the reasons why I decided to recommend IIM SKILLS to you because I thought as a content writer at a beginner stage you have a lot to develop and grow financially and will definitely be possible with the help of IIM SKILLS. Hope it helps ! All the best for your future. ",

And more importantly, read a lot the more you read, the more you get ideas and skills about writing. A few tips before you start off writing professionally: Write daily: I suggest you to write more and more on anything you want. You can start off by writing a diary. Maintaining a diary requires daily effort. Try to schedule a time each day to sit down and write. Try to write at least 2-3 pages daily (or more).Do research before writing: Before you sit down to write, make sure you have done all your research. This way all you have to do is write without stopping.Write outline: Think about what you want to write. Write down the points you want to cover. This will help you write easily because you know what you want to write and how exactly you are going to write about it.Read regularly: Read a lot, the more you read, the more you get ideas and skills about writing.Keep it precise: Express yourself clearly and concisely. Keep it brief, simple and clear and try to write to the point.Thanks for A2A ",

I hope you know where I am proceeding with this. The only way I was able to finish my novel was by imagining it a day prior. I used to set targets for myself, initially it was 500 words a day and towards the end, I was writing up-to 3500\u20134500 words a day! I used to, before sleeping, imagine a structure for the next day's writing and let my imagination run. Before I used to konk off, I had a pretty fair idea as to what I wanted to write. My advise, just start writing. No matter what, just write... Words, I have seen, only flow out once you have a habit of writing everyday. Do check on out my book on Amazon.

If not that, listen to other people\u2019s conversations in restaurants or coffee shops, or on the bus or train, and extrapolate their conversation.

WordPress has a good community and this is missing in Blogspot. I would not recommend the latter.  If you struggle to find topics to write on, create a disqus account. Disqus is used as comment section for many websites. You can comment on the articles written on the topics you are interested in, and people can upvote or downvote it, or post reply to your comments. Quite an interesting platform when you are just starting.  You can check Tumblr as well that is widely recognized as a micro-blogging site. Write short 100 or 150 word posts to get a momentum. Again, the community is large and you may find many interesting people to follow. ",

If you have neither use a pen and paper but either way you need to write. You can start with word sprints, which basically means you time yourself and within that time you basically splurge out word vomit, the key here is to not stop writing. After the time is up you look over what you wrote and see if you like it or not and what you can edit. Another thing is, you can't be a writer if you aren't a reader. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s just not possible. If you\u2019re in a slum read one of your favourite scenes, or if you need inspiration be a magpie and borrow ideas. Learn to let go of the fear of rejection. I\u2019ll let you in on a secret: the best thing about writing is\u2026 that you don't have to show anyone. Writing can be as private or as public as you want. I suggest that when you\u2019re starting out you should keep what you write to a select few until you are more confident. One thing that really helped me write was NaNoWriMo, it\u2019s a challenge where during the month of November you have to write 50,000 words. This forced me to write write write, no matter whether it was good or bad. During the month of may they do this thing called Camp NaNo where people go back and edit their work. You can also set your own challenges and goals, which is super cool. Here\u2019s a link: National Novel Writing Month Anyways, carry on. Write, read, and write more. ",

There are three places in a story you can start. 1. This is the very beginning of a story, where there's no past story or underlying plot. James and Lilly are enrolled in Hogwarts. You write on and on until you finally reach the first Harry Potter book, which begins...2. Harry knows nothing about his parents. He still has a lot to learn, the future and his past included. Or...3. You can write as if everything has already happened. You can write in Harry's point of view of him recalling absolutely everything in his past. At this point, everything's decided and you know that the main character lives happily, or not-so-happily, ever after.  2 and 3 can go over and over again. There's always some past, but #1 means that there's nothing vital to your story in the past. You could write your books like J.K. did, or you could write as if it's all over. You could add so many sequels. They could all be Harry talking about his past, or, you could go back to Number two and put all of Harry's adventures in the past, write in #2's way with his children, or perhaps Hermione and Ron's children. So you've just got to stick your nose into the story and ruffle things around until you've found a place to start. You could put a dark past with the character and the villain already in progress. You could have them starting to become enemies. You could have them recollecting on how easy it was for them to hate each other.I hope I could help! And remember, there's only one perfect beginning. Make sure you've got the right one before it's written in stone. ",

RESEARCH:- Do lots of research on some topic say fashion and try to gain as much knowledge of it that if someone asks you about its history, emerging trends, latest updates you can answer.In this way your confidence will boost and also you will have some content.2.READ A LOT:- Read some novels,magazines, journals to get the essence of compiling your thoughts and proper format of any piece of writing.3. SHOW SOME IMPROMPTU SKILLS:-  After this, just write something and try to use every weapon you have; your vocabulary,subject study,life experience, humour to make it interesting and engrossing.4. IMPROVE THE MISTAKES AND CARRY ON : There would be lots of errors, incorrect usage of words, vague points(May be), in your impromptu piece so just improve them by showing it to someone experienced or self assessment and by repeating this you will surely emerge as a good writer.

Then you need to take into consideration what audience you are writing for. Such as, children\u2019s books. You need to take that part into serious consideration when writing. Is it going to be a book that everyone can enjoy or just a particular group? Don\u2019t fall into these pitfalls of writing a book about yourself or self help crap. I truly believe when the world comes to an end and there is no one else to make toilet paper, these books will be the first in line to be placed on the shelf for use. Garbage. Especially today\u2019s so called celebrity books about themselves. Second, if you are going to write or be a writer, don\u2019t call it your \u201ccareer.\u201d Just be a writer. The second you start calling it your career choice, that makes it so you are writing for the $$ and not the art of it. In the beginning, the Greeks wrote to better themselves and to pass on their teachings/lessons learned to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, now days, writing is so tied to political or racial views (at least here in the good old USA). Hemingway often wrote as if he was writing to himself and no one else. He would go for long walks with a pen and paper in hand so he could write down the things he saw that peaked interest (sunsets, the weather, people sitting at a bench). These things were true and quite often forgotten or over looked. He considered them the most important things in his writing. ",

I assume that you are an observant person so whatever you have seen or learnt in life, pour everything out in the form of words and sentences. DO NOT try and follow the footsteps of any writer who you have ever read and admire. If it's a story of a life and around, knit characters from real life, mix it with emotions and imagination. Use your skill of observing people. Write in pieces, remember if you don't like something you have written, you can use it in future at some other place and scenario or story. Set goals; it could be words, lines or even pages. Once done, see if you are satisfied, read everything as a reader, correct your unknowingly made mistakes. Ask for a second eye. Appreciate criticism. Talk to publishers, tell them your preferences. They will help you with everything needed in publishing and marketing. Share once you are done writing your first book, I would want to buy the book. Ask for any help if need be. Love, Snehil ",

This also allows me the opportunity to sit down and write one chapter in an hour or less. After a month of just writing a little each day, you could a substantial chunk of your book complete. The main thing I am trying to point out is, don\u2019t get overwhelmed thinking, \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d Once you think you can\u2019t do something, it is so easy to believe it.

            "answer_text": "Hey thanks for the A2A . You question is a bit vague. I am not a writer or something but still. If you are someone who hasn't written before then first you just have to devote yourself to writing. You can start by writing a journal or something. And the more you write, the better you get at it, the greater your sense of how words should flow as they express thoughts, observations, and feelings. There are no shortcuts here. You just have to keep doing it until it becomes as natural as breathing. I personally like those books which involve details. Those in which the emotions etc things are explained. You know deepen your descriptions, add character defining sensory details. If you are writing, you have already become a writer. The readership comes later. The second thing that will help you become a writer is to read a lot. Romance. Fantasy. Fiction. Anything. The more of their language you can get into your head, the better. When you feel ready and have a small body of work you feel good about, seek out other writers who can help you. Share your work and know what they think about it. If all they do is criticize and tear your work to shreds, don't give up. Try to do better. Eventually you will get more compliments than criticism. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "This may seem contrived, but the best way to start writing is to just start writing. It doesn\u2019t matter if what your writing is relevant to your end goal, but just getting in the habit of writing on a regular basis will go a long way. Try to write every day. It doesn\u2019t need to be a lot, and it doesn\u2019t need to be formal, in fact it shouldn\u2019t be. Allow yourself to write without editing yourself until you are done. Write 1000 word without editing yourself at all, then let it sit for a day and come back. You may only end up using 100 of those words, but you couldn\u2019t have gotten there without the other 900. Editing yourself as you write is the biggest boon for a writer. It slows you down, injects unnecessary decisions and doubt into a process that should be generative. Writing and Editing are two very different activities and should be kept separate. The only other advice I can provide without knowing more about what specifically you\u2019d like to write is to read a lot. Reading allows you to pick up ideas, patterns, and techniques that will allow you more to express your own ideas better. ",

The very first step is, \u201cJust write\u201d and then beautify it which means rewriting has no substitute. Do it. Choose some fancy diary and pen of your choice to fascinate yourself if that attracts you. Keep a logo such as anything statue, clock or pen that pulls you to write.

If you have thick skin - bearing in mind the John Gabriel\u2019s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory - you can try letting it out on your blog or Facebook to test it on a wider audience.

The beauty lies in the fact that in the back of your mind you are secure that nobody else is going to read it. So just pick a pen(or your laptop) and have a blast. Forget grammar and everything about language. Just write your heart out.Writing and sharing: Write a \u2018paragraph' about something of your interest as social site status. The response from other people will tremendously boost your confidence.Quora: let's agree that answering questions here can give you a boost. :)Short Stories: Before moving to more serious writing, you can start with short stories which doesn't need to have a plot and can be just your day musings. Ruskin Bond's short stories such as the book 'When Darkness Falls' can give you an idea on how to go about it. To get an idea you can visit many online blogs of short stories. If you wish to, check out mine at Short StoriesThen you can move to other stuff like novels and poetry and so on.Happy writing. :) ",

Go out and buy the biggest bound journal you can find. Spend enough money to get a beautiful blank book full of blank pages. (Nowadays a suitable journal might cost $100 or more.) Important to spend enough money on it that you will take it seriously. Save up if you have to. Begin journaling. Write down your thoughts every day, and do this for at least three weeks so it becomes a habit. Record observations, descriptions of things, bits of conversation overheard in the market or on the street. Speculations about the meaning of life. Ideas for stories you might write some day. Thoughts about your childhood. Regrets. Joys. Things you're grateful for. As you begin to put your thoughts down on paper, you will find out soon enough if you want to keep doing this. My bet is that if you are even inclined to ask this question, you probably are a writer, and good luck to you on your journey. ",

If you are not still in school, some communities do offer free, or nearly free, classes in a number of subjects. Some libraries offer writing workshops during November (NaNoWriMo, or National Novel Writing Month) or have writer\u2019s groups. There are also online writing communities. But don\u2019t wait, at least try to begin writing for yourself. Keep a journal or write letters or something\u2014try to write at least 15\u201330 minutes a day, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good, at least it\u2019s a beginning in getting your words down.

On Quora, you can pick & choose the topics/questions you want to write on. So, in a way, your starting trouble is taken care of.  You have the added benefit of learning something new - about what you know & otherwise. And the more you learn, the more you will have something to write about & the more you will be able to write about, in terms of content & depth as well. So what're you waiting for ? Love me(=Quora) like you do ... :D. You know the rest. Just start writing. Good luck.  ",

If you come up with a totally new story while you\u2019re writing (and you will), do the prewriting and get back to your story. If you want to write poetry or short stories, I advise you to read plenty of poetry and/or short stories and just start writing and writing. No matter what you do, talk to other writers.

At the risk of looking like a serial killer, you can look at any random person and imagine what might be going on in his/her life. That alone will give you an idea for a novel, not to mention the trial and error that is a part of your own life. Once you have an idea, you need to write. When someone says \u201cfrom scratch\u201d it often sounds to me as if they are afraid of writing something unworthy, more than they are afraid of the blank piece of paper in front of them. My advice here is to use brute force. That\u2019s right. Bulldoze your way into the first few words, however shaky they may be. It\u2019s important to forget any notions of what a great writer you are going to be and it\u2019s equally important to assume you\u2019re going to be bad at it. Whatever you do, don\u2019t interfere with the scratching of the pen/pencil on paper. Don\u2019t hesitate. Do not stop writing, even if you think what you wrote is gibberish. Even great writers use this method to get themselves out of a writing slump. You can use it to start\u2026from scratch. ",

However, if it's a skill in creating a good writing in literature then it really is a question of what patterns and methods are used that you must observe. Reading a book on it's own won't be all that helpful unless you know what you're looking for. Basically, you need to be looking for a pattern or style. How does the writer get the direction they want to take. I do the same with music a little (I'm still not that good but you can have a listen to some of my stuff if you want, I'll link it below). I listen carefully to the music but not as a work of art but as a series of ideas that have been put together and planned out. I listen for the method that was used in order for me to learn how to create something that has a direction to go in. The same in some ways could apply to literature. The Author has to have a plan of some sort and to know (at least) part of the ending before they can start on the beginning. I hope this helps you and I wish you the best of luck. - that link I was talking about, not intended as spamming, please do not feel compelled to follow it unless you wish to. ",

Because by answering, it means you have to think about the answers, organize it in your head and then write them well so that the readers can easily understand what you have wrote there. If what you mean is to write a short story and even a novel, I think what you need to do is basically the same, the difference is that novel\u2019s scope is deeper. Novel require your thoughts such as characters, behavior, storyline, backgrounds, how it will started and concluded etc. (even surprises if needed). If you still have any trouble, just do it slowly. Every thought goes through your head, you can write it in Word, Notepad or something similar. Once you have time, you can begin to compile and refine that pieces of the idea into a broader and deeper storyline. Or yeah, you can answer questions in Quora as a beginning or practice for you to able write further. Keep learning, cheers :) ",

Even if you don't have a fancy vocabulary and perfect Grammer, just start writing. One can correct their mistakes only after penning it down. Unless you try you will never know how good or bad you are. Write something which is close to your heart, which you think you are really good at. If you like movies start writing reviews. If you like sport start writing match blogs (stats can help). If you are an artist, describe your piece of art. Go with something where you don't need to find subject and words. The words should just flow on paper. Next step, Your opinion towards a topic. May be an argument. You have to do your research on the topic before you start. You cannot use hypothetical situations in your opinion. It needs facts and figures. Using simple language is the key as you want to reach the mass. Example - Indian political scenario Or social issue. If you want to write something fictional. Then it's important you use extravagant language to make it look colorful and indulge your audience Into your world.

In my book, the people are kept complacent and comfortable, so they don't notice or question when the State takes away their freedom. Books were destroyed, not by the government, but by the people, who would rather listen to what the State tells them than pick up a book. Laziness. That's my theme. Whatever theme you choose, it will help you to write even when you don't want to, because when you know what your book is about, and why you are writing it in the first place, you can develop the world and conflicts that can allow your theme to come alive.

Try turning your thoughts into short stories and zoning in on your own style of writing. Some people believe that you need a degree in English or similar to become a writer but, that is completely inaccurate. If you can find a way to make the words in your head turn into a reality on paper, you will have very few troubles becoming a great writer.  If you're referencing learning how to write code.

Your work. What is your work? Novels? Short stories? Articles? Each of those different writing goals have different formats to go online.  For instance, if you write novels, your best option is to turn them into e-books and sell them or give them away through an aggegrator like Draft2Digital, who will submit your e-book to all the retailers - from Amazon to Scribd. If you write articles, you can post them to your blog, or you can contact websites like HuffPost and see if you can write for them. If you write comedy, you can write for Cracked.com - America's Only Humor Site which is always looking for new writers.

So, since what you know best is yourself and your own life you could start with a journal - a diary of what you find interesting about the world around you and your place in it. Once you start to write you may find you would like to write either fiction or non-fiction. One form may suit you better than the other. Think about forms such as sci-fi, historical fiction based on real life persons, real life biographies, current events that concern you, poetry\u2026 play around with whatever comes to mind. Even fiction can contain elements you know from your own experience. Some people start a blog and then turn the articles they post into a book. The key is to write what you enjoy writing about. Get started\u2026 now. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, I think you should start with keeping a journal or diary writing about any significant or noteworthy happenings of the day. You can always go back and retrospect how happy, sad, or angry certain situations made you and how they do not matter so much after a few years. You can also start writing about events, people, hobbies that interest you. For example, if you are a foodie you can write restaurant reviews online, or blog about recipes or places you love to eat at. If you are a movie buff, you can write movie reviews. If you write about things that really inspire you or causes that you really care about, it will give you immense satisfaction too. Maybe you can start blogging and keep yourself motivated enough to write often. You can also try apps like Evernote on your mobile to keep writing on the go. Or you could just update your Twitter and/or Facebook status with your take on the daily happenings. ",

Before that, I mostly wrote at LiveJournal, which is where fans of popular media live and interact. There are certainly lots of opportunities for starting your own blog -- just google and you'll run into a long list. The best way to find options appropriate for you is to start looking for blogs publishing what you are interested in reading and writing. There are obvious places, like Facebook, where it's easy to get a corner and then the challenge is to get other people to start reading you. Other places -- for example, the Disqus communities -- the challenge is to get published. I'd just send an email inquiry with an offer to send samples of your work to the ones which look most promising to you. Good luck! ",

They may even give you some kind of \u201cin\u201d to writing/blogging/publishing if you know the right people and if you feel you\u2019re decent enough for it. But again, either way is up to you. Spell-checks, grammar checks, dictionaries, and thesauruses are your friends! Grammarly and Hemingway app are more sophisticated than those on word programs in that they can break down things like sentence structure. ",

But how to do it? I think it has to become a habit almost like brushing your teeth. Could you start by writing just one sentence every day? Maybe next week you would write two and so on until you feel like starting writing is not something you have to even think about. Writing is not hard, writing good text is hard and being okay with not always writing good text is hard. Editing can be a bit hard but that's why it helps to get others opinions and maybe at some point an editor. But start with the increasing of volume in both reading and writing and I guarantee you will start to write better. ",

Poems tend to start with an image and a bit of language. The issue, of course, is not how to begin, but how to continue after we begin, when or initial inspiration wanes. ",

After that, you will have to decide on whether or not you are going to be a full time or a part time writer. This concept may seem insignificant right now, but believe me, it is not. It is the most important decision you will make, and will affect your book, much more than you think. There are many, many more things to consider, and for this there is a ton of help.

Write as often and as much as you can each day! Carry a notebook around with you and write as often and as much S you can.

Just Start right now; do not wait till you find the best book or course that teaches you how to write! Just Start, write about anything that interests you! I know it would be garbage like, but no problem at all, you will never know what or when your masterpiece would be! The only and one thing that would delay you is procrastination! Waiting to write the best! No; you should write anything and by time you would be better.

So start now and write! ",

Once you have decided on your genre you then need a set of characters. Your main, secondary, attached characters, incidental characters and supporting characters. Then you need a locale and potentially places of interest which will be visited. Finally a plot, what is the story about. Choose a genre that interests you, buy, borrow a couple of the best books from the genre. See if there are any common plot lines, twists etc. Oh yeah. One thing you do need to do is before you write it is write a plan, otherwise like me you will get things in the wrong order, or repeat yourself. Not much but I hope this helps. ",
