            "answer_text": "I'm wondering whether your misspeaking or from a different country, because there are no undergraduate medical students in the United States. Medical school is a graduate school; you enter it after having completed a bachelors degree, which usually takes four years. Dr. Christopher Fox gave a fine answer for an undergraduate premed biology or chemistry major who is able to work on a solid project at the University. My understanding is that during your first year of medical school, you won't be able to do any serious amount of independent work; the people who seem to succeed spend their time studying, sleeping, and not much else.

            "answer_text": "Getting involved with research with one of your professor is the best way, possibly leading to a good quality publication. However, that requires a lot of time and patience because the publication may only come years after the project. I often advise my student who know what specialty the want to get into to find a mentor in that field and work on a case report with them. Many practising physicians have a case or two that they want to publish as a case report but don\u2019t have time. It\u2019s a good and relatively easy opportunity to get published. ",
