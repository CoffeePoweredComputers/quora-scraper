            "answer_text": "BA exams are synonymous to essay like answers, especially the university papers. They consist of 4 questions of 15 marks each and it gets difficult to \u2018think\u2019 and write, rather, recollect the points and answer them in the same manner in the answer sheet. These may be some of the clich\u00e9d steps to follow, but they are helpful.  Here\u2019s what I do/follow:  1. As soon as you get the question paper from the examiner, go through all the questions carefully. Do not give them more than 10 minutes. Within 10 minutes, you need to know which answers are gonna be the content.  2. You start writing the answers. Once you start writing them, however the points are, their oder does not matter, as long as you have mentioned the necessary pointers and have explained them briefly.  3. Contrary to the popular belief, do not write unnecessary sentences and stretch the answer. Just write how much ever you know. The supervisors who correct your papers, they have lots of experience to catch which answer is genuinely explained in detail and which answer has \u2018stories\u2019.  4. All the answers should be given 30 minutes, if you have a time limit of 2 hours for a 60 marks\u2019 paper. If you have more than 2 hours, utilize your time well. Go through the answers if you have spare time after attempting all of them. Highlight the main points with a pencil.  5. Last, but not the least, try to not acquire a doctor\u2019s handwriting, towards the end of your paper. Maintain your pace and attempt each question\u2019s answer on a new page of the answer booklet.  All the best! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi See, college exams, consist of a few questions with heavy marking to each question. My college has 20x3 marking system in Political Science exams. It gets difficult to analyse them and write accordingly, rather, recollect the points and answer them in the same manner in the answer sheet.  As soon as you get the question paper, go through all the questions carefully. Like we used to do it in school, spend around 10 minutes to go through the paper and think about the answer and form it in your head. This helps when you start writing the answers. Once you start writing them, the order of the points does not matter, as long as you have mentioned the necessary pointers and have explained them briefly. Try not writing unnecessary sentences and stretch the answer. This is stupid, you might go off track what you were writing and ruin the answer overall. Just write how much ever you know. The supervisors who correct your papers, they have lots of experience to catch which answer is genuinely explained in detail and which answer has \u2018stories\u2019. For this, you ought to read more and more. The more knowledge you know related to your subject, the more it will help you. Utilize your time well. Distribute your time equally towards each question. Don\u2019t bother about the word limit or anything of that sort, although this doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019d write 5 lines for a 20 marks question, the more you explain your points, the more you\u2019d write. Go through the answers if you have spare time after attempting all of them. And again, prevent yourself from writing stories in answers, that\u2019s not cool. I hope this helps, stay hungry, read more! ",
