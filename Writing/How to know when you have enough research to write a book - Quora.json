            "answer_text": "If it\u2019s non-fiction, I can\u2019t really help you and disregard my answer entirely. Now if it\u2019s fiction or sci-fi, I do that kind of stuff. Something that I\u2019m currently doing is just writing the outlined concept of what is going on, call it the skeleton of the story. I know I want these futuristic concepts, interesting science bits\u2014but I don\u2019t understand how they work enough to describe them. So, following this, I go back over what I\u2019ve written and cross reference it with a little bit of research. Mostly it has to do with architecture. A building might be a significant place of religious standing, so I compile a series of cliches or tropes that might reside around it and just piece it together with enough that the reader can understand what it is, but also still have that aspect of imagination. Since I already know a lot about military stuff, I don\u2019t need to do very much research on that. But how, say\u2026 a detective behaves, how criminal justice works in a real scenario. Recently, I just emailed a local lawyer and asked for a tour of their office and a break down of how everything works for say, a murder case. Though, to be fair, the only reason that person gave me the time of day was because someone from my family is friends with them. The baseline is always going to be the story itself, you have one of those and you are set. From there, if it\u2019s world-building you have a lot of research to do\u2014if it\u2019s a fiction based in the real world, you have considerably less to look for and only need to ensure that it is plausible and realistic. You can even just ask Quora questions in relation to your book, and someone will provide insight. But, like I said, I always just kind of ghost over everything and then once my first draft is done, I double back and start my research from square one. Though, if it is key to the plot, I do a little beforehand to ensure that my general idea isn\u2019t too far off the mark. You\u2019ll know when you know, though. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone does research differently, so everyone completes it differently and at different times. Most writing classes suggest using note cards (paper or electronic) that can be changed and arranged as knowledge of the subject grows. Personally, I think that\u2019s a lot of work. I only do enough research before starting to get a feel for the subject and as I write I do specific research about what I need to know to write the scene I\u2019m working on and, yes, sometimes I must go back later and revise a passage or two to conform with what I just learned. That rewriting involves a tiny bit of time and work compared to what I\u2019d have done if I\u2019d researched everything I thought possible before starting the book. It\u2019s often said jokingly \u2014 though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s truly a joke \u2014 that most of a writer\u2019s research is ignored when writing a story because it turns out to be unnecessary and irrelevant. So in the end research is a tossup. Do enough research before writing to learn a complete subject. Or stop during the writing process to learn what you need to know to write a specific scene. Whichever way you choose will decide when you\u2019ll have done enough research to start writing. ",
