            "answer_text": "As children, most of us are taught to be polite and to say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d It\u2019s usually a matter of us demanding something from our parents, and being asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s the magic word?\u201d We say, \u201cplease,\u201d and grab for the cookie. But before we can get away, it\u2019s always, \u201cand what do you say?\u201d We mumble \u201cthank you,\u201d and take off. As we get older, we usually find that being polite, being grateful, gets us farther than simply demanding something and taking it without acknowledging our appreciation. As submitters (Muslims), we\u2019re very aware of how important it is to be appreciative of God\u2019s blessings. It\u2019s clearly a trait of a believer. GOD rewards those who are appreciative. [Q3:144]Therefore, you shall eat from GOD's provisions everything that is lawful and good, and be appreciative of GOD's blessings, if you do worship Him alone. [Q16:114]Therefore, you shall worship GOD alone, and be appreciative. [Q39:66]We showed him the two paths, then he is either appreciative, or unappreciative. [Q76:3]So, do we really have that much to be grateful for? Just the sun and the moon, the night and the day, the earth and the sky, plants, animals, mountains, rain\u2026. Just everything! What we would do if we had to control all of the things God controls every minute? If we just had to regulate our bodies, tell our heart to beat, our lungs to breathe, our eyes to blink. There would be no time for anything, except, \u201cHeart, beat! Wait, take a breath. Heart, beat! Chew. Blink. Heart, beat!\u201d Yet, every second, all those things go on and we take them for granted. God doesn\u2019t begrudge us that. He doesn\u2019t demand that we remember all those things constantly. He\u2019s taking care of it. But it would be good for us to occasionally stop and be appreciative of how well the system works. Everybody is grateful for the same things -good health, food to eat, air to breathe, a roof over our heads. Big things that we take for granted. Again, we need to stop now and then and thank God that we have those blessings. At the same time, everybody has different things to be thankful for. What are your personal blessings, and do you remember to appreciate the One who created them? The more we can remember and appreciate God, the stronger we\u2019ll become in our submission to Him. In verse 2:152 God tells us: You shall remember Me, that I may remember you, and be thankful to Me; do not be unappreciative. [Q2:152]We certainly don\u2019t want to be among those whom God will forget on the Day of Resurrection. He also tells us in Q14:7 that there are benefits when we remember to be grateful: Your Lord has decreed: \"The more you thank Me, the more I give you.\" But if you turn unappreciative, then My retribution is severe. [Q14:7]It\u2019s not for God that we need to be appreciative. He doesn\u2019t need our worship or our thanks or anything from us: If you disbelieve, GOD does not need anyone. But He dislikes seeing His servants make the wrong decision. If you decide to be appreciative, He is pleased for you. No soul bears the sins of any other soul. Ultimately, to your Lord is your return, then He will inform you of everything you had done. He is fully aware of the innermost thoughts. [Q39:7]It\u2019s for our own growth and development. Every day there are so many things\u2014big and small\u2014that we should be appreciative of. And it\u2019s not just the things that happen, it\u2019s also the things that don\u2019t happen. You travel without an accident; you don\u2019t have diseases; you\u2019re not starving. So, next time you stub your toe, say \u201cThank You, God. I have feet to walk on.\u201d Next time you take a breath of air, say \u201cThank You, God.\u201d God tells us in Q14:34 that we can never be appreciative enough of all the things He\u2019s given us, but we need to try. And the more we thank Him, the more He gives us. What a blessing! ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion,I think everything that God arranges for us is good and has God 's purpose .When  we don't understand,we can  feel painful and upset.    Almighty God says\uff1a\"Because people do not recognize God\u2019s orchestrations and God\u2019s sovereignty, they always face fate defiantly, with a rebellious attitude, and always want to cast off God\u2019s authority and sovereignty and the things fate has in store, hoping in vain to change their current circumstances and alter their fate. But they can never succeed; they are thwarted at every turn. This struggle, which takes place deep in one\u2019s soul, is painful; the pain is unforgettable; and all the while one is frittering away one\u2019s life. What is the cause of this pain? Is it because of God\u2019s sovereignty, or because a person was born unlucky? Obviously neither is true. At bottom, it is because of the paths people take, the ways people choose to live their lives. Some people may not have realized these things. But when you truly know, when you truly come to recognize that God has sovereignty over human fate, when you truly understand that everything God has planned for and decided for you is a great benefit, and is a great protection, then you feel your pain gradually lighten, and the whole of you become relaxed, free, liberated. \" By God's word I know our pain is not given by God,it  is  that we don't  understand  God's purpose.Everything  God arranges to us is our need.
