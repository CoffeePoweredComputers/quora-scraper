Now you are at the right platform to fetch SEO projects. Quora has many members looking for services related to SEO. Market yourself by writing answers but be a bit low on the self promotion. You want other ways? Check these sources. Fiverrpeopleperhourfreelancer ( all these 3 sites will make you understand how difficult it is to score a project , so Go to the next link and register an account there )Top 10 List Fiverr Alternatives Websites Like Fiverr for 2013 - 2015Contact businesses close to you. they will give you a head start and a profile to brag about.Cold calling works sometimes, but the conversion is very low.Contact other freelancers, some of them are willing to outsource a project, but you\u2019ll have to stick to their plan. I mean..it\u2019s their reputation essentially.Contact other firms, they\u2019ll take a cut and outsource the project to you.Post ads in local classifieds.Tell your colleagues about your venture. Who knows whether they can bring a project.Frankly I wouldn\u2019t care about starting a website, make it popular and then get a business.. However having a profile website does help the client to know what exactly you do. I would suggest crating an about.me account and fill in your details. Some persons dig that. ",
