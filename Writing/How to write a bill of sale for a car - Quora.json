            "answer_text": "Where I live (Alberta) there is a link to a Bill of Sale pdf on the back of the vehicle registration certificate. You just download the document, fill out the information about the vehicle, both you and the buyer sign it, the buyer hands you the money or cheque, and off you both go, you with the money and the buyer with the car. It\u2019s worthwhile to do two copies of the Bill of Sale, one for each of you, in case you have to prove you sold the car. The buyer needs this document to register the car in his own name. You keep the license plates here. Often you do this in the parking lot of a registry office because the buyer can\u2019t drive it anywhere without plates. In the old days, there used to be a Bill of Sale on the back of the registration certificate itself, so you and the buyer just filled it out, he kept the document, and you kept the money or cheque. Sometimes, if a car died on the highway, the owner used to fill out the Bill of Sale on the back of the registration, sign it, put the registration on the dash with the keys on top of it, take the plates off, and walk away. If someone wanted a free car to fix up, there it was. If not, I assume the police found a new home for it somewhere. There was always the wrecking yard. ",
