            "answer_text": "In general, the answer is no. Sumerian cuneiform consisted of signs representing phonetic values (usually a discrete syllable), whole words, or determinatives (used to clarify the meaning of a another sign or group of signs). With a little creatively, one could use Sumerian cuneiform to write in any language, and that is precisely what the Akkadians did. However, the neatly-formed neo-Assyrian orthography, with its simplified angles and clearly-defined wedges, typically dates to a later period when Sumerian was no longer common. If you see a text that looks like this, especially on monuments, you can generally assume that it is Assyrian or Babylonian:  The same text, following the \u201cOld Babylonian\u201d orthography, could be Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, etc.:  (In this case, both texts are Akkadian: ma-tum ki-ma li-i i-\u0161a-ab-bu, \u201cThe land is bellowing like a bull,\u201d pulled from an exercise in Teach Yourself Babylonian by Martin Worthington.) You will notice that the older orthography uses odd angles, irregular strokes, hashing, etc. The newer orthography is cleaner and uses a smaller inventory of strokes. Here are few comparisons to give you a better idea:  If you see an inscription that mostly lacks the familiar wedges, or where the signs are rotated by 90 degrees, then you are probably looking at a Sumerian text, but there is no way to know for sure without learning the language. Here is an example of a ninth-century BC Assyrian text on the Stela of Ashurnasirpal II (Wikimedia commons):  This detail, from the Babylonian text of the Code of Hammurabi, is nearly 1,000 years older than the Stela of Ashurnasirpal II, and shows the older orthography in use at the time (Code of Hammurabi).  This votive tablet is written in Sumerian, and is dated several centuries before the stela with the Code of Hammurabi. You can see, in general, that the signs favor the older orthography, but many of the lines lack the characteristic wedges. In the Sumerian period, the wedges were the unintentional result of the shape of the stylus, so they are often missing from carved inscriptions. (Image from Ur-Namma votive tablet translation)  Another example of a Sumerian inscription that almost completely lacks the characteristic wedges (The Minoan Web of Mirrors and Scripts):  There is also the Old Persian cuneiform script, invented in the sixth century BC. The style clearly emulates the Akkadian script but is not actually derived from it. Persian cuneiform only had 44 signs, and the characters are much simpler:  ",

If you know a bit of Akkadian, and have some practice reading Akkadian texts (which is already more than I have managed so far in almost a year), you might after a while get to the conclusion that this text cannot be Akkadian. Never forget, reading cuneiform (Sumerian as well as Akkadian) is quite like solving a crossword puzzle. The signs are strongly multivalued, and you need a solid understanding of the language to have a chance to decide which of the many possible things this sign is supposed to mean at this position. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is no difference in the system of writing itself. As long as the scribes are writing in the same time period, their signs will look the same regardless of whether they are copying a Sumerian or an Akkadian text. The only way to tell which language a text is written in is to read the text. In theory you might be able to tell the difference between a text written in Akkadian and one written in Sumerian by knowing that certain signs (or groups of signs) are more common in Sumerian than in Akkadian texts, but in order to employ such a method you would need to know so much about both languages and about cuneiform script in general, that you would just read the text and recognise the language instead of using the other method which would be a pointless waste of time. And even if you used it, you might still be wrong because Akkadian texts commonly have Sumerograms (bits written in Sumerian) in them. The only way to tell from just the sign forms which language a cuneiform text was written in would be if you were looking at very early texts (first half of the 3rd millennium B.C.) which antedate the oldest written Akkadian texts. After the same fashion there is no way that anyone can tell whether a text written with Hebrew characters is in Hebrew or in Aramaic or in Yiddish just from looking at the characters themselves because these will be exactly the same regardless of the language. If you can read the words, however, then of course you can identify the language. \u05d0\u05d1\u05e2\u05e0\u05d3 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d0\u05d8\u05d8 \u05e4\u05d5\u05df \u05d3\u05d9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05e2\u05e8 \u05e6\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d2 For example, if you know nothing about Hebrew characters and nothing about the Hebrew, the Aramaic, or the Yiddish languages, the small text above is meaningless, and you cannot tell what language it is. But if you know the languages in question and can read the characters, then it\u2019s easy to make it out: Abend-Blatt von de Arbeiter-Zeitung. I.e. it\u2019s Yiddish \u2014 \u201cEvening Edition of the Workers\u2019 Paper\u201d. (Those who actually know Yiddish will please be so good as to forgive my use of German orthographical norms; and will please also note that I was able to refrain from adding an \u201cr\u201d after the \u201cde\u201d. I really wanted to add that \u201cr\u201d. The preposition \u201cvon\u201d takes the dative.) ",
