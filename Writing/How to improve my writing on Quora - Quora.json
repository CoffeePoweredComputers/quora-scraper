            "answer_text": "Quora is an excellent resource for a person who is interested in improving their writing ability. I can honestly say that my writing ability has increased dramatically since I started writing answers three years ago.  When I started writing here, I was quite possibly the worst writer possible. Everything I wrote was grammatically correct and I could say what had to be said, but reading any of what I wrote was difficult. If I wrote a long form answer the reader would either fall asleep or forget the question before getting halfway through it.  In the first couple years on here I wrote maybe five or ten good answers, but most of what I wrote was so boring that no one could read it. I made it a point to write one answer everyday for a while. most of my answers never got any upvotes, when one did it was a big deal. That meant that I wrote an answer that someone found useful. But it didn't help my much because I would get maybe ten views in an average day.  Over time I learned how to get feedback and I made a serious effort to improve my writing. I used as many sources of feedback as I could. Quora has given us several feedback methods and I recommend using as many as you can.   Upvotes - the most common form of feedback on the site. This is probably the first kind of feedback anyone gets on their content. It is easy for readers to use and it it easy to use upvotes to measure how well people respond to your writing. Followers - as your writing improves, you will get more followers. Followers are a good indication of how well you write. As your writing improves you will likely get more followers. Comments - people will often comment on your answers, use this as an opportunity to develop your writing. Many times there will be disagreement in the comments, try to remain respectful and discuss your reasoning and thinking without resorting to personal attacks. This will help you with forming your thoughts in an effective way. Quora community - follow all the quora topics and interact with the other writers. Become a member of the community and get to know people. Comment on other answers and have conversations. This will lead to more feedback that will help you. Argue - it sounds bad, but it doesn't have to be. If you disagree with something someone said, write a comment explaining why you disagree. Keep your comments centered strictly on the reasons, avoid any personal attacks. Ask why they think the way they do and what has led them to think that way. This will build up your ability to be convincing with your writing. Be nice, be respectful. Always follow this policy, it will help you more than you realize. People will be much more willing to help you if they like you than if they don't.",

I don't know if I am eligible enough to clear your question, still. Whatever I write, that's how my thought process is. I don't do extra effort to think different or to keep my view, whatever I feel, I write it as it is. Intially I wrote it as if its my personal diary, rather a social site. Writing improve you. Almost all good writing begins with terrible first effort. You need to start somewhere. Anne Lamot.

And if you decide to write, As per the question - Few things which could help you to be presentable are as follows- Know the use of number, bullet, brackets, grammar.Either write in points or in a line or two para sentence.That helps reader, without skipping.Don't do fake sugarcoat, be you.Be REAL YOU.Write without fear being judged.You have your own life, way, brain and heart \u2764You don't owe anything to anyone, here.Appreciation and criticism should be welcomed in any way.Don't get offended if someone keep their point of view, explain them yours politely and it they don't, smile and leave.Reply to comments.If someone take a moment to write something on your answer, take a moment at least drop a smile.:)Even stars smile silently on writers and poets.
