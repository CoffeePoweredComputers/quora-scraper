            "answer_text": "As you're writing your SOP, keep the following in your mind. And cover all these points, you're sure to win.  Divide your SOP into three major parts. Part one being: Introduction about yourself, a brief para on what you've studied and your eligibility. Part two: You must describe your technical knowledge and skillfully weave your technical knowledge with writing skills to make sure that they get a feeling that you're well versed with the subject you've chosen. Part three: Totally about softskills and interpersonal skills. In this part, you have to describe about how you can help towards the contribution in diversity of the college. About how you will adapt to the system of that college. Browse the college website and add few highlights about the college in your SOP, that will give them a feeling that you are thoroughly informed about everything. Briefly praise the country and why you'd want to reside there and do the so called course.  NOTE: Write an SOP in such a manner that it should seem as if you're talking to the person who's gonna read that. But not in an out and out formal manner. Remember, its a personal statement, and it should seem like one. If you'd let me know your email id or whatsoever through a comment.. I'd email you one of the SOP's I've written for my client about a month ago.  I've also attached a link, and its the best piece of advice on SOP writing as far as I know.  http://www.uni.edu/~gotera/gradapp/stmtpurpose.htm  \u2026\u2026 ",
