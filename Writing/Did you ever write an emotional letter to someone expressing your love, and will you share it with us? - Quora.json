            "answer_text": "Dear D, We met last night, after 2 months of no contact. Because I had blocked you. On Viber and also your number, to minimize the chances, I burn every bridge. But I wasn't clear to you of why I did it, the two times I blocked you for two months. It's been going on since April. Now it's November. You said that I had stopped answering to your messages on Viber, so I guess you noticed that something was going on with me. You still didn't give up. Maybe your 21 years old dumped you or you missed my body. I'm heartbroken now because I couldn't sleep next to you, when you came to my home at 2 am wasted, drunk and high, I was so happy to see you. And not sleeping, having my body all tingling, I was afraid that I would wake you up and you needed rest. Ik hou van je. I care about you. I love you. I finally admit it and now when I stopped fighting against it, it reveals itself using my decision to let go, my underlying reason. You are a tender lover. I thought I liked it rough and then you and maybe only one of all the other men showed me how I like it better. This morning, before you had to leave, it was the most blissful moment I've had\u2026 since the last time. Two months of my life spent in depression and more of the oversharing madness, I couldn't, I didn't want to see anyone else. It's not the first time I wallow in this feeling. It's after every one of our dates, our fuck dates. Sometimes I managed to recover for 2 weeks, I even made myself forget you, you know how. I was completely frigid when you found me again. I thought about you every day. I had accepted it, almost, almost no naive questions why, why didn't you want me, each day \u2026 I couldn't write anything anymore. It was completely gone, any desire to, to live like I used to before I met you and now. And now again, I had such a terrible headache, which turned out to be a liberator. It gave me the strength to say \"no more\" one last time, to show you I'm serious. I'll bear my punishment, the next two weeks or two months will be sore. Which makes me proud of myself for writing \"It's all or nothing, and it ends now. I know exactly what you're thinking\". You don't feel the same and from now on, for the third and final time, I won't wait for you to decide when it's over. ",

Imagine me, someone so full of words that flow easily, like a river, not being able to send something so simple. Three single words. I didn\u2019t want to disturb you. I know how the process works, and only in isolation sometimes, are we able to create, the inspiration pours from our mind to our heart, to our hands. Words fall like rain, drawings turn to masterpieces, colors turn into vision. Annoyed, I turned the phone off, pushed my thoughts away. \"Tomorrow\", I say gently to myself. Silence is better. I step outside to breathe some clean air, I inhale and look at the sky, the stars, the moon. Bathed in moonlight, my thoughts turn, and I wonder if perhaps for just a moment, wherever you are, if you might be doing the very same thing. I pull the sleeves of my jacket down, and wrap my arms around me against the chill of the night air. A brief smile passes my lips as I see a shooting star, and I think for just a moment of the possibility of what could be, or what might not ever be, I don't seek your attention only to bolster myself, but somehow the thought of you has seeped into my very soul. Beautiful heart, don\u2019t you know that you have also captured mine? I exhale and shrug. a tear slips down my cheek.\u201d To someone \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes\u2026. it is a Bliss to express you feelings to the one you love. Might or not they love you back and reciprocate your feelings\u2026 Just tell them that you love them. It is the very first step you take to get to her. And writing a letter to express your love is wonderful. Let me share one\u2026.I am sorry if it is not good.  \u201c To my dearest , Enough it had been for me\u2026It may be early to say\u2026It may be late to say\u2026But it is wrong never to say\u2026.!!! This moment is right to express the feelings I have for you\u2026 I could wait for you for ages \u2026 But I know yesterday will not ever return again\u2026This very moment would be gone forever.  Even the strongest person In this world might feel weakest at certain point of their life\u2026and I have reached that point in my life. This day I will tell why you had been the Apple of my Eye\u2026!!!  Love is certainly the best thing that could ever happen to a person\u2026But what's hidden inside a heart will always be a pain. It is a blessing to be able to express one's feeling that they have gathered for their loved one..!!! You can think I am mad , stupid and being idiotic \u2026..Yes , I am really mad , But all for you and you know that too..!!  Many believe \u2018 Beauty is an open invitation for love ' \u2026..Gone are those days \u2026\u2026atleast I think so. More than a person as I know you\u2026there has been something magical I felt for you always and these feelings are wonderful\u2026.Oh\u2026Dear\u2026!!! Oh\u2026Yes..You are Beautiful..!!! But , whenever I imagine looking into your face I search for signs of love behind the beauty you posses.  Time has been tough and certain things in life made it much tougher\u2026 I may not be good enough, perfect for you..But I promise I would change,grow,become responsible and strong;survive and succeed;react and exist in all the ways that makes you feel proud and happy all the lifelong\u2026\u2026I would be there for you always..It's an ocean of love I have for you..!!!!  I am always prepared for the worst \u2026But, Give me a chance\u2026Won\u2019t You..??? I thank you for some of the precious moments I had with you\u2026They taught a lot in life for me\u2026Those precious moments are my tomorrow's memories that ever last in my mind. Lost in time and thoughts \u2026Truth has been strange for me\u2026; The Love I have for you made it much stranger. From inside I felt like dying\u2026But noticing one of your smiles\u2026Would make me relive this life again. Thoughts of unravelling the mystery beneath those beautiful eyes of yours always strike me\u2026But alas It would tear one's world apart to understand what's really inside a woman's heart. You are not just a dream to forget soon\u2026for Me your are a life worth living. \u201cEvery time I look into a mirror \u2026I see you as if I don't exist\u2026May be I see myself existing within you\u201d.  I wish you have heard and remembered these words\u2026 \u201c I remember the first time\u2026I look into your eyes\u2026You looked like an angel like heaven in the skies\u2026\u201d. I really meant those words\u2026!!! I always felt that I must have bored you with my texts\u2026..It was never my thing\u2026But there were thoughts behind some of those texts\u2026!! I have said what my heart felt\u2026If not , I would have not been truthful either to you or even myself throughout this life\u2026..How can one live such a life\u2026..??? A worthless one\u2026A hell to live.  I have spent all of last month thinking about you every moment\u2026Sleep has been my enemy all these days\u2026!!! I don't know why this feeling is so strong that I would wake in the middle of night to find a way to text you\u2026You are never available then\u2026!!! I am never discouraged , Instead I uses to convince myself that you were happy sleeping coziest in your bed somewhere..!! All I can do is to wait for another day\u2026with lots of hope\u2026!!! I might make you angry now\u2026but time would subdue your anger and one day you will realise the worth of my words . They were written with love and pain in heart.  You might be far away from me\u2026but I feel you are the nearest person next to me\u2026.!! I might run out of words\u2026But I will never stop thinking about you..!! You are my breath..!! Days would pass\u2026Months would pass \u2026Years would pass\u2026But you will be remembered forever\u2026!!!! I love you\u2026.I love You\u2026!!! I love you till the end. I am sad to say these words in this way\u2026But I hope one day I would stand before you to say these words\u2026with more love that I have gathered for you\u2026!!! With Love\u2026; Yours Truly.  ",

I didn\u2019t know her, but I was too cowardly to approach her, so I wrote down some gibberish and handed it to her. I can\u2019t show it to you, because she has/had the only copy. But it was just the usual mumbo jumbo, I\u2019m sure. I meant it at the time, though. She sent me a text the next day, thanking me for my \u201cinterest\u201d and reminding me that this was highly unusual behaviour and NOT the way these things are usually done. And she also made it very clear that she already had a boyfriend, thank you, and bye bye. Sigh\u2026 ",
