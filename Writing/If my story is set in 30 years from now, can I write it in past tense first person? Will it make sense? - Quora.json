            "answer_text": "Sure. Many futuristic novels are written in the past tense. You just have to have a clear vision of what happens between the ending of your story and your narrator\u2019s present, so that this can inform how he or she looks back on things. An excellent example of this, albeit not set in the future, is John Maddox Roberts\u2019 SPQR series, which is set in the waning days of the Roman Republic. The narrator and main protagonist is a fictitious Roman Senator named Decius Caecillius Metellus. He\u2019s \u201cwriting\u201d about the events of the 70s to the 40s BCE, but he\u2019s doing so decades later, during the reign of Augustus (whom he despises). He is continually comparing the Rome of \u201cthen\u201d (when the story is happening) and \u201cnow\u201d (when he\u2019s old and bitter and the Republic is dead and every has to kiss one ruler\u2019s ass).
