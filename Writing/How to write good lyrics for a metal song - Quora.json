            "answer_text": "Hey! So I never used to really like hardcore metal because of Brian Yankee's answer. Metallica (circa Ride the Lightning) was the hardest I would go. Yeah, also mention blood and death a lot and you have your typical bullshit song. But when I met Tom, he was convinced to get me to like his music because it went deeper. So, he didn't write this but his bandmates Jeff and Kerry did. Check this out, and try to differentiate between this and \u201ckill your mother kill your father death death death\u201d kind of stuff. Trapped in purgatory A lifeless object, alive Awaiting reprisal Death will be their acquittance The sky is turning red Return to power draws near Fall into me\u2026the sky's crimson tears Abolish the rules made of stone Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above Awaiting the hour of reprisal Your time slips away Raining blood From a lacerated sky Bleeding its horror Creating my structure now I shall reign in blood How cool is that?! Raining blood from a lacerated sky?! Wow I love it! So, my advice is to be poetic and reach deep and don't be afraid to use words that make you sound intelligent. That is actually super cool. (Lyrics credit: Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King) Oh\u2026and that song has super kick ass drum and guitar. Having the coolest riffs that don't sound like the same old stuff that has been done to death helps. If we can circle back to my Metallica reference, my favorite song by them is Creeping Death. That is a story from The Bible. Be well read and draw inspiration from everywhere. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Generally, I keep it to five to seven word phrases. It helps if some of the lines rhyme but they don\u2019t have too. Pick a topic first though, what are you going to write about? Love? Passion? Sex? Drugs? Bisexuality? Christianity? Christianity + Muslim? Suicide? Hope above Suicide? Denial or Refusal of Suicide? Learning to write damn good lyrics is a long process it took me about 16 years to get very, very good, and that was just studying the lyrical side about 3 hours a day, nearly daily, including reading most of Shakespeare\u2019s works. Now I have to get inspired enough to start studying the guitar side of it for melody writing. Now put together some phrases that make sense and rhyme They just have to go together and make sense on the dime You can even copy a song that already exists A topic that exists in the present Can be copied, even line for line And rewritten and changed into a new song Just be careful to change everything! After your done and happy with the lyrics Then your ready to take it above the knicks To the next step or phrase, just add music And practice, practice, practice It may take 10 years to get that first song just right! But I promise you, it gets easier, and easier the more you do! Now if you still can\u2019t think of anything, you can buy a book of lyrics From a lyrical writer with some repute and fame And take on their lyrics one by one on your own ",
