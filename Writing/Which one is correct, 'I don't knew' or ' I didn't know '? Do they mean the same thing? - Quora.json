            "answer_text": "I don't knew\" or \" I didn't know \"? Do they mean the same thing? \u201cI don't knew\u201d. Knew is the past tense form of the verb \u2018know\u2019. We don't say either \u201cI don't knew\u201d or \u2018I didn't knew\u2019. When we make negatives with do, we construct them in the form of \u2018don't + (present tense of) verb\u2019. I don't like. I don't want. I don't know. I don't see. I don't understand. \u2018I don't know\u2019 and \u2018I didn't know\u2019. I don't know who she is. Present tense. I have no idea who she is. I didn't know who she was. Past tense. I had no idea about her earlier, in the past. I didn't know anything about her until an year ago (when we accidentally met and became friends). \u201cWhen is he coming\u201d? \u201cI don't know\u201d. \u201cI didn't even know that he was planning to come\u201d. \u2018I don't know\u2019 is also a discourse marker in spoken English. That is, when you are short of words or when you are not sure what to say or when you are too lazy to explain.\u2026 \u2026this phrase comes in quite handy. :) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI don\u2019t knew.\u201d is wrong. So what it means is not important. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d is correct. And it is an example of Simple Past Tense. It means \u201cI did not know something in past\u201d. As \u201cdid\u201d is a verb in Past Tense, the other verb \u201cknow\u201d is written in Present Tense and not as \u201cknew\u201d in Present Tense. Rule: Two verbs in Past Form cannot come together in same sentence. Example: Wrong \u201cI didn\u2019t wrote anything worth appreciation.\u201d Right I didn\u2019t write anything worth appreciation.\u201d Hope it helped. ",
