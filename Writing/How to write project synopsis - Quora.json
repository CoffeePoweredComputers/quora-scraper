            "answer_text": "Project synopsis is basically your project report in short. You need to tell the objective (Why?), the execution (How?), and the conclusion (What?) of the project. one thing which you must understand even before you start writing the synopsis is that you will have to edit it a number of times. So, don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes. To begin with, You can just write down, what the project is about, in the form of bullet points. Here, if you are not comfortable in English, you can use any language you are comfortable with. Most of the times I go with my mother tongue.Now, take each point separately and extend it. Write down the details of the equipment used, procedures followed, documentation, literature survey conducted, etc. By now you will see the WHY? and HOW? of the project. Here, just go with the flow.Pause from here on for some time. Go to google and read some project synopsis online. The more you read, the better idea you will get. Check out their use of language and how they format it. What kind of subheadings they give, how they divide paragraphs, how they use pictures, etc. For a project synopsis, the language should be precise. The use of apt words avoids confusion.After you feel that you have read enough, come back to your bullet points and their extended versions. If you have written them in English, mull over them and try to improve the language. If you have written in any other language, try to rewrite in English now and then improve.Try to put everything in a concise and readable format. you can refer to the synopsis you liked from google.Now compare your synopsis with those you found on google and keep working on them. See that you have perfectly shown the scope of your project. Don't make the conclusion part very lengthy. Add only the main findings of your projects. Other things will eventually come in your detailed report.I think that\u2019s pretty much of it. For more detailed information, you can read other related blogs, and youtube videos. I am leaving a couple of links for your reference. How to Write a Synopsis for Project Work: 24 Tips - WiseStep You can also check this video.  The process that I have explained is how I work on my things, but these links will give you a more general idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Since it sounds official, it becomes important to give the synopsis an official look. First it should be a limited account of what all is there in the project. To make the synopsis interesting, it is usually a good trick to give some hints towards the important points you have covered in your project. However the key point is not to give away the information but put a suspense to what it was actually directed to. It should be catchy and good use of terminology related to the subject may attract the audience towards the accuracy of your project( even after it won\u2019t turn out to be that accurate, it will still leave a good impression). The synopsis must be written in three parts: Introduction: what the project is about and why is it worth the time of everybody else\u2019s, aims, objectives and stuff Middle part: here you must give all the previously mentioned hints Closure: The closure must be particular and factual as well. It must contain what benefit the project had brought to you or whether or not it fulfilled its aim. That\u2019s all. Hope this was helpful enough. ",
