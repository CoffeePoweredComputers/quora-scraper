            "answer_text": "Because the Bible came out of the Middle East, and in ancient times, people had no way of knowing about the peoples in the other hemisphere. That is why God has inspired prophets in ancient America to create a volume of revelation and scripture similar to the Bible. You may have heard of it. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201d There are numerous prophecies (indirect of course) about the Americas in The Bible. The one most obviously about Native Americans is found in John 10:16, when Jesus says: \u201cAnd other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\u201d This prophecy of Jesus\u2019s was fulfilled when He appeared to the people who inhabited the Americas after his resurrection and they heard His voice, as told in The Book of Mormon: \u201cAnd now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and wondering one with another\u2026 And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom the sign had been given concerning his death. And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and they cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a small voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center, insomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did cause their hearts to burn. And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they understood it not. And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from whence the sound came. And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which they heard; and it said unto them: Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name\u2014hear ye him. And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes up again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending out of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came down and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole multitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they thought it was an angel that had appeared unto them. And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake unto the people, saying: Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world. And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Why aren't there any Native Americans in the Bible? The answer, my friend, is not blowing in the wind but in the pages of the Bible. Read it objectively, without any emotional attachment, from a distance, as if it were the book from an alien culture.What will you discover is that the Bible has two parts. The first and larger one is a collection of texts from the Hebrew tribes, about the Hebrew tribes and concerning events that affected directly the Hebrew tribes. There are no Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Gauls and any other ethnicity that didn\u2019t affect directly the Hebrew tribes. There are no historical accounts that didn\u2019t affect directly the Hebrew tribes. There are no useful or useless information about anything that didn\u2019t affect directly the Hebrew tribes. The Hebrew tribes are the main concern of the writers of the oldest and largest part of the Bible. And this focused interest is because the anthology was made solely with the purpose of providing an unified national identity to the Hebrew tribes. That\u2019s why the anthologists collected myths, legends, stories, poems, philosophical writings, laws, sanitary advice, historical chronicles and educative fictions from the Hebrew tribes and only from the Hebrew tribes. And for the same reason is why the anthologists didn\u2019t collect texts from other cultures, didn\u2019t mention cultures that weren\u2019t in contact with the Hebrew tribes and didn\u2019t include the scientific, historical, geographical and other-ical knowledge other contemporary cultures had. The second and shortest part of the Bible is a collection of texts from the followers of a wandering preacher and revolutionary leader, about this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers and concerning events that affected directly this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers. There are no Chinese, Japanese, Hindus, Gauls and any other ethnicity that didn\u2019t affect directly this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers. There are no historical accounts that didn\u2019t affect directly this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers. There are no useful or useless information about anything that didn\u2019t affect directly this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers. This wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers are the main concern of the writers of the newest and shortest part of the Bible. And this focused interest is because the anthology was made solely with the purpose of providing an unified ideological identity for the followers of said wandering preacher and revolutionary leader. That\u2019s why the anthologists collected chronicles and letters about and from this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers and only from this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followerss. And for the same reason is why the anthologists didn\u2019t collect texts from other cultures, didn\u2019t mention cultures that weren\u2019t in contact with this wandering preacher and revolutionary leader and his followers and didn\u2019t include the scientific, historical, geographical and other-ical knowledge other contemporary cultures had. That\u2019s why because the Bible says nothing about the Native Americans. Because the Bible is not a compendium of Life, the Universe and Everything Else but a collection of texts about very precise things for a very precise group of readers with very precise interests and very precise goals. Simple as that. ",
