            "answer_text": "I believe that the CAC (customer acquisition cost) is not a relevant measure for a marketplace. It is relevant for a recurring-payment SaaS product. I suggest finding a more meaningful measure for a marketplace, e.g. Cost per Sale in Marketplace (CSM?). Then you can measure the average sale price in the marketplace, the average commission your business take, and go from there estimating the required cost per sale in marketplace to make it worthwhile. For example, if your sales transaction price in the marketplace averages to $100, and you take $5, you need to make sure that the cost of making that happen is not more than $5 (and preferably much less).

            "answer_text": "The normal CAC metric calculation applies to marketplaces, since you\u2019re going to have to spend to bring in supply and demand. Depending on your strategy, one side, most likely the demand side, will certainly be cheaper to acquire. I\u2019d recommend separating the two CAC metrics and tracking them both. For instance, if your marketplace connects buyers and sellers in a specific niche track a buyer CAC and a seller CAC. Your marketplace take rate should be healthy enough to cover both CAC\u2019s regardless of which side you decide to charge. ",
