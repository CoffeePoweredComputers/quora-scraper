            "answer_text": "Depends on the genre. There are way too many to mention all I\u2019ve seen so I\u2019ll just list my favourites. Serial Experiments Lain - very surreal full of mysteries, philosophical questions and nothing gets explained directly, one of my favourite shows. Kind of like Evangelion on crack with a female lead. Revolutionary Girl Utena - again, very philosophical, metaphorical with a yuri relationship. Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica - clusterfuck of feels and depression. Magical Girl deconstruction. True master piece. Ergo Proxy - Female protagonist that devolves into a deuteragonist. Full of action set in Dystopian world. A bit philosophical. Kino no Tabi - A girl and a motorbike (no, really) traveling around the world and meeting various people with various problems. Strike Girls - Main cast of only girls, a git ecchi but full of action and comedy. Sabagebu - Girls playing Airsoft way too seriously. Action-y and loads of fun. K-On! - Not a anime I liked but very popular. Girls doing stuff. Comedy. Aria the Animation - Girls doing gondoliers on Mars. Very relaxing and calm. Jormungand - MC is a female arms dealer. Very action oriented with feels here and there but mostly it\u2019s pure fun. Blood+ - MC is a vampire and is out to kill her sister, who is also a vampire. A lot of action, gore and blood. Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru - Anime about little girls fighting against impossible odds to keep their friends, friendships and the world alive. Brutal and sad but I 100% recommend to finish both season for a complete story. Canaan - Very action oriented with a lot of realistic hand to hand and gun fighting. Ga Rei: Zero - Break the Cutie: The Anime. Supernatural and action genre. Very sad. Not recommended to watch unless you want to feel feels. Gakkougurashi - Every wondered what happens to little girls in elementary schools during a zombie outbreak? Well, this is your answer. Hint: it\u2019s not nice. Jinrui was Suitai Shimashita - Ever wondered what would Dadaism look like in anime? Well, this is your answer. Pure hilarity and confusion. Unsurprisingly, anime is not in chronological order. Kaleido Star - Story about a girl dreaming of becoming a star in a circus. Love Live - Story of girls dreaming of becoming popular school idols. Medaka Box - You certain know the shounen where the MC is awfully OP from the start to finish. This is the case, just that the MC is a female. Noragami - A highschool girl becomes a pall with a broke god of war. Hilarity and feels ensue. Jigoku Shoujo - A compilation of various stories of hatred and revenge connected by a single girl that can make you a deal to send someone to hell. Princess Tutu - A story inspired by various ballet compositions set in a alternate world full of mysteries and magic. MUCH better than it sounds, 100% recommended. Shigofumi - Anime about a girl that delivers letter of the dead to living. Similar to Jigoku Shoujo. Shugo Chara - Magical Girl anime about coming of age. Simoun - Anime full of magic, action and war set in a world where everyone is born female and then they choose a permanent sex when they come of age. Also a coming of age and finding love and your place in the world story. New Game - Daily life in a gaming company full of women. Sore ga Seiyuu - Daily life of female voice actors. Houkagou No Pleiades - Magical Girl, coming of age and finding love anime. Tackles serious illnesses and neverending hope. Very good. Little Witch Academia - Story about girls in a school for withes and their struggles and friendships. Much better than it sounds. Shinsekai Yori - Coming of age story set in a future world where humans can control reality to various degrees. Deals with racism, hatred, loss of friends and survival. Kamisama Hajimemashita - About a girl who becomes a guardian god of a shrine and meets her fox demon servant. Romance. Unfinished. If you want more of a certain genre, don\u2019t be shy to ask. ",

Our protagonist is a naive 10-year-old girl, Chihiro, who encounters many struggles and obstacles in this coming of age story. Nana  A series that follows two female leads both named Nana and their shared stories. Kara no Kyoukai  A series of 7 movies that follows Shiki Ryougi, a demon hunter, who is sent out to solve paranormal cases. Kyoukai no Kanata  A series that follows Mirai Kuriyama, the last descendant and sole survivor of the Spirit World warriors tasked with hunting down the youmu, manifestations of negative human emotions. Kill la Kill  Ryuuko Matoi seeks only one thing in life - to find and kill her father\u2019s murderer. By the way, Kill la Kill has one of my favorite OSTs. Shirobako  One of my favorite slice-of-life shows that follows a group of friends involved in various sectors of the anime industry. Yes that\u2019s right, an anime about making anime. Toaru Kagaku no Railgun  Based off A Certain Magical Index, this show follows Misaka Mikoto, an esper with the ability to generate and manipulate electricity. Madoka Magica  I think you could make the argument that Madoka Magica might be the best anime in the past decade. This series completely breaks all the stereotypes about magical girls. Honorable Mentions: Elfen Lied Blood-C Black Lagoon Durarara!! Ghost in the Shell Claymore Another Trinity Seven Jormungand Ergo Proxy \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 So most of the ones I listed above are plot-heavy or action anime. You could also go for something a little slower like slice-of-life shows: K-On! New Game! Hanasaku Iroha Non Non Biyori Nichijou Love Live! School Idol Project Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (Wolf Children) Tamako Market and Tamako Love Story Chihayafuru \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 While the following anime do not have a female lead, they do have some great female characters: Princess Mononoke Gintama Samurai Champloo Neon Genesis Evangelion Psycho-Pass The Fate Series (Rin best girl) Steins;Gate Code Geass Death Parade Baccano!
