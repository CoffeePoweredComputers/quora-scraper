            "answer_text": "Ghostwriters are unsung in the literary world precisely because the named author claims the work and the ghostwriter signs a non-disclosure agreement. Autobiography ghostwriters such the one who wrote Trump\u2019s The Art of the Deal is an anamoly in the ghostwriting world because almost no one expects people who \u201cwrite\u201d their autobiographies have the skills to write a book. In fiction, the named author may or may not make significant revisions of the work, but they certainly take all responsibility for getting the book to print and marketing it, which is a significant part of a modern writing career. Here is a hint. When you browse the catalog of an author\u2019s work and find more than two to three releases per year under that name, then that author is either a \u201cbrand\u201d created by the publisher using ghostwriters or an author who can\u2019t keep up for the demand for their work. If you see a significant change in writing style from the author you love, that author bought the services of a ghostwriter. Rare is the writer that can write a book per month, which is about what a modern indie author needs to produce to generate a livable income. However, there are a few well-known authors whose publishers engaged ghostwriters and it was quite evident since those writers died, or were too ill to carry on their work. The writers include: Robert Ludlum. ...H.P. Lovecraft. ...K.A. Applegate. ...V.C. Andrews. ...Mickey Spillane. ...Tom Clancy. ...Isaac Asimov.Check out the below article for details. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain: 7 fiction authors whose careers were extended by ghostwriters ",

            "answer_text": "The best ghostwriting partnership I can think of was the one between Robert K. Tanenbaum and Michael Gruber. Robert K. Tanenbaum is a high-profile trial lawyer. He got his JD from Berkeley\u2019s Boalt Hall School of Law, where he later taught a class in advanced criminal procedure. He\u2019s been a prosecutor for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, and is licensed to practice law in New York, California and Pennsylvania. Tanenbaum had the stories. He needed a ghostwriter. His cousin, Michael Gruber, happened to be a fine prose stylist. So Tanenbaum and Gruber collaborated on a series of crime novels about New York criminal courts bureau chief Roger (Butch) Karp and assistant district attorney Marlene Ciampi. They wrote fifteen books together: No Lesser Plea (1987), Depraved Indifference (1989), Immoral Certainty (1991), Reversible Error (1992), Material Witness (1993), Corruption of Blood (1994), Justice Denied (1994), Falsely Accused (1996), Irresistible Impulse (1997), Reckless Endangerment (1998), Act of Revenge (1999), True Justice (2000), Enemy Within (2001), Absolute Rage (2002) and Resolved (2003). Here are the opening lines from Absolute Rage: Killing people is so easy that the iron laws of supply and demand make it hard to earn a decent living doing it. As a result, murder for hire is almost always a sideline, and the people who engage in it are by and large stupid losers, quickly caught, and quicker still to rat out the idiots who hired them. And here are the opening lines from Material Witness: A fat man with a jaunty air and five minutes left to live walked out of the Izmir Restaurant on Third Avenue and 46th Street on the island of Manhattan and turned east. He moved with the twinkle-footed gait adopted by many of the stout, but his progress would have been faster had he not, at nearly every convenient window, slowed to check his image in the reflecting glass. Tanenbaum never came right out and said he had a ghostwriter. Instead, he\u2019d write a few lines of fulsome praise in the Acknowledgments. Here\u2019s what he says in the Acknowledgments for Material Witness: To my partner and collaborator, Michael Gruber, whose genius flows throughout this book and who is primarily responsible for this manuscript. And for Reversible Error: Special and profound thanks to Michael Gruber, my partner, collaborator, and confidante whose brilliance, expertise, and devotion helped make this manuscript what it is. And Corruption of Blood: With utmost respect and admiration for Michael Gruber, my partner, collaborator, and confidant who is primarily responsible for the excellence of this manuscript and whose brilliance, expertise, and professionalism make this manuscript what it is. But Michael Gruber was a restless ghost. He wanted recognition. The cousins had a falling out, and Gruber started writing fiction under his own name. Robert K. Tanenbaum hired other ghosts, and keeps publishing novels about Butch Karp and Marlene Ciampi. What are some good examples of ghostwriting works and authors? ",
