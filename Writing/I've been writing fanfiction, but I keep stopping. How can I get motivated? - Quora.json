            "answer_text": "I'm not certain that this'll help as it's not fanfic specific and more related to how I come up with story ideas in general. I used to get hung up on plotting out entire storylines even before I'd start the first paragraph of a story. When I decided to get more serious about storytelling I attended a number of creative writing classes, seminars and workshops. One huge myth that was quickly blown out of the water was the idea that you need to know where a story is going before you start writing it. That simply isn't true.  The best yarns are often spun by putting a character that you know and love (or hate!) in a challenging situation and seeing what happens. Don't worry about plotting, pacing and all that stuff that is ultimately only important in the final draft. Often, I don't know what a story is about or how it's going to end until I've written the first or second draft.  If you try to shoehorn characters into fixed plot lines they can end up acting in unbelievable ways but moreover, as the writer, you spend more time trying to figure out how to manoeuvre them about than simply letting them react to the situation they find themselves in. As your story progresses, at some point it will become suddenly clear what's going on and it may be completely unexpected, but at the same time obvious that that's what had to happen. Any weaknesses in plot and pace can then be addressed by filling in gaps or removing unnecessary scenes and characters. As I was writing this I realised another major motivator for my writing, which I hadn't thought about before bashing out this response. Writing classes and groups can be incredibly inspirational as they give you real-time deadlines and interaction with an audience for your work. Knowing that someone is going to read your stories each week forces you to focus on them in a way which keeps the writing process engaging and fresh.  In summary, don't get bogged down in the details of plotting. Put a character in a situation and let them do what they do. That, and go join a class or a workshop with real people. Good luck with your storytelling!  ",

            "answer_text": "That's a great question.    I've been an author of fanfiction for over three years. I usually never quit a fanfiction mostly because I'll feel bad for the readers if I do. I had that happen to me once, though. I didn't have enough motivation for it, so I quit. In order not to do that you have to makes sure that... You have the plot down. You know how's it's going to start, you know the middle, and you know how it will end. Make sure when you got the idea, you actually wanted to do it. Let's say it was a great idea, but you kind of wanted to write it. Don't write it unless you'll enjoy it and want to put the time into it.If you would read it, write it. Make sure you enjoy when you write it. Let's say the fanfiction is based off the show... Keep watching the show or re-watch. You need to look at these characters. Research them. Know them. Be comfortable possible having to write in their point of view. You must know them well. Make sure you're character is dynamic (if you add your own character). Make sure they have a possible backstory. Make them interesting, like you want to know more about them. Then, know everything about them. EVEN THEIR MIDDLE NAME. Make this character special. Make people want to know about them, especially you.If you're afraid you'll lose interest, don't take a break from writing. Keep a schedule, and stay with it. Right after you get the idea, start the set up from the story, then start the story. KEEP WRITING! Someone's reading it, and they want an end to the story. They will not want it cutoff right in the middle. Don't give up!   ",

            "answer_text": "For my answer, I am going to address the lack of motivation arising from little support or lack of strong enough following which pushes most fan-fiction writers to write. If you are already a highly popular fan fiction writer, and still feel demotivated then skip and go to the bottom of my answer. I write a fan-fiction series currently, and a few one shots. In total I have been writing for a year. At first I started a series and dropped it, so I understand the frustration that comes with lack of motivation at some point. Here are some tips that helped me (these are subjective, do keep in mind) 1.Find a website with an interactive community. If you feel like nobody is reading or enjoying your writing it can be de motivating... I find http://fanfiction.net and deviantart to be more popular, but there are other sites. 2.Read some popular fan fiction works that you personally enjoy and see what makes the writing popular/ good. Try to include similar things without (This is important) compromising your own writing style. This is helpful because it will attract readers who will enjoy your work- again another motivation. 3.Keep a schedule for writing. I upload a piece of writing once every week, when I am in the mood for writing. If you don't upload works somewhat predictably, you won't gain the slow following/fans that you will support you otherwise.  It's a tedious process at first, but after few months when I gained enough support I found writing to be very fulfilling and inherently felt motivated as there were people who wanted to read it. OK SO: If you have a large enough following and fan support who urge you in comments and messages to \"pls update\" and STILL feel demotivated then writers block or exhaustion could be the cause. Many writers simply feel saturated and out of interesting content and stop writing. This is common for fan-fiction and I suggest visiting this thread : How do I motivate myself to keep writing?  Hope this helped, feel free to add on/clarify anything!   ",

            "answer_text": "The two things that motivate me to write fanfic were watching/reading things that gave me characters I wanted to spend more time with and having conversations with friends about those characters. Sometimes those conversations ended up as collaborations, sometimes they just seeded me with an idea. The stimulation of great characters and plot points can't be overstated. I don't write much fanfic anymore, and last year finished up a story that completed a series I'd been working on for more a decade that I referred to as my \"last fanfic.\" But then I played a Visual Novel and one of the characters was so intriguing, I was tempted for a moment to write a new one. (Then I remembered I have a novella left unfinished and three lectures to write, so that's not happening. ^_^)  The point is, you get \"done\" with a series and that's perfectly okay.  Write about something else, put together something original or just move on to a different hobby and remember your time as a fanfic writer with fondness. ",

            "answer_text": "Oooh. Writer's Block and Fic Freezing. I know how you feel. I've been dragging a fanfiction along since 2014, only updating when I feel like it (read as: never). But, there are other fics that I have managed to pull through. To motivate yourself to write your overdue fic, I suggest retracing your steps to the beginning and asking yourself \"why did I want to write this fic, again?\" Going back in time will help you to kind of figure out a few of the obscure details you wanted to put into the story and then continue. Another good way? Edit the older chapters/segments you've already written. Chances are, you'll be editing and then find a part that you think could be moved or continued later on. You could also listen to music, watch a movie, read other books/fanfictions, or take a walk. It's good to clear your mind and rethink the fic.  Thanks for the A2A and good luck!! ",

Look at a few HP accounts. Writing about Sherlock? Watch a few episodes.  If this doesn't work, you should try to read a FF that is completely unrelated to your topic and give some thought as how you could change it to meet your topic (never copy though!).  Lastly and most importantly: Don't over-do it. If you over-do it you could lose interest in the topic. Wouldn't it be a shame to lose all that work? Remember, you're doing this for fun and for you.

Researching the characters and their traits, researching their environment and what it is like, how their skills and interests work and the biology of plants and animals in their surroundings.I also research how their interactions might play out, when comparing to sociological norms and finding the set points of their culture.I read up on the characters again and again, using wikis and discussion forums to see  how others interpret the characters and their relations and compare it to my own. I know the research might just end up in minor detail that most will overlook when they read it, but I love doing it and it makes it more interesting for me to write. Oh, and I first start writing when I have a general idea of the whole story from start to end. I might make changes during the writing, but I need to know how it ends before I start, because I tend to either go on and on, or loose interest if I don't have an ending. ",
