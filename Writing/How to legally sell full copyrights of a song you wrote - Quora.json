            "answer_text": "You can sell the rights to a song but I will disagree with something someone else said. Someone said you can sell the writes like Willie did with Crazy but his name is still on the song. While that is true after 50 some odd years the song automatically reverts back to the writer so once again the song belongs to Willie. This is the same thing McCartney is going through. I believe that he now has the writes back to many of his earlier songs and will have them all back in a few years. Now comes something that may get some comments and that is the fact that you can sell the writes and even sell it to where someone else can have their name as the songwriter. Most people will say that I am wrong but trust ,me it does happen, I should know because I have sold some of my songs and with it I sold the songwriters credits. I\u2019m not say this is common but it does happen. Prince has given songs away that he wrote and let someone else also take the credit for writing the song. In my case I did it because I was friends with certain people and they paid me to be pretty much a ghost writer for them. ",

            "answer_text": "Selling a song, or the rights thereto, is a matter of signing a document assigning all rights to the work in question to the purchaser. Willie Nelson wrote \u201cCrazy,\u201d the song that later became a hit for Patsy Cline. Willie wanted to move to Nashville and didn't have the money to go, so he sold the rights for five hundred bucks to get the money. That's the last dime Willie saw off of that song, but his name was still on the label. Years later, he was broke and offered to sell Faron \u201cHello, Walls.\u201d Faron said \u201cwhy don't I loan you a grand and you can pay me back with the first royalty check.\u201d Unless a song becomes a hit, or becomes an album cut for a big star, you'll probably make more money selling the song.
