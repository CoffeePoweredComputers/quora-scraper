            "answer_text": "He wrote poetry and plays. Most of the poetry, and much of the dialogue in the plays, was written in iambic pentameter, which means ten syllables to the line, with the emphasis placed on the even numbered syllables. The plays are usually put into three categories: comedies, tragedies, and histories. Sometimes people divide some into a fourth category, which they call romances ,or sometimes problem plays. In the First Folio, which was the first printed collection of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, \u201cCYMBELINE\u201d is classified as a tragedy, which makes no sense because it has a happy ending. Somebody goofed. Shakespeare was a poet, so there are a lot of similes and metaphors in his dialogue. If that doesn\u2019t answer your question, you need to add more details to your question, so that I can understand what you are really interested in asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Shakespeare's style of writing is Shakespearean. He was one of the creators, perhaps the foremost creator, of early modern English. He invented new words which today are quite common and which we take for granted, such as \"amazement\" and \"lackluster.\" Some very simple words, such as \"luggage\" and \"bedroom,\" are credited to Shakespeare. The new words he added to our vocabulary number over 1700. Shakespeare's vocabulary, based on his written remains, is said to be the largest of any writer to date, at 24,000 words. His influence upon our language has been immense and, alongside the King James Bible, the root of Western literature. ",
