            "answer_text": "There are myriad ways to make money writing online. I have earned a significant amount of money writing for clients online, and personally I know people\u2014in my LinkedIn network\u2014who make a living out of writing. As far as my experience is concerned, I would not prefer to work for content mills. Because, no matter how prolific you are at writing, the pay will always be way below your expectations. If you are a beginner, you first need to stop believing that there exists a secret sauce to become a professional freelance writer. The only secret to earning money by writing online is to write quality content. Here are a few steps to become a professional freelance writer with examples: Build a portfolio. You can reach out to the popular publications, magazines, websites and blog owners and pitch to guestpost articles for them. This will help to build a credible portfolio that you can reach out to potential clients with.Choose your niche. You might be confident enough to write on any topic given to you. But that will require you to spend adequate time on research as well. Instead, focus on specializing in a particular niche. Remember: to make money writing online, you need to write qualitative content and be able to deliver it within the stipulated time frame. You can write fast without having to spend time researching the given topic, if you focus on a particular niche such as Technology.Start pitching to clients. Many budding writers ask me a common question: how to find high paying clients? As I mentioned earlier in the intro, you will hardly be able to find a high paying client on content mills owing to high competition among writers there. No doubt, there are writers on content mills, too, who are minting unprecedented amount of moolah. Not everybody can reach their level though. However, there are ways to get there. You just need a slightly different approach and strategy. For instance, go to the job board section on LinkedIn and type \u201cWriter Jobs\u201d in the search box. The potential clients you find over there, pitch them with your portfolio and explain why you are a perfect fit for them.Another example is type \u201canything\u201d on Google search engine and look for companies listed on, let\u2019s say, 4th or 5th page. Visit those websites and see if the blogs are updated. If not, contact their marketing and communications department head, and offer them your services by explaining how you can help them organically feature their website on 1st page and thus get the expected traffic. More the traffic inflow, more the potential customers for them. Believe me, this works for best-of-breed writers, for me and this can work for you as well. Hope these strategies will help you land high paying clients. Happy Writing! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve had a steady source of income from writing for a few years now, and even though I should be used to it by now\u2026 It\u2019s still weird to think about. Why? Because I\u2019ve never been a \u201cwriter\u201d, the farthest thing from it actually. Growing up I always hated high school English and never understood why I had to worry about where \u201cand\u201d goes or if I\u2019m using the proper form of APA style writing\u2026 And guess what? I still don\u2019t today. That\u2019s because, as I learned a few years ago, the internet-style of writing is a lot different than the boring academic stuff we learned in school. What do I mean? Well, don\u2019t get me wrong, there\u2019s still a time and place for academic writing (like textbooks or technical documents)\u2026 But for the most part, online companies use the written word for marketing, sales and deepening client relationships\u2026 All things that are done by using a different style of writing, one that most refer to as \u201cspoken language\u201d. In other words, if you know how to talk, and you\u2019re willing to put in a few hours of training\u2026 Then you can easily become a writer too\u2026 And that brings me to my next point, all the different specializations out there. 16 writing specializations that practically guarantee success So after I heard I could become a writer and get paid well for it, I was completely on board\u2026 But there was one small problem that I couldn\u2019t figure out\u200a\u2014\u200ahow do I do this? I mean, whenever I think of writer, I think of Authors or Journalists\u2026 But after asking the friend who introduced me to this new world, he quickly laughed and started telling me about all the different opportunities out there today. From proofreading to writing emails, I quickly learned that there\u2019s enough opportunities for everybody\u2026 And throughout my years of experience, I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s 16 specializations that practically guarantee success\u2026 Starting with: Blog/Article Writer Since you\u2019re reading this right now, I know you understand what a blog is\u2026 But what most don\u2019t understand is how important blogs actually are. I guess I always thought companies wrote blogs for the fun of it, but after looking into it a little more\u2026 I can across an interesting concept, content marketing. If you\u2019re not familiar with content marketing, it\u2019s an efficient way for companies to attract new clients\u2026 And they do this by writing useful information, which then attracts potential clients to their website\u2026 With the remainder of the sales process taking place from there. In short, I\u2019m pretty sure every legitimate company attracts customers with content marketing, so there\u2019s always going to be a demand for this field\u2026 And as a bonus hint, if you have another skill that can be combined with your ability to write (i.e. a CPA who writes about tax for other firms)\u2026 Then you\u2019re going to be set for life. Demand Level: High Income Level: It\u2019s not surprising to make $40/hr for this service, which isn\u2019t the highest, but it\u2019s always consistent work\u2026so that\u2019s a major plus in itself. Difficulty Level: Depends on the industry you\u2019re working in, as it can be harder to write on some topics, but for the job itself\u200a\u2014\u200ablog writing is simple and enjoyable. Press Release Writer Another field where I\u2019ve seen a lot of people make money in, writing press releases. Now when I first started working online, I actually thought it was funny that people got paid to do this\u2026 Because from what I could see, it really wasn\u2019t that hard. If you\u2019re not familiar with press releases, they\u2019re really just a short essay that\u2019s sent to multiple press outlets in hopes of getting some publicity\u2026 And most companies will do this when they have something noteworthy to announce, like a new product or some big news. Anyway, I stayed away from press releases for the first few months, but then after I continued to read about it and noticed how helpful they could be\u2026 I decided to write a short press release announcing my new company, then sent it off to multiple outlets. The results? Nothing. Not even a reply. This was depressing and made me despise press releases for a while, but after I cleaned up my tears and quit acting like a two-year-old\u2026 I decided to give it another shot, and this time, I hired a professional press release writer to do it for me. The results this time? Well, I actually got some replies and made it into some publication (I can\u2019t even remember the name now, and I don\u2019t think it did me any good, but hey\u200a\u2014\u200ait was an improvement). Long story short, most companies don\u2019t do a lot of press releases and they\u2019re not going to take the time to figure them out\u2026 Making them more than willing to outsource this work, and that might be a great opportunity for you. Demand Level: Medium, but at the same time, I don\u2019t see too many press release writers out there\u2026so the demand tends to be higher than the supply. Income Level: Varies. I\u2019ve seen some people charge as little as $5 for these, and then I\u2019ve seen some people charge upwards of $200. In other words, it might take you a few projects to get your rank up\u2026but once you do, you\u2019re set. Difficulty Level: After you do one or two, it\u2019s pretty easy. Sales Copywriter Sales Copywriting is hands down my favorite line of work, and if you can learn from the right people, then you\u2019re going to make a lot of money off it. Why? Because it\u2019s one of those deals where every writer thinks they can do it, and even though writing is important\u2026 It\u2019s far from the only thing you need to know, as sales copywriting focuses 100% on psychology and emotional triggers, the things that get people to buy. What do I mean? Well, most writers think they can throw some fancy words on a page, spice it up with a lot of !!! and then top it off with some shiny buttons\u2026 Which is almost an insult to mankind, as nobody falls for that stuff. On the other hand, if you can understand the target market\u2019s wants, fears, and uncertainties\u2026 And then position a product or service to match these characteristics, then you\u2019ll have clients for years to come. Demand Level: Through the roof Income Level: As high as it gets for writers. Difficulty Level: Very difficult, and it takes a lot of brainpower. 20 hours of sales writing knocks me down for a week. Landing Page Copywriter Carrying on with the \u201csales\u201d theme, landing page copywriter. This is another important one for me and even though I like sales copywriting the best, I\u2019ve found that I make the most money by creating landing page content. Why? Because it\u2019s the area with the highest demand, but it\u2019s also one where many copywriters fail to convert\u2026 And if you have any examples that are above the typical 1% conversion rate that most mediocre copywriters receive, then well, your services are going to be in high demand. If you\u2019re not familiar with the term landing page, it\u2019s really just a one page offshoot of your regular website. They\u2019re called landing pages as it\u2019s where specific traffic is sent, and even though this can take place in any form of marketing\u2026 The most common method is paid advertising, which is also why I think landing pages are popular today. The best part of landing pages is that they really don\u2019t take a lot of words to get the point across, and if you come across a client that\u2019s been burned by other copywriters in the past, making them more than willing to pay for good results\u2026 Then you can easily make upwards of $150/hr to do this (and it\u2019s uncommon, but I\u2019ve actually had a few projects where I made over $200/hr\u2026which they were happy to pay as I was able to get them a 34% conversion ratio). Demand Level: Very high. Income Level: If you can show past results that are well above the competition (which isn\u2019t that hard to do with a little bit of practice), then you can easily do fixed projects that pay over $100/hr Difficulty Level: Easier than sales copywriting, but it still takes time (and proper training) to learn\u2026putting it in the hard (but achievable) column. Ad Copywriter It takes good copy to make a landing page convert well, but the right type of traffic never hurts either\u2026 And that all starts with brilliant ad copy. This seems to be a field where a lot of companies can get by and they usually mimic their competitors ads, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a demand for this either\u2026 As every company wants to stick out and get the most clicks on their ad, which is accomplished with great copy and okay design. This is a field that I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of times but it\u2019s also one where I usually don\u2019t enter, unless I\u2019m doing the landing page copy as well. Why? Because even though companies understand the importance of good ad copy, and they\u2019re willing to pay for it\u2026 Most of the ads only take 50 words (or less), and since a lot of companies look at pricing on a per word basis\u2026 It\u2019s tough to charge a lot for these services, and since it still takes time to do some customer research before creating the copy\u2026 I\u2019ve just found that it\u2019s usually not worth your time, UNLESS you\u2019re doing this as an add-on for landing pages, because you\u2019ve already done the research and it\u2019s just an easy 50 words after that. Demand Level: High Income Level: By itself, not that much. As an add-on, very profitable. Difficulty Level: Medium, but once you get the hang of it, it goes very quick (it took me 7 minutes to do my most recent ad copy, and the results have been amazing). Email Marketing Copywriter If you have any experience working online then you\u2019ve definitely heard that \u201cthe money is in the list\u201d\u2026 And by list, they mean email list\u2026 Which is definitely true, but here\u2019s the thing, very few companies actually know how to do this properly. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve joined an email list and received generic sales emails everyday, which makes me cringe as I know they\u2019re scaring away hundreds of customers\u2026 But it\u2019s also annoying, because well, who likes to receive a sales email everyday? Nobody, and after seeing unsuccessful marketing campaigns combined with floods of email unsubscribes, most companies are quick to hire email copywriters\u2026 And that can create an amazing opportunity for you. Just remember, when it comes to email marketing there\u2019s really 2 different forms: Automated\u201cBroadcast\u201dAutomated email marketing refers to email funnels where you create a sequence of emails once, and then use them forever. This usually takes place when a new subscriber joins their email list, and as you can guess, this is an amazing asset that companies can use forever\u2026 So they\u2019re willing to pay top-dollar for good work, but just remember, it\u2019s not as easy as \u201cwriting emails\u201d. This is a mistake I see all the time and have had to clean up a lot of good writing that\u2019s not working because the copywriter didn\u2019t understand the underlying formula that takes place. Then for broadcast emails, these are the type of emails that are sent frequently\u200a\u2014\u200alike 3\u20135 days per week. The complexity of this really depends on the company, as you can really get advanced and send out some detailed emails 3\u20135x per week\u2026 But for the most part, most companies are looking for guidance on when and how they should send emails. This puts you into more of a consultant role and that pays well, but when it comes to daily email marketing, most companies aren\u2019t going to pay as much\u2026 Even though it\u2019s consistent work, so that\u2019s something to consider as well. Demand Level: High Income Level: Automated\u200a\u2014\u200aVery high (similar to sales copywriting). Broadcast\u200a\u2014\u200aMedium Difficulty Level: Correlates to income level. Automated email funnels are difficult and take a lot of time (they\u2019re really a long sales letter split into separate days) while broadcast emails may take a little bit of training, but they\u2019re not too difficult to do once you get the hang of it. Ebook Writer I really have a love-hate relationship with this specialization. I love it because it\u2019s not too terribly hard to do, and they\u2019re usually medium-large projects that can keep you busy for awhile\u2026 But I hate it because, in my years of experience, NOBODY WANTS TO PAY WELL FOR THESE. Some of the pricing I\u2019ve seen is absolutely rediculous (less than 1 cent per word) and even though I\u2019ve had plenty of opportunities, I\u2019ve never accepted one of these deals as there\u2019s never been one that\u2019s even close to worthwhile. With that said, I don\u2019t advise specializing in this field as it\u2019d be hard to make a living, but there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll come across a topic that you enjoy\u200a\u2014\u200aand if you\u2019re just getting started, it might be a good way to get your feet wet. Just remember, ebook can mean 2 completely different things in today\u2019s world\u2026 With one being the typical \u201clead magnet\u201d (shorter ebooks that are designed to collect email address)\u2026 And then there\u2019s an actual book that\u2019s only sold in electronic form. These are going to be longer and require more quality work, so be careful with pricing before entering one of these deals. Demand Level: Medium. I see plenty of these, but people are starting to become \u201cdesensitized\u201d to ebooks\u2026so their popularity is on the decline. Income Level: Low, very low. From what I\u2019ve seen, you can make more as a proofreader. Difficulty Level: Easy, as long as you understand the topic. Copy Editor If there\u2019s one hidden gem of online writing, it\u2019s the copy editor. Why? Because the biggest problem with having somebody else write for you is having them find your voice and understanding how to say it like you want to say it. Sure, you could always pay an expensive copywriter that takes the time to understand your voice and write it exactly how you would\u2026 But most new entrepreneurs don\u2019t have that kind of money laying around, and that\u2019s where the copy editor comes into play. The copy editor really works like any kind of editor, where they come in and clean up your work after it\u2019s ready (usually a first draft)\u2026 But a copy editor takes this one step further and actually goes through the work, then transforms it into a well-written blog that has the flow/structure of a professionally-written blog\u2026 And since you took the time to create the first draft, having a copy editor is about 90% cheaper than having a full-blown copywriter who writes this for you. This is actually how I first started blogging, and I think I paid my copy editor around $10 for a 1,200 word blog\u2026 Which worked amazing as it saved me countless hours everyday (from editing), and also helped me improve my writing style dramatically (after seeing what they did to improve it)\u2026 So it\u2019s something I advise for any new entrepreneur, but it can also be an amazing start for you. How? Well, on the other side of things, I\u2019ve noticed that the hardest part for a lot of new writers is getting started. I guess some call this white page syndrome, while others call it performance anxiety\u2026 But once there\u2019s words on a page, and it\u2019s not your work that you\u2019re looking at, it\u2019s really not that difficult to go through and edit a blog. Then on top of this, you really don\u2019t have to know a lot about a subject to edit a blog (even though it does help), and that means there\u2019s endless opportunity out there\u2026 So if you don\u2019t like the idea of writing everyday, where you have to create something from scratch and thoroughly understand a topic\u2026 Then copy editing might be a great start for you. Demand Level: Medium. From what I\u2019ve seen, this is something that a lot of people will gladly use, but they don\u2019t think about it. That\u2019s why I have to give it a medium demand rating, but if you know how to explain your services, it could easily jump into the \u201chigh\u201d category. Income Level: Since the work is easier, you\u2019re going to be making a little less\u2026but it\u2019s still a great start that pays okay ($30/hr is a good starting point). At the same time, it\u2019s usually consistent work, so that\u2019s something to consider as well. Difficulty Level: Measy (get it, like medium and easy?) Okay, maybe not the best joke, but I think you get the hint\u2026it\u2019s not something that I can call easy, but it\u2019s certainly easier than most other forms of writing\u2026so it falls somewhere in between medium and easy. Proofreader Carrying on with the editor theme, proofreaders. As I mentioned above, copy editors are advanced editors that not only go through and proofread a client\u2019s work\u2026 But they also do some restructuring and rephrasing to ensure a constant flow throughout the entire article. This takes some extra time and allows you to command higher pay\u2026 But if you\u2019re still uncertain about your editing skills and want to start with something easier, than proofreading is for you. This line of work is really about as simple as it gets, and the typical clients you work with are ones that just started a side hustle and don\u2019t care about the quality of work too much\u2026 But they still want to have everything spelled correctly, so they\u2019ll hire a proofreader to skim through their work and make sure there\u2019s no major typos that stick out. This is honestly a line of work that anybody could do, as you\u2019re merely getting paid to be a second set of eyes, and as you can guess\u2026that means you\u2019re not going to get paid that much. With that said, it\u2019s still a great start if you\u2019re not comfortable with any of the other roles, so it\u2019s something I wanted to mention. Demand Level: Medium. There\u2019s always going to be work out there, but it seems like proofreaders are always \u201chunting\u201d as well. What I mean by that is most proofreading clients are usually one-time projects (such as ebook proofreaders) or long-term commitments that don\u2019t last long (client either quits their side hustle or graduates to a copy editor), so that\u2019s something to keep in mind as well. Income Level: Low. This is really about as easy as it gets for online writing, so you should expect the lowest rates out there. It\u2019s possible to charge $30/hr, but you\u2019re probably going to be closer to the $15\u201320/hr range\u2026especially in the beginning. Difficulty Level: Easy. Proofreading is really just looking for typos, so it\u2019s something anybody can do. Video Sales Letter Copywriter I guess I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the correct name for this field, and it just sounds funny to say\u2026 But this is the most common name I\u2019ve seen for this role, so it gets the point across anyway. With that said, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed this or not, but the recent demand for videos has skyrocketed. It seems like every company is using this for every aspect of their business, and rightfully so. Most people simply prefer videos over text, and this isn\u2019t really a lazy thing, it\u2019s more of a learning preference\u2026 But either way, I think they\u2019re here to stay, and out of all the video fields\u2026 The one that\u2019s always caught my attention is video sales letters. If you\u2019re not familiar with this term, it relates to videos that are intended to sell a product or service\u2026 And one thing I never realized (or thought of) was that every one of these videos actually has a script (or sales letter), and that\u2019s where the copywriter comes into play. I\u2019ve actually had the opportunity to create a few of these, and even though they\u2019re very similar to traditional sales letters (i.e. sales copywriters), they do have some differences\u2026 And from my experience, I\u2019d say they\u2019re a tad bit harder\u200a\u2014\u200abut that could have been my lack of experience as well. Either way, if you want to take the time to learn this skill, you\u2019ll always have clients begging for your service\u2026 Allowing you to have a constant stream of work, and charge a high rate while doing so. Demand Level: High. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you won\u2019t see as many opportunities as you would in the blog writing field, but these projects are always much longer and that offsets the difference. I can confidently say that any video sales letter writer will always have enough work to keep them busy, and with the usage of videos on the rise, I think this demand level will stay the same (if not increase) for years to come. Income Level: Very high. You\u2019re going to be in line with a sales copywriter, and from what I\u2019ve seen, most video sales letter copywriters can easily charge in excess of $125/hr\u2026.while possibly getting commissions on top of this, if you\u2019re able to get results. Difficulty Level: Hard. Like sales letters, writing is only a small fraction of the skill needed to complete this role. It takes some time to understand the underlying structure, psychology, and target market research\u2026so don\u2019t expect to jump in and become a video sales letter copywriter on day 1. Explainer Video Copywriter Carrying on with the video theme, explainer video copywriter. Now I wanted to mention video sales letters first as they\u2019re more common, but explainer videos shouldn\u2019t be laughed at either. If you\u2019ve never heard of an explainer video, they\u2019re really a shorter version of a sales video, generally ranging from 1\u20132 minutes long\u2026 And their main goal is to introduce a product or service, which usually moves the customer further down the funnel. I honestly love picking up these projects as they\u2019re quick, easy, and fun (usually around 100 words)\u2026 But clients are always willing to pay pretty good for them as well, so it\u2019s always a fast way to make some extra money. Heck, the other day I was bored in between projects so I picked up a quick explainer video script and made $125 in 2 hours\u2026 So it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a fresh rookie that\u2019s looking for your first project, or an industry vet that\u2019s looking to fill some free time\u2026 This is a field that I think everybody should know. Demand Level: This one is tough as I want to say high, but from my experience, it\u2019s not quite at that point yet\u2026so I have to give it a medium. With that said, I continue to see more and more everyday, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be long before hitting the \u201chigh\u201d mark. Income Level: It pays well, but the projects are never large. This means you\u2019ll be doing a lot of starting and stopping (where you have to keep understanding new products), and that can take a lot of mental energy so I usually just advise this as a side hustle or added service, but it\u2019s a great field nonetheless. Difficulty Level: Medium. It\u2019s really just telling a story and anybody can do it, but you have to understand scriptwriting and storytelling first. Grant Writer I\u2019ll be the first to admit that this is one field I don\u2019t quite understand 100%, but I\u2019ve also seen people make some decent money off of it, so I had to at least mention it. From what I understand, grant writers just create applications for funding, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a line of work that takes a specialized skill set\u2026. But I\u2019ve never met a lot of people who specialize in this field either, so if you wanted to position yourself as a grant writer, I\u2019m sure you could get a decent amount of work. As for the work itself, personally speaking, I think it looks boring and it\u2019s a lot of technical writing, which eliminates a lot of creativity\u2026 But I personally know one person that enjoys this line of work, so if you\u2019re not the creative type\u200a\u2014\u200athen it might be something to look into. Last but not least, the one thing that really scares me with this field is the ideal target market\u200a\u2014\u200anon-profit entities. From my experience, non-profits usually don\u2019t like to pay a lot of money and would rather exchange services more than anything else\u2026 So that makes me skeptical on the amount of income you could make, but that\u2019s pure speculation\u200a\u2014\u200aso it might be something to look into. Demand Level: Medium. When you think about how many non-profits there are in the U.S., and how many of them are always applying for some kind of funding\u2026then the amount of work can really add up quick. On top of this, I don\u2019t see too many grant writers out there, so the supply is low, giving you a great opportunity to have a lot of work. Income Level: Low. I\u2019m sure you could work your way up and demand higher prices once you show that you\u2019re able to get most grants approved, but as I mentioned earlier, the ideal target market is non-profits\u200a\u2014\u200aand they\u2019re not known as big spenders. Difficult Level: Easy. From what I\u2019ve heard, once you do one or two, you\u2019ve done them all. I think it\u2019s really just fill in the blank work and knowing what the approving agencies want to hear, but again, I don\u2019t have any experience in this field\u2026so you might want to fact check me on that. Business Plan Writer As an ex-Commercial Loan Officer who\u2019s seen hundreds of business plans, I can confidently say that 99% of new entrepreneurs need help with this field\u2026 But just like a few of the other categories we\u2019ve discussed, it requires more than a general ability to write. Instead, you\u2019ll need to have an understanding of mitigating risks and identifying problems, along with financial projections and why they\u2019re accurate\u2026 All things that most entrepreneurs forget to mention. This is actually a field that I worked with in the beginning of my writing career, and my background allowed me to pick up a lot of jobs so demand was never a problem\u2026 But it just got really boring and overwhelming to me. Why? New entrepreneurs have this wave of energy that\u2019s hard to keep up with, and they always want to have their projects done right away\u2026 So that was kind of annoying, but on top of this, once you do one business plan it seems like you\u2019ve done them all, and even though it is fun to look at different ideas\u2026 The redundancy got me, and that\u2019s why I decided to switch over to a creative field\u200a\u2014\u200alike sales copywriting. With that said, if you have a background in finance and like writing business plans, then this is a great opportunity for you as technology has created a new wave of entrepreneurs that are looking for funding\u200a\u2014\u200aand I don\u2019t think the demand is going to go away anytime soon. Demand Level: High. I\u2019ve never seen a shortage of business plan requests and they\u2019re the perfect-sized projects. They\u2019re long enough to where you\u2019re not having to hunt all the time, but they\u2019re short enough to where you can quickly complete them and have a steady source of cash flow, so it\u2019s not a bad field to specialize in. Income Level: This is a completely biased opinion, but if you understand Accounting and Financial Projections, then you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. Most new entrepreneurs think their product is going to make $10 Million in the first week, so if you can show them how to map out reasonable projections that actually get funding, then they\u2019ll usually open their wallets. Just remember, not all new entrepreneurs have a lot of money\u200a\u2014\u200aso you have to choose your clients wisely. Difficulty Level: This is also one that\u2019s hard for me to answer, as I have a Master\u2019s in Accounting with 5 years of Commercial Lending experience, so it was easy for me\u2026but I could see how it\u2019d be a hard field to learn right away. Technical Writer The part of writing that really lured me in was the mention of \u201cspoken language\u201d, where you don\u2019t have to worry about proper english or the correct usage of \u201cand\u201d\u2026 So I\u2019m probably the last person who should speak about technical writing, but for the purposes of showing you the 16 best specialties\u200a\u2014\u200aI had to include this on the list. Technical writing can really cover a broad range of topics, and it seems like everybody has a slightly different definition of what it means\u2026 But as the Bureau of Labor Statistics explains: \u201cTechnical writers, also called technical communicators, prepare instruction manuals, how-to guides, journal articles, and other supporting documents to communicate complex and technical information more easily. They also develop, gather, and disseminate technical information through an organization\u2019s communications channels.\u201d Or in normal language, they take technical subjects and break them down into a way that the user can understand. Having a pre-emptive knowledge of how a certain industry works is always helpful in this field, but if you\u2019re able to take complex subjects and break them down into an easy-to-read format, then you\u2019re more than qualified to take on this role. So why did I mention the usage of proper english earlier? Because, for the most part, a lot of these companies want their technical writing to be in an APA style format. Think of any instruction guide that you\u2019ve used in the past, and that\u2019s really what technical writing is looking for. That\u2019s fine for some, but I know they\u2019d hate my style of writing, so this is a field I\u2019ve always stayed away from. Demand Level: High. I\u2019ve seen a lot of opportunities for this field, and even though I\u2019m sure I could suck it up and try it out, I\u2019ve never been attracted to this line of work\u200a\u2014\u200aso it\u2019s something I have zero experience in. Income Level: I\u2019ve talked to a few technical writers and they make a good amount of money. It seems like most of them focus on the instructions/user manual line of work, but either way\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019d say it\u2019s on the high side of the medium range ($75/hr or so). Difficulty Level: Easy for some, hard for others. I actually talked to a few technical writers before writing this, just so I could have a better understanding of it, and even though they tried to make it sound hard\u2026from what I got, it really boils down to the ability of breaking down complex subjects. Website Content Copywriter Most people claim that if you\u2019re any type of copywriter, then you should be able to create website content\u2026 But I have to strongly disagree. Why? Well, I know this is a mental thing and I could easily figure it out if I wanted to, but I\u2019ve tried to do web content a few times\u2026 And every time, I\u2019ve fallen on my face. It just seems like you have to be very short with your writing, having the ability to explain something in a few words\u2026 While my style is long and in-depth (if you couldn\u2019t tell by this article), so website content has never been my thing. With that said, there\u2019s always new websites being created so there will always be a high demand for website copywriters\u2026 But on top of this, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of people try web content for themselves at first, then after seeing how their website isn\u2019t getting any conversions\u2026 They\u2019ll usually reach out to a website copywriter, and by that time they\u2019re likely an established company, so you can charge a pretty penny to do so. In short, this is a great field to specialize in, and if I had good results with it I\u2019d probably brag it up more\u2026 But I don\u2019t, so we\u2019ll just leave it at that. Demand Level: High, I always see clients looking for this. Income Level: The pay range is very broad with this field, as I\u2019ve seen some people get paid $20/hr while others get upwards of $125/hr\u2026but if you\u2019re good, you\u2019ll get paid well. Difficulty Level: For me, very high. For most copywriters, medium. I think being able to explain a lot with few words is very important, but it\u2019s also important to understand how customers react with a website as well. SEO Copywriter Last, but certainly not least\u200a\u2014\u200athe SEO Copywriter. This field is one that I also have a love-hate relationship with, but this time, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m being completely unfair. Why? Well, the main reason why I dislike this field is simply because I hate the concept of SEO. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love ranking high and have a couple articles that rank #1 in Google, but I\u2019ve also seen a lot of\u2026.well, what I\u2019d consider fraud, in this industry. What I mean is that EVERYBODY wants SEO, and it doesn\u2019t take long to notice this demand, which has created a new wave of \u201cexperts\u201d\u2026 The ones that promise rankings overnight by increasing your site speed, shrinking your images, inserting the proper meta tags\u2026 All things that do help, but not something you should worry about until you have at least 100,000 monthly visits on your website. So how do you reach that point? With SEO Copywriting, which can be made into a complex subject\u2026 But in the simplest form, it\u2019s really just knowing where to insert your keyword (without keyword stuffing) and then creating a quality blog that gets a lot of comments and shares\u2026 Which is 90% of what you need to rank high in Google. With that said, there\u2019s 2 people in this industry that I respect (because they helped me rank on the front page of Google in 83 days), which is Neil Pateland Backlinko. Reading these guys for a while will give you everything you need to know, and after you have that, you can easily become an SEO Copywriter\u2026 Which is really just a fancy way of saying blog writer that understands SEO (even though you can get paid a lot more for it). How You Can Become a Paid Writer As Tim Ferriss says best, there\u2019s about as many ways of becoming an entrepreneur as there is entrepreneurs\u2026 And I think the same logic applies to writers, so you could realistically start reading free resources (like Copyblogger) and get started soon\u2026 But if you want to learn about my favorite niche, and how I started gaining clients (even though I had zero experience) - then please check this out ",

You see, to make money with a blog, you have to get traffic there\u2026 and it can take some time to build traffic.  What I recommend is to write your stories offline and then publish them to Amazon. But wait\u2026 before you start freaking out\u2026 it is not as hard as you may think. Here are some steps I recommend on getting starting in self-publishing: Write. If you want to make money by writing stories, then by all means write!Join forums, blogs, and social media groups related to your genre and then contribute your thoughts when you have thoughts. Don\u2019t ever post unwelcome advice or comments. You want to stay with the groups to build your pen name, not to get banned. Share with the members bits of your story or a description of a pivotal point. Get them thirsting for more before you\u2019ve even published.Edit, edit, edit. When you are finished with your story, make sure to have it edited. If you can\u2019t afford to pay a lot, check out sites like http://Fiverr.comAdvance Reader Copy. Want to make sure readers of your genre enjoy your story? Ask for advanced copy readers! They\u2019ll give you their honest opinion in exchange for reading your story.Cover model. Everyone is told not to judge a book by its cover\u2026 but we all do it. You must make sure that your cover fits the genre and looks worthy of being a best-seller. How do you do this? Browse the best-selling stories of your genre on Amazon. What do the covers have in common? Is there a theme, a certain color scheme? And, if you aren\u2019t a professional designer, hire a professional! Here are a couple of designers that I recommend to do a bang-up job and not break the bank:Go On WriteOlivia Pro DesignDescribe. Make sure that your blurb or description is interesting and piques the interest of potential readers. Not sure how to do it? Check out the blurbs for top-selling stories in your genre. Notice how they make you feel the story\u2026 use them as examples.Publish. The biggest challenge in self-publishing? Hitting that \u201cpublish\u201d button! You can do it! If you\u2019ve followed all of my above steps, you are good to go!I wrote fiction for a time and within six-months of starting, I was bringing in 6k per month. (Honestly, I only followed my above steps the last three months before my success!) If I can do it, I am confident you can too. Good luck! Lara :) ",

            "answer_text": "The interesting thing about writing, is that you can convey ideas and thoughts across time and space. Gutenberg first made this possible through his printing press. Today, with Internet, you can send your ideas and thoughts to potentially millions of people. HOW TO MAKE MONEY FROM WRITING The main question is, \u201cWhat can you write that people will find valuable enough to happily pay for it?\u201d This is the million-dollar question! It\u2019s like the \u201choly grail\u201d of Internet marketing because anyone, even teenagers, can write and publish online. The challenge is, WHAT can one write in order to inspire, inform and/or instruct people? You must first have hypotheses, and then test each hypothesis to discover what writings people would be willing to pay for. Many writers on Quora COULD be earning money, however they do not explicitly state their hypotheses, let alone test them. A tiny minority have been able to create books from their answers, and make money from their books. The important thing is to focus and concentrate. Focus on ONE topic and write ONLY or MOSTLY about that topic. Of course, I\u2019m assuming \u2014 if you want to make money \u2014 that it\u2019s a topic people are interested in, like relationships, health, wealth, etc. Focus, focus, focus! Also: Little by little, does the trick (as Seneca wrote). The more you write (every day, if possible), the better you get at it. And as you get better at it, words flow easily and you\u2019ll find yourself in a situation where you can create newsletters, blogs, vlogs, ebooks, reports, etc. rather effortlessly \u2014 and get paid. Just keep writing. Isaac Asimov is my role model. Using only an electric typewriter, he was able to write and publish 300 books! His trick: he did not censor or edit himself too much. Today, we have word processors and computers, but we judge ourselves too much and too early. Just write, write, write. And the money will eventually come. ",

With Medium, you can upload and article and tag it with up to five tags. People who like your article can \u201cclap\u201d for it up to 50 times by hitting the clap button. The more people who read and clap for your story, the more Medium will promote it. The best way to grow your audience is to submit stories to publications that have their own audience. That way when your story is published, people who follow that publication might see your story in their feed. Medium also has a \u201cpartner program\u201d where users pay $5 a month to get access to content on Medium that is otherwise locked. You can sign up to write content for the partner program (it\u2019s free to do this) and you\u2019ll get paid monthly based on how much engagement your posts get (views and caps). According to Medium, the average writer who writes for the partner program makes about $60 a month and the top writers make $6,000-$8,000 a month. There are more profitable ideas out there, but this one is super easy to get started with.

For a limited time, it\u2019s just 99 cents on Kindle (although I think it will still be a steal even when I raise it to $2.99 and eventually to $9.99) You can get the book here: Personal Finance That Works For You: How to Build Wealth, Design Your Future, and Make Money While You Sleep eBook: Matthew Kent: Kindle Store  ",

The other could pay his groceries, but not his rent. I\u2019m very familiar with their content. I\u2019ve been a paid writer, but I could not write what they wrote for long, because I found it mind-numbing and soul-sucking. To me, it felt like being chained to your laptop for 4 hours a day, not counting the admin tasks related to it, but not actually producing content. But they got into the mindspace that they were little more than assembly line workers, producing words on a conveyer belt, like widgets. You have to write fast, and not care much about the details, other than being grammatically correct and make sense. As far as making money blogging, well, that\u2019s all over the place, but the ones I\u2019ve seen have at least one thing in common \u2014 they heavily cross-advertise other bloggers\u2019 services and products, so that those bloggers will cross-advertise \u201cmy\u201d services and/or products. Much of it is insincere, but viewed as a business necessity. I find that unsavory, if not mercenary. To be a successful blogger, you essentially are a salesman of a product, and that product is YOU. I\u2019ve done it, and it gets tiresome and vaguely exploitive to post stuff when you have nothing to say, merely because you need to keep the buzz up, to ensure that eyeballs keep coming back to your page.

The question is: \u201cWhat is content?\u201d When is comes to internet marketing, here is the definition. \u201cContent marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience \u2014 and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.\u201d This is the definition given by the content marketing institute. How do you make money online writing content? The best way to write content is to first do some research. This is essential. You have to find out what people are looking for. Unless you know what they are looking for, you have very little chance of people clicking and reading your content. The more traffic you can get reading your content, the higher it will appear in the search engines. Producing one piece of great content is not going to work however. The key is to produce great content consistently. That way your content will get more views. The best way to do this is to have a blog or website. Having got a popular blog or website, you can then place affiliate links on it. Make sure that the affiliate product is relevant to your content you are writing about.

It takes a lot of work and even more patience, and you have got to be a half-decent writer; if you\u2019re crap, don\u2019t even bother. However, if you have the three qualities above, here\u2019s my advice. Fiverr: Use Fiverr as a starting point. It\u2019s not easy to get going on Fiverr, but once you get a few orders under your belt, things will pick up nicely for you.Upwork: Upwork works in a different way to Fiverr. In Fiverr, you wait for people to contact you. With Upwork, you write to people looking for writers. You have to be just as patient with Upwork as you need to be with Fiverr.Quora: I know of a couple of writers who got jobs through Quora after people saw their work. I\u2019m not one of them which says something about my writing! Actually, that\u2019s not true. The writers who got jobs are creative writers, where I just go on about making money online all the time.There are many more places to find writing gigs, but the three above are an excellent place to start. Just remember what I said, when you are just starting, you will need to be really patient, and if you want to make writing a full-time job, you\u2019ll need to be really, really patient. Good luck in the future. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several platforms where you can find freelance content writing jobs online. Worknhire and Upwork are two of the platforms I\u2019m familiar with. But the problem is you have to make bids in order to get hired. The employer will make a selection based on which bidders fit their requirements. And if you\u2019re a beginner with no referrals, you\u2019ll have a much lower chance of winning the bid. Also, I think the job offers on Worknhire pay much less than Upwork. But Upwork is a much more competitive platform. If you\u2019re determined, you can regularly make 2\u20133 bids every day and possibly get hired for the first time after 2\u20133 weeks. I haven\u2019t had the time to do this as I have a full-time content writing job. You can also search on Naukri.com. If you want to make a name in a niche/industry, I would also recommend finding relevant blogs and websites that accept guest posts and pay for submissions. For this, just google \u201cwrite for us\u201d or \u201csubmit guest post\u201d. Then check out the results to see whether the website is relevant to your expertise and whether they offer any compensation for submissions. You can then come up with fresh content to submit to the ideal websites. ",

Also consider what kind of writing you want to do. There\u2019s always a market for people to write blog posts or very short articles. Businesses need this kind of material. Just be aware that many people seem to think writing is easy and anyone can do it, so they expect you to write for very little money.
