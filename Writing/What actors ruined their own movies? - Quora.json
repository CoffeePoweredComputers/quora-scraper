            "answer_text": "This is just my own personal opinion and others may disagree, but it was the remake of the 1968 movie version of The Planet of the Apes, starring Mark Walhberg. While I think Walhberg is a decent actor, for supporting roles, him being cast with a starring role in this movie just didn't go over well with me. I thought he was totally miscast for this role, and it just didn't work. The remake wasn'all that good to begin with, so maybe having a miscast actor in the starring role didn't make much of a difference. The 1968 version of this film with Charton Heston was 100% better. A classic movie such as planet of the apes can't be improved upon with a remake. ",
