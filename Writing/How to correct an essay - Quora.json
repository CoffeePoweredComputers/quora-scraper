            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on what you're correcting. I have two different strategies that I feel work, and help me improve my writing. If you're doing editing/ grammar, copy and paste the essay into something like google translate. Hit the speaker button and hold a copy in your hand while it reads it back to you. Even reading your own essay aloud can leave you skipping over grammatical mistakes. Listening to it being read also works, I just assume you have no one because I don't either.If you're doing content and revising it, decide on your thesis. Take a highlighter and highlight any body paragraph sentences that support that claim. Find a sentence that doesn't, or could be read in a way that supports a different claim more. Your goal is the have all that color, and none that don't in some way support you general idea",
