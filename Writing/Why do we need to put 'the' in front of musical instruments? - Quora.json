            "answer_text": "I have read several answers here that are beside the point. The real question is why it is even legitimate to put a definite article, normally signifying one single particular specific object, in front of a categorical noun. It is because the syntax sounds highly irregular; it is not \u201cwhether it is the only way\u201d, or \u201cwhether it is necessary\u201d, or \u201cunder what circumstances\u201d, or \u201cwhether it is required or not\u201d, or \u201cwhether you have to or don\u2019t have to\u201c, as most answers tell us here; it is actually about a form of sentence that normally should NOT be valid in English AT ALL under ANY circumstances, as, of course, it is not valid in other Germanic languages as in Dutch and German. There is even an answer here about ingredients in a salad. Well, skipping ingredients and focusing on the final composition, does anybody in English say \u201cI eat the salad\u201d meaning \u201cI eat salad\u201d? No, the two are totally different in meaning \u2014 as \u201ceating THE salad\u201d means a particular salad, not just any old salad. It does seem that even \u201cI play violins\u201d makes much better semantic sense than \u201cI play THE violin\u201d. The phrase is a violation of one of the most rudimentary forms in English syntax. Then, why on earth? In my opinion, it is a literal idiomatic musicians\u2019 jargon carried over in full from Italian and French, as in suono il violino and je joue le violon. In other words, I reckon that the particular expression is a\u2026 \u201cromancism\u201d :-)) ",

It refers to a discipline as a whole. We say \u2018do you play the flute?\u2019, but we would never say \u2018do you own the flute\u2019 (it would be \u2018this\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019 flute). We use the in some other situations to refer to an entire class of things. Generally, though, we put some kind of article in front of any thing: car, television, play. You would never say \u2018do you drive car?\u2019, or \u2018you own television?\u2019 However, we would say \u2018do you watch television?\u2019 or \u2018do you eat chocolate?\u2019 In this context, \u2018television\u2019 is being used not as a defined thing, but an indeterminate amount. Rain, chocolate, carrots, summer, dreams, water, and so on. ",
