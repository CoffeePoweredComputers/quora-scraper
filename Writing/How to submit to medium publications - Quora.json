            "answer_text": "Each publication has its own requirements. One of my favorites, P.S. I Love You, only accepts new writers the first week of each month. Despite the name, you aren\u2019t stuck writing about dating and romantic relationships. Last month, they published my piece about the senior photo trend on FB. This month, they approved an article about how I miss my delivery gigs. I also like writing for The Startup. They found one of my pieces months ago and invited me to join their publication, so I bypassed the application process. When I want to submit an article to The Startup, I upload it to Medium, click on the option to add it to my preferred publication, and wait a few days to see if they accept or reject it. ",
