            "answer_text": "There is a very high divisity in boarding schools and the students that attend them, so calling them all bad for everyone makes no sense. so, lets go over some of the things why you could consider boarding schools bad: The children get cut off from the rest of society: this is true for some boarding schools that are in the middle of nowhere, they exist, but definitely not every boarding school is like this, several boarding schools are located in the a town or city, where it\u2019s only a short walk to the center of the town or city, so the children are still close to society.Boarding schools encourage elitism: of course this is going to happen in some elite school (be they boarding school or day schools), but not all boarding schools are elite schools, there are boarding schools for several purposes, there are elite boarding school, where this could be a problem, there are boarding school aimed at children with disabilities or emotional problems, some of which are basically psychiatric clinics with schools attached.., there are state-run boarding schools, that offer schooling for students living further away. There was never an issue with elitism in either of my boarding schools, because elitism didn\u2019t make sense in that environment, all the boarders attended a normal state-run school along with several day students.Boarding schools is lazy parenting: Or you know, in some cases it\u2019s the best case scenario. There are many family situations where sending a child off the boarding school offers the most stabile environment. Also, though I don\u2019t doubt there are some parents that stick their kids in boarding school and basically ignore them, most parents continue to be part of their children\u2019s lives, even though they are living at school.You are constantly surrounded by the same people: the same goes for a day school though or living in small village.They are expensive: Some are, especially elite private ones, the boarding schools I went to where around 450 euros (\u2248514 US-dollar) a month, so they weren\u2019t very expensive.The children will become homesick: a lot of them do, a lot of them become so homesick that they can\u2019t stay and need to go home, this happened to a good friend of mine, but a lot either don\u2019t get very homesick or get over it and adapt, children are all different, and for some kids, boarding school isn\u2019t a good choice, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad choice for all children.Bullying: this happens at every school, at a boarding school it could be a lot worse, if your child is getting bullied, something needs to be done, however, not every child gets bullied and not every boarding school is prone to having bullies.Children think they are being abandoned by their parents: if this happens, and if the child thinks this, the parents should do something about it, but this doesn\u2019t happen with most kids in my experience.conclusion: Boarding schools are very broad and range over multiple school types (state-run, religious, elite, disability, etc), so it\u2019s hard to find things that are unanimously bad about boarding schools, because they are so so vary variable. Also, every child and family situation is different and needs slightly different things, sometimes that means a boarding is a good option, sometimes it means it isn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not possible to say they are \u201cbad\u201d. That is too general an adjective. I am very interested in the whole issue of private/independent schools (in fact I have written a book about it, which is about to be published). There is no doubt that attending an independent school gives a child social and academic advantages - although only 7% of the UK population attended one, most judges, MPs etc did and there is a direct link between lifetime earnings and attending boarding school. However, many of the advantages of boarding school can be gained by a) attending a day independent school b) considering how you as a parent can adapt how you bring up your children (this is the basis of my book). In my career I have seen a lot of emotional damage caused to children and the adults they become by disruption to their home situation and separation from their parents. I\u2019m not sure I can see why it would be different if a child is deliberately sent away to school. Some children really suffer when they are first sent to board and we now know that this sort of emotional distress can affect the brain long term. What message does it give the child from the parent: \u201cI don\u2019t want you near me\u201d? Also, while acknowledging that there are special circumstances in which parents send their children away to school (living a very long way from a decent school, for example) I don\u2019t see why people have children if they want to send them away for other adults to look after\u2026 ",
