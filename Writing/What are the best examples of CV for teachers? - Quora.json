            "answer_text": "Some coaching I received recently around applying for teaching positions is not just to have a CV, but to build a portfolio, that has evidence of some of the projects you have worked on that have been successful. Not too much, maybe three or four things. If you want to know the best layout, a quick google search should show you. You will need to tailor your CV and portfolio to the job you are applying for. Only include past history for example that is relevant to the job you are applying for. ",
