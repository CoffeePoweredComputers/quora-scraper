            "answer_text": "First, write a sentence about yourself. This can be just your name if you'd like, or some other feature of your personality that you think readers might be interested to know. Then add some biographical information. Oftentimes people tell small stories about their lives, where they are from, formative experiences, etc., though you are by no means required to do so in your paragraph. Another easy way to write a paragraph about yourself is to make a list of statements that are true of you \"When I was 12 I went to Manilla. I hate most commercially available spaghetti sauces. I tend to sleep in because watching the sunrise makes me cry every time...\" then just keep going until you have yourself a nice little paragraph. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm.... At first I thought, judging from the question and your past, you wanted to write a About page, but the question's description makes it clear that it is not. So, here's my take on what and how you can write about yourself.  - Be Yourself Writing is about communication. For such a type of writing, you need to bring about your personality with your writing. Don't try too be formal, academic or use words or sentence structures you don't normally use.  The tone and voice need to be you.  - Don't get Hung on your Problems  I hope this doesn't seem harsh, whatever you do - don't not focus on your problems. Give an adequate elaboration so people get an idea and can empathize with you.  Most readers don't want to know all the details about your problems - unless it's unique (like you're not well to do, battling cancer, etc). Most people have a tinge of depression and have confusing thoughts on being rich and achieving something. So they know what you're talking about.  - Focus on the solutionsI think the best part of your story comes out in what you did and how you did. More than being inspiring, provide information on what you did, the challenges you face, how did you overcome them. From my personal perspective I would like to know:    - How did you learn coding?    - How did you music app specifically beat the competition    - What drove/motivated you to do what you did?  - Conclude I dislike meh/bleh endings.  Have a good conclusion that will inspire and create your own mark on the reader. The question for you is - What final thoughts do you want to leave with your readers? Something about what you're future plans are? Or, something to inspire them so they too can overcome their challenges?  Hope this help.  PS: Considering who you will be submit this to, I would avoid mentioning illegal things like smoking up. ",
