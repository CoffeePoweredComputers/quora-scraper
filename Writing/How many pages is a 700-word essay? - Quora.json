            "answer_text": "To Bill Chen, A 700-word essay could be one to three pages long depending on how you format it. A single-spaced essay with one-inch margins could fit close to 600 words on a page, so a 700-word essay could occupy two pages, with only a couple of inches of text on the second page. PRO TIP: Single-spacing an essay is a really bad idea. If it\u2019s double spaced, you can fit maybe 300 words on a page. Your page count will vary depending on margins (e.g., normal one-inch margins all around, or something custom), font type (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial, Arial Narrow), font size (e.g., 10 point, 11 point, 12 point), headings, and number of paragraphs. ASK YOUR TEACHER how you should format it. When I was earning my master\u2019s degree this century, one professor required papers to not exceed a maximum page length \u2014 and he was strict about margins, font, and font size. It had to be one-inch margins, and 12-point Times New Roman font. He would not read (or count) anything beyond the maximum length. Tough love, and he was (and still is) one of the favorite professors. To determine how many words you have written, use Microsoft Word\u2019s function (File/Properties/Statistics/Words). For comparison purposes, this entire answer is 228 words long. \u2014Sarah M., posted 26 August 2019  QUESTION: How many pages is a 700-word essay? ",

            "answer_text": "Criteria for essays is always a word limit, so I don\u2019t think page count matters.
