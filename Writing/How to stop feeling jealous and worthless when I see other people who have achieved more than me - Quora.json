            "answer_text": "ONE stop simple solution for this problem is to use it PRODUCTIVELY. First of all, never think that by feeling jealous of other\u2019s achievement , you have done any SIN. Jealousy is a natural human emotion like feeling happy and sad. If this is done half of the issue is resolved. Next , try to figure out why were you left behind. We naturally think about it when we feel jealous and DONT IGNORE THEM And then think of the ways you can overcome these hurdles cuz of which you were left behind and work on then . You might fail a couple of time but once you start overcoming them ,feeling of WORTHLESSNESS will never bother you. Life alwaysys gives you SECOND chance to achieve THE BIGGER GOAL. It's only a matter of perspective. I think feeling jealous is not bad , rather it's a sign of being human. Only rational man and achievers feel jealous . The word jealous might sound oxamoron with the word achiever but achievers are the people who utilize this feeling positively by analysing faults in themselves and working on them rather than finding faults in success of others. Lastly I would say that jealousy is not bad till it takes you to a negative path or towards a negative bent of mind. When human can make productive things out of waste / garbage , I am sure we humans are innovative enough to bring out our own ways to use jealously PRODUCTIVELY. ",
