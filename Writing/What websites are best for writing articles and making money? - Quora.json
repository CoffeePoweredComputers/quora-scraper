            "answer_text": "As a new writer, your best bet to make money out-the-gate really are going to be the websites you listed. Freelancer,eLance,iWriter, orOne of the many other online marketplacesI know it kind of sucks, because you'll be paid next to nothing. That's why I never did that. I cheated the system. Instead of selling my words for next to nothing, I wrote them for free, for myself. I wrote, and wrote, and wrote, and wrote. No one ever saw what I wrote. And I was okay with that. For the time being. And then one day I saw a job listing on Craigslist (of all places) that I was woefully under-qualified for. They wanted 2+ years of professional copy writing experience. I had none.They wanted someone with at least a year of marketing experience. I had none.They wanted someone with knowledge of the Silicon Valley and the startup scene. I had none.So what did I do? Yeah, you're damn right I applied. Because I'd been writing my whole life. Sure, I didn't have the professional experience of selling my words for the price of ramen that day, but I'd put in the hours. Maybe I didn't have the resume to back that up, but I had the work to prove it. And through a lot of follow-up, sample pieces, and a little bit of sucking up... Well, hey, I've got the job. My first writing job was the kind of job most writers aspire for. I don't say that to impress you, but rather to impress upon you this fact: If you want to make money writing, it isn't about what website you post your services on. It's just about pouring yourself into your craft and waiting for the right moment. Sound a little anticlimactic? Maybe it is, but the only truths I can share are those that have been true for me. If you just want to start making money, then I don't care if you \"simply didn't like\" those website. Pay your dues like many other writers and work your way up the ladder. Write for free for others, then charge a couple cents a word, then a couple more cents, and maybe if you're lucky someday a couple dollars per word. Or, forget about all of that nonsense like I did. Just start writing, and watch job boards for jobs that you are insanely under-qualified for. Then get hired. (Do note that that's going to take one metric shit-ton of confidence. Here's a little hack for unbreakable confidence; you're gonna need it) Here are a couple job boards to watch: IndeedCraigslistMonsterYou already know what you want to specialize in (history, gaming, tech...), so you're better off than I was. Since you're already so clear on that, here is the number one website to get paid for your writing: Your own personal blog. Don't have one? Start one. Today. Use whatever platform you want, just start creating a presence for yourself online. One final thing I'll note is that writing as a profession totally changes the way you view it. Be prepared for that. I still love it, don't get me wrong. But before I started being paid for it, writing was an art.  Now I don't have the luxury of treating writing like an art. If you're going to write professionally, learn to turn it into a science. You no longer have the pleasure of having writer's block and it doesn't matter whether or not you \"feel like writing\".  You're probably smarter than I was - You definitely sound like it. But that's just a little heads up in case you hadn't thought of that. Anyway, I think I've written quite enough! I hope that answered your question in some roundabout way. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to shoot me a message or leave a comment. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "Why not go solo? With your own blog or website you can post your articles whenever and however you want. It will be your portfolio for future interviews for big serious magazines. And it can be your \"web-designer\"/\"programmer\"/writer/editor in chief experience. If you write really good articles you can get your readers \u2014 real audience of yours and not of some other website, and there are a lot of ways to earn money with a content-oriented blog, I'll explain this all. Okay, let me put it this step by step. First, you don't have to be a great programmer or web-designer to build websites. There are 3 steps in building a website (and here's a simple guide if you decide to try \u2014 Everything You Need to Know to Start a Website): CMS (content management system) is an application which helps non-techies create and manage their websites. It's an easy replacement for HTML, as far as it does all this coding work. After you download it from official website and install you'll get an admin panel for anything you want to do with your website \u2014 posting articles, adding pictures and videos, customizing your website's design. I would recommend to go WordPress, it is the easiest and the most popular CMS (26.0% of all websites are built with the help of WordPress).You'll obviously need a domain name and a hosting provider. If you choose WordPress here's the list of recommended hosting services. And as for a domain name you'll need something memorable but nowadays it is impossible to get a short catchy domain name, they cost millions, so I suggest to use your own name. After all it's your personal brand you're working on.Get a design. There are free templates or crafted templates which cost $80-120, or professional designers whose services are the most expensive. With each option you'll have a possibility to customize your design, just make sure it fits.And that's it. The average reasonable cost of a website is around $120, but of course there are free hosting providers, themes and basically you can get your website for free and with a minimum efforts as you see. As about the ways to earn money with your website. These are well-known, but I will go through pros and cons of each. Advertisement. With a certain level of popularity others will want you to promote their products and they will pay. And this is the most certain way to earn some cents. But it's not that profitable. And I think promoting others' stuff means stealing from yourself.Guest posts. I like this one more but again not too much. On the one hand it can enrich the style and content of your website, as far as others will write for you, but on the other \u2014 your blog is the place for your development and your articles.Promotional articles you write yourself. This one is great I think. People will pay you for what you basically want to do \u2014 for articles on the topics you're interested in.Affiliate programs. It is similar to the previous one, but more profitable I think. Affiliate programs means writing or posting on a certain topic with a link to the other website. And you're paid some percentage from the purchases made from exactly your website.And the main one which should be #1: your website can be an advertisement of yours, people will discover your texts through it and will invite you to write for other blogs or magazines or whatsoever for money.So, keep up your work and promote your own articles on your own website.
