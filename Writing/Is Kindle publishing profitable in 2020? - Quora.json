            "answer_text": "No offense, and you A2A\u2019d me, but: I\u2019ve always considered \u2018profitable\u2019 to be the wrong attitude for writing. Writers write. It\u2019s what we do. Yes we want to make money, but profit is a business term. And yes, being an author these days is a business, but it\u2019s also not. Authors get paid royalties. Publishers make profits. Now a lot of authors these days consider themselves publishers, and they use ad systems to spend a great deal of money to make a modest (in comparison) profit every month. That is a business. But authors in general write a book, get it out there, and go on with the next one. They do a bit of dabbling in promos and ads, but it\u2019s about increasing their royalties, not about making a profit. They don\u2019t care about return on investment, just meeting the self imposed deadline for the next book. There is profit to be made on Kindle. No doubt about it. But you asked an author, who isn\u2019t running a business from it, and that\u2019s my view on it. Profit is the wrong attitude for a writer. But if you\u2019re a business person, and can market your book(s) effectively, go for it, there\u2019s still plenty of scope for making that profit. But the thing is, it all changes every 6 months of so, and you have to change with it to keep it flowing. Those who don\u2019t keep up, suddenly find it no longer works. ",

I do get a lot of supplemental freelance work, and international publishing is also starting to be a great form of extra income for myself personally but this has been years of hard work. My ebooks per se don\u2019t pay the bills but it has opened lots of doors and opportunities. One-hit wonders that make it big right off the bat, are about as frequent as winning the lottery. Honestly, if you write well, have a great marketing plan and a touch of luck that the right person finds your work and loves it you might make enough to be on the path to making this a full-time gig.
