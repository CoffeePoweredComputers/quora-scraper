            "answer_text": "Kids that age have not perfected the fine motor control needed for good cursive writing - the ones that look like calligraphy. I had \u201ccursive writing\u201d when I was in grade 2 and 3 in Singapore. I absolutely HATED it. my hand would cramp up trying to etch out those beautiful curves, although in my case, no doctor\u2019s written prescription could have been worse. Even today, i can\u2019t read my handwriting, and my cursive is just plain ugly. It\u2019s like forcing a kid to write chinese characters over and over and over - because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s taught. You just end up hating the subject and topic. ",
