            "answer_text": "You can write a 5000 words essay in just one day. I have done so a few times in the past. However, 5000 words is not a breeze to compose on the fly, so the topic you are writing will make all the difference. The easiest way to pull off a 5000-word essay would be to write from existing notes, or from an outline you\u2019ve already made. At the very least, you\u2019ll want to have your source materials already read and mentally digested, highlighted and bookmarked as necessary. If you\u2019ve yet to do the readings for your essay, well, add another 4\u20136 hours, at a minimum, to the work you are looking at. Of course, if your essay is on a personal topic (that is, requires no reading in advance), then 5000 words in a single day would be easier to pull off. Regardless of topic, the best way to write an essay (or any kind of assignment, really) on the fly is the following: Decide on your thesis. Boil it down to a single sentence if at all possible. For example: \u201cSocial Learning Theory proposes that people learn not only through classical and operant conditioning but also through observing and imitating others in their immediate environment.\u201d Estimate how much space you will need to properly explain your thesis-and in doing so, write your entire intro to the essay. Typically, for a 5000-word paper (15\u201320 pages), you\u2019re looking at 1\u20132 pages for a sufficiently detailed introduction.Figure out what your supporting points will be, and how much space each will require to explain, support with quotations and thoughts of the prominent figures in your field, and so on. For me, the easiest way to do this is in point form: it helps me to quickly assemble my ideas, and figure out what I want to be sure to include.Assuming you\u2019ve done your readings, and made notes, beforehand, decide how you want to incorporate these into your paper. Do you want to have a separate section reviewing the literature on your topic? Or do you want to include it in the points you are making to support your thesis? Either way, in point form, jot down who had what ideas, and the page numbers/etc of quotes you plan on either including outright, or paraphrasing.To bring your paper to a close, formulate a final section on where the most-recent research on your topic is headed/what other topics it logically links up to/in general, why the topic continues to be important to your field of study. This is a smooth way to lead into your conclusion, and can also be tailored for length as needed later on.Draft your concluding paragraph(s), and your reference list.Take a break, you\u2019ve earned it! Now go back and \u201cfill in\u201d each section, one by one.For an essay of this length written in one day, you are most likely going to want to go back and revise significantly. It\u2019s normal for the first draft of this length to be pretty rough in terms of correct citation format, word choice, and overall readability. So make sure to spend a solid 90\u2013120 minutes going over it before you submit.If you want more information on these topics and want some examples essay of 5000 words. See it here ",

            "answer_text": "I figure a first draft one page essay takes about two hours, provided you largely know what you are writing about and just need some fine tuning on facts or quotes. The second and subsequent pages take about an hour each to organize and write to a first draft state. A 5000 word essay is more like a short term paper. So the research is more time consuming and so a 20 page essay which is what a double spaced properly formatted essay is takes about 20 plus hours plus it needs at least two revisions. One to clean up the messy thinking and obvious grammar and spelling errors and then a second more refined approach to clean up your thinking and make the points more powerful and concise. If it is formatted to a 1.5 space it pares the pages down to about 15 pages but it doesn\u2019t change the time. I am fairly average in my ability to write an A essay so it takes some time. My wife just wrote a 1500 word essay and she was well versed in the subject and and it took her over five hours to get it to a third draft and ready for submission. So a 5000 word essay would have been over 15 hours and she is a very good professional level writer. But she would have spent at least another 10 hours on research to nail down her arguments. If you can do this faster then one of two things are happening, one is you are both brilliant and well versed on the subject matter or you did a poor essay. A 5000 word essay, you have my sympathy.
