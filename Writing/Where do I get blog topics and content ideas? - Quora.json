It\u2019s hard to come up with a unique content creation idea when you feel like you\u2019ve completely exhausted all possible options. That\u2019s where the wonderful world of content creation tools comes in hand. Personally, as a blogger, I absolutely HATE coming up with a title for my blog posts. Despise it, really. They never have seen snappy enough to grab any reader\u2019s attention. So I turned to my trusty friend HubSpot for a bit of assistance. HubSpot\u2019s Blog Topic Generator AMAZING to help with content ideas AND can double as a tool to help you title your blog post. The best part about this particular tool is how easy it is to use. Seriously, you type in three nouns, and HubSpot will generate five blog post ideas. I entered the following three nouns: \u201cSEO\u201d, \u201cBlogging\u201d, and \u201cMarketing\u201d. From these three nouns, I was given the following topics for consideration: The Worst Advice We\u2019ve Ever Heard About SEO10 Quick Tips About MarketingThink You\u2019re Cut Out for Doing Blogging? Take This QuizThe Ultimate Cheat Sheet on SEOWhat Will Marketing Be Like in 100 Years?There really isn\u2019t an easier tool that provides such amazing results! There\u2019s also a handy \u201ctry again\u201d button at the end of the page that will allow you to start your search all over. UberSuggest\u2019s Tool is just as simple as HubSpot but provides you results in a method that looks similar to Google Keyword Planner, but a bit more condensed. UberSuggest will also generate hundreds of results based on your search phrase, so don\u2019t use this if you are easily distracted and want something to provide a narrow scope of results. This tool is NOT for you! For example, when I entered \u201cSEO Marketing\u201d into UberSuggest, I was provided 247 different phrases that could be used as content marketing ideas. The plus to UberSuggest is that you can choose a topic that it generates and ask it to expand on that particular search result. From this action, you are given additional topics that pertain to the initial suggestion. BuzzSumo The same lines as HubSpot, but with more features.

            "answer_text": "Fish is thirsty in the pond. You are in middle of many topics and ideas, still not able to figure it out. Quora is goldmine for finding awesome content ideas. Just you should know how to find it. There are tons of question published everyday, your job is to find the most popular questions. There is where your content idea is hidden. How to find them? Choose any question on Quora from the feed. This is how it looks like:  We just came over a minimal design with some text spread all over the screen. That\u2019s it. This is how a Normal Person see this question:  It\u2019s just a normal webpage for an average read with a question and an answer. This is how a Smart Blogger see this question:  Confused? This is what a smart blogger see in this page. His/her mission is to find the best content idea from every question he see. Here is what to deduct from each of the element on this page: Question stats:Here you need to see the % of people following the question as compare to the people who are viewing it For example: Question every 10 readers out of 1000 views follow XYZ question whereas 20 people out of 1000 views follow PQR question. XYZ have 1% conversion whereas PQR have 2% conversion. Now it doesn\u2019t need Einstein mind to deduct that question PQR is in high demand because more people want to read the perfect answer for this question. Last asked time:This shows the freshness of the question. Some question may have high conversion rate of following but it may possible that people were crazy for that question 1 year ago and now the trend changed, people are seeking for answers on fresh trendy questions. However, some question never lose their trend like: How to start blogging?How to start investing?How to *any verb*?People like to read \u201chow to do niche things\u201d and it will never trend. Answers and follower:How much answers the question already got and how much people are still following the question. It also plays a great role. People will unfollow the question if they get the best answer for the question and if not, they will still keep following it for more best answers. And if still people are following it then chances are, people are still looking for an awesome content for the question. Grab the opportunity. Question Topic.This is for the people who are looking to answer the question. Make sure that the question topics are up to the mark and related to the question. It will be helpful to get your answer in front of eyeballs of the people who follow the topics. Related Questions.If you don\u2019t find the current question up to the mark then switch to the other question from the \u201crelated question\u201d section. This questions are the curated list of Quora for which people looks generally. In simple words, this are the demanded questions which Quora algorithm segregate on the basis of most wanted questions. Now what? Once you find the best question, convert it into the topic. This question itself is a blog topic - Where do I get blog topics and content ideas? And the answer I\u2019m writing itself is a blog-post. That\u2019s all you want to get best content idea. And this is why many people struggle to get more views and upvotes on their answers despite of awesome content. Numbers speaks everything. Learn to read and understand numbers. Same applies with Investing. ",
