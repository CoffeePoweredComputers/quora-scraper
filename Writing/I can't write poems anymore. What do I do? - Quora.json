            "answer_text": "I guess there is always a time when we feel no more excited about the work which we love. I find it normal as I also go through it. Still, there are a lot of ways to feel inspired to come back to your pen and paper. There are the following ways to do for example- Read books.Watch movies.Listen to songs that soothe your soul. I would suggest you listen to Roo Panes, however, you know better.Discuss the topics like the origin of life, science, literature, and arts with someone.Stuck on the words like \u201cinfinite\u201d, \u201cnothingness\u201d. I think some words are so powerful that they leave so much impact on us and leave us in deep thoughts.Read the quotes.Read about the artists, writers, sculptors, etc. I am sure they will inspire you in their ways and would bring you back on the page with a huge number of ideas and you will be busy in bringing coherence.Write about the internal conflict you are going through. Write about any small experience of your life which touched your heart. Write about society or what changes you want to see in society. These things help me to write. Once I was listening to Royals- Song by Lorde. I feel a sudden desire to write and the interesting part was that my mind was empty, I did not have any thoughts in mind. I was just writing with the help of a song. I can\u2019t describe everything as it has happened a long time ago. I wrote this poem. There is no connection between song and poem. The song inspired me to write and words were drawn by something I don\u2019t know maybe intuition. You can read about \u2018Art and Intuition\u2019 on the internet. Poor poetry decorated with diamonds Mud on the flesh is invisible Sing a song on its worth Standing still Wearing a crown of fantasy Jump in the words to dream... (c) Amisha I hope it helps you. Have a great day! ",
