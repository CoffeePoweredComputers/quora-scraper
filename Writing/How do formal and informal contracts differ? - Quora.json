            "answer_text": "Informal contract is basically an understanding between two parties to the contract may be verbal or written but in which the essential requirements of seal of the parties which ever it may be and signatures of witnesses are not appended. The said sort of contracts will not stand enforceable by a court unless there is very strong evidence that the contract had been agreed to with mutual consent. Formal contracts are legally worded contracts in which all the terms and conditions of the contract are laid down and the same bears the signatures of atleast two witnesses who can stand in evidence to prove the contents of the contract. Such contracts are well entertained in the court of law and are enforceable with assistance of the court.
