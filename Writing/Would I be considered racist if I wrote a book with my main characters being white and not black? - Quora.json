            "answer_text": "You shouldn't be considered racist. However, there are always people out there who will jump at any chance to accuse people of being racist, sexist, homophobic or anything else. I suppose you could only be considered racist if you're deciding to utilise white characters as opposed to blacks if you're prejudice against them. If not, then it shouldn't be a problem. I am working on my own novel at the moment with all of my characters being white. It has nothing to do with me being racist (which I'm not), it's just that I couldn't picture my characters being black nor would it be historically accurate for the time period it's set in. There's nothing wrong with having main characters being white. If people are going to get upset over it and accuse you of being a racist, that's their problem. A book is a book. As a matter of fact, I'm sure most people wouldn't take much notice of the characters colours while reading it. The main goal of an author is to entertain people. The only time people are going to start thinking about the colour (or absence of colour) is when it is pointed out. ",

If you write a book\u2026..I don\u2019t care if your characters are black, white, blue, or green! Just ENTERTAIN ME! I realize it\u2019s a novel approach but that\u2019s my advice. Anyone who worries about stupid shit such as the color of a person in a FICTIONAL book needs serious help or things to fill the apparent void in their life!!! ",
