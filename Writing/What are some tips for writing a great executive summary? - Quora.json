Some are for a business plan that goes to an investor. Some go to an executive within your own organization. The above link is mostly about the first kind. The second kind, which isn\u2019t well addressed there, is a little different. Imagine you are an executive and fifteen proposals for important projects are in your inbox. You open one and it has a page or two of \u2018executive summary\u2019. You put it in a pile you will get to later. A second one has an executive summary that consists of a single sentence. You glance at it. Not enough info. You sigh. You\u2019ll have to read the damn thing. Then you get one that has a large paragraph. It encompasses the problem and gives a rough description of the solution. This person has chosen to note waste your time. You, being an executive, have learned to skim these. You read the executive summary. You glance at the sections. You read the last section. You look for the financial and personnel numbers. You look for the word \u201crisk\u201d addressed anywhere in the document. You write one phrase on it: Arrange a meeting to discuss. The other two sit there in the \u2018will get to it later\u2019 pile for a few days and eventually you write on them, \u2018rejected\u2019 without bothering to read them. Do not waste my time, you think to those people. You know that if you had a meeting with them it would probably be badly organized and overloaded with unnecessary items. They pretty much proved they cannot get you the information you needed quickly. As far as you can see, they probably can\u2019t be trusted with the resources they asked for to get their project completed. ",

            "answer_text": "Your executive summary is essentially the cover letter to your business plan: its goal is to get the reader to check out your business plan and, hopefully, to set up a meeting. Think of your executive summary as the halfway point between your elevator pitch and your business plan\u2014you have about 2 pages (give or take) to communicate your value proposition and get you to the next stop on your startup journey.

Do it yourself. Sure you can get help, but the exercise of creating your executive summary is an important one. The act of distilling your business down to its core will not only result in a compelling story, but it will help you to identify your greatest strengths and focus your company. Just as I don\u2019t recommend you outsourcing the writing of your business plan (see my previous article on this topic: Should You Outsource Your Startup Business Plan?), I wouldn\u2019t pass on this task. 2. Keep it short and simple. The executive summary isn\u2019t called a \u201csummary\u201d for nothing! If you can\u2019t summarize what your company does in just a few pages, there\u2019s a problem. Don\u2019t worry about fitting it into a specific format (e.g., it doesn\u2019t have to be exactly 2 pages), but do think about how you can strip away extraneous content to focus on the core message. Any layperson who reads your executive summary should clearly understand what your company does. A good check is to have someone from outside your circle read your draft and reflect back to you what they got out of it. If they can\u2019t, take a step back and try again. And remember, bulleted lists are your friend! 3. Start with a bang. What\u2019s going to grab a potential investor and inspire them to read on? What\u2019s the most compelling thing about your company? What are you doing that nobody else is? You want to pull in your reader from the very beginning. 4. Problem\u2014Solution\u2014Opportunity. These three things are essential. This is the meat of your executive summary: what problem does your company solve, how does it solve it, and what\u2019s the real market for your solution (not a trumped up top-down projection). 5. Focus on what makes you stand out. If your startup is introducing some sort of new technology, focus on this. If your company has already shown real traction, you\u2019re acquiring a significant customer base, or you\u2019re earning substantial revenue, make this the focus of your executive summary. Stellar management team \u2013 push it hard. Whatever it is that makes your company unique should be at the heart of your executive summary. This is what matters. 6. Sell don\u2019t tell. Your executive summary doesn\u2019t have to outline everything that\u2019s contained in your business plan. It needs to compel the reader to check out your business plan. This isn\u2019t a book report; it\u2019s more of a promotional brochure. 7. Include a financial summary. Again, keep it brief, but your executive summary should include some financials, in particular your valuation, history of revenue, cash, expenses (including headcount), losses/profits, and some key drivers,. At this point, potential investors just wants to get an idea of what returns they can expect. It\u2019s your job to show that your investor will win on this investment. Need help with your valuation? Contact Early Growth Financial Services. 8. Speak in your own voice. There\u2019s no one right style or tone for an executive summary. Just try to make your executive summary be a true reflection of you and your company. Speak in the first person or first-person plural (\u201cI\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d) and let your personality come through. Authenticity is compelling. 9. Ask for what you need. You are asking for money, so be upfront about how much funding you are seeking. What amount will help you to get to your next milestone, and what is that milestone? Also, if you foresee future rounds, project out to how much you expect you will be looking for in the future. Always tie these rounds to your milestones. 10. Keep your end-goal in mind. No startup has ever received a check as a result of a fantastic executive summary. It\u2019s not going to happen. The executive summary is just a tool. Remember that its goal is just to get potential investors to want to know more. This is a great guiding principle. With every sentence that you write, give it the test: Will this make a VC want to know more? If not, delete and try again. Do you think you have an effective executive summary? What makes it so?
