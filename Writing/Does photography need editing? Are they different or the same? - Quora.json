            "answer_text": "Photography like any other form of art like writing or filmmaking definitely requires editing. How much of it is done depends on whether it is for news for commerce! In the old film days photographers edited their photos in various ways during the photo printing process; namely by Cropping, Dodging and Burning during printing. They even did manual retouch with brushes to either the negative or the print to edit or correct details Today in the Digital age Photo editing is as much of an art form as taking the picture. In fact we no longer know what is the truth of photography as so much can be digitally manipulated or \u2018Photoshopped\u2019 as it is known in the industry That being said today almost all photographers use tools such as Adobe Lightroom & Photoshop or Capture one to edit their photos. Without digital tools to edit photos most picture would look \u201cNormal\u201d which is why apps like Instagram on Phones is so popular as it can make most mundane images look spectacular with a bunch of filters!

            "answer_text": "Editing is a product of the digital age. There was retouching in the film days but it was expensive so most photographs were as is. Knowing this, you could see who was talented and did not rely on post production (not that there is anything wrong with that) Clarify that EDITING is color and density correction, straightening and the use of presets or filters as a basic definition. EVERYTHING else is RETOUCHING! So many people misuse these terms on an everyday basis. Think of how you communicate with your client and they want retouching but you give them editing, you suck because YOU did not know the correct definition. YOU will not be successful if you cannot COMMUNICATE with your clients! So you see on Instagram, almost all the images have some type of filter but then you notice the hashtag #nofilter. Is is supposed to be as it was shot, nothing added, so these are the images that are not edited. Good Luck! ",

Analog & digital editing are different\u2026but concept remains same. Most of the digital tools like filters etc are inspired / derived from analog processing. Good luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "Editing is an integral part of photography. Photography is empty without editing. You alway do not get the desired shot when you are out on a shoot. Sometimes the sun is too bright or if you are shooting in night there may be lack of light, of course you can bump up/decrease the ISO and can increase/decrease the shutter speed to get a brighter shot or a dim shot! But sometime it doesn't work out, because increasing the ISO increase the noise in the picture so with the help of editing you get your desired shots. You can fully transform your image with editing. If you look at the RAW photos of a photographer it would dark, having a gray shade\u2026. But this only helps them to transform their image into a master pieces with the help of editing. Have a look at the Befor and after editing of pictures by the famous photographer Brandon Woelfel!     Thank you! Upvote if liked! \u2764\ufe0f ",
