            "answer_text": "Best \"pickup line\" I've used was super easy, just walk up to her and extend your hand and say \"Hi, my name is Wes. I saw you over here and really wanted to meet you.\" Often you don't even need the second sentence. What I think is so great about this approach is that A) it's authentic B) oozes confidence C) usually makes the intentions very clear without looking desperate. Which one of those three are a turnoff? None. Lines usually scream insecurity and produce an \"ick\" factor. Not always, as with most things there's variables like the personalities involved, setting, alcohol, maturity, etc. But as a rule of thumb, confidence trumps all. Will it work on a 19 year old? Depends on the variables, but whatever you go with just be confident. I just don't think I want the kind of girl who can be easily picked up with a Barney Stinson play, and the kind of girls I want wouldn't give me the time of day if I tried it. ",

            "answer_text": "When in a group environment with friends[smile] \"Hi did you just get here\" - This can tell you right away if she has a boyfriend, what her intent is, who she knows (which you can leverage for rapport building), what her attitude is like, etc.  When in a public place while stagnant (in line at coffee shop, etc) \"So are you from around the area?\" - This is casual enough where you can gauge her interest. It open up multiple avenues of conversation.  When in a public place while dynamic (at a bar walking by)[subtle smile] \"Hi\" - Her response to this immediately gauges what she thinks about you. She already knows if she is physically attracted to you before you even open your mouth. ",
