Only then does it carry the meaning of \u201cdear\u201d). Also \u547d\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b (inochi wo kakeru) means \u201cto risk one's life\u201d. The \u201cfight\u201d in your sentence obviously signifies that there's risk involved, even if the speaker's life isn't necessarily in danger. It's a pretty direct phrase, so I wouldn't go about using it unless you're running an inner monologue or talking to someone dear. ",
