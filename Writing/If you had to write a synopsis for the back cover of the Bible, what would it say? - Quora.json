            "answer_text": "The whole Bible addresses two vital questions that Satan the Devil posed to Almighty God Jehovah. 1. The exclusive right that Jehovah God has sovereignty over the entire universe, (to be ruler overall and have ever living being, to be in subjection to his authority). 2. Satan the Devil has accused mankind to be so selfish, he only worships Jehovah God to preserve their lives and is better off being self-governed. (all mankind would turn away from Jehovah God if it meant their life). The Bible invites all to find out what the answers are, you may be surprised what the Bible contains. ",
