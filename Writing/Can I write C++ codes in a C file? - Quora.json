            "answer_text": "Of course you can (though it's rarely a good idea, at least in my opinion). If you use syntax that's specific to C++ in a file with a \".c\" extension, you'll usually have to include some special flag to force the compiler to treat that file as C++ instead of C. With VC++ that would be \"/Tp\" to force a single file to be compiled as C++, or \"/TP\" to force all the files given in a call to the compiler to be treated as C++. With gcc, you'd use \"-x c++\" to specify that the following files should be compiled as C++, regardless of extension. You can revert that to the default of guessing based on the extension with \"-x none\". ",
