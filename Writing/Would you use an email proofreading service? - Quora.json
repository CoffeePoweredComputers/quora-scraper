            "answer_text": "Confidentiality is definitely an  issue here (simply hiding names or email addresses isn't enough) but I'd  like to unpack a point that William Pietri makes: \"Proofreading  isn't a feature; it's a relationship. A good proofreader know who I am,  where I'm coming from, and who the audience is. I can't develop a  relationship with a button.\" Your service assumes that there is a standard way to correct errors. If you're talking about basic grammatical structure, that might be true. Maybe. But lots of \"errors\" in language have nothing to do with grammar.  Idioms can be problematic. I remember being shocked when, ten years ago, someone said to me, \"I don't care.\" He meant that he had no preference between the two alternatives I'd presented to him, but I wasn't familiar with that idiomatic use of \"I don't care,\" and I thought he was being inexplicably hostile. I'm careful about what idioms I use when I write, depending on who my audience is and what the context of the email is. The service you describe can't help with this. Tone can be problematic. Writing is difficult. It's very difficult to master tone in writing. It's even more difficult when we're writing short things like emails. With longer pieces--like a novel, or a short article--the reader has time to learn to hear the writer's tone. In emails, often not, unless there are lots of emails exchanged between people. So in that case, how well would a third-party be able to gauge the appropriateness of the tone of a single email? Cultural references can be problematic. Regional differences are almost too clich\u00e9 for me to mention, right? Most Americans wouldn't understand if I said, \"Wow, we really hit a sixer with that product launch!\" but it's clear to anyone who plays cricket. But it's not just regional; sometimes it's totally individual. For instance, people often refer to TV shows or movies, and they are all lost on me. (What is a McGuffin? Why is someone telling me to \"lead on\" and calling me \"McDuff?) As with idioms, references must be picked prudently. And finally, let's talk a bit about the Dunning-Kruger effect. I wonder to what extent the people who most appreciate this service will turn out the be the ones who don't need it? I mean, I would love it if more people wrote with fewer errors in whatever language they were using, and in that sense I can get behind your service. But I would never pay for or use your service because... well, I don't make very many mistakes that a proofreader could correct. :-/ And if you've ever tried to correct habitual grammar offenders, you'll find that a disheartening number of them respond with, who cares stop h8in u get wt i mean ryte* and you will weep solitary tears into your pillow at night. Or maybe that's just me... So what, you might ask. True, you're just trying to fix grammatical errors. But grammar isn't as fixed as you might think. (Nor is it quite as fluid as some others might think.) A service like the one you describe, being outside the \"relationship\" that William Pietri mentions, works by using a \"standard\" grammar. Correcting everything to  that standard might actually impede meaning, particularly when it comes  to jargon. And it could erode tone--by airbrushing casual,  largely-accepted \"errors,\" you can make a piece of text sound like the  visual equivalent of the voice that guides you through an automated  phone system. (And how could such a service fix the inherent awkwardness  of that simile?) But, despite all these things, I say... ...the only way to really know is to do what you're doing: test it. See if anyone actually pays you for it. If you have even one customer, you have a customer! From there you can see whether you can scale up or whether your market is too small. Simply asking people what they think won't tell you the truth; trying to get them to buy/use your product will. So: good luck to you! May you learn many things. * Do you even know how long it took me to (mis)craft that? :) ",

            "answer_text": "Seeing as I have just identified over ten mistakes in your question details, I wouldn't use the service, but I would (in theory anyway) apply for a job there.  (I know that the person who wrote the question is probably not the same one who will be doing the proofreading, but seeing writing mistakes made by someone who just built a service that corrects writing mistakes is not the best promo for the service).  On a more serious note, I personally wouldn't be using such a service, simply because I consider my grammar, punctuation, and general phrasing to be accurate enough not to require corrections, and I always proofread what I write, even if I send unimportant text messages while tipsy. Some mistakes do slip every now and then (I'm sure that Murphy's laws will have me make one in this answer, just to mess with me), but they are rare enough to be ignored. (However, I might be a little \"grammar nazi\" exception. I am sure this  service would be of great use to many people. In fact I should start  suggesting it to many of my co-workers. Ahem.) I should also point out that confidentiality doesn't necessarily mean just who sends it and who receives it. The e-mail itself could contain extremely sensitive and confidential data that is revealing in and of itself, without even knowing who sent it. Not to mention that e-mails are usually signed in full name, as part of the text, so that info is visible. ",
