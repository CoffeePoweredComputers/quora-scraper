            "answer_text": "Give them pains and gains of being who they are. My two protagonists are both quite arrogant and self-assured. That benefits them in some ways but wounds them in others.

            "answer_text": "My advice would be to read classical novels that have these characters. Brothers Karamazov abounds with these- Dostoevsky \u2018wrote the book\u2019 on Narcissism which is an issue for almost every major and minor character. Oscar Wilde also created some great Narcissistic characters- The Picture of Dorian Grey is often cited. Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights Henry Higgins My Fair Lady One writer says Fred Flintstone. ",
