            "answer_text": "Now apparently, as we all know that both of the rambo parts that's ofcourse the first blood part 1 as well as the first blood part 2 were a \u2018Massive hit' at the box office worldwide in their golden years of 1982 for part 1 & then the year of 1985 for part 2. But apart from all that stuffs, still there are quite a few things in common that makes first blood part 2 extensively more big & popular than first blood\u2026 The first blood might contain all the essential factors or credentials or entities like storyline, action, adventure & so much more, but have seen no suspensive or technical factors as the first blood part 2 that makes part 1 a way more different than part 2 regarding all the storyline & movie segments\u2026.  And as mentioned earlier, regarding all the storyline of this two huge movies, the first blood ( part 1 ) seemed like a big drag down of the story straight up from the initial scene till the final scene of the movie, where a US military soldier ( john rambo) gets his life threatened by a sheriff from a small town who tries to get a big revenge on rambo for his friend\u2019s death that ultimately raises up the darker side in rambo with a lot of anger, rage & fury that turns out to be deeply personal b/w those two\u2026And ends up fighting for his life throughout the entire movie that's makes the first blood a bit more storylined than part 2 but having not enough action or adventure than part 2, just raw suspense & show down b/w two guy & that's the first thing\u2026..  But the first blood part 2 gets more fine marks than part 1, since the entire story is revolved around a US soldier \u2018rambo' saving the lives of all the innocent American POW's who will be imprisoned over there in the deep dank forests of vietnam by a few Russian mercinaries at their headquarters over there & ultimately rambo bringing them back home safely where they belong, that's got a lot of action, thrill & also some adventure on his return back home after a successful victory over the russian's that ended up to be an ultimate action cum adventural movie of the 1980\u2019s\u2026 But actually the mission was to set rambo to fail by his own country men's betrayal towards him & his mission, but later figures out what rambo is made of. And that's takes the entire complexion of this movie ( part 2 ) to a great heights in the worldwide box office at 1980\u2019s bigger than it's competitive first blood movie that came out in 1982 or any other movie else of rambo series in that age of that time & stands up to be one of the most greatest & most iconic movie ever to be a part of the rambo series & bangs it up also in the Hollywood history\u2026..

            "answer_text": "First Blood was an awkward film about a war vet being misunderstood by backwater local police with a situation getting out of hand. It was designed to make America look at how it was treating ptsd war vets and you Americans don't like to be told you are doing something wrong. It was also scary in how it still stands up today as a film about how easy it is to get powerful weapons and go on a rampage in America. Rambo put a killing machine back where he could do what he was trained to do. There were a lot of these types of films around at the time and it went from being self reflective to all action, big explosions, kick the commies patriotism. American men and boys could polish their hand guns and pretend they were cool enough to go kick commie butt if they ever got the call up. ",
