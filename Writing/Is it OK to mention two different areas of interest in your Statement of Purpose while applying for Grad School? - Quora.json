            "answer_text": "Yup, I agree with the rest of the answers. I have seen SOPs where the student has talked about having two areas of interest but he has made his case by strongly relating the interest in the two fields and showing a clear vision about how he plans to use the knowledge of the two fields (his goal of graduate studies).  One example would be artificial intelligence and computer graphics (if you are talking about CS). You can say that you want to be able to develop intelligent software with a 3d avatar with body and facial expressions to create to create more engaging conversations between the user and the machine. Another, example could be machine learning and systems (although this is related more naturally). I could give examples here but I intend to use those in my SOP so I will refrain. ",

But, in general, if you are mentioning two areas, make sure they are not drastically different. In that case, it might just look like you are not focused enough. ",
