            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t say that you need to practice writing everyday to pull this off. I practice writing maybe once a month or once a year, depending how much time I have. I can usually write around 2000 words in one day so 3000 in 2 days is a completely average amount. Especially when you consider that English has more words than my native language (Polish) - there are modal verbs and \u201ca/an\u201d etc. so it\u2019s easier to write more words. ",
