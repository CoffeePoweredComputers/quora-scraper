            "answer_text": "I'll cover only those things that are in your control and more or less common to all wrimos around the world.  What to expect Please note: some of these are mutually exclusive, but many can happen at the same time. Regarding your writing: Your great idea for a 50,000 word novel will most likely run out of fuel before you get to 10k. Your main character (MC) will turn out to be bland and boring. One of his/her sidekicks might end up being more interesting. Your story will likely feel dull, awful, unreadable and/or a copy of something else. You'll restort to what you think are cheap tricks to keep those numbers up. You'll hate yourself for using those tricks or for not using them. You'll write awfully long sentences, long speeches and internal monologues to reach your daily 1,667 words. And some days it might not be enough. Regarding people (family and friends): Most people will either see you as someone crazy or will not be able to understand the monumental challenge you're imposing on yourself. If you're really serious about NaNo, your friends will actually wonder what's happening to you, because you're either turning down nights out or you go out for a few drinks and do nothing but talking about your novel.  Regarding yourself: You'll most likely think that you can't do it, that you have no ability to write decently at all, that you're faking and you're just making this to brag about. You'll obsess over your word count and worry that you might not make it after all. You'll want to kick it and never write again. You'll fall in love with yourself some days, to the point of developing minor symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. You'll  When NaNo is over, you might also get some (reverse) cultural shock. You'll expect people and the world to change as you've changed over the last 30 days, but most everything will be the same. You might wonder how is it remotely possible for the world to stay the same after your herculean task is over, but it will. It can lead to sadness, to rage, to fury, to crying. But the one thing you aren't expecting (because, frankly, no one does) is to actually sit down near the end of November, when the word count is only a few numbers above 50k, marveling at how (despite all of the above) you just wrote a book.  Preparing for NaNo  Sign up. Wander around the forums.Sign up at your regional forum. If possible (and if you want to) get to know some of your fellow writers and your Municipal Liaison (ML). Ask him or her if there are any pre-NaNo events and try to attend one. Listen for ideas on execution, traditions and such. This should be your home, these people will (or should) be a major source of support during NaNo. Learn from them.Schedule as much as possible for November. Seriously. Plan ahead for any exams, homework, travel, games or whatever obligations that you must do. This is mostly to make an early assessment of whether you can or can't do it (and I've met lots of wrimos who burn out because they try to juggle too many obligations with a difficult challenge like NaNo)Tell your family and friends about it. Some people (like myself) do this as an additional source of motivation, to not fail after you've told everyone what you're doing. Let them know you will be extremely busy during November, but only during November.Stock up on candies and/or caffeine. Many places will have candy sales right after Halloween, so you might want to wait until Nov 1Observe your writing patterns and your daily activities. If you're writing for NaNo, you might want to use every waking moment to write, so make a quick plan of how you're going to actually write? Do you have a computer near you at all times? A notebook? Do you have lots of dead time between activities? Can you write on the very early morning or very late nights?Equip yourself based more or less on the above. Get whatever software and hardware you might need. Almost every writer has its own preference of writing software, music or background noise, notebook, pen and even pencil sharpener, so use what works for you. A good tip is to always carry at least some paper and pen to jot down ideas.Visualize yourself as a writer. NaNo, for the vast majority of us, is a hard challenge. Forget about that 10-page essay you wrote easily because you were \"in the zone\". NaNo will likely demand that you write in the real world, under suboptimal conditions, at bizarre times, when your mind and your body aren't just in it. Inspiration alone won't cut it. This is a lot of hard work, but the benefits, to me, far outweigh the complications.Relax and rest as much as possible",
