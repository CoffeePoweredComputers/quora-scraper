Here\u2019s what I do: If it\u2019s a \u2018formal\u2019 mail (as you might have done in a letter in the past) I use yours sincerely of yours faithfully, using usual letter \u2018rules\u2019If it\u2019s less formal, I use Regards or Kind RegardsIf it\u2019s to someone who knows me personally I use Cheers or just ChrisOf your two, I prefer Best Regards, but I pretty well always say thanks in the closing text. Thanks: in anticipation of your assistancefor your attention to this matterI have seen \u2018warmest\u2019 or \u2018kindest\u2019 regards used and I\u2019m ok with both of these although I don\u2019t use them myself. Slightly off topic, but if an email to me says \u201cDear\u201d Chris, Mr/Dr Atkins (whatever), I always reply in the same way. ",

            "answer_text": "If I\u2019m asking someone to do something for me, I will just type \u2018thanks\u2019. In fact, I often use that sign-off, kind of as a subtext of \u2018thanks for taking the time to read my email\u2019. It\u2019s personalised based on the message - it needs to fit what you want/need to convey in every single case. For example, I\u2019ll sometimes make it \u2018many thanks\u2019 if what they\u2019re going to do for me is particularly helpful/important. So, adopting a standard is inadvisable. I say this specifically for email, which is generally less formal than other written communication. A standard sign-off can begin to seem insincere, especially if people realise that you\u2019ve made it part of your auto-signature. I\u2019ve worked with people who do that, and I\u2019m not impressed. ",
