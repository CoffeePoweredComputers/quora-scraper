            "answer_text": "That he should cut taxes as much as possible, rationalize the budget by eliminating dual/redundant programs and bringing the welfare system in check, and start prepping the US to get back on the gold standard. There are two reasons for that. The first is that America has in the past been a debt averse nation. When Jefferson took over, he cut as many programs and taxes as possible to pay the debt down faster. Guess what happened? The economy boomed and his government was able to pay debt down faster while still keeping taxes low. And use the surplus as a down-payment on the Louisiana purchase. Low taxes and low debt lead to success for America. High taxes and high debt, like during Eisenhower\u2019s reign, led to multiple crashes in a short span. The correct decision is clear- cut down taxes and programs to pay down the debt and let the economy boom. Use the surplus for truly important programs like schools and national security programs. Now I have to defend supporting the gold standard. I recognize its not perfect. No system is. But it means there\u2019s a limit on both how much money can be printed and how quickly. That means modern ridiculous ideas like MMT would be shown to be craziness that would lead only to inflation and low growth. The Breton Woods system was successful at making America hugely important in the financial system, and preventing inflation. The gold standard is a good solution to a messy problem. Paying down the national debt, cutting taxes, cutting unnecessary taxes, and a return to the gold standard should be presidential priorities because they will lead to great economic growth. If you are still interested in reading about historical American economic growth and how those lessons can be applied today, read these three articles from my personal website: The Magic Formula of Economic Success \u00bb GenZ Conservative , \"History of the United States of America during the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson\" by Henry Adams \u00bb Book Reviews \u00bb GenZ Conservative , and The Affluent Society\u00bb Book Reviews \u00bb GenZ Conservative Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "Mister Trump, you are completely incompetent. People in your circle have gone to prison or have destroyed their integrity, and lately many have died just from being near you. You have escaped impeachment during the first term only because Republicans held the majority. You managed to inherit an upswing with the economy when first entering office and if you stay you will be in charge during an economic collapse that will lie squarely on your shoulders and can't be blamed on anyone but you. Leaving before this huge collapse will allow you to lie about your accomplishments in office, but staying will reveal how poorly you ran the presidency and this country. It would be a poor decision to seek a second term when Congress and the Senate will be switching to the opposing party. You should get out while the getting is good. If you really want to exit on a high note, there is one thing you could do to get universal support. Eliminate Daylight Savings Time!!! Do that and people will sing your praises and dance in the street. ",
