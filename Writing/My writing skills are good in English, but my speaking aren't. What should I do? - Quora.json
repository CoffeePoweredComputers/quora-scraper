It is\u2019nt that i could\u2019nt speak English but it\u2019s the fear that \u201cwhat if i just something that is ungrammatical\u201d or \u201cwhat if i pronounce something wrong\u201d and many more what ifs used restrict me and used to dwell in my mind. But getting into college i realised its just not the problem i face, its the problem of many. Soon i had to go for internship in many of the reputed school as an English teacher. I tried to look confident but still had fear. But being afraid can not be ans to any of the problems, so i started some of the \u201cweird\u201d practices. 1.I started to read my books loudly and tried to pronounce every word very clearly and correctly. 2. I used to stand infront of a mirror and used to conversate in English just to see how i actually look and wheather my posture is correct or not. 3. just follow some of the English news readers in you tube. try to avoid foreign english news channels because their accent is very much different than ours. And Indian accent has got its own clarity and beauty. 4. take help from your peer group. ask your friend to be your mentor(who is already fluent is speaking and reliable too). 5. go through some of the idioms and onw word substitutes. Using them in your sentences make ur speech more bold. 6. install apps from google play where English can be learnt easily and u will not get bored too. 7. last but not the least gain confidence and dont get panicky while speaking. because lack of confidence can make your listeners uninterested even if your sentence is correct in all way. Work hard. And all the best too..:-) Hope the above points will help.. ",

            "answer_text": "Its good to know that you\u2019re good at writing skills. First of all, please understand that like writing and speaking both involves Thinking first. You think first and then write and the same way, you think first and then speak. Writing is generally done in isolation while speaking is in front of someone and that\u2019s where something creeps in and that\u2019s usually fear of failure. While writing you have the possibility to edit and scrap and publish only when at least you fill it is alright but when it comes to speaking it\u2019s like performing in reality show. If you are still with me on this explanation, please understand that those who perform in reality show works hard on their rehearsals. The same way you just need to rehearse a lot (initially) to get it right. Work on your pronunciation, accent, and tonality. Nowadays there is a lot of help is available in the form of books, mobile apps, and online tutors. Since you are already good at writing, prepare your own simple and small speeches and practice in front of friends and family. Gain some confidence. You can also join local toast-master clubs in your city. For more tips you can check out my other answer on Quora Biman Gandhi's answer to How do I overcome fear when talking to a group of people? When I'm with friends, I will be bold enough to share thoughts. Hope this is helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "If you really think that your writing skills are quiet good, then just keep answering the questions on Quora (product), and also keep reading the answers given by others you will definitely find certain new things that you never knew exist. After that when you find sufficient of knowledge that is enough to keep you a step ahead while talking then go and try to talk between your friend circle, and specially between those who are really good at English. Its not always compulsory to start a topic always. First listen what they say and how they say. Notice their way of speaking words they use the most and also their gesture that they keep while speaking cuz definitely English is gentleman's language and thus it really matters to notice your gestures while speaking. Also try to convert every sentence that you speak in Hindi to English in your mind and then try to speak it. Think about a normal sentence like \"haan yaar aa raha hu 5 minute me\" what you will say it in English \"Yeah, i will be there in 5\". So in this way you yourself will find that its not that hard to speak English if you really want to. And one more thing that you could try is talk to yourself in front of Mirror. It will also improve your gestures as i already told you it matters in speaking English. I hope you got the point, try doing it and hope you will get the positive result. All the Best..!!! ",

I understand my chief limitation is finding someone with whom I can consistently communicate with in French. It's the same way I learned my native dialect\u2014 igbo. I was surrounded by igbo speakers. I'd speak the little I knew, stumble in my verbs, get laughed at and corrected anyway. I'd learn word pronunciation and usage and over time my speaking became better. I wish I had the same with French, but there are very very few French speakers around here. If you know any native English speakers use them to practice. Be sure to ask them to correct you when you stumble over the words. No need being shy or embarrassed. That's the best way to learn. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Use Merriam-Webster online Dictionary and Thesaurus, which has an audio providing the pronunciation also. Or any other. Word Power Made Easy by Norman Lewis can also help build your vocabulary. Listening well and reading intently are the first steps in good oral and written communication. Build your knowledge of grammar (Wren & Martin), syntax, vocabulary and so on. Before you use a particular word, for example, \u201cbeautiful\u201d, check the online thesaurus for synonyms and use the most appropriate word. Vocabulary is built brick by brick. So learning one new word leads to learning many others. Check the exact meaning of every new word from the dictionary, instead of trying to guess the meaning from its context. Read a lot of good authors. Listen to a lot of good speakers. Yet, in either case, develop your own unique style. Write short speeches, memorize them, internalise them and deliver them before the mirror or a better speaker than you. Practice makes perfect. Join a local Toastmasters Club or other public speaking club. Standing Ovation - Fifteen speeches to steer the budding orator by Sterling Publishers on Amazon will be a great help. ",

It works well because you are hearing the spoken language, you are hearing the context of the discussion, you are hearing the reply\u2019s and grammar and syntax to the discussion. Watch, speak, repeat - then next move and so one - you\u2019ll be suprised what a difference it makes as much of what you hear it repeated in real life! Also, decide on an accent, American or British as you won't want to mix the two. British movie vocabulary and word use is better than American, but less colloquial than American, meaning if your day to day interaction might be with people who learnt through American language teaching - then this may be better.
