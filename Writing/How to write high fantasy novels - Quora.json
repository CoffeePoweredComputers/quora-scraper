            "answer_text": "I'm not a writer but I've been researching this topic for a significant amount of time. Because I don't really have anything better to do with my life obviously. I'll share what I learnt. I've found that this genre has the most loyal fan-base, if done right. But doing it right is where most go wrong. The basic things to remember while writing a high fantasy novel are:  World BuildingThis is the single-most factor that can entirely make or break your book. Epic fantasy renders so much freedom to the writer that it becomes mandatory for the writer herself to set some boundaries. You should have a model of your world prepared before you introduce your characters in the world.  Your world can be anything: from a parallel representation of our own universe to a completely new universe built from scratch. This is what makes High Fantasy so damn attractive. You can actually build castles in the air.  But (pardon me for quoting this overly-quoted quote) with great power comes great responsibility. Even though you have an empty canvas to paint on, you have to remember to stay within the lines. By this I mean, you have the option of choosing the size of the canvas but not the power to change it mid-way.  Set some ground rules for how things work in your world. What is the driving force? Magic? Technology? Anything else? The most forgettable thing here is, occasionally it slips the mind of the writer that building a world doesn't mean beginning it from the start. You have to pretend that the world has existed way before it was written about by you. Which brings us to another important thing:  The History: For something to have a continuous presence over a long period of time, it's necessary for it to leave foot-prints. How did your world come into existence? You don't have to provide the reader with an elaborate truth of the dynamics of your world but you have to tell what the people living there believe. One thing that's as crucial to a person's existence as their body, is their opinion. What do different people in your world have to say about how their world was born? Like the people in our world can be divided into people who still believe in the Flat-Earth theory and the people who abhor even the idea of that belief existing in this century, your world, too, should have people with opinions about the history of their world. Conflicted opinion is even better because it leaves the reader guessing.  Some might think about introducing Religion as an elegant plot device to bring about these discussions, and it's great. But it's not important. Religion isn't a dominating factor while writing epic-fantasy. What's more important here are the two sides: the good side and the bad side. This is not just limited to the High Fantasy genre but it is greatly magnified here. The bad side is limitlessly cruel and the good side is an epitome of goodness. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule like the characters from ASoIaF.  Every epic-fantasy novel that I've read gives out tidbits about the history of their world. Take for example, The Mistborn Triology tells us about how the Lord Ruler came into power and how he's been using that power to dominate the people under his rule for centuries. This answer the question about how the world has been doing for a thousand or so years. That's enough time for people to fabricate the actual history and thus leave the reader unsure about it yet it still manages to answer most of the important questions about their history.   After you're done with the history, you might want to visually guide the reader about how the world looks. One thing I've found essential to every High Fantasy story is The Map:  I find this to be the most fun part of the entire lot. Drawing your world.   Redirect Notice   Redirect Notice   Redirect Notice   Redirect Notice   Well, this should be enough information on World Building. If you're confused whether your world is built well enough or not, ask certain questions like: If a person walks into your world, what's the first thing that he'll notice?How do the five senses respond to the air, land, noise of your world?How would your world look if viewed from a great height?What are the eating habits of the people? This question is one of the important ones to answer since it gives out a lot of information about the environmental situation of the world. I would highly recommend you to go through this site for further help: Fantasy Worldbuilding Questions - SFWA.    CharactersYou'll not only use the characters as an active element here, you'll also be using them as the static devices needed to answer some questions about your world. Even though you can use them for telling the story about your world, be careful not to overuse this privilege.  Give your protagonist a set of skills that differentiate them from the others. Are they stronger than the others? Is that what makes them different? Or are they weaker? Have they been bullied their entire life, making them emotionally strong? There has to be a certain element to them that makes them stand out. It shouldn't necessarily be good.  Choose their weapon. Make them exceptionally good at sword-fighting. Or shooting. Anything that makes them intimidating to the people around. They don't need to be hard-core but they need to be at least good enough for the antagonist to even entertain the idea of screwing with them. Everybody loves a good challenge.  Similarly, the antagonist, too, should have a nice story to tell. What made them the way they are today? Why are they so hell-bent upon destroying the world? And remember, the antagonist should have the will of steel and the stubbornness similar to that of hair on velcro; your antagonist cannot just wake up one morning and go well, this has been fun and all but I'm gonna give up now. No. The antagonist never gives up, not even at the face of death. Your protagonist is allowed to entertain the idea of surrendering but that's a liberty you cannot allow your antagonist to have.   You can learn a lot about writing High Fantasy novels by studying the ones available to us. I think they're a blast to work with but equally as difficult to create since you're not just building a world, you're attempting to build credibility, too. Everybody knows you're lying but you need to make that lie as believable as possible. Remember how acceptable it was for us to believe that the pokemon world existed as kids? You want to have a similar effect on your readers.  Lastly, I think, the entire point of writing an Epic Fantasy story is having fun. So enjoy yourself and don't take all these points all too seriously. Your world, your rules. All the very best.     ",

            "answer_text": "Ah, High Fantasy! The most fascinating and unfortunately also the most abused of fantasy genres. There is so much to say about what to do with High Fantasy, and even more about what to avoid. The first step is to of course identify the premise of high fantasy. It is NOT only about kings and dragons and sorcerers. It is about any world different from our own. The more different the world, the higher your high fantasy gets. The bigger the scale, the more epic your high fantasy gets. So, in a way, all the Tolkien imitators are not really writing High Fantasy. They are writing Low Fantasy on Tolkien\u2019s world. If you really want to tackle High Fantasy on your terms, then really let your imagination fly. Discard our reality, our physics, our logic, our rules. Create your own. Terry Pratchett created Discworld; a flat world borne on the backs of elephants on a gigantic turtle. It\u2019s a satirical nod to some of our mythology, but it\u2019s also representative about how insanely creative you can be with your world. My own novel is quite Low Fantasy, based on our humble Earth and our current time, with flashbacks to the past and hints of other worlds and beings. However, if I were to sit back and cook up a High Fantasy concept in line with my own advice\u2026 let me see. How about a world where the day brings life and the night brings death. A race of Light Beings live on aerial floating islands that skim the surface of the planet, forever racing to stay in the day, ahead of the night. The night holds unthinkable terrors and the Dark Beings. The power source for the floating islands is an elemental being\u2026 who is dying. If the elemental dies, the islands stop flying and the Light Beings will be devoured by the night. The only way to replenish this power is to journey into the night and rescue the only other elemental being on the world, who the Night Beings hold captive. Cue a party of heroes who are the Light Warriors and a parallel party of fugitives who are an assorted bunch of Light Being misfits who also stumble out at the same time. Gleeful chaos ensues. In parallel, the High Quorum of Dark Beings is working on cloning the surviving elemental into an army of elementals who will give them enough power to bring down the sun, plunging the world into eternal night. There! This is a rough and very random first draft of a high fantasy concept, but it kind of proves my point. You don\u2019t need high fantasy tropes. You don\u2019t need maps or quests. Actually, in this story, a map won\u2019t make sense as everything is in motion. Even time in the traditional sense won\u2019t make sense as there is no passing of day and night. The Light Warriors and the fugitives can both have central characters who come together. The Night Beings can turn out to be good guys too, just photophobic and geekily gothic. The elemental can turn out to be the real evil. Anything is possible. Everything is possible. It\u2019s High Fantasy! Now that the idea is done, I have the itch to take it further and see where this story of the Light and Dark Beings goes. I wish you luck with your High Fantasy journey! ",
