The first site that popped up was sparknotes with a wonderful explanation. A few links later is cliffsnotes. The sparknotes site described the tone of the custom house this way: \u201cThis introduction provides a frame for the main narrative of The Scarlet Letter. The nameless narrator, who shares quite a few traits with the book\u2019s author, takes a post as the \u201cchief executive officer,\u201d or surveyor, of the Salem Custom House. (\u201cCustoms\u201d are the taxes paid on foreign imports into a country; a 'customhouse' is the building where these taxes are paid.) He finds the establishment to be a run-down place, situated on a rotting wharf in a half-finished building. His fellow workers mostly hold lifetime appointments secured by family connections. They are elderly and given to telling the same stories repeatedly. The narrator finds them to be generally incompetent and innocuously corrupt.\u201d I didn't dig into sparknotes and cliffsnotes but am sure there is more description of that custom house and its tone. Also, check out the gradesaver site just below cliffsnotes. ",
