No, it\u2019s not a journal; it\u2019s not a textbook; it\u2019s not a short story; it\u2019s not (except for a very few parts) poetry; it\u2019s not an almanac; it\u2019s not a novel (you already asked that one); it\u2019s only partly a biography; it\u2019s not an airline timetable; it\u2019s not a repair manual for a 1998 Toyota Camry. Hope this helps, Mr. Spambot. ",
