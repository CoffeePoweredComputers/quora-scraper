            "answer_text": "A fair few authors claim to. That is how Phillip Pullman writes, for instance. But as an approach it's not without risks - for instance, the end of The Amber Spyglass (the finale of his His Dark Materials trilogy) is a little disappointing on first reading - the pacing is somewhat off and it feels like a tale with such huge scope needs a \"bigger\" ending; on later reflection you can see how he has tied his themes together very nicely, but it still feels like a diminuendo when a crescendo was required. Generally, I would say that to write without an outline you need to have spent a lot of time on understanding your characters, and you need to know what your ending is and what threads will lead into it. You also need to be very good at problem solving along the way, and you may need to be more willing to abandon a particular route if it doesn't suit the story. To get to a good draft you will need to rewrite, whether you have an outline or not. Without one, your first draft will end up serving much of the purpose of an outline, because it will be the first time you'll work through the major plot points. You may find you have to abandon whole subplots or directions because they don't serve the story. That's harder to do if you've drafted them than in an outline. However, you may find that you can be truer to your characters, because you are working out your plot and character beats at the same time. The best I can offer is that if you feel like trying it, try it. That way you will find out if it works for you. You may find that it works, or you may realise that the effort of an outline saves you effort and keeps you on track. A final thought: one reason I didn't like writing outlines was, I suppose, that it forced me to resolve things. You need to tackle the big questions of plot and structure and I wasn't sure if I could. Since writing my first (and only, and probably unpublishable in current draft) novel, it has taught me the value of tackling more of that up front so that you don't write yourself into a corner. ",

            "answer_text": "Is it possible to write a novel without a plan? Yes. It\u2019s called pantsing, as in writing by the seat of your pants. Undoubtedly it\u2019s always been done, but the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) challenge has popularized it. What you end up with, of course, isn\u2019t a novel but a really rough first draft. By writing without a plan, you\u2019ll have tried out a lot of ideas, explored a lot of avenues that don\u2019t pan out. Out of that wealth of ideas, some are able to find a story line they love. Some people begin with just a spark of an idea. Some begin with a very loose plan. So there are variations. It\u2019s whatever ends up working for you. It suits NaNoWriMo well. The challenge is to write 50,000 words in the 30 days of November. This forces writers to write fast with no time for editing. When you get stuck and hate what you\u2019re writing \u2014 as most writers do \u2014 you need to keep pushing forward. The goal isn\u2019t a great novel but to prove to yourself that you can write a novel. If you Google pantsing versus plotting (planning, outlining) you\u2019ll read lots of experiences. It\u2019s not for everyone! Some people hate it. Some love it. Some end up with some variation of pantsing and plotting that works for them. Is it possible to write a good novel without a plan? I think some people can, but most can't. I suspect the biggest factor is how someone's brain is wired. Some great writers naturally think in terms of \"How can the character's choice resonate thematically with the other elements of the story AND move the plot forward while ALSO making the situation worse?\" Occasionally a person will have a brainstorm where the beginning and ending resonate so well that the middle just flows from their fingers. But writing the next story will be ever so much more difficult for them since they don't know what made the first one flow. It just happened. I think it was John Truby who said something like the reason writing is so hard is that in real life we naturally make choices that make life and relationships smoother. But to write a good story, our characters have to make the opposite choices. They have to tick people off, make life harder for themselves and others, feed their emotions at the expense of logic. So maybe the authors who can fire off a continuos stream of anti-social behavior should frighten us a bit. ;-) ",
