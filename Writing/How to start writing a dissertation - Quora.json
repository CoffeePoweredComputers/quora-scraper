            "answer_text": "How do you begin writing a dissertation? What topics in your discipline interest you? Become by jotting down some possibilities. It seems to me that anyone who has been giving serious consideration to pursuing a Ph.D. in a field, likely has one or more subject matter areas that they would be interested in further delving into. Is there a subject in your discipline that just will not leave your psyche, that you have been seized on learning more about? Try to think of the types of questions arising from these subject matter(s) that would be interesting to ferret out the answer(s) to. Develop the habit of carrying paper and pens everywhere, when you travel short or long distance, or a laptop, and write just about anywhere and everywhere that you can, it does not matter: laundromat, restaurants, cafes, libraries, buses, trains, trams, subways, ferries, boats, waiting rooms, transportation stations, wherever. When you can advance to knowing what your chosen subject matter for a dissertation is going to consist on, it becomes important to develop a workable Contents section for the outset. Perhaps you want to keep the chapter numbers down to ten, let us say for sake of example to keep the manuscript manageable and ultimately readable with becoming prohibitively onerous. There are usually certain structural elements that one finds addressed, in one form or another, in the manuscript we refer to as the thesis or dissertation. For one, there may exist a Foreword to the dissertation, outlining what the genesis for your writing of the paper is. What is the dissertation intended to address as in, what questions specifically will be answered as a result? This section may also set forth what the paper is not intended to address. The introduction section may describe the hypothesis(ses) of the paper and, on a chapter number by chapter number basis, describe generally what the content of the particular chapter will be seen addressing. Many dissertations will have a chapter, located somewhere toward the early chapters, which is devoted to summarizing, a Review of the Literature of the Field specifically as appertaining relative to the questions under discovery in the instant thesis, providing the reader too with a baseline of the subject\u2019s specific vernacular, key definitions which will be arising throughout the manuscript, and what the historical to the present developments in the field have temporally been occurring, relative to the leading thinkers, books and articles constituting work by key players in the field. Many chapters of the dissertation may consist of content, be it experiments or case studies, tied to the selected methodological approach which is being employed by the author of the dissertation, he or she expressing through their prose, the why and in what manner, the several hypotheses are being tested against. Many, if not all Ph.D. dissertations, will have what is referred to as a Conclusions chapter. Many dissertations will also have a Notes chapter, although the obligatory, official university dissertation format in many cases, requires that the appertaining notes section consist in being virtual footnotes, their being typed - directly \u2014 onto the bottom of the instant page therein being so referenced, thus avoiding a reader to having to constantly refer to back notes, which can obviously become soon distracting to any reader/reviewer. Most Ph.D. dissertations it seems to me based on my research will also end with a Select Bibliography chapter listing all of the various materials referred to during the course of the dissertation\u2019s research. Finally, ending a dissertation with an Acknowledgments page(s) [or alternatively, incorporating this section into the Introduction chapter at the outset of the dissertation] wherein one thanks with some degree of specificity the dissertation adviser, co-adviser, external reviewer(s), and similarly others who assisted your work, including the various officials and organizations you reached out to who responded with useful and worthwhile information helping in having advanced your dissertation\u2019s work and what new knowledge can be derived therefrom such contributions. Once the writer has their Contents section (read outline of contents for the ms.) quasi-finalized, down to the point where they have confidently submitted such to their advisers and it looks like it is being greenlighted, the student should begin writing in earnest. The easiest technique which I acquired was working the individual pieces of the manuscript, one-by-one. If you become bored working one particular chapter, or your writer\u2019s well runs dry on prose regarding a particular chapter, put that chapter down for the time being, and pick up working on another. Tomorrow, remember, is another day. The dissertation\u2019s writer should always be working the pieces of one\u2019s dissertation, revising and tweaking your material on a day-to-day basis, such that it will become a natural, almost instinctive process for you, fear not. Progress will be the result. Another highly useful, if not invaluable dissertation organizing technique is to begin writing on 3x5, or larger depending, filing cards for constructing the order of your various chapters and their respective contents. Make sure to always have plenty of rubber bands to assist you in segregating the various piles of cards, demarcated by their respective chapters/subject matters (content). Make certain to always have back up copies of your work on the Cloud, somewhere way up there, and as your dissertation seriously advances as prudent measures, you too may wish to make sure you keep CDs of your current draft ms., offsite, such as for example, in a bank safety deposit box, or at a friend\u2019s home or apt. hidden away somewhere safely there as a safety backup measure, too. There is, nowadays, no such thing as being too careful about such things. Finally, before embarking on this journey, I would strongly encourage all takers to be availing themselves of the classic work by David Sternberg titled How to Complete And Survive A Doctoral Dissertation (Macmillan, 2014). For many years now, I have credited much of my success in achieving the Ph.D. to having applied the brilliant methodology and workable tactics presented by Dr. Sternberg who through his book, has for decades now, given so much to so many. In recent years, I had the privilege of corresponding with him and moreover, personally thanking him for his great assistance provided me during the mid/late 1980s through his magnum opus, I having read it many years prior to embarking on the Ph.D. I hope that this information proves helpful to you. May you have all of the requisite talent and grit in going the distance of what can be, and usually is a challenging journey, by ultimately and successfully completing the Ph.D. May your quest be thankful to having had the likes of Dr. Sternberg\u2019s excellent advice and guidance by your side (as well as, that of worthy other advisers you can find through your own goings and research).
