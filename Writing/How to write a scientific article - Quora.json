            "answer_text": "Hi, I am glad that you are interested in writing and publishing your research. I have written a book titled: How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper: The Step-by-Step Guide. You can find it on Amazon Amazon.com: How to Write and Publish a Scientific Paper: The Step-by-Step Guide eBook: Dr. Luz Claudio: Kindle Store or if you go to this website, you can download some free Write Scientific Papers resources. I wrote this book for exactly the reason you ask. Many students and junior scientists don\u2019t know where to start in order to write and publish their work. And it can be overwhelming, especially when your mentor assumes that you already know how to do this. And so many mentors just don\u2019t take the time to teach their students and postdocs how to write because they spend so much of their time writing their grant proposals. I think like many beginner researchers are not feeling mentored in their scientific writing. My book is written in a short, easy-to-follow format and each chapter gives you templates so that you can start writing at the same time as you read the book. I hope that the book and/or free materials will be very useful to you. Luz how to write science ",

            "answer_text": "A vague question like this I can answer by saying, read my book. That of course is insufficient. Communicating science is not a topic that is easily answered in a paragraph. The first thing to do is educate yourself in some depth on the topic you plan to explore in writing. Now you can do that on the Web, but it is better to interview someone who knows that particular subject. Find someone you can visit ,and do that first interview, on the road to educating yourself first.     A massive drawback to doing this successfully is that ideas of The European Enlightenment of the past two and three hundred years, have not spread widely to Africa, Asia or The Middle East. Indeed there they were, and still are, resisted frantically by religious and other authorities. (And this is also true in religious parts of the US and other first world countries too.) It is ideas of The Enlightenment that are the basis of modern science: inferential thinking (Francis Bacon), thinking in probabilities (Bayes, Fisher and others), the scientific method (Popper and others), a belief in yourself and your own thinking rather then that of authorities (Decartes), the idea of testing ideas against external evidence and so on. Without at least an inkling of these ideas, science is meaningless. So get cracking, you have a heap of work to do! ",
