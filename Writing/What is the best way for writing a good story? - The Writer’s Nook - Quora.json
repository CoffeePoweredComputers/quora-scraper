            "answer_text": "Writing a good story in seven easy steps! Let's begin. Step one: write a shitty story. Absolute garbage. Don't forget to use awful grammar, describe nothing, and have no plot. Yes, step one makes no sense. Just wait. Step two: go read a bunch of other stories. Short stories or flash fiction are good for this step, because they can be read in 30 minutes, tops. What was good about them? What did you like? What did you dislike? Not enough description, or too much description, or unrealistic characters, or weird point of view\u2026 figure it out. What you love may be entirely different from someone else, or for entirely different reasons. Step three: go back to your unfiltered garbage heap of a story. Are there elements within it that you can dig out, polish, and shine up? How is it similar to the other stories you loved, or hated? Step four: ??? Step five: take your time and write a story you think is good. Edit it, polish it, make it worth reading. Tuck it away and never show anyone. Step six: go read some more. Keep looking for things like style, characterization, dialogue. Anything you can get your hands on. Now is about the time that you should be figuring out what genre speaks to you most, also. Romance? Westerns? Not my cup of tea, but I'll indulge if the story is well-structured. Fantasy? Science-fiction? That's my language, but there's as much crap as there is gold. Step seven: write a story with characters you think are interesting, in a setting that fits your desired genre, and with a plot that makes you sit up straight and react to it as you're writing it. Bonus step. Even if you've written a good story, you may never get it published. Publishing is hard, especially when you're starting out. (I'm currently writing this as I stare at three rejections in my inbox.) Keep in mind that writing is an art form, and art is ultimately subjective. Many good stories may never see the light of day because there's no publisher who wants them, or because the writer never tries. Many more are rejected several times before picked up by another source. If you want a good story to get published, you probably need to write about 100 shitty-to-mediocre stories first. If you want a novel to get published? Write about 5 novels worth of crap while you refine your skills. PS. Step four is blank because it's up to you. It's your out. If at step three you keep writing and wonder why you're dying inside, step four is your chance to question yourself. Step away for a bit b if you need to. Come back later with renewed vigor. But, if you truly want to write good stories, you must come back and write. Be a voracious reader, and a prolific writer, and the practice makes you and your stories better. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has different \u2018Best Ways\u2019 but for me, I just take inspiration whenever it hits me, or at least I note it down. Inspiration can come from the most random words, most random places, and basically the most random things. I always jot down the main points of the story after choosing one thing that inspired me. I get inspired by random words such as \u2018Winter\u2019. Eventually, I have developed a plotline and I just start. Study other stories. They can really help. The way the plot goes, turn of events, descriptions, methods and styles. Just pick up a book and start reading. ",
