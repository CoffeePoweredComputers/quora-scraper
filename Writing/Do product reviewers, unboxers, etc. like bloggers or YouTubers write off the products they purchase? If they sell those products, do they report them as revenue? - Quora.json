These folks often receive goods for free in exchange for product endorsement, or are contractually bound to brands such as women\u2019s makeup. It\u2019s rare that products are purchased, and those who do buy out-of-pocket are reviewing low cost items or goods primarily purchased for personal use. I doubt many engage in product-taxation related issues unless they\u2019re generating substantial revenue from their activities, and those who do would be in the small minority. ",
