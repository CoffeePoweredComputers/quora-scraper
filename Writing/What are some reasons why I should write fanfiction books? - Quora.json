            "answer_text": "You should not write fanfiction \u201cbooks\u201d as you can\u2019t publish anything based on another\u2019s work unless the work is in the public domain or you\u2019ve been granted authorization by the author or property owner \u2014 and the folks who write those books are usually contracted by the property owners, as in the case of things like the Star Wars extended universe. As for why you should write fan fiction, it\u2019s a great way to improve your writing skills with some basic support in place (existing readers who already enjoy a particular set of characters) and some of the plot or characterization has already been created for you, giving you a \u201cboost.\u201d ",

Fanfiction writers write for the love of it. However, if you can write Star Trek or Star War novels, or novelization of movies and television shows under contract, there may be a paycheck in it for you. ",
