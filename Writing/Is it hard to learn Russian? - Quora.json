            "answer_text": "I've been teaching myself Russian for about a month and my answer is a definite YES. It's hard. I think Latin is a good comparison. They're about as hard as each other probably, in different ways.  Three main reasons: a) case and gender system. Russian has nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, prepositional and instrumental cases, and three genders. Obviously this is tricky if you're new to the concept.  If are generally a good linguist, you won't find it hard though. There aren't particularly many ending patterns (all plurals are the same for instance). If you've learnt Latin you'll find there are far fewer noun and adjective endings in Russian. but the overriding difficulty is: b) aspectual verb system. This was totally new to me and almost made me give up. Each Russian verb has two versions, called perfective and imperfective. They express differences similar to English 'I was doing' and 'I did'. Except in Russian, there are actually two different verbs used for each version, not different forms of the same verb. So, for every Russian verb you learn, you need to learn two. So, if you want to learn the verb to open, you learn otkryvat/otkryt. If you want to learn to start, it's nachynat/nachat.  To buy is pakupat/kupyt. So get ready to learn twice as many verbs as you expected. Many of them have their own irregular conjugations as well. c) verbs of motion. These are just a total nightmare. Single direction, multi-direction, motion on foot, motion by transport, and on top of that you have to learn their aspectual pairs as well. More minor reasons: c) numeral system. It's pretty difficult, let's just say. d) the actual words - a lot of them are long, hard to pronounce and sound similar to each other. It isn't really worse than English in this regard, but it's still difficult. A well-known book, Crime and Punishment is Prestuplenie y Nakazanie. You'll be learning lots of long, unfamiliar words like that. Edite) One thing I forgot - stress. Just like English, stress is very important in Russian. Every word has a strong stress pattern and if you get it wrong you'll sound silly. Also like English it's kinda random and unpredictable, you just have to learn it as you go along. Conclusion: if anyone tells you Russian isn't hard they're lying to you. If you've only learnt Spanish or French it will be a major step-up. If you've learnt German, that will help but it's harder. If you've learnt Latin, and found it OK, that will put you in good stead. It's easier than Czech, Ancient Greek or Arabic in my experience. If you want a challenge, go for it. If you want to casually learn a language for fun, I'd pick something else. ",

            "answer_text": "I am learning Russian now and I find several things hard about it: Pronunciation, especially of consonants - Russian is a very consonant-rich language, and it makes distinctions between consonants that are typically not distinguished in most other languages (except other Slavic languages). For each consonant, there is a pair of \u201chard\u201d (non-palatalized) and \u201csoft\u201d (palatalized) consonants.I initially found it hard to even hear the distinctions between these consonants. But not only hearing, but speaking these can be important in being understood, because sometimes using the wrong one can change the meaning of different words.There is also one tricky vowel, \u044b, which is both hard to pronounce and, perhaps even harder to hear, initially (as our brains tend to force it into categories for different vowels based on context.)Different logic of spelling - I personally find the Cyrilic alphabet to be pretty straightforward, and Russian spelling to be much more regular than English, but it uses a very different logic from how the Latin alphabet works. There are two sets of vowels, and these typically change the preceding consonant.There are also a lot of spelling exceptions to learn\u2026like contexts where \u0433 is pronounced like \u0432 or rarely like \u0445, and then weird rules like \u0448 not being allowed to be followed by \u044b, combined with the fact that \u0448/\u0449 function a lot like a hard/soft consonant pair, which leads to some strange exceptions to patterns to learn.Different vowel reduction - English has vowel reduction, but it works differently from in Russian. \u041e reduces to an \u201c\u0430\u201d sound, wherever it is unaccented, and this is relatively easy to understand, although it still takes some getting used to. On the other hand, \u044f and \u0435 reduce to \u0438 when unaccented, which was weird and unintuitive to me at first.Crazy amounts of case endings to memorize with numerous unnecessary complications - Cases make sense to me; I learned Latin and German and I\u2019m familiar with the basic idea of them. The way Russian cases work is actually highly intuitive to me and was easy to learn. But the endings are out of control!!!There are three different genders, and there are multiple different sets of possible endings for each gender. On top of that, adjectives have their own set of endings and the adjectives are based on the case and gender of the noun they are modifying; they do not necessarily have the same ending. On top of this, there are tons of pronouns which, although they usually largely match the adjective endings, have some irregularities and exceptions. Oh, and possessive pronouns like \u201cmy\u201d and \u201cyours\u201d often need to be conjugated as well.And there\u2019s the little quirk of masculine, neuter, and plural nouns declining differently in the accusative case based on whether or not they\u2019re inanimate.One thing that makes these endings much harder to learn is that a lot of endings appear in multiple places. Accusative singular feminine for adjectives and some nouns ends in \u0443, but masculine/neuter singular dative also ends in \u0443. Feminine singular for some nouns ends in \u0430, but so does genitive singular of some masculine and neuter nouns, and the plural of other nouns. \u043e\u043c is instrumental case for some masculine and neuter nouns, but for some adjectives it\u2019s masculine and neuter prepositional case. Seriously WTF? The reuse of the same endings in different ways is the most confusing thing to me about the case system.Basically the endings in the case system is one of the worst shit shows I\u2019ve seen in any language.Perfective and imperfective verbs with no predictable patterns of how they are related - In Russian, verbs come in pairs, which is not so bad; I find the concept of perfective (actions carried to completion) vs imperfective (habitual or ongoing actions) pretty easy to understand.The problem is that in Russian, it seems essentially random what form the verbs take. For example, look at some imperfective / perfective pairs: \u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c/\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c, \u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c/\u043f\u043e\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c/\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0437\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044c/\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c, and \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c/\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c.This is also a complete shit show. There are many different prefixes that can appear. In one case, the verb with the \u043f\u043e- prefix is the perfective one; in another case, it\u2019s the imperfective one. In one case, you have a verb pair both of which has the same prefix, \u043f\u0440\u0438-, but without the prefix each of these is its own imperfective verb which has a different perfective counterpart. Sometimes letters/sounds later in the words change in the pair. Sometimes the pairs are completely distinct words with no clear relationship between them.It is these irregularities, the extensive things that have no logic or pattern to them that you just need to learn, that is what I think makes Russian hard. To be honest, there\u2019s not all that much else I\u2019ve encountered about it that is hard. A lot of things that are very hard in English, are a lot easier in Russian. You don\u2019t have to worry about whether or not or when to include articles in front of words, because there are no articles. Making subordinate clauses is often very easy; a lot of things are communicated just by pausing at the right time, and the way the pauses work is highly intuitive to me. A lot of unfamiliar grammatical constructions are actually intuitive to me when I first encounter them. The language is highly synthetic (built out of small pieces) and I can often figure out what a word means thorugh a combination of context and familiarity with its components. I think these things combine to make Russian one of those languages that feels \u201cfront-heavy\u201d on the difficulty. You not only need to get the tough aspects of the pronunciation, you need to know an awful lot of case endings before you become able to understand even fairly basic things. But then once you reach a certain critical mass of knowledge, it\u2019s like things \u201cclick\u201d and suddenly you start understanding a lot. I found this more true of Russian than of any other language I\u2019ve studied; for example, with Spanish, German, or even Japanese, it feels like there is a little more of a gradual increase in comprehension ability over time. Russian, whether writter or spoken, seemed hopelessly confusing to me for months and months, because I would hear words and know the words but not know how they fit into things, and then suddenly when my intuition for the case system started to develop, it was like, BAM suddenly I was catching the meaning of what was going on, and I was saying things and they\u2019d be right and I wouldn\u2019t know why but they just would be. I highly recommend learning it by use and exposure, not by trying to memorize tables of those endings. If you are hearing and learning whole sentences, especially when there is some sort of context for them, you hear both the case endings and the various verb forms and all those endings will eventually become second nature to you.
