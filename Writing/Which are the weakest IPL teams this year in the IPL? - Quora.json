            "answer_text": "KKR is the weakest team this year in IPL 2018. In terms of batting they have Chris Lynn (who is very much injury prone) , Robin Uthappa, Dinesh Karthik, Shubhman Gill and Nitish Rana. Out of these Robin Uthappa & Nitish Rana are consistent having average of 30 with strike rate of 130. Chris Lynn is a big player but most of the time he is unavailable due to injuries. Shubhman Gill is not tested yet in IPL. In All rounders they have Andre Russell, Piyush Chawla, Cameron Delport, Shivam Mavi, Javon Searles. Out of these only Andre Russell is the quality all rounder (Having batting strike rate of 164 & Bowling Average of 25 with economy of 8 runs per over). Piyush Chawla is more likely a bowler. And the others have played very less matches. They have two wicketkeepers - Dinesh Karthik & Robin Uthappa. Their bowling department is their strength as they have big names like Sunil Narine, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson, Kuldeep Yadav, Kamlesh Nagarkoti & Vinay Kumar. Out of these Sunil Narine might not play due to illegal action and Mitchell Starc have always issues sometimes regarding injuries sometimes he takes rest due to workload. Otherwise all the bowlers are of good quality. In terms of captaincy Dinesh Karthik would be there who is tested at Ranji Level. So let's see how he would take this average looking team ahead.

            "answer_text": "1.KKR (KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS)is such team which is looking weaker on the whole , when the full squad of all the IPL franchise were finalised They were very slow in the auction process They pressed the reboot button and started to get everything new And failed to use their RTM card effectively They failed to get their core team back And purchased such players whose names always present in the list of \u201cINJURED PLAYERS\u201dbefore the start of every season Plenty of errors in their auction approach So now they heavily rely on U19 YOUNG GUNS Which doesn't help to lift the trophy 2.Then comes the team which is known for their miserliness while purchasing the players i.e RR(RAJASTHAN ROYALS) This time they went big in the auction and brought some good bankable players with huge price But lacked to have specialized and well known spinners And they heavily rely on BEN STOKES&JOS BUTTLER if once the English season has started they both will be not available as they need to attend their national duties then who will replace them is the big question?????
