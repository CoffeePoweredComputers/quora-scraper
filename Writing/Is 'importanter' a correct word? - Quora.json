            "answer_text": "NO, \u201cimportanter\u201d is wrong. In English, half the time you write \u201cmore.\u201d For example people write \u201cmore important,\u201d not \u201cimportanter\u201d The other half of the time, English writers write \u201cer\u201d at the end of the word. Which words follow which rule is arbitrary and is probably only learnable by wrote-memorization. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- new --> newer (NOT \"more new\") CORRECT EXAMPLE \u201cJoe has two cars.

            "answer_text": "No, it isn\u2019t. Even though, in English, you can usually \u2018invent\u2019 any word you want to , you have to follow the rules. You probably want to create a comparative adjective, so you need to follow the rules for adding suffixes to a word. Your word is \u2018important\u2019 is an adjective. To make a comparative adjective you can add the suffix \u2018-er\u2019. However you can only add this suffix to words that have one or two syllables. tall - tall+er = taller happy - happy + er = happier (There is an extra rule here that says change the \u2018y\u2019 into an \u2018i\u2019 before adding -er.) For words that are more than 2 syllable you don\u2019t add a suffix. Instead you put the word \u2018more\u2019 before the adjective. important - more + important = more important Compare these examples: George is taller than Marcus. Marcus is happier than George. Food is more important than shelter. If you want to make the comparison in the opposite way, you can use the word \u2019less\u2019\u2026 Shelter is less important than food. and the phrase \u2018not as + adj. + as\u2019 \u2026 George is not as happy as Marcus. On a side note you might want these other rules for making comparative adjectives: If the adjective\u2019s last three letters follow the pattern c-v-c (that is consonant-vowel-consonant), you should double the final consonant. ex.: big c-v-c = bigger thin cvc = thinner This is only a spelling convention and does not affect the pronunciation. Here are the only irregular adjectives, (only 3!)- good-better/ bad-worse/far-farther or further I hope that was your question ;-) ",
