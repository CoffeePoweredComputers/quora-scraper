            "answer_text": "How do I write an article on LinkedIn? I will first address the question of the mere mechanics of writing an article, then focus on how to do it well. Mechanics From the main LinkedIn page, LinkedIn is forever prompting you to post an update.  If you click on Write article (or click on this link), you get this:  If you have ever used a text editor of any kind, this should be pretty straightforward. Kindly note that LinkedIn prompts you to start with the title of your article\u2014it presumes you know what you are writing about. Doing It Well LinkedIn loves to trumpet that over a billion articles have been posted on their platform, which speaks to the popularity of posting on it. That\u2019s also a warning. Because it\u2019s so popular, there\u2019s a lot of competition for articles. Your network has been deluged with them, if your network is of a meaningful size. Don\u2019t just post an article because hey, that\u2019s what the SEO folks say you should. Do it because you actually want to inform your network about something important, that matters to you. Do it well, or don\u2019t do it at all. And you do it well by: Saying something worthwhile. If you are just the hundredth post saying exactly the same thing in the last hour, nobody cares. No one cares if you\u2019re just repeating conventional wisdom.Being distinctive. Having read hundreds of articles over the years, please stand out or don\u2019t bother. LinkedIn is positively littered with bland, boring, unremarkable articles.",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking about writing an Article on your personal LinkedIn profile, some of the other answers go over that. However, if you are asking specifically about writing an Article for a LinkedIn company page (as opposed to a personal profile), it is not allowed by LinkedIn. Articles are more like long blog posts, and unfortunately can only be posted by personal profiles, not company pages. On your personal profile, you will see you have the \u201cWrite article\u201d option:  However, on your company page, you will notice that you do not have that option:  So the answer is no, company pages cannot publish Articles, they can only publish Posts.  Need a way to schedule LinkedIn posts? I am the founder of a social media tool called OneUp that allows you to schedule posts to LinkedIn (both personal profiles and company pages), in addition to other social networks. Here\u2019s how it works: On the Accounts page in OneUp, the first step is to connect your LinkedIn account(s). You can connect both LinkedIn company pages, as well as LinkedIn personal profiles.  After, click on Schedule a post.  On the scheduling page, choose which LinkedIn accounts you want to post to. If you have multiple LinkedIn accounts, you can select multiple company pages and personal profiles at the same time.  Then write the contents of your LinkedIn post. You can add photos directly from your computer, create an image in the Canva integration, or choose a professional photo from the Unsplash integration.  Then choose to post it once, or to have the post repeat automatically. Example: this LinkedIn post is scheduled to repeat every three months.  Then choose to post it now, or schedule your LinkedIn post for the future. ",
