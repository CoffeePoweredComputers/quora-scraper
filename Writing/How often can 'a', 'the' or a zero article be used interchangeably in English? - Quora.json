In some circumstances, the difference is slight, for example: Cows are dairy animals (zero article plus plural)The cow is a dairy animal (the plus singular).They convey the same information, but the context for each is different. You could use these sentences interchangeably and be understood, but in context, each may not be idiomatic. This is one of the areas I struggle with explanation - I know which is right but telling you why is difficult.
