            "answer_text": "Hello, So, there is no such thing as best handwriting\u2026 every handwriting depends upon the present mental state of a person.. as a graphologist (handwriting analyst), I have seen many handwritings.. but the best ones were the ones that were neat and readable.. As long as your writing is neat, your sheet is clean and your writing is readable\u2026 that is the best.. except that, it depends upon your style of holding the pen which should be correct, and your current state of mind that shows in your handwriting.. So, keep your mind clear and calm.. your handwriting will be clear and nice\u2026 and practice your curves and writing style by writing a lot.. use paper and pen more than laptop and keyboard\u2026 if you want, then search it up, it has many more advantages to it except for the disadvantage of cutting down of trees to make paper which can also be replaced by recycled paper. Your fingertips have acupressure points that helps you to remember what you write and many more things.. so, practice a lot, and your writing will be as good as the ones you like the most. If you want, you can even join handwriting workshops for all age groups.. they even teach you the right way to hold a pen. Usually people hold it in a wrong way because of which their hand states paining after writing for as long as an hour. So, all the best for your practice... With best wishes, Praptii Jain. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote an answer similar to this: Astoria Lee's answer to Is your handwriting good or bad? Here\u2019s what I wrote: I'm not a fan of hand-writing. I just wanna share some Chinese high school students' handwriting!    Go on http://baidu.com and search \"\u8861\u6c34\u4e2d\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u4f5c\u6587\u5b57\u4f53\" if you want to get more. Maybe you want to ask \"How could they have handwriting which looks just like it\u2019s printed!!\" or \"Why do they practice their handwriting like that? Is there any advantage??\" Okay, the answer is, yes! In China there is a exam named \"\u9ad8\u8003\" and it's just like SAT in USA. Chinese students try their best in the \u9ad8\u8003 to get more score. Even 1 point will change a lot. We have the subject \"English\" and it need us to answer some questions and write a passage. Teachers almost never care what you write, they just care about if your handwriting is good and search for some key words. That's why students practice their handwriting so hard,they just want to get more point in the exam. So in the end, let's have a look about my handwriting. Not good at all.  ",
