            "answer_text": "First of all, congratulation that you have thought about writing about yourself. And, sorry for a late answer. To start with, when you write something, you need be very clear about who is going to read it. If you are willing to keep it a secret and trying to do an introspection or just writing to find the answer of \u2018who am I?\u2019 then your content will be different from a general information which will be available for public reading. After you are sure about your targeted readers, you can follow the below steps to go with your writing. Be at a calm and quite place where you can think uninterruptedly.Note down broadly what are the things you want to share with your readerDivide the broad topics in paragraphs/ chaptersOne by one put your thoughts into each chapter/ paragraphRevisit what you have written and edit for consistency of your thought, grammatical mistake if anyAlso, assess the impact of your information on your reader, whether you truly want the reader to read it or not.In normal cases you may need to modify/ correct what you have written 3/4 times before you go for finalisation. I know few good authors who corrects his writing up to 6 times. So, best of luck!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi,on a page, do a SWOT analysis. That's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. This will give you an accurate understanding of yourself in words. Make notes about interesting anecdotes or important events (which you wish to share). Maybe a lead-up or background for that incident or maybe the after-effects (lol) or maybe both. That'll provide your readers with a more well-rounded understanding. If you're not sure about what pattern to follow, I'll humbly suggest doing so chronologically. You can check about the formatting options online. It's important that your content, i.e. - narrative, is engaging. All the Best. :) ",

            "answer_text": "I feel that's the easiest thing to write about and the toughest at the same time! Easiest because if there is someone you know in and out that is you yourself and toughest because when you write about yourself you reveal a lot about your life and it is not easy to put it all down on paper, it takes courage. If you want to write about yourself then ask yourself why you have not written about yourself yet and begin! It is the best way to vent out, it will escalate your patience level. ",
