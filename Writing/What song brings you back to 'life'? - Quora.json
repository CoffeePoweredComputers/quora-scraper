            "answer_text": "Its a truth, and it happens, Out of the silence of regret comes a song of hope. Some music, lyrics, so well in rhythm that it hits the core, the walls which binds a space for realisation. Incidentally many times it happened, different songs, realisations, a new kind of feeling, so new that it takes a while to be introduced properly. Then a song becomes an inspiration, generating a new idea and a new way of watching the world around. You remember all the time when and where you heard this song, either after a long time or for the first, also under what situation that music inserted a change around. 2017 July - High Hopes - Pink Floyd 2017 September - Coming back to life - Pink Floyd 2018 March - Kryptonite - 3 Doors down 2018 August - Norwegian wood - Beatles (First time) 2019 Febraury - Halfway to Nowhere - Chelou (First time) 2019 March - The trip - Still corner (First time) This is a list that I remember with some recent and old times, I adored the change, loose myself in the feelings they gave, and found myself back to life.
