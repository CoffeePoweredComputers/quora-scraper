Other then that I dont write bad review s about a person unless its serious, it needs to be addressed. Making a complaint should only be a complaint if a situation is serious, it needs to be expressed, helped with. Sruff like hurting you Deffo needs to be complained. People dont know whats wrong if you don't complain about it. You should complain if its a new complaint. If its old complaints then it needs to go away if the situation has been dealt with, fixed. You need to let it go. Only complain if it hurt you, its a new problem. Love, Angela ",

If it is constructive, then it can be very useful. I have often got in touch with people who have picked up on a number of errors in my books, and received a lot of great feedback. ",
