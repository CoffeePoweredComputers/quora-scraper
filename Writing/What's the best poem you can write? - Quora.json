            "answer_text": "A poem, I believe, is very subjective; what is good for you may not be good for me. And it\u2019s a continuous process, so you never know which one is your magnum opus. Here\u2019s one of my favorite ones. Alone You are a traveler, you have to walk alone.When the thoughts in your mind begin to hatchWhen you have a new destiny to follow When you have to begin from scratch You need \u2018good luck\u2019 but there is no one to say \u2018hello\u2019 Like at dawn, the morning light shone You are a traveler, you have to walk alone. You have begun; you took your first stepNow you know there is a lot of work to do You look around to find someone for help But to support your struggles you notice only a few Like the heat at noon, the hardships have grown You are a traveler, you have to walk alone. Now you succeed, you are at the topYou will be surrounded by praise and prize When the life is hard, when you seem to go flop To help you stand up, these hands never rise Don\u2019t you get flattered by this success and fame With every new day you will have a difficulty to tame Like evening, when the sun says \u2018another good day has gone\u2019 You are a traveler, you have to walk alone. If you have failed in your ambitionYou may feel heartbroken and dead But you need to remember this condition These petty failures should not make you sad After the darkness there rises a new day You just can\u2019t let go, you need to stay Like the night, when even the shadows are long gone You are a traveler, you have to walk alone. Good and bad times come and goYou only reap what you sow Your instinct to never fall down will pay Your desire to succeed will make your day Every task is a challenge, the reward is the throne You have to work hard to make it your own Even if you are lonely, you should not moan Because you are a traveler, you have to walk alone.
