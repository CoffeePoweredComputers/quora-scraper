            "answer_text": "In a typical peer-reviewed journal, the types of articles would be: regular research papers;short communications / rapid communications (typically just a few pages long in the final layout; often without abstract; upper limit on the number of words in the manuscript; sometimes published faster than a regular research paper);review articles;erratum/corrigendum (authors\u2019 correction to their previously published article);discussion (another scientist provides feedback on a paper recently published in this journal; typically short; there is usually a deadline for submitting discussions, e.g. 2\u20133 months after publication of the original paper; some journals do not accept discussion articles);authors\u2019 reply to discussion.Some journals do not provide the \u201cshort communication\u201d option. Some (though very few) publish only papers of a fixed length (e.g. all papers must be 4 pages long in the final layout). Some journals do not accept review papers, while others encourage submission of reviews or publish exclusively reviews. When it comes to review articles, there is great variability, too. Some have only text, others contain a lot of figures, some are short (10\u201315 pages), others are much longer. When I see a review article, I usually look first at the list of references rather than at the page count. A sufficiently long list of references without any obvious bias might be a much better indication of a thorough review than the page count is. As you see, there is indeed a great variation, but the above covers the most, I think. ",
