            "answer_text": "Interesting is a very abstract concept indeed. Here are 17 clear strategies you can implement today to create a more interesting articles. Use a variety of sentence structures. Articles that try to make every sentence a simple sentence don\u2019t make for an interesting read.Use a variety of sentence types. That\u2019s declarative, imperative, interrogative and the occasional, exclamatory. But be aware of the publication the article is for. In some cases, certain sentence types may seem out of place.Use sentence fragments strategically. Obviously, if you\u2019re writing for an educational institution or client who asks you to follow MLA or APA, skip this advice. But know that a well-placed fragment can really enhance a piece.Use a variety of words. Barring really common words like \u201ca\u201d, if you just used the same word in the last sentence, or same sentence, try using a different word. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to learn how to begin my articles well.\u201d Note how poorly that reads.Avoid words that are hard to read. Variety is great. But try to avoid words that people have to look up. If you wouldn\u2019t use the word normally, it will likely detract.Reduce use of passive language. Hemmingway app is a free online tool that will highlight passive verbs. Go in and fix them. But please note that Hemmingway sometimes flags sentences as passive that aren\u2019t. Use your professional discretion.Avoid clumsy or exeperanous words. \u201cYou can find what you\u2019re looking for on my blog\u201d Notice how the \u201cYou can\u201d is really unnecessary. A tight imperative sentence works better. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?Avoid Be verbs, sometimes. Don\u2019t get rid of all Be verbs. That can make an article read strangely. But sometimes, you\u2019ll find that if you reword the sentence, an action verb works better.Write in 2nd person. Articles always sound more interesting when the piece is conversational. It\u2019s hard to sound conversational when you\u2019re talking about instead of talk to. This is something that a lot of business writers get wrong.Use storytelling. Adding a quick story or relatable example into an article increases interest. \u201cDon\u2019t you just hate when peanut butter gets stuck to the roof of your mouth?!\u201dFind a unique angle. it doesn\u2019t matter how boring a topic is. Find a unique angle to discuss it and you\u2019ll have a more interesting article.Add interesting stats, quotes or facts. Show that you\u2019ve done your homework by supporting what you\u2019re saying.Use Visuals. Articles with relevant images get more engagement.Use emotion. Contrary to what some will tell you, a piece doesn\u2019t have to elicit the standard emotions to be engaging. Wanting to succeed. Desiring to learn. Figuring out something helpful. These are secondary emotional feelings that an interesting article might tap into. Nostalgia is another great emotion to write. And of course, when appropriate tap into fear, excitement, tears of joy, frustration, etc. But be careful. A non-stop emotional article can become very draining to read.Know Your Audience. Finally, the most important one of all. Know who your target audience is. If you\u2019re writing for programmers, they\u2019re going to find certain tech topics very interesting. You don\u2019t have to get emotional to be interesting. If you\u2019re helping a business person run their business better, then they\u2019ll often find straight to the point interesting. You don\u2019t have to tell jokes.Make it Skimmable. Huge block paragraphs and no headings quickly reduce the perception of how interesting something is.Get rid of \u201cvery hard to read\u201d sentences. We turn to Hemmingway app again. Use this free tool to identify sentences that are very hard to read. Enhance the reading experience. But I\u2019d ignore the \u201chard to read\u201d sentences in this app unless you\u2019re writing for 2nd graders.Note, however, that despite the fact that I get rave reviews for my writing, every once in a 1000 or so clients, I\u2019ll get someone who says my writing isn\u2019t interesting or otherwise not up to standards. In these cases, don\u2019t take it personally. Read back over it. See what you can learn from it. Then move on to make more great content. Sometimes they were just expecting a different style and didn\u2019t indicate that. You might also find this article very useful. Why Your Article Writer Should Be a Storyteller  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIt\u2019s Topic\u201d I guess makes the article interesting . Humour in writer\u2019s mind and creativity in writer\u2019s hand makes it even more interesting . The frequent Readers reads article with their interest in their respective niches and some non-readers (not frequent) if the writer pour his/her soul describing the specific topic makes it worth reading .
