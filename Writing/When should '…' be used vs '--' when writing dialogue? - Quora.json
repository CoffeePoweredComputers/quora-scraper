            "answer_text": "Please note: I violate this rule myself (just so we understand each other): Strictly speaking, \u201cthree dots\u201d (three periods) should be used only to indicate an omission in the middle of a quotation. Four dots (four periods) should be used for an omission that includes a period ending a sentence that also ends a quotation. A hyphen (-) is used for hyphenated expressions like \u201cGovernor-General,\u201d and a dash (\u2014) is used to signify an interruption. There are two ways in which three dots often are used that do not conform to the official rule. First, there are some distinguished newspaper columnists (including writers of sports and financial columns) who use three dots to separate short, unrelated items. \u201cGilda Gotrocks was back in town after an adventure in Rome\u2026 Operagoers say that the drinks served at intermission are weaker than ever\u2026 Shortstop Biff Buntling is buying a $3.5M condo across the street from the ballpark\u2026\u201d A San Francisco newspaper columnist named Herb Caen, of happy memory, won the Pulitzer Prize for Journalism after a lifetime of creating three-dot columns. Second, in reporting dialogue, writers of fiction may indicate that what a character is saying trails off by running three dots at the end. >> John sighed and said, \u201cI long for another trip to the Riviera,\u201d and Marsha answered softly, \u201cI long for the days when we could do it justice\u2026\u201d >> \u201cMy story begins forty years ago,\u201d he said, \u201cin a cheap hotel near the waterfront\u2026\u201d We listened in rapt attention, because we knew it would be a long story. Since your question is about writing dialogue, I think that\u2019s what you have in mind: trailing off. In my own writing, I use three dots to suggest that a statement or thought is trailing off, and I usually can get away with it. ",

            "answer_text": "When should \"\u2026\" be used vs \"--\" when writing dialogue? Two hyphens in sequence (\"--\") are never used in published typography. They are used only to represent a long dash when the keyboard or input device does not have the capability to create a long dash. Instead of two hyphens, the long dash (\u201c\u2014\u201d) is always used. Three dots in sequence (\u201c\u2026\u201d) are a single character, known as an \u201cellipsis,\u201d which means, roughly, \u201csomething has been omitted.\u201d____________How To Use An Em Dash (\u2014) https://www.lexico.com/grammar/dash-and-em-dash An em dash, or long dash, is used in pairs, to mark off information or ideas that are not essential to an understanding of the rest of the sentence, as in: \u201cThousands of children\u2014like the girl in this photograph\u2014have been left homeless.\u201d It is used singly in place of a colon (\u201c:\u201d) to indicate that the following text is an explanation of what went before it. Example: \u201cIt is a simple premise and yet, at the same time, an article of faith\u2014a faith that the future would be better than the past.\u201d In neither case are spaces used before or after the dash. Ellipses | The Punctuation Guidehttps://www.thepunctuationguide.com/ellipses.html An ellipsis is a set of three periods (\u201c...\u201d) that indicate an omission in the text. An ellipsis can also be used to represent a trailing off of thought, as in \u201cI was just thinking how \u2026 but that\u2019s another story.\u201d Note that an extra period is added when the ellipsis occurs at the end of a sentence, as in \u201cI was thinking about it when I was interr \u2026.\u201d ",
