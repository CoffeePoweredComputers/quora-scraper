Only submission of an application to the Patent Office of your country will determine if it is truly patentable as they have the last word. ",

            "answer_text": "You can definitely patent an unpatented medicine but if that information is published then you would have problems. However, even when a medicine is PATENTED you will still be able Patent your invention PROVIDED that is for a new usage and utility. For example ASPIRIN was discovered and invented for HEADACHES but later it was discovered that this medicine that was used for blood thinning that reduces the headache could also be used for heart protection. So YOU could not patent your medicine for HEADACHE but certainly for the HEART PROTECTION. But since now ASPIRIN is possibly patented for both the HEADACHE AND HEART you could not patent your medicine for those two usages and utility but IF AND WHEN you would be able come up with THIRD health benefits of it you certainly would be able to PATENT YOUR MEDICINE but NEVER EVER discuss your idea in public before you FILE A PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION with your Patent Office or else you would be OUT OF LUCK.
