            "answer_text": "Contaminated water used for irrigation is one further source of pollution. Much of the water we use comes from ground water reservoirs, canals and through the rains. While plenty of it is clean and pure water, other sources are polluted with organic compounds and heavy metals. This happens due to the disposal of industrial and agricultural waste in local bodies of water. As a result, the crops are exposed to water which has small amounts of mercury, arsenic, lead and cadmium dissolved in it. The process of agricultural pollution becomes harder to fight when such water poisons the livestock and causes crop failure. ",

In other hand , if the plant does not die it will go weak and less product , less quality , bad smell , bad taste , this happens because the elemant avaliblity decrease for some elemant and increase to other . Avalibilty depends on \u2018soil ph , soil EC , SAR \u2018 and all effect with water and what it contain . If water have high pollution it can be toxic for the soil , plant and underground water !!

There is already evidence in the San Joaquin valley where heavy metals from chemicals and fertilizers have changed the water table and growing potential for what was once one of the most fertile growing regions in the United States. There is a USDA projection about the impact in the region that I will find and add to this thread. But in the meantime here are articles that talk about its impact and how chemicals have polluted the water and soil. California to get more than $5 million from USDA for agricultural innovation Agricultural pollution ",

Some pollution may inhibit growth (albeit some pollution may actually promote plant growth), pollution can alter the chemistry of the plant, some pollution can poison or make toxic the resulting food (think in the news all the recalls of agricultural commodities like lettuce and spinach for e-coli or biological contamination).
