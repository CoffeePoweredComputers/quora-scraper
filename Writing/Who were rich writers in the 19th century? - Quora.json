            "answer_text": "The 19th century was a time of rapid social change brought on by the accelerated Industrial Revolution. In poetry, novels, essays, short stories, journalism, and other genres the following are some of the writers who provided a varied and exciting understanding of a world in flux. Charles Dickens' classic books, including Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, A Tale of Two Cities, and Great Expectations portrayed the social conditions of Victorian Britain and his books often concern the class divide, poverty, and ambition. Walt Whitman\u2019s classic volume Leaves of Grass was considered both a radical departure from convention and a literary masterpiece. His free verse poems celebrated the individual, notably himself, and had a sweeping scope including joyful attention to mundane details of the world. Washington Irving made his name with a satirical masterpiece, A History of New York, and created such memorable characters as Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane. His writings were highly influential in the early 19th century, and his collection The Sketch Book was widely read. One of Irving's early essays gave New York City its enduring nickname of \"Gotham.\" Jane Austen published four novels named Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, and Emma, where she vividly depicted English middle-class life during the early 19th century. Austen's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free indirect discourse, burlesque and irony. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle felt trapped at times by his own success as the creator of Sherlock Holmes. He wrote other books and stories which he felt were superior to the extraordinarily popular detective stores featuring Holmes and his loyal sidekick Watson. Frederick Douglass was enslaved from birth on a plantation in Maryland, but he managed to escape to freedom as a young man, and became an eloquent voice against the practice of enslavement. His autobiography, \"The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,\" became a national sensation. Louisa May Alcott created colorful relatable characters in 19th century novels. Her work introduced readers to educated strong female heroines. As a result, her writing style greatly impacted American literature. Her notable work Little Women is written with such natural dialogue that, even today, it remains realistic in its portrayal of womanhood. Emily Bront\u00eb, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Mark Twain, Anton Chekhov, Mary Shelley, Victor Hugo, H.G. Wells are other writers who has contributed notable works in the 19th century.  You can find most of the books written by these writers for free of cost or at cheap price(pay only the shipping charges) in an online website named MyPustak. ",
