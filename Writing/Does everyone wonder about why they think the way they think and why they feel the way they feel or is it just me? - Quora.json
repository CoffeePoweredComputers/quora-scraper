            "answer_text": "I wonder all the time, and it\u2019s trippy, especially when my mood swings come along, I was happy as could be yesterday then randomly just got so pissed off. When time passes after i\u2019m angry, I become really sad, cause I hate being angry I\u2019ve seen what it does to people and what can come from anger. Questioning things is what I do on a daily basis, and it helps me strive to learn more. When I was in lets say 8th grade my mom was taking a college psychology class, that I was interested in so I had her explain some things I didn\u2019t understand to see how people think. But you can never really come to a solution on that, the brain works in mysterious ways. Like \u201cwhy am i answering this question right now?\u201d It interests me and has more than one answer based on the opinion of the person. It\u2019s a really good thing to do in my mind, but it causes me daily headaches, and believe me it hurts, I love it though. ",

            "answer_text": "It's funny, before I started reading responses on quora about having this or that personality disorder I really didn\u2019t think about my feelings all that much. After I read a few responses from folks with psychopathy I began to wonder do I feel things the same as other people do? Is my happy like their happy and so and so forth. I started asking folks in my life and so far the answers are all over the place. I'm normally happy. I have times when I have experienced other emotions for awhile but then I always go back to being happy. It's my normal. Other folks can\u2019t fathom how this could be. Their normal is sad or their moods fluctuate. It's fascinating to me and I enjoy hearing other perspective on their own feelings and emotions. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with the previous answer suggesting that you get yourself checked for BPD - there\u2019s a good chance that you aren\u2019t actually bipolar, but you are displaying some of the symptoms so it\u2019s well worth booking an appointment with a mental health specialist just to be sure. That\u2019s dealing with the details of your question, but in terms of dealing with the question itself, the answer is that it depends entirely on the person. Some people question existence, emotions, philosophy, society, etc. Many don\u2019t, and are content with just getting on with life. Personally, I think it\u2019s a good thing to question yourself. I can\u2019t really speak for emotions, but in terms of thought, it\u2019s always a good idea to analyse thoughts - particularly those that may have an affect on your life. Your mind is your castle. If you have BPD, you may need some help in restoring it fully to your control, but it\u2019s your domain nonetheless. Don\u2019t feel like you are at odds with yourself - it\u2019s counterproductive and won\u2019t get you anywhere. Instead focus on harmonising your mind, you\u2019ll be much stronger as a person if your mind is under your control. Thanks for the request to answer, and I hope that this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Does everyone wonder about why they think the way they think and why they feel the way they feel or is it just me? There are these days when I feel so exuberant and lively but then there are days, the gloomy(at least for me) days when I do not find interest in anything. I just feel so empty and baffled about my sole existence. It\u2019s like I am my own friend and foe. Lots of people think about why they function the way they do. Some investigate this in a therapy setting, learning to understand their own motivations, feelings, and thoughts. There\u2019s a lot to be said for trying to figure out when and how you are your own enemy, for example, because that can help you be more of a friend to yourself. Self-reflection is a healthy thing, and unless you\u2019re completely focused on yourself to the exclusion of being available or accountable to others, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.

Sometimes it is easy to work out why I am feeling the way i am and other times there doesn\u2019t really seem to be a reason. There may be a reason which i am not aware of. I am lucky that my down moods aren\u2019t too bad and I know I will bounce back to a happier state before long. If you are worried about the emptiness you sometimes feel, perhaps it would be an idea to chat to your doctor. He/she may be able to give you some advice or refer you on. ",

So, reinterpreting & worrying about thoughts is necessary for us to flourish. I will advise you to rethink your thoughts but don\u2019t feel sad about youself consequently. Think them for your betterment, think them for fulfilment not for emptiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading your comments, it sounds like you have high energy days and low energy days. This could be normal for you. If you are interested, check to see if you have a routine diet (balanced) and routine exercise. Some people find that if their diet and exercise varies, so does their energy level. Since our energy level has a strong influence on our emotions, you may find relief just by adding some routine to your life. However, if your diet and exercise seem to be balanced and routine, then seek assistance immediately and get an evaluation. Extreme mood shifts without an obvious reasons can be an unhealthy sign. Find out for sure. You will feel better knowing and you will be better prepared to act on a solution. Hope this helps and take best of care! ",

This may sound new to you, but it seems man-kind is becoming more aware of their being, or their soul and existence. This \u201cAwakening\u201d may happen to anyone at anytime after the year 2012. I myself have seen people begin to \u201cawaken\u201d at completely different timings, ages, and speeds. Up until today, I believe this \u201cAwakening\u201d is more vibrant when around good, loveable people. There is also more \u201crealisation\u201d and \u201coneness\u201d when one is comfortable. I think your problem with the \u201cawaking\u201d process, is being around people who don't understand you, don't comfort you. It's better to be around good vibes, and good vibes include comfort. If you are not commonly around good environments you may reach these dull-like phases. ",
