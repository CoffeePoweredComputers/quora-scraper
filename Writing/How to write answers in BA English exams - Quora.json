            "answer_text": "Writing answers in Ba Hons English can be pretty tough if someone doesn't know the pattern. When you start jotting the answer, make sure that you mention the poet/author of the concerned answer in the first paragraph. You also need to mention his educational qualifications, achievements. The second paragraph should be concerned with the book or the poem. You require to give a brief explanation of the same. The characters, theme, the figure of speech and what does it convey.

            "answer_text": "I believe the priority before yo start preparing an answer for English literature is that you know the topic or the theme to it's shred. Second, understand the question that has been asked. Writing down all the details you know in a haphazard manner will not fetch you good remarks or score. You need to address the question along with the needful details. Or use the details in such a way that they advocate the answer to the question. Third, a big no no for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. You can't do that in your exam being a student of English. It's like doing calculation mistakes in your mathematics exam. Try to use good vocabulary that substantiates unnecessary long sentences. Fourth, make sure your answer is properly organised into introduction, body and conclusion. Conclusion is an absolute necessity for any kind of answer. It leaves a bad impression of carelessness without a proper conclusion. Fifth, your points that suffices your questions must be coherent. So that the examiner can trace the structure of your answer. Coherent writing is a mark of good writing too. PS: Don't be hasty, mark out the main points well for each question and work on those. You will do good. Best! ",
