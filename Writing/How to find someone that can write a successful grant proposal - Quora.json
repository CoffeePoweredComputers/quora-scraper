            "answer_text": "Speaking as someone who\u2019s written more than a few\u2026 There are plenty of folks who specialize in grant & proposal writing. For non-profits, check with your nearest Foundation Center Library - they might be able to refer you. For government contracts, try contacting the APMP (Association of Proposal Management Professionals).But\u2026 success has as much to do with substance & sales as proposal writing. Yes, organizing & presenting well is critical to receiving high evaluation scores. But\u2026 if your proposal doesn\u2019t align with the funder & solicitation, if it isn\u2019t substantive, if you\u2019re sending your proposal in cold (they have no idea who you are, you\u2019ve never talked with them, you\u2019ve never vetted your concept with them), don\u2019t even bother submitting a proposal. For foundation grants, more often than not, if they haven\u2019t explicitly asked for a proposal, you\u2019ll be dead in the water.Someone can write a proposal for you, but you (or key people) have to be seriously involved. You\u2019re selling the people & the project, the proposal is just a vehicle - so you need to be reflected in the proposal, and that takes time. It\u2019s also important that the proposal be worded in the language of your field & funder (e.g., when I write an R&D proposal to the Army, the reviewer had better feel sand between their toes) - that requires both intimate knowledge of the customer, how they think, and the language they use, as well as intimate knowledge of your subject area - a hired writer can organize & polish, but a lot of that has to come from you.Nobody can guarantee success. It\u2019s a statistical game. If you win one in four proposals, you\u2019re doing well. You have to play a long game.",
