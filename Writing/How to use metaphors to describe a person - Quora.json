            "answer_text": "A metaphor expresses a similarity in a characteristic between two items. To use a metaphor to describe a person, you must first choose what descriptive characteristic of the person you wish to emphasize - to use in the metaphor. For example, is the characteristic strength? \u201cJohn is as strong as a lion.\u201d [A lion is universally regarded as a strong creature.] Is it wisdom? \u201cMary is as wise as King Solomon.\u201d [King Solomon was renowned for his wisdom.] Is it a lack of personal hygiene? \u201cPaul smells like a skunk.\u201d [A skunk that has released its scent smells\u2026well\u2026smelly.] An excerpt from the Wikipedia article on \u201cMetaphor\u201d follows immediately below, and a link to the entire article follows that excerpt. _________________________ A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly refers to one thing by mentioning another for rhetorical effect. [1] It may provide clarity or identify hidden similarities between two ideas. Antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy and simile are all types of metaphor. [2] One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature is the \"All the world's a stage\" monologue from As You Like It: All the world's a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances ...\u2014William Shakespeare, As You Like It, 2/7[3] This quotation expresses a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage. By asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the behavior of the people within it. _________________________ Metaphor - Wikipedia ",
