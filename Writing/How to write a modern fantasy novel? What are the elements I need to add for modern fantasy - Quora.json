            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s less about adding the modern world to Tolkienian fantasy\u2014it\u2019s either adding fantasy to a modern setting and its storyline, or starting with a concept that already combines the two. Like any writing, the less sure you are what to write about, the less likely you\u2019re ready to write anything yet. Most suggestions here say to start by reading heavily, and that\u2019s as much to find a style or idea that speaks to you as to see how it fits together. Some contemporary fantasies have been strictly ordinary coming-of-age stories, except that the protagonist is dealing with being a witch; some have been murder mysteries where the detective is secretly a demon (the detective, not just the killer; that would be horror). And those are the simpler models; there are many more that aren\u2019t as based on any other kind of story. Mainly, writing a modern fantasy needs good storytelling overall. Whatever parts of the modern world you use, use them to make the effect you want. Archeologists digging at an ancient site could capture a real scholar\u2019s sense of wonder, or the locals\u2019 fear at having their town overrun by city folks\u2014and you play that off the strangeness of what they unleash. A detective trying to police the wizard underground and the secret labs they work for should have a sense of how secrets and industrial spying works in the city. And like any fantasy, the magic and monsters need to be designed to fit the story\u2014the more unique and exciting the better\u2014and handled clearly enough that they don\u2019t contradict themselves. And most of all, the characters and their trials have to connect with the reader. It\u2019s a story. You can read how fantasy works with a modern setting, but most of all they have to make it work as a story. ",

            "answer_text": "As with anything writing-related, you have to read within your genre to understand what works and what doesn\u2019t. My recommendation? Read the Dresden Files. It\u2019s about a modern-day wizard who helps the police solve crimes that were committed using magic. It\u2019s got potions, faeries, vampires, a mystical land of foul creatures, rites, rituals, spells, magic symbols, a White Council of grumpy old wizards enforcing magical rules, an air spirit living in a skull, and much, much more. Another place to look would be Hellboy, both the comics and the movies. Those are classic examples of modern urban fantasy. ",

            "answer_text": "You really need to immerse yourself in the novels of this genre before you start writing in it. It\u2019s a complex genre that has too many intricacies to list. I would suggest reading, Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, The Mercy Thompson series by Patrica Briggs, The Jane Yellowrock Series by Faith Hunter and go from there. Even Twlight has some elements that could be useful, if you\u2019re willing to deal with the story as a whole. As any writer will tell you, the best thing you can do is read. Good Luck! ",
