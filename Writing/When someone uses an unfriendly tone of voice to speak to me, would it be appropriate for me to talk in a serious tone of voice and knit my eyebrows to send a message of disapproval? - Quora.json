            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve observed that when a person is rude, terse and altogether unfriendly, others go out of their way to kill that person - with kindness. Typically the rude person has a microscopic power advantage over others. For example, they might be the spouse of a teacher but not the actual teacher. It could be a co-worker with more experience, but not a boss. Or a customer in a store addressing the service person. Typical conversation; \u201cDo you know how to file this paper or am I going to have to do that too?\u201d Typical response \u201c yes I know how to file, in fact I won a filing competition four years in a row! (Big smile) In fact it\u2019s already done\u201d. More effective response, the one rude people seldom hear (lower voice, knit brows) \u201dare you under the impression that you have been doing more work than me?\u201d Here\u2019s another; \u201cI take my break at 11:00, so don\u2019t wander off and disappear or the phones will go unanswered.\u201d Typical response \u201cI\u2019ll be glued to my desk!\u201d along with a good natured laugh. More effective response (lower voice; knit brows) \u201cI don\u2019t wander off, nor do I disappear. Just be back by 11:15 when I\u2019ll take my break\u201d. Mean people are only nice to people who don\u2019t put up with it. They seem to follow some kind of animal like dominence code. For some reason the knee jerk reaction to rude people is overwhelming kindness, or a cajoling peacemaking effort. Forget it, play by their rules and set your boundaries. They will love you for it. ",

            "answer_text": "NO. Here are some words of wisdom from 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene. \u201cBy acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is often made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.\u201d \u201cThe best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to oblivion by ignoring it. If it is impossible to ignore, then conspire in secret to do away with it, but never inadvertently draw attention to the bothersome insect that will go away or die on it\u2019s own.\u201d  Great video summary of Law no. 36 by illacertus.
