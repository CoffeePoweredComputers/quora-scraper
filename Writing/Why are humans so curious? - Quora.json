            "answer_text": "Yes... \"What?\" makes us curious.  As do \"Where?\", \"Why?\", \"Who?\", and \"How?\"  Actually, the human brain is hard-wired to solve puzzles.  As a visual facilitator, I use the power of productive cognitive dissonance to help delegates at conferences engage with the material speakers deliver.  They see a part of my picture forming on the screen behind the speaker as he or she talks.  Their brains CRAVE a solution to what the part of the pic will become. Their curiosity is activated. The picture resolves. Their brain gives them a dose of reward hormones, along with a sense of pleasure.  There are three ways curiosity can be resolved: 1. Give up. This happens when the problem is too difficult, or too disconnected from the person's everyday terms of reference. Humans HATE giving up. It's a negative feeling. When this happens, they generally hold a resonant grudge against the thing that made them give up. Think of kids who do badly in maths at school. They hate maths as adults.  2. Solve the problem easily. If I say, \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\", chances are, your brain grapples with the question for a fraction of a millisecond, and lights up with the answer, \"To get to the other side.\" There's a small amount of reward in it for you. A little \"fix\", so to speak.  3. Solve the problem with a certain amount of dedicated effort. Think sudoku or crossword puzzles or building a model plane. The more difficult the problem is, the greater the physiological brain reward is (given that the solver doesn't give up). There's a sense of ecstasy in this kind of thing.  Operant conditioning works best when rewards are intermittent.  So, if we fail a few times at solving a problem, and we get a small reward most of the time we get it right, and we occasionally get a really huge reward for a really difficult problem, the operant conditioning propelling us to curiosity is perfectly tuned.  As it happens, that's exactly the right pattern. We're conditioned by our addiction to brain hormone rewards to be curious. Don't you think? ",

            "answer_text": "A2A I believe that all people are curious. From the moment we are born we strive to make sense of the world around us. We are born curious. There are some in the world that can't help themselves with their curiosity. The need to constantly ask \u201cwhy\" or \u201chow\u201d is how we get to the bottom of a problem or topic. But what I think it really means is that for some people there is a boredom that occurs when you have worn out all your \u201cwhys\" and \u201chows\". And it never really goes away. So how to do solve being bored? You find curiosity in something new. ",
