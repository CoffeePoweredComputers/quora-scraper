            "answer_text": "Unethical ones. Ones that want to part you from your money and play on your desire to be published. A traditional publisher will not do this. A traditional publisher will work with you and your manuscript to create the best book possible, and they will pay for the editing, production and printing. They will then pay you some money - usually based on the number of your books they sell, but sometimes a flat fee instead. It may not be a lot of money if you are an unknown author. But you should come out of the deal having made at least something out of the transaction, however little (many authors claim - with some jusification - that they could have made more working in McDonalds, but then they do have a book to show for it at the end of the process). Any publishing deal that actually makes you poorer is not a good deal. Don\u2019t deal with companies like this. It only encourages them. ",

Others may let you buy as many copies as you want at \u201cauthor\u201d prices plus tax and shipping. When I self-publish my books I usually get several printed proofs and these usually have problems. I give some away to people I know and if by some strange chance I ever become a \u201cfamous\u201d author those books would be worth a fortune to a school as an example of editing and proof reading.
