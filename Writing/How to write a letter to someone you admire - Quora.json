            "answer_text": "Note: The original question details indicated that this question was specifically about writing to a CEO. If the intent of the letter is to thank the CEO for inspiring you, here are a few suggestions: Keep your letter brief and to the point. Most CEOs are very busy and will appreciate that you respect their time.Use facts and not emotions to tell your story. This will reduce the suck-up factor.Write in an informal, conversational tone. Instead of writing \"You demonstrated superior leadership abilities,\" write \"I think you are a great leader.\"Write as if writing to a friend, but don't cross any boundaries.Avoid slang and profanities. The CEO may use these in private conversation, but you should not assume that it\u2019s OK for you to do so.Think carefully before suggesting some form of in-person contact. There are instances of CEOs attending high school graduations and Bar Mitzvahs at the request of \"fans,\" but most overtures of this sort are inappropriate and might even be perceived as creepy.Avoid political and other potentially controversial topics. You are writing this particular letter to thank the CEO for inspiring you, not to inflame this person.Don't be self-deprecating. Be confident and have pride in who you are and what you have accomplished, if you choose to mention these things in your letter.You refer to a \"letter\" vs. an email. If your intent is to handwrite an actual letter, it adds a personal touch and demonstrates your sincerity. And it might increase the chances that your message gets read.You can call or email the CEO's office and speak to someone on his/her administrative staff to determine the best channel for this kind of communications. Remember these people are just as busy as the CEO, so respect their time and don't be pushy. There is some risk with this approach as it might also seem like stalker behavior.Have a friend review your letter before send it.Spellcheck.Spell the CEO's name correctly.Do a Google News Search on the CEO and the company to make sure you are not sending your message at an awkward time for the CEO, or one during which the CEO might be inclined to ignore such a message. (Like the weeks before quarterly earnings, after the announcement that the company is involved in a merger or acquisition, etc.)",
