            "answer_text": "As others have already pointed out, improvement comes with the doing.  If your goal is carrying on fluent conversation in English, practice with other learners as frequently as possible, listen to movies or television shows to hear how native and ESL speakers do it, and study the grammar enough so that you are clear how the parts of speech operate in English where they are notably different from your first language.   For writing, the grammar is of even more importance.  Unlike in speaking in live conversation, a reader can not use the visual cues of facial expression and gesture to help along the flow of language.  Absorb the oddities of how English has come to be spelled (and have fun laughing at why they are) and learn how word order can be manipulated in some ways and not others.  Because English has absorbed words from so many other languages, learning vocabulary is a lengthy process, but reading a lot of standard English, especially in newspapers and other periodical publications, will give you a good idea of what you need to know and will help you in incorporating all the most frequent words into your writings. It's never a finished process, even for native English speakers.  Our vocabulary continues to grow with new usages and jargon, and older terms drop out of common usage.  With careful planning or even just luck, you may be able to add one or two new words to the English language yourself. ",

About your level, I mean you have to find things you can understand on you level (things that will be a bit challenging, of course).
