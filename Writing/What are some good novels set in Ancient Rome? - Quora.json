            "answer_text": "Robert Harris' Cicero series:  Imperium and Conspirata are pretty good and stick fairly close to the times.   The upcoming Dictator. which comes out this month I think,  will bring the events up to Caesar's dictatorship.   His Pompeii  didn't work as well for me but is still not a bad read. Steven Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series  is a sort of Dashiell Hammet in Rome detective noir; it's set in roughly the same time period, covering the end of the Republic. Lindsey Davis' Didius Falco series  is also a detective novel, set in the Flavian period so about a hundred years later than Harris and Saylor.  It's less noirish in tone, but good research.  I haven't read her Flavia Albia books, which are set one generation later and have a female heroine, but if they are up to her usual standard they'd be worth checking out. Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series  covers the same well-trodden ground around the last generation of the Republic, but it also covers a generation earlier in the time of Marius and Sulla. It's a bit operatic for my taste but it's a popular series. Robert Grave's  I, Claudius   and Claudius the God  are great if you want a tabloid approach to Roman corruption and debauchery.  His Count Belisarius takes an equally graphic look at Justinian's reconquest of Italy in the 6th century.  The same events are chronicled in a light-hearted time travel context in Sprague DeCamp's novella Lest Darkness Fall.  Iain Pears' Dream of Scipio  is a rare look at the \"decline and fall\" period, bracketed with a modern tale in Vichy France.  ",

            "answer_text": "Lindsay Davis's \"Falco\" detective series are good.  There's a couple of average ones but more above-average, and one or two just excellent ones - and in a series of about 20 books, that's a good ratio.   \"I, Claudius\" by Roberta Graves is about the best there is. I haven't managed to work my way through \"Spartacus\" or \"Ben-Hur\" - I stuck with the movies.  I did get through \"The Robe\" and \"The Big Fisherman\".  Lloyd Douglas.   Mika Waltari also wrote a host of historical novels - one set in Ancient Rome \"The Secret of the Kingdom\" - very readable (as all Waltari's novels are).  He also did a spiritual trilogy of \"The Egyptian\", \"The Etruscan\" and \"The Roman\".  Just excellent.   (One thing - \"The Robe\" and \"The Roman\" both have characters at the crucifixion - surprised they didn't bump into each other).   ",
