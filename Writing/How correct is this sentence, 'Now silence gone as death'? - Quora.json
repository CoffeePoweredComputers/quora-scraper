            "answer_text": "If silence is gone, then there is no silence. Silence that goes away becomes noise. Silence and death are related, as one who has died is silent. You need a verb to make this into a sentence, and I am not sure if \u2018gone\u2019 is the right verb. What are you trying to say? That silence is like death? That silence has become as still as death? (Still meaning having no movement or sound). Are you composing a poem? Now silence has gone still as death\u2026but silence has always been the \u2018going away of sound\u2019\u2014no sound. I am a bit confused. ",
