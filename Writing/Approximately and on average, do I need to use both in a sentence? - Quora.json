Assuming that the wall, which is not truly Trump's wall, follow the same parameters as other walls which exists primarily in Texas and California, it will be built less than 10 feet from the border. There has been some talk in Texas of moving the wall perhaps as much as half a mile from the border in order to allow recreation in the river. I don't know if this is the plan for the short amount of wall that is currently being contemplated or not. ",
