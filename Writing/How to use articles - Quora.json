            "answer_text": "The use of articles is individual to each language, and even to regional variations within languages. For instance, there are differences in how American and British English speakers use them. For speakers of languages such as Russian or Hindi, it can be difficult to get used to the habit of using articles. There are no doubt resources online you could research, but I suggest you simply do a lot of reading and listening of native English speakers and take note of every time an article is used, especially the definite article \u201cthe.\u201d It's probably one of those things best absorbed through exposure rather than a set of rules. It might be better to use written examples, where you can highlight the articles and review their usage easily. ",
