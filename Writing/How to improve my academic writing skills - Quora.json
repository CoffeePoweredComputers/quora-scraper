            "answer_text": "The single biggest thing that can help you while you are writing in school is to have a professor (either Writing or English) go over one of your essays with you. This should be done as early your school career as possible. When I entered a four year university I was no where near prepared for writing at a college level. My essays were not focused and my writing mechanics were very poor. Luckily, my first English class was a class specifically designed to teach academic writing. The college I attended made this class mandatory because so many incoming students didn\u2019t write at a university level. At the end of the first month, our first essays were due. The week prior to the due date we were supposed to peer edit our papers. I was so nervous I was shaking because I knew my writing was awful. As luck would have it, there were an odd number of people in the class. The professor chose a student at random to have his or her essay edited by him. Guess who was chosen. I took my paper up to the professor. I was trembling. He sat there and before he even got to the second page the paper was full of red ink. Finally, he looked up and asked, \u201cDo you even know what a comma splice is? Your paper is full of them.\u201d I sheepishly told I had no idea. I expected a rebuke as I felt I had no business being at a four year school, let alone an English major. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d He went through my entire essay with me and pointed out what I was doing wrong. It was the single greatest thing that ever happened to my writing. 90 percent of what I know about writing I learned in that 15 minutes with my professor. I instantly became a much better writer. I received an A on that paper, as well every paper for the rest of my school career. So that\u2019s my advice. Find a professor (or teacher if at the high school level) you trust, and ask them to go over your writing with you. Most professors would love to do this. ",

            "answer_text": "Reading, writing, feedback, rereading, rewriting, and feedback. Students need something to write about - they also need to analyze texts to see what choices writers make in terms of structure, wording, presenting ideas, evidence and opinions. They get that all from reading. Having them write about something they\u2019ve read gives them focus on the topic and allows them to make choices about structure, practice paraphrasing, question the authors\u2019 biases and conflicts of interest. Feedback should focus on one thing at a time. The first pass should be about how the student communicated the idea, that could mean structure, organization, evidence and support. Once the student is happy that they\u2019ve communicated their idea after a rewrite, then feedback can progress to some other feature like grammar (but focus on just one or two things Subject Verb Agreement and Word forms). The point is to take a process approach that allows the student to focus on one issue at a time. It keeps the student from feeling overwhelmed by failure and reduces the marking load on the teacher.
