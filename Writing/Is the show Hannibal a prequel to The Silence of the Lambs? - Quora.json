            "answer_text": "Hannibal (Harris novel) - Wikipedia Hannibal is a novel by American author Thomas Harris, published in 1999. It is the third in his series featuring Dr. Hannibal Lecter and the second to feature FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling. The novel takes place seven years after the events of The Silence of the Lambs and deals with the intended revenge of one of Lecter's victims. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 2001, directed by Ridley Scott. Elements of the novel were incorporated into the second season of the NBC television series Hannibal, while the show's third season adapted the plot of the novel.  Hannibal Rising - Wikipedia Hannibal Rising is a novel by American author Thomas Harris, published in 2006. It is a prequel to his three previous books featuring his most famous character, the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The novel was released with an initial printing of at least 1.5 million copies and met with a mixed critical response. Audiobook versions have also been released, with Harris reading the text. The novel was adapted (by Harris himself) into a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Peter Webber. Producer Dino De Laurentis implied around the time of the novel's release that he had coerced Harris into writing it under threat of losing control over the Hannibal Lecter character, accounting for the perceived diminished quality from Harris' previous books. so rising is the prequel. \u201cI\u2019m having an old Friend for dinner\u2026\u2026fly fly fly\u2026.\u201d the tv series is based on all of the books in the \u201cCanon\u201d\u2026 imo gf ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. It involves many of the same characters and is technically set prior to the events of \u201cRed Dragon\u201d, which itself is set before \u201cSilence of the Lambs\u201d. But it goes off on its own into storylines that have only a glancing connection to either of the Harris novels. Mads Mikkelsen\u2019s version of Dr. Lecter is very different from Anthony Hopkins, and I find his take on the character actually more compelling, although Hopkins was far more disturbing. ",
