            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, there is no standard for line spacing for manuscripts. There is only what is common. Most dialogues do receive far greater line spacing than a traditional business document, but this does not directly mean double-spacing. This line spacing typically ranges from 1.5 to 2, while business documents are typically only 1.15 for line spacing. It\u2019s a good idea to check out your clients and competitors in your specific industry to find the norm. Then setup a good template for yourself in Microsoft Word and you\u2019ll never have to worry about spacing again. ",
