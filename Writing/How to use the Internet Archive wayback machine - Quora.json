            "answer_text": "Wayback Machine is a great tool which allows you to see how your competition has changed and allows marketers to access petabytes of archived web pages. By sifting through Wayback Machine\u2019s extensive database, you can track the evolution of your competitor\u2019s brand and web presence, taking note of factors such as changes in UX design or differences in copy from one web version to the next. Still, you shouldn\u2019t implement something just because your competitor is doing it, whether that\u2019s designing a website a certain way or using specific copy or images. This is especially true for larger websites like Amazon, which have much more leeway with search engines. Thanks to their numerous, highly skilled staff, they can test small changes and measure results with a high degree of accuracy. If used correctly, Wayback Machine has some interesting lessons to offer any company. Take a look at these two screencaps of Title Boxing. The top picture is a screencap of Title\u2019s homepage from Wayback Machine, circa 2007, while the bottom one is a screencap from 2016.  Image Source: Wayback Machine  Image Source: Title Boxing The differences are pretty clear. In 2007, the web layout was much more cluttered and crowded, with small, hard-to-navigate sidebars squeezing some small, insignificant-looking pictures in the middle advertising daily specials. In 2016, however, the user experience is much more streamlined. Visitors are greeted with a clear, easy-to-use sidebar at the top, labeled with categories like \u201cGloves,\u201d \u201cPunching Bags,\u201d and many more. A large, sliding image in the center replaces the tiny, hard-to-notice ads from 2007, allowing buyers to see exactly what is on sale. The new website is almost minimalist, doing away with the previous confused, slightly chaotic format. Clearly, Title has come a long way when it comes to UX, testing their changes and eventually settling on this new, simpler design. Still, it\u2019s very likely that plenty of testing, design and redesign was put into this process, which is clear when you track their changes through Wayback Machine. Be strategic about your changes, test them thoroughly, and examine how your competitors\u2019 websites have evolved with Wayback Machine. ",
