            "answer_text": "They are both correct, but they both lean toward being an archaic useage. Using little as an adverb, to say \u201cI little knew about that\u201d, is the more archaic of the two, because it reflects a language seen pretty much only in far older literature, perhaps even poetic, older literature. I can\u2019t give you a specific quote, but my mind\u2019s ear hears \u201cI little knew\u2014-\u201d as emoting Emily Dickinson. So far as \u2018I knew little about that\u201d, in today\u2019s style we would be more likely to say \u201cI knew a little about that\u201d, or I knew just a little about that.\u201d There is nothing necessarily wrong with archaic or outdated useage; it isn\u2019t uncommon to use it for effect, for emphasis\u2014-but it does sometimes strike the ear of the listener in an odd way.
