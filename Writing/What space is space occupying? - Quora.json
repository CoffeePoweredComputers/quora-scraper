            "answer_text": "This is more of a philosophy question than a scientific question. It would be like saying what was here before time. You are assuming that space needs a place and that this void , lacking structure gives purpose to our universe. Something without cause giving cause and effect to our physical universe. Now that evolves into a religious philosophy question. This entity would be shapeless, weightless and without form and yet have the ability for creation and form physicality. Amazing and yet billions of people think that to be the case. In fact because of a lack of a scientific answer all religions on Earth say it\u2019s the only way to attribute the reason for everything. This inquiry can only be answered using intuition with a dash of the need for a sense of purpose and this should only be done on a individual bases. ",
