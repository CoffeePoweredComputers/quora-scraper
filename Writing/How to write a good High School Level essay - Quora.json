            "answer_text": "Brainstorm ideas to support your thesis. Make sure that you have enough meat in your thesis to support an entire essay. If you can't find enough evidence in your brainstorming session to support your essay, rethink your thesis. Here are two brainstorming techniques. Try clustering. Write your thesis in the middle of a blank sheet of paper and draw a circle around it. Every time you think of an idea to support it, draw an arm off of the center idea and write it out. Try freewriting. Write your thesis at the top of a piece of paper and write down whatever ideas come to your mind. Don't think, just write.Here are the The Don\u2019ts of Academic Writing for you.",
