            "answer_text": "Arrogant ones. I met one of my favorite authors around five years ago. This guy (who will remain unnamed because he\u2019s such a douchebag) had been my idol at one point. I remember selling my modest books at a booth directly across from him during an Indie book fair in Harlem some years ago. His fan base was so large that he sold out of all his books within 30 minutes! I was floored. His success was so impressive as he began as a self-published author with no agent or large publishing house. Fast forward ahead five years or so, I had run into him again at an author conference. One aspiring writer had gotten close enough to ask him for advice. Right in front of everyone, he started yelling at the author about how he doesn\u2019t \u201cgive advice for free.\u201d That he only talks to other authors \u201conce they\u2019re established.\u201d And that the author should just \u201cgive up and move on.\u201d He\u2019s not alone in his arrogance. Many popular, highly paid authors (not all), have ignored requests from fans, pissed off bookstores at signings and just carried on like divas. I never bought any more of his books or supported him in any way. Trust me, kindness goes much further than being an A*hole. To date, his popularity has declined. Ah-ha just deserts for such a jerk.

            "answer_text": "Authors of books that are considered sappy who suddenly make it big. I think of a book like Bridges of Madison County. (Like really, mom mostly cheats on Dad and the kids read her diary and think how wonderful it is? Come on.) Writers don\u2019t like authors who manipulate the reader. There are plenty of bad writers out there, lots of crying in romances is just awful in my book. That said, I have a friend, Jeanne Dickson who writes Christian romance and really does it well. I know other romance writers who are really good. In general, genre writers, writers of fantasy etc. get low grades. That doesn\u2019t mean they are all bad, it just means that too many use plot driven means when serious authors insist on character driven work. So that\u2019s my two cents on it. ",
