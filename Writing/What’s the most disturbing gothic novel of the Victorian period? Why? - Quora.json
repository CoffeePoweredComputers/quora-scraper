            "answer_text": "The most salient feature of gothic horror is dread. Dread is not surprise or suspense or gore, it is an anxiety that one's deepest fears are somehow threatening to emerge from their secret places and confront the world we have built up to protect us from them. In the Victorian era, the science of Newton and Darwin, and the reason of Locke and Erasmus had come up to stave off the horrors of plagues and demons and the excoriating guilt of sinful life. Gothic horror is often situated in the ruins of the past. Like Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist of the 1960\u201370 decade, the banality of demonic horror reminded readers (and viewers) that the devil still exists. The only gothic tale of novel length that comes close to this soul-chilling dread in Bram Stoker's Dracula. He mocked innocence and bravery, faith and love. Stoker's technique of writing Dracula as a series of letters had the effect of immediacy and verisimilitude like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activities. In both films, it wasn't the danger as much as a growing realization that the supernatural world was indeed reachi g out of the history of our unconscious to plant the icy fingers of death's inevitable judgment on us apostate postmodern sinners. The 1931 film, Tod Browning's Dracula, looks like a joke in 2018, but it slapped Great Depression viewers with an indictment of their complicity in the Roaring Twenties. When Bela Lugosi kissed a man's neck and sucked his bodily essence, the Catholic Film Board went crazy. That's another deep, deep dread that Mary Shelly's friend Dr. Polidori found in his own 1813 brain, and Bram Stoker launched in 1897. To allude to another great film, the greatest horror of the scientific age is thinking that evil doesn't exit. ",
