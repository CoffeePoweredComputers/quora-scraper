            "answer_text": "Original question: How can I check plagiarism with accurate results? Is it possible to get a crack version of Turnitin? So if I understand your question, you are asking for a way to steal software so that you don\u2019t get caught stealing someone else\u2019s work? I am always dumbfounded by the idea that someone needs to check to see if their work is original or copied. The whole point of plagiarism detection software like Turnitin, is so that the teacher (that is, not the author) knows if someone is copying work. The author of the work knows if they copied anything, and if so, if they provided the proper citation/attribution. So, I\u2019ll make it simple. If you don\u2019t want to get in trouble for plagiarism, then don\u2019t copy anything. Use your own words, your own thoughts, your own ideas, and properly cite any quotes that you use. It\u2019s that simple. Using someone else\u2019s words OR ideas, without proper citation/attribution is plagiarism. It is stealing. If you reword a sentence, but it is the same basic idea, then it is NOT yours. Cite your source. If you paraphrase, with your own words, then it is not a quote, but it is still a source that needs to be cited properly. Anything, this is not your original idea that you use, must be properly cited. It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally plagiarize. There are very long odds against you coming up with the same idea, in the same way, with the same focus, as someone else. My point, instead of worrying about IF you are plagiarizing, spend that time thinking and writing something from your own thoughts and provide proper citation of ideas that you used to create your idea. Its NOT that difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "While I'd agree with another answer in theory - I'd add that I've seen Turnitin render false positives for plagiarism - with disastrous results for one of my student advisees. A student who cited her paper quite properly - was accused of plagiarism by Turnitin - though that student wrote for a psych class at a Pennsylvania college and Turnitin claimed she had plagiarized from a high school student's psych paper- in Wisconsin. Both students had heavily used - and properly cited- information taken from the same Intro to Psychology textbook - and Turnitin noted the similarity of the frequent quotes and deemed the more recent paper to be plagiarized from the existing paper in its data bank. The happy ending would be that the course professor read the Turnitin report and realized it's a glitch in the program. But on reading the word plagiarism rational thought shut down and Turnitin ruled the day - no one would hear the student or me out and she was awarded an F in the class and placed on academic warning. For plagiarism she did not commit. So - for whatever reasons you might want it - you supposedly can't get an individual account to Turnitin but Student hub and Moodle are words that come up if you want to try to access Turnitin on your own and Scribbr is some other plagiarism checker - ",
