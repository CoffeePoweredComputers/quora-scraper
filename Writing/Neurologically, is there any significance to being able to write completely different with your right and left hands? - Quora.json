            "answer_text": "I am ambidextrous and my handwriting is quite different when using both hands. I was born left handed and in high school start using my right hand in everything. I am able to write my first name using the left hand and write my last name using the right simultaneously. I tried a simple sentence to write on both hands at same time but no sucess, yet. Since we have 2 hemisphere, neurologically each hemisphere has its own role for the whole brain to function, even a simple as handwriting. It proves that brain is malleable. ",
