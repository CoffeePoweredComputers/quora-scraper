            "answer_text": "It comes down two ways: You pitch them a book and if they smell the money and there\u2019s a possibility of someone else taking it, they will offer an advance agains future earnings. So let\u2019s say they offer you $10,000 advance. After everything gets signed, you, but most likely your agent, receives a check for $10,000. The agent will have it in a special account, will extract their 15% maybe 20% depending on the agent and the deal. He will then send you either a check of a money transfer. You won\u2019t get another dime until your book sales break the $10,000 level. Then you\u2019ll get royalty payments every quarter. Or you can get a deal for royalty only. in Which case you start earning money with the first book. ",

My agent got 15%. The advance is against sales, so until I had sold about 7000 copies, I was still in the red. That is over, and I get a royalty check twice a year. My royalties were structured as follows. 8% on the first 5000 copies, 10% on the next 5000 copies, 12% on all copies sold after that. My agent gets 15% of the royalties. ",
