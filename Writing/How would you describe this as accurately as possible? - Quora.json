            "answer_text": "I assume you are looking for more than \"it's an overhead projector\", which would be enough to describe it for anyone over the age of about 35. The longer version is that it's a mechanism for projecting written material on transparent acetate sheets onto a screen or wall. There's a flat glass plate for the transparency, with a light source underneath. Above that is an arrangement of two lenses and a 45 degree mirror, supported on a vertical bar and adjustable to set the focus and level of magnification. That arrangement re-inverts the image, allowing the transparency to be the right way up for the presenter - or for the presenter to draw his presentation in real time using felt tip pens. These were very widespreadin business and education  20 years ago, but have now been almost entirely superseded by digital projectors fed by computers. ",

            "answer_text": "It's an over head projector. You place a sheet of transparent plastic film on the horizontal surface and it can project the material written/printed on it in a magnified manner. As a high school student in India we used these all the time and thought it was pretty cool then!Thanks for the A2A. ",
