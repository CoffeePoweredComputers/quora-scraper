            "answer_text": "there is not separate way to learn to script using python. Once you are able to program in python all you have to do is to look for libraries that you need in order to run your commands. The os library is pretty useful allowing you to run you linux commands. also the requests library is pretty useful in cases where you are required to get information from an api. These libraries are pretty much all you will need to write automation scripts. ",
