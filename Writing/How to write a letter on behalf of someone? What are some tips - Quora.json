            "answer_text": "In this era of fake news and avatar identities, there is a number of key points concerning the proxy writer and the subject, which the former must cover to ensure the reader takes the content seriously. 1: Who is the subject for whom the letter is being written? The data must cover if they are aware of the letter being written (they\u2019ve granted permission to do so) and why they cannot write the letter themselves. The most common reasons are - underage (minority), illiteracy, and disability (physical or mental or both). 2: Who is the proxy-author? The data must include the relationship they have with the subject: work (they are both in the same business, where the proxy is in a more senior position); professional (the proxy-writer is a care-worker, health professional; familial (the proxy-writer is a close family member); legal guardian. Supporting documentary proof, that the proxy-writer is who they claim to be, will be helpful. ",

            "answer_text": "The first rule is BE HONEST. Any other rules are far behind. I\u2019ve written hundreds of such letters. I can assure you that if you stretch the truth, your violation of the first rule will come back and bite you in the butt. Maybe a second rule is this: If you feel you can\u2019t help the person by being honest, don\u2019t write the letter. Period. Those two rules will keep you out of trouble, while helping the person as much as you can. ",
