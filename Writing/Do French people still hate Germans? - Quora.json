            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a generational divide: the (very) older generation (people over 70) still pretty much resent the Germans, any German for WWI AND WWII (and possibly the memory of 1870). For example, Hitler is generally seen as a German native, while he was really from Austrian descent. Also, my wife\u2019s grandmother(s) could not accept the fact she had German friends. People around 70 (they have lived through WWII and the aftermath: rationing tickets for food long after the war was over, reconstruction) have mixed feelings about them. Younger people (under 50) and especially teenagers have more of a positive bias towards Germans and Germany. This has much to do with a steady students exchange program policy (way before Erasmus program), IMO. It also has a lot to do with the simple fact that most Germans one can meet (tourism, business) are clearly well educated, rather well behaved (except during sports events) and so kind as to be on the verge of naive (very \u201cgreen\u201d and overall trusting, \u201cthe world is my oyster\u201d fashion). For example, Angela Merkel\u2019s stance on the migrants issue is something that could never have happened in France: this mix of compassion and real-politik (they need the migrants\u2019 workforce) is something French people and politicians are incapable of. I think Merkel taught everybody a lesson there. Among French hipsters, Berlin is considered one of the places to be these days, along with Berlin- [edit: I meant London] and New York: underground culture, fashion, mainstream culture, it has it all. I would say the average Frenchman hates Germans less than he does Britons these days, and this is mainly due to the Brexit mishap. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. At all.First of all, almost all French cities are twinned with a German city. It began in 1950, after the 2nd World War, and it has increased after the \u201cTrait\u00e9 de l\u2019Elys\u00e9e\u201d, signed in 1963 between the French president Charles de Gaulle and the Chancellor Adenauer. This treaty has made possible a special relationship between France and Germany. Also, I believe that France and Germany have always been the main pillars on which the European Union has developped. This is the political aspect. On a personnal point of view, until recently, I hadn\u2019t been to Germany (even if I reside in the North of France, just 300kms from there), and I started to learn German in middle School, at the age of 13, as a second language. I hated that language as I found it way too difficult. And most students learn Spanish as their second language, as many more people speak Spanish in the world.But at the age of 17, my city organised a free trip to our twinned city in Germany, in order to celebrate the 50th birthday of the twinnage. I had the opportunity to get a German correspondant, and in the following year, we met 5 times in a year, in France and in Germany. I met this friend only through the twinnage process, and it gave me a nice experience of exchanging a culture.  I have another friend of mine, who made herself German friends on a trip in New Zealand! I think the fact that our country are quite close make the things easy. Still, we make some jokes about Germans among my French friends, but I think it\u2019s really incredible how in a century, France and Germany have switched from a burning hate to being the best friends ever. Now I\u2019m really young, but I kept studying German, and I hope I\u2019ll be good enough one day in German to study or to live there! Also, there are special partnershpis made for French and German teens who want to exchange with teens from the other country : https://www.ofaj.org/ ",
