            "answer_text": "Yes, I\u2019ve been a helper and respite care giver to several young folks with both disorders. It is very, very hard on a person and his family. But please don\u2019t conclude that an autistic person has schizophrenia just because his behavior is odd. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he has schizophrenia too. And some with autism have some symptoms of several mental illnesses but can\u2019t be clearly diagnosed with one or the other. They used to get diagnosed with mood disorder NOS, psychosis NOS (not otherwise specified). And a fair number of people with Childhood Disintegrative Disorder also have various symptoms of psychosis. I think I counted 2 out of 8 of the case studies in \u2018When Autism Strikes\u2019 had psychotic symptoms, possibly 3 out of 8 (I\u2019ll recount them, my memory is fuzzy on it). And some studies have found around 30% of people with mild autism will develop a psychotic disorder, though results may vary depending on how people are recruited for the study. Some time ago when Kanner ruled the roost a person had to be rediagnosed without autism if he showed symptoms of psychosis as Kanner insisted people didn\u2019t get autism and psychosis. Even though his own research showed it at a high rate. The truth is that the genetics of the two are very close and many people with autism wind up with other disorders as well. It stinks, but that\u2019s the truth of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we can have anything anyone else can. But interestingly, many decades ago autism was often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. We do experience things differently than others do since our bodies are processing sensory data differently or not at all. I think there is some relationship between the two disorders as well as with anxiety disorders, OCD, and the egocentric disorders (NPD, ASPD). ",
