            "answer_text": "When my coworker screws up, I tend to use the \u201cwe\u201d to soften things and not make it seem like it was his fault and his burden to bear alone. We got it bad as it is with a lazy boss that tries to make us to DO work while doing side business instead of staying at his post at work hours. The \u201cwe\u201d makes it feel like a group effort so that my coworker does not feel left out, and that in many cases, most of the failure isn\u2019t down to one person doing his job badly; and in most of THOSE cases, it\u2019s usually not him, anyways, but my aforementioned lazy boss. You must also understand that sometimes, one\u2019s performance is poor not because of his or her own volition. If you tell me to go somewhere to fix a fridge, and I haul my ass over there like the loyal worker that I am, but you didn\u2019t tell me the fridge model was XYZ which required an entirely different set of tools and equipment and manuals, is it really my own poor performance or yours? On more than one occasion I had to go over my boss\u2019s head and speak to his boss to explain my supposed mistakes. Which leads to the question of whether the subject is a superior or a coworker. Coworkers you include into the team. A superior who makes a mistake you can cover like a coworker. A superior who tries to pass the blame onto you, don\u2019t hesitate to give a rude awakening. ",
