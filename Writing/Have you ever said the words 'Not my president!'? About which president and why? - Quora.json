            "answer_text": "I was a supporter of Tammy Duckworth, Senator from Illinois, when she first ran for the Senate. I contributed a good sum of money to her campaign. Shortly after Trump was inaugurated in 2017, I received a fundraising email from her campaign. The content of the email was about how she would oppose the policies of Trump. I didn\u2019t have a problem with that\u2014officials almost always oppose policies they don\u2019t agree with. The subject line of the email, though, was \u201cNot My President!\u201d I did have a problem with that, especially coming from a sitting US Senator. She lost my support and will not get another dime of money from me. There is not a single president I have disliked more than Donald Trump. I wasn\u2019t crazy about Reagan and not a big fan of a lot of things Bush II did. They all were, and Trump is, my president. To state otherwise is simply not factual and, quite frankly, childish. So no, I have never said \u201cnot my president!\u201d Not even about the guys I didn\u2019t like. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever said the words \"Not my president!\"? About which president and why? No, because it would be delusional. The POTUS at any given point in history is the POTUS whether I like it or not. Now, if you are not a US citizen, then you are correct. I was less than enamored with Obama. I found him weak and far too conciliatory. But as much as I disliked him, he was my president for 8 years. And if you hold citizenship of this country, then it is a simple fact that right now, Trump is your president. You can hate that fact all you want, but saying \u201cnot my president\u201d is, well like I said, delusional. ",
