            "answer_text": "When you start writing, your book is not good. In fact, it isn\u2019t anything. The big question is: is your premise good? With a good premise, any book can be made to work with enough work. The book will never be better than its premise, and it\u2019s the thing you really can\u2019t fix after you\u2019ve started. As you keep writing, as long as you remain confident of your premise, you can fix any problems you have with characters, plot, setting and so on. Every sentence can be polished. Every word can be refined. But is it worth it? Which is to say, is it worth it to you that the book gets taken all the way to where it is finished and polished? If the premise continues to inspire you to take it that far, then it will eventually be good. It won\u2019t actually be good until it\u2019s gone through the final stages of editing and proofreading. But if your premise has enough in it to keep you going, then it may not just be good, it may be great. Sometimes you can start working on a book and just lose interest: at a particular point, you realise that the premise doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s too similar to other premises, or it isn\u2019t big enough to support all the things you want to say. At that point, if you haven\u2019t got anything else, you can grind on with it, and take it as far as you possibly can. There are some real gems which seem to flow from such a process, such as The Red House Mystery, by A. A. Milne. This is never going to be a classic mystery of the Conan Doyle, Christie or Sayers type, and it never set the world alight like Winnie the Pooh, but it seems that Milne wanted to write a mystery, and he kept working on it. It\u2019s genuinely enjoyable\u2014not a classic, but a semi-precious stone which has been lovingly polished and appropriately set. There are also some books where the author cut the story short to prevent it from outliving the value of its premise. Three Men in a Boat is one of these. The original plan was to go right up and back down the Thames. By the time the characters get to a particular point, the book has run out of material. So Jerome K. Jerome cuts the plot short, and the three take the train back to London. CS Lewis (apparently) started many books, and destroyed the manuscripts if he wasn\u2019t happy with them. Some of the leftovers are preserved in the collection The Dark Tower. Those who knew him suggested that many of his ideas were later reused. Certainly we can see the characters in the story The Dark Tower returning in his science-fiction trilogy. Only you can know if your premise is big enough to finish and polish the book to perfection. But even if you abandon it, be assured that it will remain buried deep, and may sprout again at the proper time. ",

            "answer_text": "This is something I struggle with constantly. I tend to write the sorts of things I enjoy reading\u2014otherwise, why would I bother? When I write a finished piece, I let it sit for a while, then I come back to it, and read it again after a couple of weeks. It often feels different, and things which I didn\u2019t notice before definitely become much more noticeable. Then, when I\u2019m really finished polishing, when I think my piece is the very best thing I have ever written and can\u2019t possibly be improved by changing a single word, I send it to an editor. And they will send it back with suggestions, sometimes very significant suggestions, to change it. And I never fail to be shocked by the fact that, when I have made those changes, the piece is better than it was before. It took me a while to swallow the truth of this. How can someone else, who hasn\u2019t poured their own effort, their own soul, into a piece, possibly just read through it once or twice, and then make it better? How even dare they? And yet, truth it is: my own ability to look at my own writing and judge what\u2019s good, and what isn\u2019t, is very unreliable. What\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d isn\u2019t proportional to the amount of effort I have put in; to how much I want it to be good; to how satisfied I feel about it once I\u2019ve written it. Whether something is \u201cgood\u201d or not can only be judged by other people. You are only \u201cundermining your writing\u201d if, when you show your work to others, you ignore what they tell you about it, because you are sure you are right about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Imposter Syndrome is a very real thing, and it is responsible for holding back more would-be successful writers than anything else. Most important is to simply keep writing, and keep reading. Reading well-written pieces will help you ensure that your own words \u201csound right\u201d as you put them down, and the more you write the better you will become. Consider a site like Medium or any other site that pays you for your work, even if it is a trivial amount at first. Simply clicking \u201cPublish\u201d and saying that you are paid for your writing can go a long way in helping you feel like a professional writer. Ultimately, your book is good if you are happy with it. You are the artist, and that word processor is your canvas. The art is your creation; don\u2019t let its value be determined by others. You decide its worth and let those who disagree carry on. ",
