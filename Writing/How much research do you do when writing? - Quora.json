            "answer_text": "An astoundingly pedantic amount. For one novel, where the characters travel from Alaska to the southern United States, I actually used Google Street View to follow along their journey so I could describe the buildings and scenery accurately. I even described the color of the bedspreads in a hotel room. When I\u2019m writing historical novels, it gets even worse, because I\u2019ll be typing along, getting to a dinner scene and it will suddenly strike me that I need to check to make sure every food I\u2019m mentioning was actually eaten during the time period and how it was prepared. I want to know how they dressed from the skin out every day, how they cleaned their teeth and washed, how their laundry was washed, what songs they sang, what slang was popular, how their pets would have lived - details I might not even end up using, but are good to know so I don\u2019t slip up and mention something they wouldn\u2019t have done. I know that readers will never realize or care how much effort goes into it. But I know, and I care. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the book, and how confident I feel in the subject matter. In some of my Christian suspense novels, I might research the setting, such as Juneau, Alaska or Alexandria, Egypt, and more specific items that play a part in the story, but research isn\u2019t a huge part of the story. My recent book on Nikola Tesla, however, which also included some physics in it, found me reading several books before I started writing. I find the research part both challenging and fulfilling. ",
