            "answer_text": "This is purely a subjective experience, however, I shall endeavour to present some facts to you. Writing answers on Quora helps you multifold - first, resolve someone's query which makes you feel great later in the day, second, learn something new everyday in your field of expertise and other domains as well and thirdly, write better answers because the bot is quite a Grammar Nazi (I don't blame it, you need to maintain the standard of content here) so there is no getting away with poorly structured English language. There have been more than one instances where users have complained about ruthless question & answer collapses on the site - so you know that when you write answers, you cannot settle for sub-standard English - this, in itself, is a major step forward to improving your English writing skills. Other ways in which you can enhance your written English is by contributing as much to the Writing category subsets: Creative Writing Stories Short Stories Fiction Writing Poetry Literary Fiction These are just a few to name. From my experience, reading fellow Quorans' answers motivates you to write better as they help set a benchmark for you - to understand the difference between good & bad writing, pick up different styles of writing, learn how to make an impact through your writing, writing to draw views to you answer, etc. Various programs (and badges) such as \"Top Writers\", \"Top Question Writers\", \"Most Viewed Writers\", \"Quora Knowledge Prizes\" have been designed to lure you to better your writing even more. Find some generic suggestions on How can I improve my English writing skills? to learn how to climb through the ranks on Quora.  Hope this helps, Rajat! ",
