            "answer_text": "Yes it will need either a ribbon reel, ribbon cartridge, or some other type ink printing medium, it depends on what it uses.     Usually the top cover will fold or lift to gain access to the ribbon. The ribbon is what goes in front of the striking keys as they hit the paper.  You say it is a T40 but you also need the make too. Often you can get the ink ribbons at office supply warehouses or print businesses. ",
