            "answer_text": "I love ethics as an abstract concept, sort of like astronomy or evolution. But, like astronomy and evolution, ethics have very little impact or effect on human behavior. That\u2019s because there are few rewards for ethical behavior and many, many rewards for unethical behavior. For example, I used to teach at a large university. My dean (my boss\u2019s boss) told us that he expected about 15% of our students to get A\u2019s and about 15% to get F\u2019s. It didn\u2019t matter if I had a class of dimwits or a class of geniuses, the distribution of grades should look pretty much like the normal curve. So, when assigning grades, did I follow my ethical beliefs or my dean\u2019s instructions? Candidly, I liked my paycheck much more than I liked my students. All corporate employees surely understand what I\u2019m saying. ",
