            "answer_text": "Overcoming the Fear of Public Speaking is a topic in which most, if not all, of your audience will appreciate. Any ideas you can offer to them will be well received. You might begin by telling them that voice and clarity are important. One way to achieve clarity is to emphasize the thet sound Of shech word. It may sound odd at first but not to the audience. It will sound very polished. This cannot be stressed enough\u2026.pause! No more than six (6) words\u2026at a time\u2026without a pause. Even less\u2026.than six\u2026.will be effective. All great speakers\u2026.pause. Use a full voice. Think of great speakers\u2026.Paul Harvey, Kennedy, Reagan, Clinton, Obama\u2026.all utilized a full voice\u2026.and paused. I would not write a presentation. You might try writing on index cards some keys words pertaining to each aspect if your presentation. TALK about each word. The main thing professional speakers are doing now is telling stories. If you can tell a story about each word/topic on your cards, your speech will have a better flow. Too, after you written all the words on index cards, try to think of an acronym/word and use that to keep your presentation in order. For example, you may have written on an index card: risk, objectivity, pessimistic, neutral, encouragement and self. Think of the first letter in each word and arrange them to PERSON\u2026.or any other word of your choosing. Use PERSON to keep you on track: P - pessimistic E - encouragement R - risk S - self O - objectivity N - neutral Practice what you will say about each word. NOTE: you are using this to keep you on track, but the audience has no clue. They will just think you are THAT good! You will leave them wanting more! To learn how I overcame the fear of speaking in public, read the ebook, Rise Above: Conquering Adversities on Amazon Kindle. It\u2019s also available online in paperback format. Rise Above All the best to you\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "To write at school, I think the education is the most fitting and good topic to write about. Why because it is a good opportunity to get a clear understanding about the today's education system both to the students and teachers. When we are writing about the education, we have to include both the good and back sides of it, Our basic education system is rigid, rusty and mundane. Among schoolchildren, it hardly evokes an interest that could ignite a scientific spark to carry forward in their lives. I hope you will get a good feedbacks on this subject. ",
