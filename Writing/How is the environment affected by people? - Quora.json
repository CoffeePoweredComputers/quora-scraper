            "answer_text": "There are cultures that live in dynamic balance with their environment for thousands of years. The 700 or so Australian Aboriginal nations were examples, until the European invasion. Nomadic cultures tend not to damage their environment, unless there is a drought lasting decades. However, the invention of agriculture, about 10,000 years ago in the Middle East, and at various times elsewhere, has been destructive. This is because it is far more efficient in producing food, so human populations increase, leading to concentrations of people, and social division where a few rule and exploit most others. This then leads to war, and preventative measures like walled towns. Farming communities deliberately change their environment, clearing forests, replacing grassland with farms, irrigating (which increases salt concentration in the soil, except in places with regular floods like the Nile valley). What is now the Indus desert was once the home of a thriving civilisation. Then a period of drought wiped them out, but their efforts to survive replaced fertile ground with permanent barrenness. This has been the human pattern. There was the \u201cdustbowl\u201d of the American midwest, only a few generations ago. At first, the changes were slow, and local. People could always go somewhere else, at first opening up new territory, then later conquering the locals. This is why Tim Flannery titled his important book \u201cThe Future Eaters.\u201d This is the way an exponential trend works. (Look it up if you don\u2019t know what that means). At first, change is almost imperceptible, then it gradually speeds up until the rate of increase is almost vertical. All exponential trends in nature strike a breaking point, after which the curve falls to below the original zero. It took 10,000 years, but human growth in environmental damage has now passed the breaking points. That\u2019s why we are in trouble in many ways. ",

            "answer_text": "What a question. If an ant crawls across a field and harvests a seed, then that ant has affected the environment. The trees on the island of Hawaii (and all of the other volcanic islands in the world) arrived there as seeds surrounded by bird droppings. Every single movement of every single use of energy or transformation of energy (organic and inorganic) has an affect on nature. Man\u2019s affects look big to a person standing on 5th avenue in New York City, but from the moon you can barely see them. Some of the pre-historic beaver dams could have been seen from the moon if any entity had been on the moon at the time, but most of man\u2019s impacts cannot. Man is a part of nature. Just as there is nothing \u201cunnatural\u201d about a beaver dam (built for the beaver\u2019s own purposes) or a termite mound (built for the termite\u2019s own purposes) or a coral reef (again built for the purposes of the coral); there is nothing \u201cunnatural\u201d about a highway, a hydroelectric dam, or a skyscraper\u2014all of these \u201ceffects\u201d on the environment are simply the result of the free will of natural organisms. Those effects will either survive geologic time (unlikely) or not. Nature doesn\u2019t care one way or another. In the long run all impacts by all the entities on the earth will either be assimilated into the whole or destroyed. ",
