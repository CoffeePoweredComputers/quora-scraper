            "answer_text": "Here is something I stumbled across when reading about German surface raider in world war I and II. Something fascinating happened that is worthy of study. Between 1916 or so and 1940, just 24 years, the shipping in the world went from being almost completely reliant on coal, with some sailing ships and a very few diesel or oil burning ships to primarily reliant on oil, with some coal and very, very few sailing ships. somehow, during a decade and a half, even in the midst of cultural and social upheaval, economic crisis, even in the most remote ports in the world, there was a shift from a huge reliance on coal to a huge dependence on oil! The infrastructure went from thousands of colliers to thousands of tankers in just two and a half decades. The ports went from having mountains of coal to enormous fuel tanks. The German raiders found adequate coal aboard the colliers they captured to keep going during their raiding, often securing so much coal that they scuttled ships they captured with high grade coal because they didn\u2019t need it. Just twenty four years later, when a ship with valuable cargo was captured, but it was a coal burner, they often had to scuttle it because the odds of capturing a collier weren\u2019t all that high. There were political and economic changes. Ships had much more range when using oil burners than with coal. Without focusing on the war, covering that period of change and how rapid it took place would provide fascinating niche reading, and it\u2019s not something most teachers have ever seen or considered, and it could be very impressive.
