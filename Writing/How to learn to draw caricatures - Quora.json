            "answer_text": "I've been drawing caricatures professionally for thirty years or more, and was doing freebie caricatures long before then. It's best first to understand that there are several types of caricaturing, the most familiar being those of \u2018Exaggerated features', and of \u2018political\u2019 and \u2018celebrity\u2019 caricatures. \u2018Exaggerated features' is when the artist makes the sitter's facial features larger and more exaggerated. Early in my career, I soon discovered that if someone has naturally large ears or nose, they were almost always teased about it when they were kids, and for many it was a painful experience. So having those features made even larger by the artist wasn't always appreciated. The advantage for the artist though, is that they don't need to be too accurate in their drawing. But here's the thing; have you ever been unable to recognize a familiar person because they'd suddenly lost or gained a lot of weight? Sometimes they can look so different that they look like a stranger. Well it's exactly the same when an artist effectively adds or subtracts weight from the sitter's faces because of the innacuracy of their lines. Caricarurists also tend to give their sitter's large teeth, which further distorts the accuracy of the likeness. So most times it really doesn't work; I've seen hundreds of examples where the caricature looks nothing like the person. The exception to this is with political or celebrity caricatures. Celebrity\u2019s and politician\u2019s faces are often very familiar to the public, and so the 'stars' tend to stick to a formula of how they look, whether it be by hairstyle or dress. Once a Caricarurist starts drawing these people, others will soon follow suit, and slowly but surely the cartoon images get abbreviated to the point that people recognize immediately who it's supposed to be even if, in reality, it looks nothing remotely like them. A classic example are the latest Donald Trump cartoons; it's suffice to say that putting a ridiculous blonde comb-over with a round orange face and a long red tie, and everyone recognizes it as #45. In the UK, by the end of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, all a cartoonist had to do to draw her was to give her a huge sharp nose, blond hair and blue suit, and there she was. So, what I'm saying is that, in my experience, a caricaturist\u2019s exaggerated facial features, only work with very familiar faces. The style I personally choose to do is the one that originated in the Victorian period and before photographs in newspapers became the norm. There the Caricarurist would draw the actor or politician as realistic as possible, and only mildly exaggerated the figure. The disadvantage with this style however, is that it takes a much higher level of talent (hence the reason that very few do it). You also have to remember that EVERY caricature you draw comes with an expectation, namely, that it actually looks like the person, and that's not always easy to achieve. The hardest people to draw are, perhaps surprisingly, young children and attractive men or women; this is because they usually don't have strong features. In fact I won't draw very young children as they never come out successfully, at least for me. The easiest to draw are the elderly especially those with faces that look \u201clived in\u201d. As others have said before: \u201cpractice, practice, practice\u201d, it's the only way.    ",

            "answer_text": "Here are seven tips on approaching caricature drawing. I hope you find them useful: Being clear about what caricature is: It is about exaggerating some aspects of reality, while remaining true to the original features. So approaching caricature means observing the original closely, being able to copy it, but exaggerating some aspects. Exaggerating: Exaggeration or distortion is the heart of caricature. It should be realistically and purposefully done. Not accidentally. Identify one to three features that can be exaggerated. Moreover, while exaggerating, ensure that the harmony across anatomical parts of the subject is maintained (by and large). For example, if the subject\u2019s nose/nostrils are prominent, you could make them even more prominent. Or the forehead, or hair. Without losing the other proportions like eyes or ears. So it is an exaggeration, but within a realistic range. Recognizing the importance of eyes: Eyes capture and reflect emotion. They have been called windows to a person\u2019s soul. Work on the lashes, eyeballs, eyelids. Consider adding some colour to accentuate. Exaggeration does not always work well here. Work on them so that they do not look unreal \u2013 a caricature should be recognizable \u2013 realistic and also humorous. Choosing a subject and studying it closely: In the beginning pick what interests you or someone you are familiar with \u2013 a friend, a family member, a pet, a celebrity. Later, as you become professional, you may need to work with any subject that is commissioned. Look at several photographs from different angles to study and understand the subject\u2019s features. Strengthening your drawing: This requires close observation of small details like hair, facial expressions, gestures, as well as proportions. Try different angles, ages, and body types. Practice how to simplify and use big shapes. Understanding the line: The importance of line cannot be overestimated for caricaturing. Lines should vary as much as is reasonable \u2013 this will avoid making the image flat. Use hard and soft lines, thick and thin lines \u2013 harder ones for outlines, around the nose, mouth, eyes; softer ones for details facial features. Keep the lines smooth and flowing. Using online and other resources: There is plenty of helpful material available on the web, like video tutorials, guides, books, \u201chow to\u201d, etc. Study at least one or two points every day and practice them. Read and listen, but don't stop with that. After that use your eyes, hands and practice - pencil to paper. Enjoy the journey! ",
