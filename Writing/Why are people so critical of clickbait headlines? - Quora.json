            "answer_text": "I think that there are several reasons people are critical, but also several good arguments for (some of) them. There's the overselling aspect. We've all seen headlines like Blah blah blah ... AND THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! and after you've read it, the biggest life change you've had is that you'll never click on Blahblah's articles again. Once you've been burnt a few times, you feel pretty resentful overall - just like experienced people do with watching infomercials for miracle products. There's the snob (or rather, anti-snob) appeal vision ... people don't want to be seen as having read 31 Ways Your Nose's Appearance Dictates Your Life - they'd rather be *seen* as having read something like Harvard's Study Proves Heredity Is X, Y, Z...blahblah. (Even that one is a little highbrow clicky, honestly!) People don't like to be reminded of their more base instincts or impulses. They're called guilty pleasures for a reason!There's a long history and tradition of certain headlines or ways of phrasing things being respectable and highbrow, and a long history of, well, National Enquirer style headlines. We're taught to trust a headline that sounds one way and mistrust one that sounds another.On the other hand, there are some cases (IMO) where some Clickbait headlines can, despite criticism, be appropriate: Aside from just trying to sell papers and make a buck, the truth is, Clickbait headlines are the one chance in this fast-speedy world (think of the quickness of Tinder swiping, speed dating, etc) to get someone to come in and read an article. We live in a world that is continuously trying to get more efficient, find answers faster, find mates faster, etc. Clickbait headlines are the journalism equivalent of a flattering profile pic for Tinder or a really amazing outfit at a speed dating event. You only have a few seconds to get someone interested, so you need to employ everything you've got to do it.A catchy headline with some elements of clickbait can help frame expectations coming in. You can headline a semi-dry article well and bring people in with it. How AI Is Going To Take Over The World will get people to read and be thinking of this in that frame of mind what might be a very technical, thoughtful piece. But without the catchy, interest piece, not every article, post, or answer is going to get the attention it might actually deserve.We like to share some Clickbait. Think about Upworthy, Buzzfeed, MentalFloss, etc. We like a good soundbite. In a world where a lot of our comms were shaped by Twitter, you need to jam as much meaning into as few words as you can. Clickbait can be like a fine reduction in cooking - full of flavor and punch. Delicious addition or finish to a very solid meal and what sets it aside from every other meal like it.Listicles are the bane of some people's existence online. Seriously. 8 Reasons Everyone Hates Listicles. Etc etc. But the truth is, 'everyone' does not hate listicles. More and more, we like ordered lists. We like bullet points. We like actionable items sorted into smaller pieces that seem easier to handle, manage, or digest. We like these because they're Individually Packaged for Easier Consumption. You see this in those weird bite-size Snickers bags. At first I saw those and had a WTF moment. Was eating a normal-sized snickers too hard? We already had those terribly annoying 'snack-size' and 'fun-size' Snickers. And now even tinier? But the truth is, those tiny ones are easy to eat. You grab a bunch, pop them in your mouth, done. No strings of caramel. No crumbling nougat. Listicles are satisfying in this same way. They're quick and have most of the meat of a longer article, but are much easier to consume rapidly. You can look away and jump easily back in at #3 and continue.Clickbait is always about balancing risks vs payoffs. Some headlines or questions or topics are just so good that even a 'boring' traditional headline will still get views. Some things need a little bit of extra to get them clicked/viewed. It depends on what you need and what you've got, but just like really overselling a product, you might sell out initially, but your brand is dead and you cannot get that trust back easily. Clickbait with some backup or content to support it? I'm on board. ",

            "answer_text": "In my 14 years as a news journalist, I have only ever worked with serious publications, so it may come across as a surprise when I say this: Not all clickbait headlines are bad. Used appropriately (and sparingly), they are a great device that serve to pique interest in a story. At the newspapers I worked at, we\u2019d always look for the one offbeat piece we could squeeze in. On a page packed with mostly hard news, this one story added a touch of lightness, and a \u2018clickbait\u2019-type headline was often the perfect lead-in. From letter-writer feedback, I know that readers enjoyed these too.  As a headline writer, this was a fun part of the job. At one of the publications I was with, we\u2019d carry what we called a \u201cpuff panel\u201d below the masthead on the front page. The alternate term, teaser, used in some sections of the media, is however a more accurate description because that's exactly what it is: a tease. What we\u2019d feature in this panel was simply a headline or two referencing stories inside the paper. Headline writing is an art, and it takes a compelling line to make a reader want to turn to the story right away.  So why do I bring all this up, and how does it tie in to what we understand in the Internet Age as \u2018clickbait\u2019? Isn\u2019t clickbait just a way to get you to read frivolous, overblown stories on a spammy website packed with ads? Well, here\u2019s a little quiz for you: Let\u2019s see if you can identify the subject of this description: \u201cHeadlines that scream excitement, often about comparatively unimportant news\u2026lavish use of pictures, many of them without significance\u2026faked interviews and stories\u2026.\u201d So what\u2019s your guess? Buzzfeed? Gawker? Upworthy? Wrong, wrong, wrong. Try the New York Journal and The New York World , circa 1897, as described by media historian W. Joseph Campbell.   A little bit of history: \u2018Clickbait,\u2019 in one form or another, has existed for a long time. The term may be relatively new, but the idea certainly isn\u2019t. The aim is to draw eyeballs (and sell papers) when the day\u2019s stories aren\u2019t necessarily interesting. There were several ways of accomplishing this. One was by using a psychological ploy that exploited the \u201ccuriosity gap,\u201d [1] an all-too-human trait that makes us want to find out what the headline left unsaid. The less ethical papers also used bait and switch (where the headline has little to do with the story) or inflammatory lines designed to appeal to your darker side. While the more serious press of the time avoided all of these, the two 19th century newspapers I mentioned used them as tools to boost readership. Unfortunately, this was the worst kind of clickbait, because the headlines were deliberately manipulative and the stories often twisted truths or outright lies. This was how yellow journalism originated, and the clickbait headline is very much a part of that history.  (The term \u2018yellow journalism\u2019 itself came from a Simpsons-coloured cartoon character that both newspapers featured and fought over, but that\u2019s a story for another day). The circulation battle between the two papers was fierce, and both went to increasingly desperate lengths to create news where none existed, putting out false stories and using sensationalist headlines to drive up sales. If the worst of today\u2019s clickbait stories leave you feeling deceived, be thankful we are nowhere near as gullible as those early days when dramatic headlines and manufactured stories actually propelled the US into going to war.[2]   When an explosion tore through US battleship Maine in Havana Harbour in 1898, both papers ratcheted up their accusations against the Spanish rulers in Cuba despite there being no evidence they were responsible. (Much later it would be discovered an accidental fire that ignited ammunition stocks on board was the likely cause). No matter. The newspaper headlines fuelled rumours and rage, and the American public demanded action, leading to the Spanish-American War.  Going mainstream In time, the use of \u2018clickbait\u2019 became a little more mainstream, though deployed far more sparingly. My personal belief is that advertising had a heck of a lot to do with it. Think about some of the headlines that have become classics, like this one from 1926\u2014ninety years ago!  \u201cThey laughed when I sat down at the piano, but when I started to play!~\u201d Has a better clickbait headline ever been written? Or how about these from around the same era:   \"How women over 35 can look younger\" \"How to tour the U.S.A. for \u00a335 a week\" \"How 3 of Super Shell's 9 ingredients fight engine noise\u2014including one hard-to-hear form of knock that could lead to real damage\" Would any of these feel out of place on Buzzfeed today? Advertising and journalism share a symbiotic relationship, and the influence of one on the other meant that the clever,  \u2018clickbait\u2019 headline was destined to find its way into the editorial pages. In my time as a journalist I have been regularly exposed to dozens of major international papers and I can think of only two that completely eschewed the use of this technique: the New York Times and what was then the International Herald Tribune (since renamed the International New York Times). Even serious publications like the Washington Post or The Times, London, are not immune. Nor is the BBC.  As for CNN, there are days when the website appears to be overrun with clickbait.  I didn\u2019t even have to search too hard\u2014all of these modern examples are from today\u2019s home pages. The difference between these news organizations and sites like Buzzfeed, Upworthy and Viralnova is that the former do it sparingly and as a way to \u2018lighten up\u2019 a page filled with more sombre, hard news. The latter group prey on our weaknesses, our need to complete the \u2018curiosity gap,\u2019 and pack their pages with clickbait.  Unfortunately, even some very serious websites now subscribe to external revenue-generating story recommendation widgets like Outbrain and Taboola[3], which means the worst type of clickbait headlines are becoming increasingly impossible to avoid. It simply is everywhere. And that may well be why clickbait has earned its special place in hell.
