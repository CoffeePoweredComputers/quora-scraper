            "answer_text": "Writer\u2019s groups are a great way to keep from being isolated. Different points of view - hopefully civilly presented - are offered on each writer\u2019s work. When the group is comprised of unpublished writers I think it\u2019s good to interpret the comments as you would if they came from readers. If there is a general agreement that something isn\u2019t working, then something probably isn\u2019t working. Sometimes new writers cannot adequately offering ideas on what that something is or how to fix it, so the author is left to work it through. If the writer is in a group of published professionals who understand the different genres and the purpose of one of the group\u2019s work, the input will be completely different and probably more actionable. The bottom line is that the the writing group does their best to praise and critique as appropriate but it is the author\u2019s final call as to whether to accept suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "Good criticism corrects our writing flaws, thereby improving our writing skills. Take something like cliche. Tired cliches are almost impossible to see in our own texts: I won't get into why this is, but it's true. When we share our work with others who are not the original author, it's much easier for them to spot such cliches because they are less emotionally involved with the text than we are. Distance brings perspective and another point of view. When someone asks how to write good critique, I'll answer the question with my own opinion. Meanwhile, remember this old cliche: \"Two heads are better than one.\" ",
