            "answer_text": "No, and yes. It\u2019s complicated and totally depends on the story you are telling. For instance, in Romance Writing, there\u2019s a trope called the Alpha A-hole. (You know what I mean.) Mr. Alpha gets what he wants and usually in not so nice ways. But you can\u2019t have him totally obnoxious. The reader wouldn\u2019t like him enough to finish the book. So you must find some way to redeem him to make his actions understandable. This is the quest of the heroine, and the reader gets to go along. Other characters are more complicated and you may spend whole books exploring his personality. While you do that you have to give him something that makes people want to read about him. I write this character, Arekan, who had some bad turns in his life and ends up very cynical. He acts like an entitled ass (well, he is deposed royalty, but he doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s something to brag about) but his cynical observations are often amusing, and he\u2019s whip smart (though he often hides that too.) He has some other good characteristics too, but he\u2019s so arrogant they are easy to overlook. So you first might dislike him but then you get drawn into his struggle to survive and you\u2019re right there with him. And you start to sympathize. With Arekan, despite the, um, critiques of my online writing group, I didn\u2019t censor him or his actions. I just wrote more about him. And as they learned more about his story, they grew to like him. As I said, it depends on the story you want to tell. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I do try to control readers\u2019 impressions of characters in my stories. Well, not control, but certainly influence. Sometimes I deliberately describe a character so as to make readers not like/trust them because that\u2019s how the viewpoint character feels, and I want the readers to experience the situation the same way. \u2018Give them plenty of time to get the wrong impression,\u2019 right? Even giving a bit of description of a character\u2019s physical appearance will influence readers\u2019 impressions of that character. That\u2019s kinda the point, isn\u2019t it? Everything the author tells the reader about a character influences the reader\u2019s impressions. ",

I write real life anthems, if a character is an Addict he is depicted as such, If a character is a Robber, he is depicted as such. The one thing that I as a writer love is the fact that I create these characters and the roles that I assign them, and it is a book of fiction! Although I am sure readers will perhaps have a family member that is an Addict or knows someone that is, A Prostitute, or knows someone that is, A robber, or knows someone who is.. Real Life Anthems and situations that occur in everyday life.. That is the type of Author I am Author Dia Stone ",

Readers can certainly interpret it, but how I write the characters are the words the reader sees. What I don\u2019t control is how the reader thinks and feels about what I\u2019ve written. Once they\u2019ve read it, in a real sense it belongs to them. It becomes part of their experience. ",
