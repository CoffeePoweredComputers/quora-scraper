            "answer_text": "First, the primary source: http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89.9?lang=eng#0\"1 A Word of Wisdom, for the benefit of the council of high priests, assembled in Kirtland, and the church, and also the saints in Zion\u2014 2 To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order andwill of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days\u2014 3 Given for a principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints, who are or can be called saints. 4 Behold, verily, thus saith the Lord unto you: In consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiringmen in the last days, I have warned you, and forewarn you, by giving unto you this word of wisdom by revelation\u2014 5 That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him. 6 And, behold, this should be wine, yea, pure wine of the grape of the vine, of your own make. 7 And, again, strong drinks are not for the belly, but for the washing of your bodies. 8 And again, tobacco is not for the body, neither for the belly, and is not good for man, but is an herb for bruises and all sick cattle, to be used with judgment and skill. 9 And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly. 10 And again, verily I say unto you, all wholesome herbs God hath ordained for the constitution, nature, and use of man\u2014 11 Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. 12 Yea, flesh also of beasts and of the fowls of the air, I, the Lord, have ordained for the use of man with thanksgiving; nevertheless they are to be used sparingly; 13 And it is pleasing unto me that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine. 14 All grain is ordained for the use of man and of beasts, to be the staff of life, not only for man but for the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and all wild animals that run or creep on the earth; 15 And these hath God made for the use of man only in times of famine and excess of hunger. 16 All grain is good for the food of man; as also the fruit of the vine; that which yieldeth fruit, whether in the ground or above the ground\u2014 17 Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks, as also other grain. 18 And all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings, walking in obedience to the commandments, shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones; 19 And shall find wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures; 20 And shall run and not be weary, and shall walk and not faint. 21 And I, the Lord, give unto them a promise, that the destroyingangel shall pass by them, as the children of Israel, and not slay them. Amen.\" It's only 21 verses, so I popped in the whole thing.  Whereas members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe God speaks to people both individually, as well as collectively through Prophets, as he did throughout the Bible, they therefore believe that this \"word of wisdom\" against \"hot drinks\" is the word of God.  That being said, as you see there it's an admonition about \"hot drinks.\"  As you've seen throughout Quora and life, those who search scripture for answers are often up against a wall when it comes to interpreting semantics, especially when God rarely gives reasons for us to derive the \"spirit of the law\" from.  (Compare Jewish debates on whether Kosher was mooted by the advent of the refrigerator.)   So \"hot drinks\" meant coffee and tea to everyone in 1833.  In 2011 we all instantly ask whether that means caffeine.  Interestingly enough, there are all kinds of common answers.  Some Mormons believe it's caffeine, some believe it's tannin, some read verses 4 and 6 to see it as a warning against common nutritional conspiracies (not a warning against smoking, but a warning to stay away from tobacco companies and addictions), etc.  I have a friend who was a missionary in England, and he said most people there as he saw it read the Lord's admonition against \"hot drinks\" as literally referring to the temperature.  Apparently the rate of throat cancer is very high there because of a lifetime of drinking 200 degree tea.  In any case, the whole statement of the church has never gone further than \"coffee and tea,\" and so Mormons have a pretty bell-curve consumption of Diet Cokes and Red Bulls.  Yes, those who believe \"hot drinks\" means caffeine don't drink Coke and do drink decaf coffee, but I'm not sure how common that interpretation is.  And I think all Mormons approve of herbal tea. see http://mormon.org/faq/law-of-health/ for more unedited answers from random Mormons on exactly this question, and if you scroll for \"More Answers\", you'll see there are thousands, probably tens of thousands, of them.

            "answer_text": "The injunction to not drink \u201chot drinks\u201d was part of a dietary code received from God by the prophet Joseph Smith. This is known as the Word of Wisdom. As the name implies, it was not initially given as a hard commandment, but as general advice for health and happiness. Later on, other prophets codified specific aspects of the Word of Wisdom as hard commandments that we must follow in order to be members of the Church in good standing. One of these items was the ban on \u201chot drinks,\u201d which was clarified to mean coffee and black tea. I compare this commandment to the various dietary restrictions given to the Jews of the Old Testament. There are certainly various health benefits associated with avoiding the caffeine that is in coffee and black tea, just as there are benefits associated with avoiding pork, especially in a pre-industrial society in which swine often have various parasites. However, in both cases, the real purpose was to differentiate the Lord's people and give them a commandment that they could follow to test them, teach them discipline, and allow them to demonstrate their faith. When God commanded Naaman to bathe in the Jordan River seven times, it was not because the Jordan River had special chemicals in it that would cure leprosy. It was because Naaman needed something specific to do to demonstrate his faith in God. ",
