            "answer_text": "This is a house style thing. Some organisations italicise titles, others don\u2019t. Our house style is to italicise movie/album/book titles, and names of classical works, but song and poem titles go in quotes. So: Avengers: Endgame, not Avengers: Endgame. Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 9 but Schubert\u2019s \u2018Erlk\u00f6nig\u2019 because the latter is a song. The aim of house style is to be consistent. In formal writing, find out what the house style rules are for whoever you\u2019re dealing with or working for, and follow them. ",
