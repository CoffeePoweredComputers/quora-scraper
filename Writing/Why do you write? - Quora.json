            "answer_text": "I write for a number of reasons. This answer might get a little heavy, but i just needed to get it out of my system so i apologise. Writing means different things to different people. For some, it\u2019s a way to get things out of their system. They write to give their depression a kick in the ass and say \u201cnot today, bitch\u201d, and I can relate to that. People also write because it\u2019s a spur of the moment thing. You could be sitting on a train, but your mind is racing thinking of that Marvel fanficion you\u2019re going to publish later on Wattpad. It helps you through the day and keeps you motivated and thats why people write. I would like to think I\u2019m a mix of both. Recently (okay more like today), I read a book called Every Last Word. It\u2019s about a girl names Samantha who has severe OCD, and how she finds a place for herself and discovers herself through the process of writing poetry. To quote the author, it\u2019s about saying gooodbye too people who have had a huge place in your past, but know they don\u2019t belong in your future. Most importantly, its a story about the healing power of words. (Did I mention I cried my heart out at the end of the story? Well know y\u2019all know. WHEEHEE.) Through the story, I\u2019m reminded about how i write to get things out of my system. I\u2019m not clinically diagnosed with depression, but sometimes i damn well feel like i need someone to talk to but the hard truth is \u2014 sometimes, no one is there. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone with my pain, so what do i do? I take refuge in words. Short stories, which one day i might share with y\u2019all wonderful people on this website. Poetry. Songs. Everything. I centralised my story on my pain and write from there. Writing means something to everyone and to me, it means expressing myself in ways I could never speak out. It means letting my imagination run wild and free with no one there to judged me for being weird and childish. Maybe one day through writing, I\u2019ll discover myself. Just like Samantha did. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do I write? The short answer is that I write because I can\u2019t not write. There are many other ways that I can preoccupy my time (eg. reading a novel\u2014which only takes me a Saturday to do\u2014watching Youtube or Netflix, texting, going out\u2026 you get the picture), but out of all those options I choose to write. Not only because I just have so many ideas that I want to share with the world and I chose writing as my medium, but also because I\u2019d be letting myself down if I didn\u2019t write at least a little bit a day. Four years ago, during my Golden Age of Writing, I wrote every day for hours, to the point where I realized I was hungry only when I got off of the computer. A ton of stories were being created as ideas kept on popping up, sometimes 2 or more in the same week; they never got finished, but the point is that I was writing. Then my stories began to get more complex as I focused on a particular one, I started to think about adding layers to my stories, began working on some full-length novels, and suddenly, I wasn\u2019t writing as much as I had during my Golden Age. I\u2019d been lost in the sea of complication that I forgot to just write. When I reflected on that, I set up my personal goal of writing at least a little bit a day; I write way more than a little bit (especially I now have the time to do so!), but I want to keep pushing myself. Get back to the Golden Age-style practice, while also keeping my modern day complexity. I just write to get better. Another reason (and this is one that I feel is cliche but also very necessary) is that I just love writing. As previously mentioned, I can take care of my time any other way, yet I write. I\u2019ve been writing ever since I was 10 (16 now!) and I feel in love with the freedom, the creativity that I could have while writing. Yes there are rules to abide by, but I can make those rules work for me and my purposes. I love coming up with new ideas (my eyes light up and I jump up and down and get really giddy and happy and excited when I do), finding ways to add twists on old ideas (repeat previous parenthetical), and I even love the editing too sometimes, despite other authors seeing it as a necessary evil. It may be a daunting task and take forever but there are times where I\u2019ve looked over a passage that I wrote and said \u201cwow, this is actually nice.\u201d I\u2019ve also connected with other people through it. Not just through Quora, but I\u2019ve touched base with a lot of people that I honestly consider dear friends because of our creative outlets, whether it be writing, acting, drawing\u2026 I literally just made a plan with some of my coworkers to make an anime one day; I\u2019ll do the script while another does the animations and we already have one person as a voice actor! Not to mention the impacts these people have on you. My writing\u2019s connected me to these foreigners and have made them people that I can trust, that I can and will go to advice for anything about. And is there another reason I write? There are probably a ton of reasons, ranging from \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it ever since I was really little\u201d to \u201cI want success\u201d (which isn\u2019t that big a reason for me since I\u2019d do it for free) to even \u201cI\u2019ve come to far to quit\u201d and \u201cso many people want me to continue writing\u201d. So, to sum this up, I write because it\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s great for me creatively, it gives me more of a purpose, improves my work ethic and make me want to do better for myself, and is just overall really refreshing. It may be hard, but in the end it\u2019s worth it. So long as your heart\u2019s in the writing and you reflect on why you want to write, if you want to write, and what your passions are at least once every few months or so, you\u2019ll do fine. And even if it\u2019s not writing, just find A passion. Find something you love doing and push for it. Good luck! And (hopefully) happy writing! ",
