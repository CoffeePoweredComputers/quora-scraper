You can protect your book simply by keeping a copy of it and storing an e-copy in your hard disk/computer. Make sure that your computer's date settings are set to the proper date (today's date) and then save it. Always when you send something to a publisher, keep a duplicate copy with yourself with the date of creation. That is more than enough for protecting your book from plagiarism/theft. ",
