            "answer_text": "Not usually. In a way it\u2019s like police officers who never have to fire their weapons. I worked as a reporter for decades. I can count the times on one hand the times I was legitimately in danger. I was beaten by a mob once covering a black economic boycott (it was a white mob by the way); well, come to think of it I got beat up two times over the time I covered it; I covered a hurricane and I guess I was in some danger, and covered a crazy guy who had climbed up a railroad bridge and was using a high-powered rifle to hold off the police. I remember needing to crawl - since I was exposed to his field of fire to get to where the police had gathered. So that\u2019s not all that many times for a person who worked as a reporter for many decades. I\u2019d guess my life has been more at danger driving to work and from crazed editors with a violent streak, grin. ",

There are two main exceptions: \u2022 War correspondents (journalists covering combat zones) are sometimes wounded or killed. \u2022 Journalists in some areas of the world are at risk from their own governments, terrorist groups, or organised crime, if they cover stories which cause displeasure. These two links may be of interest, if they\u2019re not duplicating what\u2019s already been offered to you: Committee to Protect Journalists Protecting journalists | Reporters without borders As you can see, the Middle East and Latin America are by far the most dangerous areas of the world for journalists. The average journalist working in other parts of the world is in no more danger than any other white-collar worker, except perhaps in very rare cases when they are covering a violent situation or exposing a violent organisation. But it\u2019s not a factor that most journalists ever need to worry about. ",
