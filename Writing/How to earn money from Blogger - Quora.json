If you\u2019ve ever wondered how to make money blogging, I\u2019ll explain how bloggers make money.You don\u2019t have to be a big blogger who built an impressive company to make money blogging. Necessary steps to make money blogging Whether you are a beginner or have been blogging a while, here are the basic steps for making money with a blog: 1.Start a blog If you want to make money blogging, you must have a blog. The 6 basic steps to start a blog Decide what to blog aboutChoose a blogging platformFind a hostPick a domain nameInstall WordPressDesign & use your blog!Can I start a blog for free and make money? This is a common question and the answer is yes. However, I would caution you against it. The reason is, when you use a free service, you don\u2019t have full control over your blog\u2014the free service you are using does. This can be risky, especially if you will rely on your blog for income. A self-hosted WordPress blog is my recommendation and can be started for as little as $5-$10 a month. 2. Create useful content Once you have a blog, write useful content. Draw from your expertise & experience. Write informative posts and articles about your chosen topic. Make your content excellent. What should I blog about? If you\u2019re stumped, here are ideas for posts readers will respond to: Solve a problemRelieve a fearTeach something newExplain how to reach a goalEntertainIn order to make money, you must have blog visitors. But in order to have blog visitors, you must have content worthy of a visit. 3.Build relationships with others on social media and around the web At the same time you are creating valuable content, start building genuine and sincere relationships with others on social media and around the web. Which social media sites should I use? With so many social media sites, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. My advice is to think about where your target audience hangs out on social media and start there. Is your blog for moms of preschoolers? Facebook and Pinterest might be best. Is your blog for business executives? LinkedIn and Twitter are probably safe bets. Other than being active on social media, here are more ideas: participate in Facebook Groups, comment on other blogs or join forums. Find or start a mastermind group. Reach out to people in your niche by tweeting them. Find people who could use the information you provide. Get to know them, interact, be friendly and helpful by offering no-strings-attached tidbits of your expertise. The word about you spreads best through people who know, like & trust you. 4.Establish a strong platform Keep growing in the knowledge of your craft so the content you produce gets increasingly deep and valuable. Use your blog to get exposure, build authority, gain trust and be helpful. In addition, use this time to think about the type of reputation you want to build. How do you want others to see you? How do you want them to experience your site? What do you want to be known for? This is all part of your branding. 5.Choose your income streams Once you\u2019ve started your blog, created some excellent content, built some relationships and given thought to your branding and reputation, start thinking about ways to generate blogging income. There are many ways you can do this.I will outline 5 main types of income along with many specific ideas for each. Things you should know about making money blogging Much of the money bloggers make doesn\u2019t come from blogging directly. A blog is a platform or online home base. After proving their trustworthiness, bloggers use their blogs as springboards to launch other products & services that bring in income. Examples are e-books, books, speaking gigs, products, e-courses, etc.If you want to make money blogging, it takes time, creativity and hustle\u2014a lot of all three\u2014but it\u2019s absolutely doable.Each blogger has a different combination of income streams. There is no \u201cright\u201d way and that\u2019s the beauty of it. There are endless possibilities. Find a combination that works for you or make up your own.Income streams ebb and flow, so successful bloggers are constantly exploring new ways to make money. The key to making good money as a blogger is to have multiple streams of income. Even small trickles of money coming from various sources over time can add up.The best way to start monetizing is to let it happen organically. Hopefully, you are blogging about something you enjoy. As you grow, monetize (make money) in ways that would most suit you and your audience. Blogging about fly fishing? Sell your services as a fly fishing guide. Blogging about being a preschool teacher? Sell preschool curriculum.If you have any questions, need any help, please go to Youngceaser and contact us for help! Kristiyan ",
