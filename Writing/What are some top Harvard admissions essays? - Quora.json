            "answer_text": "My daughter went to Harvard and is now an interviewer for them. One parent, here on this thread, talks about the competition, and they are right. Everybody at Harvard is a valedictorian, captain of a sports team, brilliant, etc. That is just where you start off... In the essays and interviews, Harvard is looking for what *you* can contribute to Harvard, how will you make Harvard better just by being there. Its a given that you are a scholar-athlete etc. They want a *diverse* student body. The other students are as important to your education as are the professors. So let them know what else you are. Show them who you are. Why should you get in and not someone else? Every one at Harvard is the best of the best (almost cookie-cutter so)...but what makes you unique? But this is not a list of your accomplishments, it could be, if that's what you want to write about, but it doesn't have to be. Pay attention to the topic questions, but don't let it limit you. My daughter wrote an essay called Adventures of Hearing-Girl. It was about her trials and tribulations of learning American Sign Language, mostly about the hilarious mistakes she made. (one instance she mentioned was how she mixed up the sign \"right\" for the sign \"penis\". She thought she had asked the question 'You bowled a strike, right?\", but actually said \"You bowled a strike, penis?\") Her admissions officer later told her he was cracking up reading it, and shared it with the entire office. Her essay showed she had determination to learn a language by sticking with it, even through some humiliating episodes. It showed she had humility by exposing her embarrassing moments. It showed she had a sense of humor and insight. It showed she was accepting of other cultures and peoples. It showed her expressiveness and command of language. The admissions officer knew her character, personality, and passions very well through this one essay. He knew these qualities would get her through Harvard and would contribute to the overall quality of the student body. And that's what they want to see in an essay...who are you *really?* For God's sake...proof read and edit. Let others read it and proof read it too. Mistakes are easily overlooked. ",

            "answer_text": "After I was accepted to Harvard, my college essay was published in the 2017 edition of 50 Successful Harvard Essays, as well as on Medium and Study Notes. The prompt I\u2019d selected was \u201cDiscuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.\u201d I could have played it safe and written about something I had accomplished in high school. Instead, I wrote about reading a magazine.  I was in 9th grade the first time I stumbled upon a copy of Newsweek. What caught my eye was its trademark title: white type, red highlight, a connotation that stories of great consequence lay beneath. Such bold lettering gave me a moment\u2019s pause, and I was prompted to leaf through its glossy pages. To my surprise, I was instantly hooked. A new world unfolded before me. Biting social commentary. World conflicts that weren\u2019t dumbed-down. Piquant reviews of best-selling books, controversial expos\u00e9s of political figures, tantalizing tidbits on pop culture, full-page spreads of Technicolor photographs. And the prose was elegant, sharp, mesmerizing. It radiated sophistication and IQ. As I scanned the credentials of the authors, my only thought was, wow. The articles were written by worldly, ambitious people who were experts in their fields, people with PhDs and MBAs from world-class institutions, people who could write brilliantly, who got paid to give their opinions, who walked with a purpose and ran in the direction of their dreams. People I knew- then and there- I\u2019d like to one day become. This is what education looks like, I told myself. I was young, I was impressionable. Like a child standing on the outside of a candy store, nose pressed against the glass, I hungered to be a part of that cerebral adult world. So I read that magazine from cover to cover. Twice. And with each turn of the page I felt my small-town naivet\u00e9 break into smaller and smaller pieces. I remember that day as an incredibly humbling experience. I had an awkward, self-conscious epiphany: that I actually knew next to nothing about the world. There I was, cream of the crop of my middle school, fourteen years of \u2018smart\u2019 outwitted by a thin volume of paper. I was used to feeling gifted, to getting gold stickers and good grades, to acing every elementary examination placed in front of my cocky #2 pencil. I wasn\u2019t used to feeling like I\u2019d been living in the Dark Ages. At the same time, however, I struggled with another realization, one that was difficult for me to define. I felt\u2026liberated. I felt as though I had taken a breath of fresh air and found it to be bracing and delicious, like it was the first breath I\u2019d ever taken and I\u2019d never known that air was so sweet. Talk about a paradigm-shift: somehow, reading Newsweek had rekindled my natural intellectual curiosity; it had, briefly, filled a hole in my soul that I didn\u2019t know existed. It had also sparked something within me- a hint of defiance, a refusal to accept complacency. One taste of forbidden fruit and I knew I could never go back. Although reading a news magazine seemed like a non-event at the time, in retrospect it was one of the defining moments of my adolescence. That seemingly unextraordinary day set a lot of subsequent days in motion- days when I would push my limitations, jump a little higher, venture out of my comfort zone and into unfamiliar territory, days when I would fail over and over again only to succeed when I least expected it, days when I would build my dreams from scratch, watch them fall down, then build them back up again, and before I knew it the days bled into years and this was my life. At 14, I\u2019d caught a glimpse of where the bar was set. It always seemed astronomically high\u2026until it became just out of my grasp. Sadly, Newsweek Magazine went out of print on January 1, 2013. Odd as it may sound, I\u2019ll always be indebted to an out-of-print magazine for helping me become the person I am today. ",
