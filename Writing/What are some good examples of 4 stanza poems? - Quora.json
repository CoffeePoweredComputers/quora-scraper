            "answer_text": "Here's one from an armchair poet: I have two eyes But still too blind to see All the good and love That appears next to me - For life has dealt me harshly And my vision narrows closed Until only the darkness Swallows the light that showed. - If life has a meaning A meaning meant to be That meaning has been lost Forever kept from me - And so I fear that one day My life will end for naught For the darkness is winning The fight the light has lost. - Crude. But you get the idea. Think of it as four four-line paragraphs with a double space between paragraphs. ",

Thy vows are all broken,        And light is thy fame; I hear thy name spoken,         And share in its shame.   They name thee before me,       A knell to mine ear; A shudder comes o'er \u2013     Why wert thou so dear? They know not I knew thee,      Who knew thee too well: \u2013 Long, long shall I rue thee,      Too deeply to tell.   In secret we met \u2013      In silence I grieve, That thy heart could forget,      Thy spirit deceive. If I should meet thee     After long years, How should I greet thee? \u2013     With silence and tears. ",
