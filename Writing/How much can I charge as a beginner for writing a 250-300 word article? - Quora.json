            "answer_text": "Q: How much can I charge as a beginner for writing a 250-300 word article? Depends on the type of article, niche, and client. The fact that you're a beginner is irrelevant. You can charge whatever you find a client willing to pay you. If your writing is competent and you're in a decent niche, you should be able to get a minimum of $30\u201360. (More like $300 is possible, but that's unlikely without clips, which are prior examples.) If you're pitching topics, you should be getting paid more than if they're providing topics. Have a written contract or at least a letter of agreement. As a tip, don't compete based on price. If you try to provide the cheapest rates, you'll attract a lot of unpleasant clients and sabotage client loyalty. Too-low rates also repel good clients. ",
