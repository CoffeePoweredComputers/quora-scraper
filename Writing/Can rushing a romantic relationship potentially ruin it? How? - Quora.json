            "answer_text": "I call it \"spoiling your goose\" from this book I read called Johnny Tremain. (The book isn't important, but in one part of the book the protagonist makes a mistake and says he \"overcooked his goose\" in case you're curious) Back on topic, rushing a relationship isn't something I recommend because it can snowball into doing something you didn't want to do. Also it can't lead to problems growing a strong relationship. Thus, don't spoil your goose. ",
