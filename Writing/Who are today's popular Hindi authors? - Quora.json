            "answer_text": "I was recently looking for some contemporary Hindi books and I came across a few good authors. Here I would like to mention 3 of them whom I liked: Anu Singh Chowdhry: she has written 2 books, I have read both. One is autobiographical account of her experience of having amd raising children, other is a collection of stories. I liked them both very much. Manav Kaul: Manav Kaul is an actor and author. I absolutely loved this book Theek Tumhare Peeche, it's an absolute gem. Each story strikes a chord with you and some of them managed to make me cry. I am yet to read his second book which was published recently. Nikhil Sachan: Nikhil Sachan\u2019s stories are relatively light hearted and some have kids as characters. Nevertheless he does manage to address a few social issues that plague our societies. The writing is good. Hindi literature is going through a rough phase. No one can truly say if it will recover or not. We don\u2019t have great pieces of literature coming out right now, but that\u2019s not to say that the space is completely devoid of good authors. These authors (and a few others) are writing good stories that have the potential to connect to masses. The only problem is that no one is interested in reading in Hindi either. Many people make it seem as if the only reason I would read Hindi is because I am not able to understand English books. That\u2019s far from the truth. I read way more English than Hindi (news, official documents, Quora answers, FB posts, random articles, fantasy novels etc.). I read Hindi books because I know Hindi and I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t enjoy good Hindi literature. It\u2019s my language and despite having lived in English dominated world, I still find it easier to connect with the story when the words are in Hindi. I hope we will have more people reading and writing in Hindi in future and Hindi literature won\u2019t simply die out. ",
