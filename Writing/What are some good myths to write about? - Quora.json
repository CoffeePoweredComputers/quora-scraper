            "answer_text": "hi Suzaan, Since you didn\u2019t specify religious or new era myths you wanted to hear I\u2019ve chosen the mix of the above two categories. Here i\u2019m giving you some myths about which you can write about: 1:Flat earthOccasionally, a poorly informed history teacher might suggest that Christopher Columbus was trying to prove to a skeptical world that the earth wasn\u2019t flat but round. Hardly anyone in history seriously thought that the earth was flat. It\u2019s a modern myth that the ancients somehow believed in a flat earth. Even the ancients could see that the twilight glow during sunrise and sunset formed an arc over the horizon. They could also see that the top of an incoming ship at sea, viewed from the shoreline, appeared before the rest of the boat. These and other clues suggest a curving landscape consistent with a spherical earth. If you\u2019re not persuaded by the evidence, check out the Flat Earth Society. You\u2019ll fit right in. Meanwhile, be sure to avoid buying a ticket for an around-the-world cruise. It\u2019s just a scam organized by round-earth profiteers. 2:Jesus was born on December 25thThe winter solstice was celebrated by the Romans from December 17 to 25. This yearly festival included gift-giving, family time, and revelry. When Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity in the early 4th century, the traditional Roman holiday date was appropriated by the Christian church as a parallel holiday to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Easter was already a holiday, so a holiday was needed to celebrate the date when Jesus born. Later, the feast of St. Nicholas was assimilated into the festivities, since St. Nicholas famously distributed gifts on December 25. But there are no records suggesting that Jesus was actually born on that day or its equivalent in the Jewish calendar. 3:Hitler created the AutobahnGermany is famous for beer, engineering, Hitler, and the Autobahn. Hitler had no connection with beer or the Autobahn. He was also not an engineer. He was a teetotaler who didn\u2019t create Germany\u2019s \u201cFederal Motorway.\u201d Hitler could not have overseen the Autobahn since it was already in existence in 1931, two years before her became chancellor. Hitler\u2019s rise to power and the development of the Autobahn did happen at almost the same time, but they occurred in the wrong order for Hitler to take any credit. 4:Christopher Columbus discovered the AmericasThe New World was new to Columbus, but it may have already been discovered by the ancient Norse missionary, Leif Erickson (i.e., \u201cEric\u2019s son,\u201d his father was Eric the Red). Historians generally agree that Leif Erickson first landed on Canadian shores almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in the Bahamas. Erickson was converted to Christianity by King Olaf I in what is now Norway. He set sail as an explorer and merchant, but also to evangelize unsaved nations. Attempting to reach Greenland, he sailed off course and landed in Helluland, Markland, which he called Vinland (perhaps Nova Scotia). He spent a season or two in North America before returning to Greenland, where he later ascended to the throne. Others may have preceded Columbus and even Erickson. 5:Most men in the colonial era wore wigsWigs and powdered hair were in fashion at the time, but only about 5% of the population wore them. Wigs were expensive and were mainly worn by lawyers, statesmen and women of the gentry class. Wigs were ill-suited for blue collar jobs. And most people couldn\u2019t afford a wig even if they wanted one. 6:Thomas Edison invented the light bulbContrary to popular belief, the light bulb, a mainstay of modern life, ubiquitous in the developed world, had been around years before Thomas Edison ever created one. Edison\u2019s contribution was to improve on it. Previous versions were unreliable, expensive, and didn\u2019t last very long. Up to 20 others independent inventors were doing the same thing as Edison at the time, trying to build a better light bulb. Edison\u2019s version of the light bulb improved on the filament, used a sealed vacuum bulb, and had a lower voltage than others at the time. The result was a marketable product that could last for hours. Edison\u2019s design has been improved upon over the years. Today standard incandescent bulbs can last for years, even this one that\u2019s still burning after 100 years! Stay tuned. Government rules have banned most incandescent bulbs due to their low efficiency. Light-emitting diodes produce light much more efficiently than incandescent bulbs and will one day supplant them. 7:Albert Einstein was bad at mathThe irony of this myth is that legendary physicist Albert Einstein forged the revolutionary Theory of Relativity. While he was a poor student who failed to pursue subjects that didn\u2019t interest him, Einstein excelled in mathematics and its applications in physics, which seems kind of obvious when you say it out loud. Greek Mythology Beauty contest that led to war: How feuding goddesses caused the Trojan War All the Olympian gods were invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis except Eris, the goddess of discord. Angry, Eris decided to teach the assembled Olympians a lesson. She threw amongst them a golden apple on which was engraved the words, \u2018For the most beautiful.\u2019 Three goddesses \u2013 Hera, goddess of household, Athena, goddess of skills, and Aphrodite, goddess of beauty \u2013 claimed the apple and fought over it. No god, not even Zeus, dared judge who of the three goddesses was the most beautiful, and hence worthy of the apple. Finally, the goddesses were told to go to Paris, prince of Troy, known for his understanding of female beauty and his fair judgements. The three goddesses presented themselves to Paris and tried to impress him with their beauty. When he could not decide, each tried to bribe him secretly. Hera promised to make him ruler of the greatest kingdom in the world. Athena promised to make him the most admired warrior in the world. Aphrodite promised him the hand of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world.Paris accepted Aphrodite\u2019s offer. He gave her the apple and with that, he and the land of Troy earned the enmity of Hera and Athena forever. Thus, the cause of the Trojan War was not so much human folly as it was the pettiness of the gods.  Japanese Mythology The first couple: When a love-lorn husband followed his wife to the land of the death The primal human couple, Izanagi, the man, and Izanami, the woman, were responsible for churning out islands from the sea which they populated with their children, the many deities who populate the Japanese countryside. Izanami died while bearing the fire-god and Izanagi was so distraught that he was determined to bring her back. So he went to Yomi, the shadowy land of death, to fetch his wife. Unfortunately, Izanami had eaten the food of Yomi and so could never return. Izanagi lit a torch, desperate to see his wife. To his horror, he found that her once beautiful body had decayed and was covered with maggots. He ran out of the underworld in fear, chased by Izanami who missed her husband and wanted him to stay. Izanagi finally reached earth and covered the entrance of the underworld with a huge boulder. His angry wife yelled, \u201cI will kill a thousand living creatures each day.\u201d Izanagi yelled back, \u201cThen I will create 1,500 new lives each day.\u201d So the story ends in eternal separation and bitterness. Egyptian Mythology The true heir: An ancient tale of sibling jealousy and betrayal In the beginning there was nothing but waters of Nu in the world from which emerged the first pyramid-like mound, just like the earth that appears when the waters of the Nile recede. On this mound stood Atum who produced the god of air Shu and the goddess of moisture Tefnut, who in turn produced Geb, the earth-god, and Nut, the sky-goddess, who produced Isis and Osiris, the first queen and king of human civilisation. Atum is sometimes described as masculine, for he masturbates to create his male and female children. But he is also referred to as \u2018the Great He-She\u2019, acknowledging the androgynous nature of life before the arrival of the two genders. Osiris became first king of the Nile valley and he established a great kingdom, but his brother, lord of the desert, became jealous of him and invited him to a meal and then showed him a box. \u2018Is the box smaller or bigger than you?\u2019 Seth asked innocently. Osiris was not sure, so Seth asked him to lie in the box and check. Osiris got into the box without suspecting a thing. Seth immediately sealed the box and buried Osiris alive. He then cut his body into tiny pieces and threw them in the Nile.  I hope you've got your answer, if you have any queries please comment down below! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. That depends on what you personally like. I\u2019ve been known to like general fantasy; classic \u2018dragon being taken down by a hero of some kind\u2019. I also like stuff like Beowulf, and I\u2019ve found a new fascination with Norse Mythology. I also very much enjoy Ancient Egyptian Mythology, and would like to see more stories revolving around the ancient gods. So, really, I fall back on my original assertion, because different myths tend to be popular with different people. At the end of the day, you should choose which one you like and want to write about. ",
