            "answer_text": "Myths are the stories we tell ourselves to give us a view of personal and shared reality, and whether they are justifiably true, in any historical or scientific sense, is not usually considered. Myths are very powerful forces in any culture and are often more powerful than anything science can reveal. For example, myths tell and teach us what it means to be a man or woman, lover or friend, husband or wife, honest or deceitful, brave or cowardly, and the many other seemingly inscrutable ways of being, that we personally and culturally presume to be real. This nuanced definition of myth is well beyond the notion that a myth is a widely held belief, but nevertheless false. The comparative mythologist, Joseph Campbell said, \u201cEvery myth is psychologically symbolic. Its narratives and images are to be read, therefore, not literally, but as metaphors.\u201d Campbell, J. (2002). The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myth and as Religion. Novato, CA: New World Library. p. 28). These mythic metaphors become so personally innate that it is often difficult to recognize them in any meaningful way without a great deal of reflection, sometimes helped by education or pursuing psychological insights. Relatable to innate cognitive biases, the myths expressed by storytelling can be so powerful as to reinforce, for example, the prejudice bias such that a person is unable to self consciously recognize themselves to be racist, sexist or ethnocentric. To understand the powerful significance that possibly innately held mythic metaphors play in culture, consider the ramifications of what Joseph Campbell means when he says: \u201cHalf the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions, for example, are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves, as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies.\u201d Campbell, J. (2001). Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor. Collected Works of Joseph Campbell. New World Library. Retrieved from: Thou Art That Quotes Looking at the rising ethno-religious conflicts around the world today leaves little doubt that possibly innate and intractable mythic metaphors are driving many of these horrors. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2018: \u201cThe share of countries with \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels of social hostilities involving religion remained stable at 27%. Countries in these two categories scored at least a 3.6 on the Social Hostilities Index, a 10-point scale based on 13 measures of social hostilities involving religion, including tensions between religious groups and religion-related terrorism. Although the share of countries in these categories did not change since last year, it was higher than in 2007, when this study began tracking social hostilities. In addition, several countries joined these top two categories of social hostilities in 2016. Bangladesh experienced an increase in assaults and killings of members of religious groups by social groups or individuals \u2013 including multiple instances where people who had expressed atheist views or were accused of offending Islam on the Internet were killed or threatened.\u201d Kishi, K.

            "answer_text": "You may already be familiar with myth as a fantastic fictional story that seems to attempt to explain the nature of an establishment of the way life is. It may address the nature of what we can only know as Creation and are powerless to fight but must conform as one people to adapt and perhaps attribute our efforts to the subtle natural mechanisms that must support all life and not just life that lies directly of the effectuations that bestir us. Science has confirmed our suspicions that beetles ,mold and disease must break down death so all can continue living as one. Myths can be held to be sacred and compose truly holy stories that have been configured by the wisdoms fraught of the disciplines of heaven and hell alike. The story of Eden in the Bible is purely a mythic composition but if not taken as a work that means life or death for humankind of every generation, we would be wastes of our own flesh and our science would be based on whims bought of the highest bidder. Largely, the curation so critical to our mass comes not by what \u201cthey\" say it all means, but what we say it means. Have an opinion or start shooting . Have faith in what we call God, a thing like the name implies, it is almost Good. ",

            "answer_text": "Myth : Some people think, myth means false stories. but I would like to draw attention of those who think the same. Myth means \u2018someone\u2019s true\u2019 or \u2018my truth\u2019. I think i need to explain this, lets take an example\u2026\u201cI have seen an peacock dancing in jungle.\u201d you may say its false, because I don't have any proof of that. Does that make my story false? No, just because i cannot provide an scientific proof my story,it is not false, its may be a Myth. In the same way, when people see something, hear something, or feel something they create a story. These stories may not have any scientific proof but those are someones\u2019 truth. Some of the examples are Great Indian \u2018Mahabharat\u2019 or \u2018Ramayan\u2019 stories. For some people they are truth, for some they are false, for some they are myth. I hope my answer is satisfactory. I case of any grammatical error, please forgive. ",

            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t account for all myths, but I can offer two: Paul Bunyan and Davy Crockett. Although many Americans think the Paul Bunyan stories were based on the feats of a real person, he was actually created by two lumber-industry public relations men named James Stevens and W. B. Laughead as a way to publicize their lumber company. He was no more a real person than is Harry Potter. The first mention of Paul Bunyan in print occurred in 1914. He has been conflated with \u201cJohn Henry, the steel drivin\u2019 man\u201d as a symbol of what happens to talented individuals as a result of progress. Both Paul Bunyan and John Henry were put out of work because machines could do more work, faster, than they could. David Crockett (the name he apparently preferred to Davy) was a real person, a Tennessee frontiersman and three-term Congressman who died at the Alamo. Stories about him were like today\u2019s political ads shown on TV, a way to become known to voters at a time when travel and communication on the frontier were difficult. ",
