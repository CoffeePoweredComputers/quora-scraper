            "answer_text": "Thesis and journal article are two documents explaining the research work. However, the thesis is an elaborately detailed document with extensive data (\u224820,000 words); whereas, research article is a concise, crisp with relevant data (3000-600 words). The thesis explains the study in minute detail, highlighting every aim and objective. There is an extensive introduction followed by a literature review. The goals and objectives /hypotheses should also be mentioned in good detail. The material and methods should be explained explicitly. The results and discussion also are detailed and usually do not have any specific word count. The university guidelines generally define the formatting of the thesis.

This provides a suitable idea to format the research paper accordingly. The journal instructs authors on the length and the structure of the abstract (usually 150-250 words) \u2014 a concise and compelling introduction followed by Material and Methods. In a research article, only the significant results are highlighted and discussed. Avoid including unnecessary data. Include reader-friendly tables and figures and explain accordingly. This is followed by a discussion with relevant studies and a short conclusion. Avoid repeating the results in the discussion section. References are exhaustive in the thesis; however, in the research article references are limited. Few journals specify the maximum number of references to be included in the research paper.
