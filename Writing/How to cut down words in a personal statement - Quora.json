            "answer_text": "\u201cIn a personal statement\u201d leaves a lot to be desired. What do you mean by that phrase? What kind of personal statement are you referring to? There are many different kinds of statements, serving many different purposes, that could be considered \u201cpersonal\u201d. Do you mean a personal statement on a job application? Do you mean a personal statement for a college admission essay? Are you filing a police report? Are you talking about one of those \u201cabout the author\u201d blurbs that are often found on the inside sleeve of a book jacket? It is never my intention to be unproductive or unhelpful in answering strangers\u2019 questions on the Internet, but the fact remains that I cannot give an effective answer to your question\u2014let alone an answer that is specific to your situation, your needs\u2014without knowing what kind of personal statement that you endeavor to write. Even so, with no knowledge of the particular parameters of your personal statement (such as its purpose, its tone, its length requirements, any space limitations, etc.) and with no details or directives beyond \u201cin a personal statement\u201d, I can nonetheless provide you, in general, with the following tips for cutting down the word count in a piece of writing. Here they are: Remove all adverbs (or as many as possible). There is a good chance that every word ending in -ly is unnecessary. Superfluous adverbs are the bane of every copyeditor\u2019s existence, and whether or not to remove them has been the basis of many a battle between copyeditor and author. Want to know a secret? In such cases or \u201cbattles\u201d, the copyeditor is almost always right. For example:\u201cWe ran for our lives\u201d is shorter and more effective than \u201cWe quite literally ran for our lives\u201d while conveying the exact same message.\u201cJuan tiptoed through the hallway because everyone else was asleep\u201d is shorter and more effective than \u201cVery cautiously, Juan slowly and quietly tiptoed through the hallway because everyone else was already asleep\u201d while conveying the exact same message and avoiding the cringeworthy redundancy that plagues the latter example.\u201cThey oppose most policy changes\u201d is shorter and more effective than \u201cThey typically adamantly oppose nearly all policy changes\u201d while conveying the exact same message.Change from the passive voice to the active voice. The passive voice is vague and reminiscent of poor writing quality. But of more concern to your personal statement is that the passive voice is wordier than the active voice. Take a look for yourself:Passive: The tea kettle was placed on the stove by Beth.Active: Beth placed the tea kettle on the stove.Passive: The doors are locked at midnight.Active: The doors lock at midnight.Passive: The doors will be locked at midnight.Active: The doors will lock at midnight.Passive: Being happy is what is wanted by everyone.Less passive but still passive: Being happy is what everyone wants.Active: Everyone wants to be happy.Remove the word \u201cthat\u201d if and where possible. Newspapers do this. It can save a lot of space and reduce your total word count. Often, but not always, certain uses of the word \u201cthat\u201d in modern English can be removed from a sentence without changing the meaning or readability of the sentence. A few examples:\u201cI know that you were hoping that you wouldn\u2019t need surgery\u201d can become \u201cI know you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t need surgery\u201d without any problem or grammatical issue.\u201cLisa said that she knows that you have a peanut allergy\u201d can become \u201cLisa said she knows you have a peanut allergy\u201d without any problem or grammatical issue.",

            "answer_text": "Remove all the qualifiers and modifiers. As far as someone reading it is concerned, \u201cvery good at chess\u201d is the same as \u201cplay chess\u201d and \u201cextremely proficient at the piano\u201d is the same as \u201cinterests include piano.\u201d If your abilities go beyond that, then state it in concrete terms. A friend of mine put on her personal statement \u201cHave recorded nine piano CDs\u201d. The people reading it did not realise she was a famous concert pianist\u2014they assumed that she had been doing some home recording. \u201cConcert pianist with recordings on Naxos\u201d would have served her much better. You might also want to remove some detail. In the UK we always joke about personal statements that include \u2018bronze swimming award\u2019, which is something that almost everyone has. If you have anything on the lines of \u201cfirst in my class to receive bronze swimming award\u201d, then just delete it. Essentially, anything you have to explain isn\u2019t worth including. Prioritise as follows: Relevant qualificationsLanguages spoken fluentlyRelevant academic or work experienceRelevant voluntary interestsNon-relevant qualificationsNon-relevant sporting, professional and arts achievementsSummer jobs, hobbies and pass-timesCulture consumption.Keep these to only things which you can absolutely demonstrate. I was once an outside candidate for a job which the agency didn\u2019t think I had a chance at. I had put \u2018fluent in English, French and Dutch\u2019 on my personal statement. At the interview, the interviewer asked me about languages. I said if he could find someone who spoke Dutch, I could do the rest of the interview in Dutch. He then said (in good French), that he couldn\u2019t do Dutch, but could do French. We finished the interview in French. The next day, I was offered the job at 15% more than it had been advertised for. On the other hand, if I had put down a language in which I only had basic skills, I would have been ruled out there and then. ",
