            "answer_text": "The easiest and the best way I can tell you \u2013 as I have done exactly the same, is to watch Neso Academy videos. There are 204 videos in Digital Electronics - YouTube and 204 videos in Analog Electronics - YouTube. You'll be able to complete all those in 15 days, if you are consistent with your business. Baseless of anything, they are easy to understand. Not just the basics, you could even prepare for your exams (if you have one) watching just those videos. One discrepant is that the OP-AMP tutorials of Neso Academy are not up to the mark. For that, check out NPTEL :: Electronics & Communication Engineering. They are easy and quite lucid to understand.
