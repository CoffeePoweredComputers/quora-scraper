            "answer_text": "As a tutor in the kindergarten. On the first day, when children didn\u2019t know me, they cried when they saw me first time. On the next day - no one cried because I wasn\u2019t a stranger. Fear - cry. If they did someething wrong what is supposed themselves as wrong - they expect punishment. They try to hide. Guilt - hiding. If they like something they try to present something. Usually what is not so dear for them (like a toy) but something what they can give you as an attention sign - you are loved - you are presented with a flower from the walk, with the picture, with the hug. Like - present or action (hug). If they are hurt - they need to hurt back. It\u2019s like a balance. Hit for hit. Sometimes it can be even funny - e.g. to hit the door because you was hit. Angry - fight. When they see something unusual - they need to look, to search, to touch. It means - if something suprises them, seems interesting - they come close. Curiosity - come close. If they feel themselves alone - they need mum. It turns into the call \u201cmummy\u201d, \u201cI want to mum\u201d, \u201cwhere is mum\u201d. They don\u2019t call other adult because they don\u2019t have long time experience to have different support. Usually mum\u2019s arms the best protection for being alone with life difficulties. Sad, feeling lonely - searching, calling a mother. ",

            "answer_text": "Kids can express their feelings through facial expressions, through their body, their behaviour and play. Sometimes they may act out their feelings in physical, inappropriate or problematic ways. From the moment kids are born, they start learning the emotional skills they need to identify, express and manage their feelings. ",
