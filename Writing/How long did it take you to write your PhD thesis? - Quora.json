            "answer_text": "Oh, I\u2019d love to answer that and say that I am done but I am just entering the dissertation (thesis) writing stage at my university. That said, I have completed quite a bit of it already (more, below, describing why that is and how it works at Capella University) At Capella, there is the period of time (about two-three years if you only take one class per quarter) that you are finishing up the required coursework. As a part of that, you attend what are called the \u201cTracks\u201d which combined together, complete your required residency. During those tracks, you have the opportunity to start and work through part of your dissertation. Based on that, I imagine that many have a good portion of it completed before the official mentor-based dissertation-writing phase. That would mean that that would have only taken two to three years to write their dissertation, and that is because of the required coursework and residency. There is another year or two scheduled for the dissertation phase and some of that is to meet the requirement for the credits. But, from my personal experience, if you are really focused on completing it and understand the research requirements (i.e. quantitative research versus qualitative research > info here), you may be able to complete it in a year, especially if you have a responding/attentive mentor that helps to guide you in cases where something may need addressing or rewriting.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. My doctoral thesis was based upon a number of articles on my subject matter, bookmarked by a conclusion and a literature review and the introduction chapter. Due to the article format, each article became a separate chapter, each having a unique methodology section. I wrote a total of 7 chapters with 4 discreet articles and the above referenced bookmark chapters. The time taken to write the complete thesis was less than 90 days as the 4 critical chapters were already written, reviewed and approved by my thesis supervisor. Two chapters were already published in peer-reviewed journals, and the remaining two article/chapters were based upon research contracts for government agencies and were approved by the funding agents. I estimate that it took 2 years to complete all 4 independent research articles. Therefore, the time spent writing the final thesis was minimized by these previous efforts. I chose this format as it allowed me to segment my PhD into easier to manage projects rather than trying to start from scratch and put together an entire thesis based upon a single effort. I termed this method as the sandwich thesis. Do the inside of the sandwich first, one chapter at a time. When finished write the conclusion, then add your already completed literature review, then as the final step, write your introduction with signposts to what you think that the reader will need to know in advance to completely understand the organization and flow of your research thesis. I use this method when mentoring incoming graduate students to help them visualize their upcoming thesis. ",
