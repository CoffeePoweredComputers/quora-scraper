            "answer_text": "A few additions to Cathy\u2019s suggestion of providing students with copies of the rubric you plan to use, so that they may edit and, in effect, pre-grade one another\u2019s work: What I look for primarily is clarity and organization. A clear, well-organized essay starts out with a grade of 100%. From that, I deduct points for major errors (new paragraph in an awkward place, unclear antecedent for a pronoun, sentence errors) with fewer points deducted for minor errors such as spelling. A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ORGANIZATION I expect a high school sophomore\u2019s introduction to a 3.5 essay to contain his/her thesis statement \u2014 that is, to tell me what I will learn from reading the rest of the essay \u2014 and his/her conclusion to \u201cfit\u201d the introduction in the sense of reiterating what I should have learned from reading it. I expect the middle three body-paragraphs to contain the student\u2019s three main reasons supporting his/her thesis, each reason supported by at least two supporting details, with three details preferred. Note that students aren\u2019t restricted to the 3.5 essay form. They may use any organizational pattern they choose, so long as the essay contains an introduction-with-thesis-statement, a conclusion, and three or more body-paragraphs which follow a pattern of the student\u2019s own devising. Together, those paragraphs should lead readers to the writer\u2019s conclusion. CLARITY The best essays are the clearest, those which can be read from start to finish without the need to re-read a prior sentence to puzzle out a pronoun\u2019s antecedent or figure out what a misspelled word is struggling to become. The best essays also employ transitional words or phrases which keep the reader\u2019s mental feet on the right path. Perhaps most important of all, the best essays convey a sense of the writer\u2019s personality and, ideally, leave the reader feeling that s/he has learned something \u2014 gained an insight into the writer, for example, or even simply been entertained. They leave the reader feeling satisfied. Hope this helps! Carole Berlin ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re a new teacher and want some suggestions, Google \u201cessay grading rubric\u201d\u2014i just did and got \u201cAbout 595,000 results.\u201d I did this when i first began teaching and then cherry-picked the things i liked best from a dozen examples. Whatever kind of essay will influence what you\u2019re going to grade them on as will grade level and what you\u2019ve been emphasizing in your lessons. Do pass out a copy of the rubric when you give them the assignment/prompt, imho. It helps them to see exactly what you\u2019re going to grade them on and how much each part of the essay will cost (in points.) Make sure that anything you want them to pay careful attention to is more than 10pts, tho\u2014otherwise, you\u2019re going to get a few doofuses who decide, \u2018the conclusion\u2019s only worth 10 pts, and i can still get an A without it.\u2019 Standard i remember was keep to large issues as much as possible and divvy the grade up among no more than 6 criteria. And remind them, of course, (on the rubric!) that essays are worth (insert percentage here) of their final grade, so they can\u2019t say they thought it was just a standard daily grade. I used the rubric, too, a couple times in the drafting. That is, i had the students peer-review each other (twice, usually) using the rubric. Colored-pencil underlines help with this (red for off-topic content, blue for grammar/syntax errors, yellow for clarity issues\u2026.) Plus sparkly stars or some such for stuff done really well. Yes, these were high-school students. Yes, they loved the sparkly star stickers. (edited to add: Yes, they were expensive and yes they came of my own pocket.) ",
