            "answer_text": "The reason Roblox is free is because many more players will be registering onto roblox. As we all know, TIX has been removed, meaning that players will have to purchase more robux to be able to customize their character, also showing that Roblox Corporation makes more money. However, if it wasn\u2019t free, less players would be on Roblox since it is no longer free, and they could spend their money elsewhere, meaning that less purchase robux, and Roblox Corporation makes less money. So hence the fact, Now you know why Roblox is free :) ",
