            "answer_text": "The story. One middle aged woman boarded a boat , waiting for tourists on the bank of a river. As it is time to start, she called one of her friends in the crowd standing outside,by waving her hand and saying \u201c come on my dear, come fast\u201d. In the crowd, there were many people known to her, of different age group & different backgrounds. The child in the crowd, looked up at her gratefully and went towards her to hug as she reminds it's mom. A teen age boy from the crowd looked up at her and thanked for her kind gesture as she reminds his elder sister. A middle-aged person of bad character, looked up at her and thought to himself \u201c what a pretty call girl. If she is really looking at me & called, I am prepared to spend more money & time to share with her and enjoy today\u201d. An elderly person, thought \u201coh.what a nice girl looking like my daughter, calling to help me\u201d and thanked her for her kind courtesy. The incident is same. But the thoughts of individuals differ from person to person reflecting their own character which is not your fault. Finally she walked away with her friend without knowing the various thoughts in the minds of different people. So be true to yourself and never change as per the wish of every one, because it is impossible and waste of time & efforts. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no point in changing one\u2019s character just to please certain people. Everyone has their own perspective and its absolutely alright to be the way you are, unless all the people you meet, offend you or complaint you for one certain habit of yourself. Their can be certain bad habits in you which annoy most of the people you meet and you certainly know it. Try to change these little little habits which will definitely change (or) fine tune your character in a long run. Do not focus on changing your character, which in-fact not at all possible, because character changes according to situations. Last, but no t the least, no matter what, try to reach higher position in your life and people will definitely start respecting you, no matter what your character is. ",
