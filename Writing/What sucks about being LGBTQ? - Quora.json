            "answer_text": "For me? My experience is different then other peoples, so it may not be exactly the same as others. But for me, it\u2019s that my girlfriend is still closeted. She\u2019s closeted to her dad and most of here friends, so when we are near those people I can\u2019t hug her or try to hold her hand and it sucks. Hell, she won\u2019t even let me call her cute! It makes me somewhat sad, but yeah, I just hope she can come out to them one day and not be judged for it. I love her a lot and would hate for our relationship to be hurt because shes afraid. That\u2019s what sucks about being LGBT- It can hurt relationships from the fear of being judged. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. I am Pan romantic and Pan sexual and I\u2019m proud. The only that sucks for me would be the fact it gives a reason for my parents to make fun of. But Its my body not theirs. So if you feel insecure about it, start off unsure and wait til you know 100% for sure that is how you want to identify as. ",
