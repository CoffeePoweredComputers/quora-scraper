            "answer_text": "I\u2019m intrigued by the phrasing yet I can see others offering suggestions. I\u2019m liking the end part concerning the energy found in crystals yet I\u2019m wondering if this energy merely leads to human thoughts or thoughts divine. I am aware that some refer to the Muse or someone else being like a muse to stimulate thoughts and wonders. So, in this poem, I can see the familiar term having some relevance in this whimsical and winsome piece. I\u2019m aware of the first word as a repeat device yet not seeing it as necessary or as effective, they distract from the general theme to some degree. Merely being clever in the writing craft doesn\u2019t mean the writing becomes user-friendly, so I\u2019d prefer a second version without the added twists and turns. Short poetry style doesn\u2019t always satisfy the readers. Eloquence is usually not so short-lived. Incantations or enchantments are somethings to be savoured, as if leading to something overwhelmingly profound. Here, you merely build momentum then abruptly stop like a bus changing gear then stopping so suddenly that passengers merely move forward in their seats still composing themselves, yet asking, What just happened? Consider this version: THE EMPOWERING OF MAN\u2019S DREAMS! : The salt of the sea washes over me,Where stands this heart intense,Graciously given life among the fish,Seeking out the best, right, most perfect words\u2026Wise words that bleed on pages on the sands,Tasked with innumerable wishes,Set free upon the shores of days,Meant to warm the Muse from sweet repose,Till moonbeams bid her nightly beneath the rocks,Among her cherished cache of crystals as her only stock,Recharging the mystic energies of Earth\u2026 From their outpourings come the stuff of life, The challenge to the poets far and wide, The burden of the Prophets and the Psalmists, The hymns of kings and shepherds yet to be\u2026 And if these come to me, what shall I share, Except the pleasures in thanksgiving, The wisdom of the ages, the cry for peace, The safety of children sleeping, The harmony long prophesied that must surely come, And when I, too, am done, then to take my leave, To mingle among the saints long since past, To sleep and rest\u2026 till called above\u2026 on resurrection day! : Denis Martindale version March 2018.

            "answer_text": "Could I simply say that my opinion of your poem that you wrote is that it is quite deep (pun intended). However, if you wanted critique or something particular to go on with, you should say that in the question. I\u2019ll assume permission is given in the A2A for critique. The metaphor is good, a little unbalanced in the middle, but it holds although the shifting focus is a little confusing. When you start, it feels like you are talking about a person and their relationship to you, whereas at the end it feels like you are talking about inspiration by mentioning your muse. The two mix up together. Maybe there are two poems here trying to find form in the one set of words. Blank verse is probably good to keep metaphor in its place. Metaphor can be quite naughty sometimes. I like the alliteration and consonance scattered here and there. They give the words a soothing feeling, though there is a contrast with the wildness of the ocean which the salt water represents to me. There is the William Butler Yeats poem The Fish which has a related theme, though with a different approach and resolution. The Fish ALTHOUGH you hide in the ebb and flowOf the pale tide when the moon has set,The people of coming days will knowAbout the casting out of my net,And how you have leaped times out of mindOver the little silver cords,And think that you were hard and unkind,And blame you with many bitter words.
