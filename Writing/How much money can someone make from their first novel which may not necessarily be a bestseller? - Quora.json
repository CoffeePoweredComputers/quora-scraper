            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not easy to get your first novel published. Most authors write a second and often a third before they hit a level that is likely to be published traditionally. But if your manuscript does get published, you\u2019re likely to make only a few thousand dollars for it. It\u2019s extremely uncommon for anyone\u2019s book to become a bestseller. Of those that get published, you may see 1/10 of 1% that make it to that status, by any measure. Even books that barely crack that level generally don\u2019t make enough to support a family for a year. Even if you publish 3 or 4 genre novels per year, you may not make enough to support a family in a decent style. And, before you rail about how publishers take all the money, let me tell you that the publishers usually get a contribution margin (to cover overhead and profit) that\u2019s about the same as the author\u2019s royalties. And they\u2019re investing tens of thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of dollars into publishing the book. They are entitled to some return on their money, time, effort and skill. ",
