            "answer_text": "The research methodology is the backbone of your research/study. It should not only be good but excellent with uniformed clarity. You get it wrong and you'll likely end up with wrong results. As such, reviewers will always question the credibility of your study. Researcher methodology focuses and discusses the various types of research designs and methods that you as a researcher will use in conducting research. Back to your question, there are a number of elements you need to get right in order to have a robust research methodology. Research methodology section in your study will cover: The research design- The structure of research and it is the glue that holds all the elements in a research project together. It is the scheme, outline, or plan that is used to generate answers to research problems. Is it Case Study Design/Method, Survey Method, Experimental Design/ Method, or Historical Method.Research philosophy- What is the philosophical underpinning of your study. Is it Pragmatism, positivism, realism, or interpretivism (Interpretivist) and justify why and how it aligns with your study.Locations of study- In the general sense, it is the 'relevant area' directly related to your research. This is the area where it is essential for you to cover, through studying which involves you doing the copious reading, thinking, investigating, consulting with an adviser, note-making, and writing in your research journey.Target population- The target population refers to the ENTIRE group of individuals or objects to which researchers are interested in generalizing the conclusions. The target population usually has varying characteristics and it is also known as the theoretical population.Sampling procedures and techniques- What sampling procedures do you intend to employ in your study? Is it probabilistic or non-probabilistic? Highlight and justify whether it is systematic sampling, stratified sampling, clustered sampling, convenience sampling, quota sampling, judgment (or purposive) or snowball sampling.Sample population- Highlight whether you are studying an entire population or a target population briefly explaining how you've arrived at the specific sample sizeConstruction of research instruments- In order to evaluate complex skills like research, valid and reliable instruments must be constructed. Purpose: To report the process of construction, validity, and reliability of an instrument to assess the critical reading of medical papers. Highlight how you intend to validate construct and content validity as well as how you intend to measure reliability.Data collection methods and procedures- this is a process of collecting information from all the relevant sources to find answers to the research problem, test the hypothesis, and evaluate the outcomes. Data collection methods can be divided into two categories: secondary methods of data collection and primary methods of data collection.Data analysis and procedures- Data Analysis is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques to describe and illustrate, condense and recap, and evaluate data. ... An essential component of ensuring data integrity is the accurate and appropriate analysis of research findings. This is based on whether your research is qualitative quantitative or mixed. Here, talk about a descriptive and inferential statistic for quantitative data and thematic analysis for qualitative data.Ethical considerations- These can be related to the researcher, research process, and the respondentsA research methodology section that adequately covers the aforementioned sections is an epitome of an excellent research methodology.

Your mileage will doubtless differ in other fields: Think about what the \u201cgap\u201d in the literature is that you\u2019re addressing (in other words \u201cWhy am I writing this thesis in the first place?\u201d). Also, think about what theories and methods you\u2019re using, and why you\u2019re using them. What other theories and methods are there out there, and why are you not using those?

So decide your objective (s) of your study, how you are going to address your objectives by framing suitable experiments, what and how are the results to be collected and tabulated. Finally, you will discuss your results in the light of your objectives and available literature to see whether your experiments will answer your objectives or not. ",

Just write simple essay on the way you want to deliver your research and try to exhaust all the ways you really want to follow to accomplish your research work and then lastly look for the techniques in some technical books dedicated for research methodology and methods after that you will easily find a particular methodology that suit the nature of your research.
