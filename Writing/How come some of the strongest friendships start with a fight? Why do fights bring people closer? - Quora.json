            "answer_text": "This has been the subject of a number of social psychology studies, so I'll try to summarise it here. The depth of a relationship depends, in part, on how much each person knows and accepts the other person's faults, and appreciates their strengths in spite of them. When two strangers meet and are very cautious to avoid all conflict, it makes it hard to discover each other's faults. They might notice things they don't like, things they can see readily, but that isn't painting a full picture of the other person. Mostly, they will tend to look for a \u201ccommon ground\u201d, things they can chat about that they can both relate to. This is the human tendency to stay with the familiar. We want to see the good in everyone but we are also cautious because we don't know the other person's intentions. When a relationship starts with a conflict, however, our initial impression of the other person is negative. We no longer look for the common ground, but we look for things to criticise, and there's never a shortage of that! If the opportunity arises for another social interaction later, it's unlikely to be in the same circumstances, so a more friendly exchange is likely to happen, and to surprise each person (\u201cI guess he's alright\u2026\u201d). Each party wants to be seen in a better light than previously, so if they manage to apologise and laugh it off, the ground is ready for a much deeper relationship to develop: they make a lot less assumptions about each other's character, are more curious and no longer fear the unfamiliar. In a way, we no longer see the other person as just another version of ourselves or of someone else we think we know: we see them as a unique individual, with warts and all. This authenticity makes the relationship feel refreshing. When I meet someone new, I don't go out of my way to offend them, but I certainly don't stress about saying or doing something that could offend them. When it happens (which is fairly frequently), it gives me a chance to apologize and show them that I care about them enough to admit being wrong. By that point, I'm no longer a stranger, an unknown quantity, an archetype of the white male with a weird accent. I'm a person with feelings, willing to start a relationship with you even though I've just stepped on your toes ;) Edit: PART 2, Conflict Does Not Bring People Closer Together It\u2019s really important that I add this section. It\u2019s not conflict that brings people together. Conflict actually does the opposite: it creates a wound in the relationship, and pushes people away from each other. It\u2019s repairing the relationship that brings people closer together. Just like a muscle grows by repairing the damage incurred through the stress of strenuous exercise, a relationship grows deeper through forgiving each other\u2019s selfish and thoughtless actions, and seeking reconciliation. This is when we gradually realise that we care more about each other than about our petty problems and disagreements. So conflict is a required part of deepening our relationships. Does that mean we should seek or encourage conflict? No! We don\u2019t need to! Just like adversity is an inherent, unavoidable but necessary part of life, so is conflict to all relationships. There is no need to look for it, and nothing really wrong in avoiding unnecessary conflict (why fight over the dishes? just get it done, don\u2019t sweat the small stuff!). ",
