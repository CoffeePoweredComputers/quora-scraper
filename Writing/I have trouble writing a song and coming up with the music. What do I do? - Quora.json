            "answer_text": "Several ways of going about it: Start writing the most godawful crap, like actually the worst most godawful crap you can write.Reread it, then bin it.After around one thousand of these (do like four or five a day for the most random rhymes, whatever\u2019s on your mind), you\u2019ll find yourself getting better just out of sheer boredom.I know I got sick of \u2018purple hazy days\u2019 as a repeating line around fifteen poems in.You also wouldn\u2019t expect the stuff that repeats. But, especially if you have a certain flair for the (melo)dramatic, stuff will repeat.Alternately, you can store it on the Internet instead of binning it. Just put it somewhere and forget about it, then go back to it sometimes to laugh at yourself.Or get ideas.Meanwhile, have you heard of my new song, \u201cPurple Hazy Mountains\u201d? I\u2019m releasing it as an EP on iTunes.You say you have trouble getting past four lines. Here\u2019s an idea\u2026connect two paragraphs of four lines together. Voila, eight lines.I also have no clue what meeting E.T. has to do with writing a song.Unless you\u2019re trying to meet and/or be Daft Punk. In which case, good luck, because you would have to turn yourself half-electronic to be as plugged into the music as they are.Also there\u2019s two of them, and the cloning will probably hurt a lot.The key to a pop song is repetition.As I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve used in another answer, find a phrase of a poem, other song (preferably not their title), book, TV show, movie, etc, and repeat it until you puke.Not enough that your listeners puke.It\u2019s a fine line to walk. Usually outlined by puke.This is your hook.After that\u2019s done, repeat your hook some more. Add a beat. Some instruments. You\u2019re golden.Add some variation to the music patterns so your listeners are less totally bored. Again, not too much.It\u2019s a bit like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.Although now I\u2019m thinking of the colloquial meaning of Bear.Right, this line also has puke surrounding it.The key to an electronic song is to steal. A lot.Electronic songs are pretty much every genre under the sun. Just more electric. Electronic. Electric and electronic.Sampling is stealing. You don\u2019t have to come up with the lyrics yourself. You just have to know which song you can steal from the most.You can also stea\u2014I mean sample, the music.Keep in mind, some really good DJs, who do sample everything and don\u2019t create a note, are essentially showing you what their taste in music is, and nothing more. Their skill lies in putting everything together until you can\u2019t tell that they\u2019ve been stealing everything. It\u2019s a good skill.You can do that without a lick of music theory, just a really good ear.Also some really good lawyers.Actual tip for lyric writing:Set up a situation in a particular format, then recycle the thing. e.g.:I went to the bar Bought a glass of whiskey and ginSat in the corner, watched my ex-wife hollerAbout how she\u2019s missed me I\u2019m in my cupsDeepeningAnd I won\u2019t leaveI went to the carFilled it up with whiskey and ginGave it to my old backseat driver, that excellent liar,About how she\u2019s missed meI\u2019m in my cups\u2026Okay, this is more of a country song, but you know. Just repeat lines.For more pop songs, just trawl through tumblr poetry.Ask someone\u2019s permission to make it into a song.There, you have lyrics.Granted, you might lose a few drinking games, but you\u2019re sorted now.",
