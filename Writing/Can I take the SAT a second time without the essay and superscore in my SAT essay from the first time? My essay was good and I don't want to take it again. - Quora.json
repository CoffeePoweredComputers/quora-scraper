            "answer_text": "NEVER, EVER do that - skipping SAT Essay section in your next attempt. Some colleges, like UC, consider highest composite score of a particular test date, from your all appearances and take individual section scores. If this is the case, you scoring your best score in the next attempt, you will not have Essay component in that. You cannot afford to take that risk. Helping students apply mentions that Report test results Students applying for fall admission must take the ACT Plus Writing, SAT (taken prior to March 2016) or SAT with Essay (taken March 2016 or later) no later than December of their senior year to ensure their application receives prompt and careful consideration. It is unlikely that scores from tests taken after December will arrive in time for our review process. A few guidelines: Students should report their ACT and/or SAT scores on their application, and then request that an official copy of the scores be sent to us from the testing agency. They can have their official score report sent to one UC campus, and all campuses they apply to will receive it.Advise students to have the testing agencies report all scores. We will use the highest scores from a single test administration.For the ACT Plus Writing test, we will focus on the highest combined (composite) score from the same test administration.For the SAT or SAT with Essay, we will focus on the highest total score from a single test date.We do not accept test substitutions.",
