            "answer_text": "I'm sorry but the best answer here is a a whole joke. First off; I don't know where he or she got the idea that SM groups don't have to pay trainee debt. SM idols do have to pay their debt, and within their first year too. The plus punt with SM(and YG & JYP) is just that they do not require their idols to pay back for everything. \u201cSM idols have to pay off debts as soon as they debut as well, but the agency does not charge all of the training costs. SM thinks of investments as investments and does not require the trainees to pay that back. Girls\u2019 Generation type of groups are able to make profit within the first year of debuting.\u201d - former SM Entertainment manager, Kim Seok Hyun Excuse me? 20\u201330 trainees? What?? Thousands of people audition every year to get into SM Entertainment. Over 100 trainees alone competed to get a spot in EXO! [EXO was selected through a procedure same as \u2018Produce 101\u2019] [Here's How SM Picked Which Trainees Would Be In EXO]   \u201cTo determine the EXO members, S.M. Entertainment took 120 trainees at the start, and eliminated 20, bringing the number down to 100.\u201d Then they eliminated 40 more, bringing it to 60. After eliminating 36 more, it was down to the final 24. Finally, one trainee was eliminated per week until the final 12 EXO members were decided.\u201d - EXO's only remaining Chinese member, Lay How many times do we have to say that it's 10x harder to get into SM, let alone get the chance to debut under it, than it is to get into a small company for people to finally get it? Please stop being a clown. Privilege? People keep throwing around that word and don't even know what it means at this point. Tell me, what privilege did EXO have as an SM act besides SM being able to promote them more on a bigger scale (something small companies can't afford to do because of the lack of money and connections). Getting really tired of everybody acting like they have had it easy! Why in God's name do you think they lost 3 members in the span of 1 year? Because they had it so easy in SM? Really now? SM mistreats and abuses their idols and trainees. They have it extremely hard in that company! Nobody had it easy! The GP(general public) won't like you simply because you are from the BIG3. On the contrary, you are more likely to receive backlash and be ridiculed 24/7. As a BIG3 act, the only privilege you get is bigger budget for the material you put out and exposure to a large audience(appearing on variety shows falls under that category) and that's that. SM, for example, has had several acts that never made it big. NCT is still not liked by the GP despite all the promotions they have had for the past 5 years. If the EXOs are oh so privileged, mind telling me why all of these big companies in the K-industry are against them and try to bring them down? Mnet, Hanteo, Gaon just to name a few. Why are charts doing manipulation to stop them from being #1 on all charts? Why are Gaon and Hanteo sabotaging their sales?(they admitted to it!) Why are award shows giving EXO's awards to some other groups?(same here!) Before EXO even got to chance to release their first teaser(December 2011) ahead of their debut(April 2012), people already started up anti-fanclubs for them, all with tens of thousands of members right off the bat. They already had people trying to bring them down before they were even introduced to the public. How ridiculous is that? Hating on and spreading rumours about a group of young boys that you know literally nothing about? To this day, EXO's anti-fancafe is still the biggest one out of any celebrity's with over 100K anti-fans that constantly tries to bring them down and ruin not only their careers but also them as people. EXOLs never-ending support and EXO's love for each other and for their fans are the reason they still exist. It has nothing to do with their company, whom started to already neglect them in 2014, when they were barely 2 years into their debut. The same year they got into career-ending scandals (members departure+dating, which is a big no-no for Korean idols). And the members themselves never forget to tell us how we and their bond are the reason they're still here. EXO are the reason for almost half of SM's income. So who needs who exactly? SM about to go bankrupt once the EXOs decide to nope out together. (EXO are rumored to have had a fall-out with SM since 2018. The members apparently wanted to enlist in the military together as a group instead of going separately over the years, but SM was highly against it. With EXO being their No.1 moneymakers, them enlisting together would greatly affect the company. Their 5th Album \u201cDMUMT\" got delayed for a couple of months because of it. There was even a possibility that it was going to be cancelled altogether.) Anyway, back to the net worth talk! Reasons why EXO's net worth is much higher than that of BTS: EXO got popular very early on in their career and were endorsing high-end brands from the time they debuted, which earned them millions, and thus were able to pay off their debts way faster than the majority of idols.Because they paid off everything in 2012, they already started making some real money for themselves in 2013, the year their popularity skyrocketed after the release of their million-selling 1st album \u201cXOXO\" and the nation-wide hit single \u201cGrowl\". Exactly around the same time BTS made their debut.In the second half of 2013, they opened up their own pop-up shop with a clothing-line, named \u201cBWCW\u201d (Boy Who Cried Wolf). Although it was only open for a short period of time (it was part of their promotion for their album \u201cXOXO\"), it was very successful and brought in a lot of money for SM.    Several hit songs. 5 Million-selling albums. Extremely successful special winter EPs. Exceeded 10 Million sales last year. First 21st century K-act to do so.Besides being one of the biggest and most successful music act out there , all of EXO's members also have successful solo careers.They have a long list of CF/endorsement deals worth million. Both as group and solo.EXO are not only big in the music industry, but also branched out into the film, fashion and TV industries and many more.On Korea's Forbes Top 5(2013-2018, #1 for 2 years. Top 10 for 2019) list for biggest earners in S.Korea.5 very successful sold out Tours. Over 100 concerts, bringing in around $331 Million with tickets alone(excluding the money they made off of the sold-out merch).Youngest members Sehun an Kai? Endorsing high-end brands and being ambassadors for said brands(Gucci and Louis Vuitton) while being part of the acting industry.Lay? Self-explanatory. One of China's biggest stars. Endorsing big brands and successful in music, tv and film industries. High spot on China's Forbes list for several years now.Do Kyungsoo? Respected and acclaimed actor and landing big roles left and right. (This is a huge deal, \u2018cuz idol-actors have an extremely bad reputation and are not liked by the GP)Leader Suho? Has landed several acting roles and is now making a name for himself in the musical/theater industry. Received lots of praise for his portrayal of the main character in the musical \u201cThe Man who Laughs\".Eldest member Minseok? S.Korea's IT boy! Everything he touches or mentions sells out in minutes. Probably the most popular and well-liked(by the GP) EXO member in South Korea along with Kyungsoo and Jongdae. Also in the acting industry.Baekhyun and Jongdae had extremely successful debuts as soloist this year. Jongdae's debut single \u201cBeautiful Goodbye\" was a huge hit with the GP, while Baekhyun's debut EP sold almost 600K(Best selling soloist in Gaon's history and the first soloist to exceed 500K sales since Seo Taiji's 7th Album in 2004). Dubbed by the media as the Leader of the new wave of soloists. Baekhyun has also once tried out for acting (one of the main characters in Moon Lovers) and a musical (Singing in the Rain, main role) while Jongdae tried out for a musical (In the Heights, main role). Baekhyun is the co-creative director of the clothing brand \u201cPriv\u00e9\". Jongdae is also known as the King of OSTs. Both of them also said they want to focus more on music so they don't do much outside of it.Multi-talented artist Chanyeol? Ambassador of Tommy Hilfiger. Has his own studio. Is in the acting industry, just like the rest of EXO. Part of the fashion industry. Sang one of the biggest OST hit \u201cStay with me\" (Goblin OST). In a sub-unit with youngest member, Sehun. Best selling sub-unit in Kpop(previous biggest-selling sub-unit was CBX, also EXO). Debut EP(2019) sold over 400K.And that is only the surface for EXO. BTS might be doing extremely great as a group, but what about their solo careers? Besides the rap-line releasing some solo music and Taehyung acting in Hwarang, I haven't heard or seen them do anything outside of the group\u2026 (I really think BigHit should let Taehyung do a bit more acting. Maybe some small roles to start off? He also has good visuals, so he should try out modeling too.) EXO now has 7 extremely successful years in their bag, both as group and solo. BTS on the other hand only started to become big around 2-3 years ago. And even then, they're only doing very well as a group in the music industry. None outside of it. Which is a big reason as to why their net worth is way below EXO's. Sorry if I went a bit off or if I sounded rude. I was just ticked off by what I read. I can't stand people disrespecting the exos when they have no idea about the things they went through and what they had to sacrifice to be where they are right now. :( Edit; added content. ",

            "answer_text": "I literally made an account just to reply to this question. The answers are all so ridiculous, I cannot believe people are seriously trying to argue that EXO\u2019s net worth could be higher than BTS. BTS are worldwide stars and named amongst people like The Beatles, Taylor Swift and popular culture sensations like One Direction. They are serious competitors to well-known American artists in album sales and in charts, they actually pose a threat to these artists because of just how much and how well they sell in America. EXO is not on the same level and therefore, they can\u2019t possibly have a higher net worth than BTS even if they get more acting gigs or even if they didn\u2019t have to pay off [X] debt or not. There is no SOURCE to the claim that EXO has $950M net worth online, except for a few Pann and allkpop forums that started it. BEYONCE (and I will say it again, B E Y O N C E) has a net worth of $400M so I don\u2019t know how people here are writing these things about EXO with a straight face. You are meaning to tell me EXO have a higher net worth than Beyonce? You are telling me that EXO has a higher net worth than BEYONCE and TAYLOR SWIFT combined? Come on, now. There are actual numbers backed up by sources online about how much profit BTS makes for their company and if I remember correctly BigHit made more profit than all three of the biggest companies (with TONS of idols signed to their name) COMBINED. There are also various reports of how BTS contributes $4.65 billion to SK\u2019s GDP which is almost as much as companies like Samsung, Kia etc. You can find various Forbes articles on this if you google. There aren\u2019t similar articles about EXO because they don\u2019t contribute as much and they are barely active as of now. Don\u2019t believe everything you read and especially please think critically before choosing to do so. After seeing a ludicrous number such as $950M, you have to stop and check the source. If the farthest you can go is a Pann article, rethink the authenticity of it. There were news about Kyle Jenner having a $900M net worth (still lower than EXO\u2019s, according to everyone here) and people had the hardest time believing, it was also soon proven to be fake. If people are having a hard time believing Kylie Jenner would have that number as her net worth, what makes you think this makes ANY sense whatsoever? ",
