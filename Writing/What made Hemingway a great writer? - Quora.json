            "answer_text": "I never thought he was a great writer. He did write some good short stories and a couple of decent novels. People like Hemingway for his prose style. It is clipped, simple and elegant. He conveys much with few words, like a skilled journalist. Some of his stories are very good. I recommend the book In OurTimes for some fine short stories like \u201cBig Two Hearted River\u201d, \u201cA Very Short Story\u201d, and my two favorites: \u201cIndian Camp\u201d and \u201cThe Doctor and the Doctor\u2019s Wife\u201d. This is good Henmingway. His character, Nick Adams, is a bit of a stand in for the author himself. He is both a witness and a participant to the forces that leave his life alienated and in disarray. I like that side of Hemingway. He lost me with the novels. I like The Old Man and the Sea, but I don\u2019t love it. He isn\u2019t Herman Melville. I see what is good in The Sun Also Rises, which uses that prose style that made him famous, but I have to remind myself what the story is. His protagonists have depth, but they seem to be a type: rugged alienated man and the woman he can\u2019t have. No one is particularly likable, save Santiago and the boy in The Old Man and The Sea. I can still read a book if the plot is less than ideal, but I must care about characters. I enjoyed Nick Adams from his early short stories, but he morphs into some moody guy in the novels without that inner sensitivity that made me care. People like his cult of manhood. He is good at that. Hemingway was no fake. He believed in what he was doing. His novels and stories came from direct experience. He had enough heartbreak in his life to fill a lot of pages. Hemingway associated with some of the best literary minds in literature\u2014Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald and James Joyce. Even though I am not a big fan of his writing, he had talent. Others saw it as well, encouraging him to move from a journalist to writer. His prose style may be accessible, but he is not a shallow writer, nor is he easy. Something about his suffering male protagonists turned me off. However, I will not deny he had a tremendous influence on American literature, plus he was a fascinating figure as a celebrity for many. ",

            "answer_text": "What made him a great writer was that early on he tried to be a poet and he also worked as a hack reporter before becoming a short story writer and then a novelist. The combination of these two things gave his writing the well known austerity, and also the lesser noted, but just as essential, poetic sense that comes in his descriptions. There are scenes that deliver power which I will never forget \u2014 the detailed fishing process, reconstructing a broken soul in the Big Two-Hearted River; the overwhelming regret of his affair, when he is greeted by his wife and toddler son upon his return to Paris in A Moveable Feast; the trees, and the canyon at the beginning of For Whom the Bell Tolls. And finally, his reminder to himself, again in A Moveable Feast, to write one true sentence. These scenes have stayed with me all these years \u2014 the memory of when I first read them and even when I reread them again years later. They haunt me and comfort me. Others have done the same \u2014 William Styron, E.B.White, Patrick Leigh Fermor, Norman Maclean \u2014 but none so often and for so many years. Sure, Hem became famous for being famous, and he has been refashioned to suit the arguments of many. It's easy imitate him and even easier to mock him, as Woody Allen does in the film Midnight in Paris. He can be so easily parodied because he was so distinctly embattled and vulnerable to the world. Hem was a man of his time and there is a lot of Theodore Roosevelt's naturalism and outdoor adventure in his writing, in addition to a heavy dose of Tolstoy and Conrad. But in the end Hem, when he was truly honest in his writing, which was more often than nearly anyone else, was the best and is the best for me. ",

            "answer_text": "What generally gets lost in the Hemingway Myth that most people are familiar with\u2014the hunting, the drinking, the world traveling, the womanizing\u2014is that Hemingway spent most of his time reading and writing. Hemingway wasn\u2019t born a great writer. You can see promise in his early work as a reporter (though not much in his poetry, in my opinion), but certainly not anything that would make you think he\u2019d one day win a Nobel. No, Hemingway was a great writer because he worked at it like few writers in history. The man read everything. His home library in Finca Vigia houses some 6,000 books covering a wide array of topics, including\u2014obviously\u2014volume upon volume of fiction. This is a man who packed eight novels by Anthony Trollope on a ski trip. When Hemingway thought a writer worth reading, he read them top to bottom. He read classics. He read modern masters. He read poets. He read writers from all over the world, and he read tons of works of history and biography. There\u2019s much of Hemingway that seems outdated or anachronistic today, and I\u2019m not sure how effective his style is now a few generations later when styles have clearly changed. But there is little doubt that Hemingway was a great writer, and his greatness was something he earned, one book at a time. ",

Reading him correctly is an exercise in intellect and wisdom, trying to understand what makes people tick. Which brings me to a second feather in his cap: his understanding of people. Hemingway captured the psychology of his characters well. You might not like or be able to relate to his characters, but he creates real people in his works, people with deep thoughts and serious problems, and their conflicts are real, conflicts about integrity, love, and purpose. Hemingway wrote about serious matters in a challenging way using a simple style. He\u2019s not the only great writer, but he was a great writer nonetheless. ",

The way the sentences sounded and fit together. A Clean Well-Lighted Place. Our nada who are in nada, deliver us from nada; pues nada.
