            "answer_text": "Smaran has been trying to woo Radhika in some indirect ways, often in form of satires and some philosophical lines in their WhatsApp conversations. After so much futile attempts, he decides enough is enough and so, starts planning for the D-Day- 14th of February. He told no one about this, not even their common friends. He bought out a teddy bear, two tickets for the re-released Jab We Met, and started writing a poem named \u201cOn-Off\u201d for her, to signify how those fights will always be something special for him. One Day before D-Day, he sends a somewhat cryptic message on her number, which said \u201c All we know is that there will be only me and you left to fight out once this phase of our life is over. Or do you want to extend it into all phases of life?\u201d After 2 seconds, a confused emoji popped up into his chat. Then, a thunderbolt came out of nowhere to strike him. \u201cDo you see this pic? Cute, isn't it?\u201d He was confused, then replied in his usual way \u201cTalking about that guy, right??\u201d \u201cYes, tomorrow I will propose him. And btw, his name is Suvrat. I will introduce him to everyone tomorrow. But please, don't reveal it to anyone.\u201d \u201cNo spoilers will be offered\u201d, the chat said along with a grinning face, acting as a perfect contrast to Smaran in all the way. The next day, when they met, the same smile mask was all over Smaran's face, who offered his two tickets and clapped as she proposed to his boyfriend. After a minute or so, Smaran got a call. \u201cExcuse me, I will have to go urgently. The policemen have arrived at my home. Congrats to both of you and all the best for the way ahead.\u201d He came back in his car, he saw his mobile's car log, renamed the last contacted number to Other ME from Mom, took out a phone from his cars' pocket, cleared the auto-dialer app and took a sigh of relief , which turned into quiet tears. After moving ahead, he realised that there was something left. At the same time, he saw two children playing with some marbles. He took out a purple coloured wrapped teddy bear and threw it from his windows towards them. He opened his radio and a Bob Dylan song started playing: \u201c Twas then he felt aloneAnd wished that he'd gone straightAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate Sometimes relationships are not what gets fulfilled. Sometimes, it is about letting it go and wishing best about your partner. Thanks for reading. ",
