If your closest social circles actively oppose your life change, your chances decrease rapidly. If you have a social support for your change, your chances rise disproportionally high. Spend time with people you want to be like. This is the fastest way. The Ultra Shortcut Dr. Dunbar, an English anthropologist, discovered that humans include only about 250 people into their internal circle. He supposed that that was an average number of the tribe members in prehistoric times. But he was most blown away by accidental discovery \u2013 we can allow into our internal circles even superficial entities like brands. The more so, we can allow into this internal social circle real people who we know only through books, videos and audio. The man who had the most influence in the early stage of my life transformation was Jim Rohn. I discovered him three years after his death, but I consumed hundreds of hours of his videos and audio programs. He became my virtual mentor. He was the main reason I didn\u2019t give up. You can do the same \u2013 follow someone online and consume their materials to the point when they become \u201creal\u201d to you, a part of your internal \u201ctribe.\u201d Solitary Discipline Spend time with people who have good attitude. And here goes a suplementary activity to do when you are alone\u2026 In December 2015 I listened to a podcast episode with Shawn Achor, the author of \"The Happiness Advantage.\" It was eye-opening. It always puzzled me how much I was able to change in a few years. Shawn explained it. It all spawned from my gratitude journaling habit. \u201cGratitude rewires brain into positivity. When the brain is positive every possible outcome we know how to test for raises dramatically.\u201d \u2013 Shawn Achor In this podcast episode, he tells about an astounding experiment. A 4-year kid with a pessimism gene was being asked for one month each morning about three new things he was grateful for. It made him a hardcore optimist for the rest of his life. Wow! Now brace yourself, they did the same with an 84 year old guy who had the same gene. The same thing happened. Gratitude is a powerful force. Practicing it just a few minutes a day can rewire your brain.  (gratitude entries in my journal) Every morning write three new things you are grateful for. 30 days and your attitude will get better. Guaranteed. If you need a detailed instruction, here is one: How a One-minute Action Changed My Life Completely ",
