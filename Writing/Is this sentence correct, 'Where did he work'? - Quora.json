            "answer_text": "Yes the sentence \u201cWhere did he work?\u201d is correct if you are talking about the past but if you want to talk about the present then the sentence would be \u201cWhere does he work?\u201d or if you want to ask the same question in the future then it will become \u201cWhere will he work?\u201d See this is the fun thing you only need to change the helping verb and you get your sentence in different tenses. Hope this helps ;) ",
