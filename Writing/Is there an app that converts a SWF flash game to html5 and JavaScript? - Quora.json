            "answer_text": "There are people working on SWF to JS converters or runtimes to some degree or another and some new projects and some abandoned. Here is one called SWF2JS. And another called Gordon. Then there's Light Spark. There's Shumway. There's part of the Flash Player source code AVM Plus. There's also Swiffy. There's Apache Royale. That takes AS3 and MXML and converts it into JS or compiles it into SWF. You might be able to take your old code and recompile it. There's a SWF decompiler that you can use to rebuild into JS. Here's pixelplant. A SaaS online converter. Here's ActionScript to JavaScript Transpiler. There is another guy on patreon that is doing a swf runtime or converter. Can't find his info right now. Here's an article on other tools, Flash to HTML5 - Swiffy, Haxe, Shumway and other conversion tools. ",

            "answer_text": "A SWF file is compiled; it\u2019s not an editable file format you can easily go into and get out the moving parts (code, image assets, sound effects). You can find SWF decompilers out there. I\u2019ve never actually used one myself but I\u2019ve heard they run with *very* mixed results. I guess it depends on the complexity of the project and if the developers went out of their way to add security. But if you can successfully decompile the SWF to its raw assets (most likely a bunch of .as script files and some images, sprite sheets and so on) you will be able to slowly rewrite the actionscript as javascript. In effect you\u2019ll mainly be building the game again, from scratch, with the actionscript as a guide. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, if you have source .fla files and if you have adobe flash pro it may be possible, but just maybe. There is a toolkit for flash called CreateJS, it says that it can convert flash files to html5. I knew about this for a long time, but I never used it just yet, so I don't know if you can rely on it. Anyway here is some info: Using the Flash Professional Toolkit for CreateJS ",
