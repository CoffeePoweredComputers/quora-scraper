            "answer_text": "What do you prefer to write? In other words, where do you feel most comfortable? Is it cookbooks, blogging about a specific subject, direct response, copywriting, content marketing, PRs, academic writing, business and finances, blockchain\u2026? That\u2019s the first thing you gotta wrap your mind around. The next thing you should do is write a few things in that particular area and try to publish them somehow - even if it\u2019s a publicly accessible blogging platform like Medium, for instance. That\u2019s gonna be your portfolio. The third step would be to sign up for an account on a freelancing platform with a sizeable volume of freshly posted writing gigs. Say, Upwork, or goLance, or Freelancer, etc. Now comes the juice. You see, on freelancing platforms, there is no guessing game. That is to say, people there are actively looking for a ghostwriter; that means, you. So just swipe through the listing and find the job that fits your skills and expertise, write a proposal, send it, and, hopefully, assuming that you did everything right, a client will respond and you\u2019ll work out all the details. Write the damn thing, triple-check it, send it over, and collect your money. It\u2019s that easy. If, however, you decide not to engage via platforms in this early stage; then it\u2019s a hard road ahead because you\u2019ll have to pinpoint a few prospects who might be interested in your service among the 4,2 billion people who connect to the internet every day. You can imagine the level of knowledge required to pull something like that off. The alternative way is to cold-pitch the editors with your stuff and hope that they\u2019ll accept your submission. These types of gigs are commonly paid anywhere between $50 and $300+ In the end, it\u2019s entirely up to you. But as you can see, you have options. ",
