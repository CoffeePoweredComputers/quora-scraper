            "answer_text": "Headers and footers are typically used in multiple-page documents to display descriptive information. In addition to page numbers, a header or footer can contain information such as: The document name, the date and/or time you created or revised the document, an author name, a graphic, a draft or revision number. This descriptive information can appear in many different combinations. For example, the second page of a business letter typically contains a header with the name of the addressee, the page number, and the date. A report can contain a footer with the report name and a header with the page number and chapter name. A newsletter can contain a header with a title and logo on the first page and a footer with the title and page number on the pages that follow. Adjust your Headers and Footers via the \u201cHeader and Footer\u201d selection on the View dropdown menu on the Menu toolbar. ",
