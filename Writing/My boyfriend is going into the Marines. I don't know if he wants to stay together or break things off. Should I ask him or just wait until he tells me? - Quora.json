            "answer_text": "Here is my advice. Break up on good terms. The reality is he\u2019s away for over 3 months in boot camp. He\u2019s back home for just a few weeks before going off to his MOS school which could involve a few more months before he\u2019s again back home for week or two. Then he\u2019s off to his first duty station, which could involve him going over to Okinawa Japan. Even if he doesn\u2019t go there odds are he\u2019ll not be stationed anywhere near you. The only option you probably have to see him regularly would be to get married and that is a bad reason to get married. Married life as a young Marine is hard. Divorce rates in the military are high. They climb even higher when the military member gets deployed taking them away from their spouse. Pay is also very low. A married couple with no children is already living below the poverty line for the first few ranks. So you have to add the realistic financial burden that comes with it as well. The reality is if you tried to stay a couple without getting married there is a high probablility that he\u2019ll cheat on you. Marines work hard and play hard. Both male and female marines are seldom at a loss for potential sexual partners after boot camp. And the number of Marines I personally knew in boot camp that got a letter from their \u201cgirlfriend\u201d talking about breaking up or explicitely stating that they\u2019ve started seeing someone else, is huge. We even had one Marine in my platoon that got a letter from his wife stating she was filing for divorce because it was already to hard just in those 3 months. I\u2019ve help young Marines that were married and had their spouse living with them on base after they\u2019ve come home to an empty house because their wife left them. You two could be an exception but even if you are it is probably going to be very hard. If you got married and he got base housing and you got a job it isn\u2019t going to be a \u201ccarreer\u201d. Most companies around a military base know that if you are married to a military member you aren\u2019t really a long term employee making other people more attractive to hire. This leaves jobs that have high turnover already which tend to be jobs that don\u2019t pay well. It will be hard to break up before he goes to boot camp but it will probably be better than the result if you try to stay together.  Answer to:My boyfriend is going into the Marines. I don't know if he wants to stay together or break things off. Should I ask him or just wait until he tells me? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s important what YOU want to do and don\u2019t just \u201cwait\u201d for him to bring it up. When I went through boot camp back in the early 1970\u2019s the three guys that had the hardest time were the three that received a \u201cDear John\u201d letter from their girlfriend at home. He will be far better off knowing how you feel, and how you want to deal with this separation period. I went from boot camp to another base for my real training that lasted 6 more months before I had the chance to take a leave and go home to see everyone. Then after 30 days I was loaded up and went to play war in the jungle. By the time all was said and done it was just over another year before I got home again. It isn\u2019t easy to be a soldiers girlfriend and I hope you will learn exactly what it means. Perhaps going to the marine recruiters office and finding out what is likely to happen and the time frames involved. If he is deployed to combat a \u201cDear John\u201d letter from you could be distracting and painful enough for him to make a mental mistake in combat and that\u2019s never has a good ending because others brothers in combat are counting on him to do his job right. I don\u2019t mean to scare you, but this isn\u2019t any high school romance where your boyfriend will be gone for the summer being a camp councilor and you \u201cpromised\u201d each other to be \u201cfaithful\u201dand wait. It will be much easier for HIM to keep that promise, and much more painful for HIM if it\u2019s broken. Just learn all you can about the reality of him becoming a marine and what it will mean, then YOU decide for yourself if you can or can\u2019t. ",

You\u2019ll have to move around to a new military base either every 2 years or if you\u2019re lucky not that often (3+ years but that\u2019s a rarity). For that very reason, it\u2019s not an easy life for a civilian (non-military) spouse to live. It takes a very special person to be married to someone in the military. I\u2019m a married woman vet/veteran and served my country for nearly 10 years. I am also a wife and stay at home mother. I separated (I didn\u2019t finish my military contract and told my unit that I\u2019m done) after I had my last/second child. ",
