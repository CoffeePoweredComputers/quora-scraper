            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not exactly an expert in this, but here is my understanding. I don\u2019t think there is necessarily a single definition of topological order, but it is generally some way of classifying materials with topological properties instead of local symmetries. Physicists are used to classifying materials how they transform under symmetry operations. For example, at high temperatures, the spins of a ferromagnet bounce around randomly with no preferred direction, so they have full rotational symmetry, but at low temperatures they all point in the same direction and thus have lower symmetry. Importantly, symmetries can be broken by small local perturbations. For example, if you have a bunch of atoms arranged in a square lattice and stretch one side a tiny amount, you now have a lower symmetry rectangular lattice. These types of changes fit into the Landau theory of phases transitions. Topological order is generally a way to distinguish materials that does not depend on local symmetry. For example, in 2d insulating materials it is possible to define a Chern number, which is an integer calculated (approximately speaking) by integrating certain phases of the electrons across the Brillouin zone. This Chern number is a topological quantity that does not depend on the local properties of the material and cannot be changed by applying small perturbations. Changing the Chern number requires closing the band gap of the material, so it can be used to distinguish insulators even without any symmetry. A common feature of topological order is a bulk-boundary correspondence, where the properties of bulk can be observed at the interface of the material, where the topological number changes. In Chern insulators, there are dissipationless conducting surface states at the edge of the material that are required to be there no matter what you do to the surface of the material. This behavior is related to the intrinsic non-local entanglement in the material. Exactly what is topological order depends a little on your definition. For example, in a strong (Z2) topological insulator, there is a topological quantity (the Z2 index) and a bulk-boundary correspondence. However, strong topological insulators also require time reversal symmetry, so certain types of perturbations (e.g. magnetic ) can destroy the topological property of the system. In these systems, the entanglement can be shown to be local if you allow symmetry breaking transformations. ",

            "answer_text": "The notion of a topological order has been precisely defined . There are two ways to define topological order macroscopically: via degenerate ground states in closed spaces or via the set of all excitations. See Topological order. Microscopically, topological orders are simply patterns of a long range quantum entanglement . According to above definitions, toplogical insulators have a trivial topological order. ",
