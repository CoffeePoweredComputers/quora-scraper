            "answer_text": "The best thing to do is start. Seeing your work in real life gives you motivation to finish. When you complete something, show it off to people. That will give you motivation to do it again. When your ideas exist only in your head, you never experience the joy of seeing your work complete. If they stay in your head too long, your brain will begin to assume that there is no real point to these ideas so you\u2019ll never get the motivation. So momentum has to be jumpstarted to an extent\u2014you have to just start, motivation be damn. All that being said\u2014sometimes you don\u2019t have motivation, because it\u2019s not actually a good idea. It\u2019s in your head, but as you explore the idea, there are huge impracticalities or dimensions to the idea that make it not worth it. For example, if you want to go to Mars, that involves building a rocket. And that involves starting a company to build that rocket. And that involves being really well funded. And that involves starting a totally unrelated company to create that reputation so you can be funded. And all of that also involves you learning rocket science. MOST people don\u2019t actually have the motivation to do any of that because they don\u2019t really want to do that. But most people are not Elon Musk, who actually is doing all that. So you have to start working. You have to begin. Whether you see it through, or you explore an idea and discover it\u2019s impractical, only by beginning will you ever find the motivation you need to finish. ",

            "answer_text": "Okay. It's very simple. Firstly, make sure you always carry a pocket notebook or a book so that anything you get any bit of idea, you just write it down. The reason this is important is that \u2018an idea unwritten is an idea forgotten\u2019. Then after much idea has been written down, you just need to combine those that match. I hope I've been able to answer your question. For more, you can subscribe to \u201cPaul Eboselume\u201d on YouTube to get unlimited videos that will answer your question. Thanks ",
