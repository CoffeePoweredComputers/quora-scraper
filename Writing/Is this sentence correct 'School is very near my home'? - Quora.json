            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not grammatically incorrect, but it\u2019s not the most natural-sounding way to phrase what you\u2019re trying to say. Also, as a creative writing teacher, I usually advise my students to avoid words like \u201cvery\u201d in their writing, because it\u2019s a little vague and doesn\u2019t really tell us anything, especially when you consider that what I mean when I say \u201cvery near\u201d may not be the same as what you mean and may lead to miscommunication. Another thing to consider is that you\u2019ll hold the reader\u2019s attention better by using specific, concrete words in your descriptions. A native English speaker wouldn\u2019t begin the sentence with just \u201cSchool.\u201d We\u2019d want to give the reader more information. Something along the lines of \u201cJohn\u2019s school,\u201d \u201cmy school\u201d or \u201cthe local high school\u201d is needed. After that, there are about a million ways to convey the information to your reader. \u201cI live close to my school\u201d or \u201cMy school is near to my house\u201d sound natural enough, but still don\u2019t tell us much. If you say something like, \u201cMy house is only half a mile from the high school\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s a primary school two blocks from my house,\u201d you\u2019ve given your reader good, specific information that makes it easier for him or her to form a mental picture.

            "answer_text": "It would only make sense in a certain context. If you\u2019re saying it without some very specific context, you would want to say instead, for example: My school is very near my home. That school is very near my home. Mike\u2019s school is very near my home. Without any context, the listener will wonder \u201cWhat school?\u201d The word school on its own does not convey much meaning. At the very least, you would want \u201cA school\u201d or \u201cThe school.\u201d I suppose you could construct a scenario where \u201cSchool\u201d on its own might work in this sentence, but it would take a lot of thinking to construct it. On another note, \u201cnear my home\u201d strikes this American English speaker as rather British and old-fashioned. In the US, we would be much more likely to say: \u201cThat school is very close to my home\u201d [even better, \u201cmy house,\u201d \u201cmy apartment\u201d] or \u201cThat school is very close to where I live.\u201d But I wouldn\u2019t call \u201cnear my home\u201d wrong. It\u2019s just not the most natrural-sounding way to say it in my variety of English. ",

But to be literally correct it should be: \"My school is very near my home,\" or \"The school I attend is very near my home.\" In order to refer to your school as just \"school,\" which like \"home\" is a nebulous, not a physical thing, you must have first internalized it. The person to whom you are saying the sentence does not have a specific image of what you mean by \"school,\" because it exists only in your mind. You must first externalize it so the other person can get the meaning of it. ",

The individual to whom you are stating the sentence does not have a particular picture of what you mean by \"school,\" since it exists just in your brain.
