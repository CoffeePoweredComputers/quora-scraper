            "answer_text": "Space is a mathematical concept with certain dimensions , can be finite or infinite, it depends on what is thought about, for example in quantum physics the infinite Hilbert space is usually used , the best way of space existence is its mathematical formulation with time by GR, it can be imagined as a fabric of square nets of scaler factor a(t), this fabric is the only space, where energy and matter are warping it,leading to curve it, where gravity here is spacetime fabric curvature.The expansion of the universe is its spacetime fabric expansion given as a(t)= a(t=0) e^Ht where H is Planck constant. This means the distances between celestial objects are increasing. So, no sence of saying space occupies space.!!it is a part of space with specific dimensions( t ,x,y,z). ",

            "answer_text": "Space and Time are ideas and cannot be reified. Only now exists for humans. The past is over and the future hasn\u2019t happened yet. So you are at the center of the cosmos you see what you see depends on what you think how you filter the infinity of possibilities. Young\u2019s double slit experiment proves this, along with a number of delayed quantum eraser experiments. With no time space cannot exist as a real thing. So, space and time cannot be reified - and does not exist in any place but our minds. ",

But there\u2019s another perspective were space is defined as outer space stretching out to infinity. The question then becomes, \u201cDoes the Universe occupy space?\u201d and that question I cannot answer. It\u2019s brain-boggling to even consider. ",
