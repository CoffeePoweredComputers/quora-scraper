            "answer_text": "If Chinese characters were necessary for comprehension, then it would be impossible for two Chinese people ever to have a conversation. If it is possible for two Mandarin speakers to talk to one another -- and I assure you it is -- then we can safely ignore the argument that characters are intrinsic to the language. Writing is a pretty recent phenomenon in all languages, but because writing is by definition more durable and more visible than spoken language, people tend -- especially with Chinese -- to think of written language as \"real\" language, and of spoken language as somehow inferior, when in point of fact writing accounts for only a tiny subset of all language use even in today's more literate world. For the overwhelming majority of Chinese history, the overwhelming majority of Chinese people were either illiterate or minimally literate, and they got by just fine.  Sure, it's possible to construct sentences that are confusing when read aloud -- though people who cite Y.R. Chao's brilliant composition about the lion-eating poet in the stone house seem never to mention that Chao was (a) the inventor of one of the first widely-used romanization systems, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, or that (b) he wrote that piece as an argument in favor of vernacular writing over the stilted pseudoclassical style that it's written in (See What Pinyin isn't for more). It doesn't make sense when read aloud because it's not written in Mandarin. Pointing to this as an argument against writing Chinese in a phonetic script is like pointing to the sentence \"Buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo\" as an argument in favor of writing English with Chinese-style semantic determinatives: it misses the point completely and is a pretty weak argument to begin with. Sure, pieces in \u6587\u8a00 turn into gibberish when you Pinyinize them -- because \u6587\u8a00 wasn't a spoken language. On the other hand, the \"classical novels\" (actually pretty recent works) that some other commenters have mentioned here -- most particularly \u4e09\u570b\u6f14\u7fa9 -- began their lives as spoken tales performed for audiences, and continue to be enjoyed as performances by anyone who's ever listened to \u8a55\u66f8 on a taxicab radio. They exist just fine in an oral context, because that's where they were born. (Citation: literally everything that has ever been written on this subject ever.) The real question here is whether or not it will ever happen. My guess is that it won't. Not because of any deficiencies in Pinyin or other romanization systems, but because people see characters as a symbol of their Chinese identity. People feel that they need them, regardless of whether or not they actually do, and likewise people feel that Pinyin is a tool for foreigners (it wasn't designed to be), or that it's something that Chinese people don't use (except for every time they type anything on their computers or phones). Facts are irrelevant when feelings are this strong, and in any event the time for any sort of major systemic change like this is long past: if China couldn't rid itself of characters in the '50s and '60s, it's certainly not going to be able to do so today.

            "answer_text": "There are so many dialects in the Chinese language. In the past, for at least 2000 years these many dialects applied the same form of writing which is known as \"Literary Chinese\".   Around 100 year ago there was a movement to encourage people to write as close as spoken and since then people started abandon the Literary Chinese writing style. Today most people write in Mandarin-Chinese style. However Literary Chinese is taught in school so that we still know to read all the ancient books. (Well I am talking about in Malaysia) If the writing were to be converted into Pin Yin, you will end up having another place like India where native languages differ from each other, be it spoken or written.  Anyway, it is impossible to do that also as today Mandarin Chinese has only four tones. If you were to read article written in Mandarin Chinese style in PinYin, most of the time you need to guess what is the exact word out of hundreds of words.  It will be more practical for other Chinese dialects such as Cantonese (9 tones) or Hokkien (7 tones)  to adopt PinYin writing system but still the guessing problem exists to some extent. ",
