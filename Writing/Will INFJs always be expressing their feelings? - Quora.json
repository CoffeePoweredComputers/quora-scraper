            "answer_text": "Well, no. Many INFJs are very expressive for two reasons: It feels authentic to them. Why should we actively suppress our excitement? Because everyone else says we should? Sorry, but we can\u2019t do that. However, I\u2019m more than certain there are many INFJs out there who don\u2019t feel the need to be expressive. You might just be one of them.They feel emotions very deeply, especially those who embrace their Fe (or Empathy). Since these emotions are usually intense more often than not, we have a rather hard time holding them back.If you don\u2019t end up being very expressive, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re not an INFJ. Whenever I leave my home and go to someplace public (like a supermarket or park), you could easily mistake me for an INTJ or INTP. I keep to myself, I\u2019m always looking around and I never talk. Once I do talk to you, you\u2019ll be able to feel my empathy. But that doesn\u2019t happen very often. This is actually a common skill of INFJs: Mimicking other personality types, often unwittingly. If you\u2019re an INFJ, your level of expressiveness heavily depends on where you are and how you feel. If you\u2019re around select people (family or friends), you might feel more comfortable and therefore be more expressive. When you\u2019re in public, some social parts of you may shut down and reroute your focus to the barrage of emotions you\u2019re about to stand under. Take that into account when you think about this. And even after all of that, I don\u2019t believe that being expressive is crucial to the INFJ baseline personality. If you find that nearly everything else about INFJs fit you, including the way you feel, I wouldn\u2019t worry about this one little thing. That said, there is always a chance you\u2019re not an INFJ, or a borderline between two different types. I feel like I should remind you to be honest with yourself involving these kinds of tests. First realize who you are, then find ways to build yourself into your ideal. Don\u2019t answer them as if you were your ideal. Be honest. Hope this helps. ",
