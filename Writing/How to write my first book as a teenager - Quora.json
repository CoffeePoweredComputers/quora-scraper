            "answer_text": "Its great that your teacher noticed your writing skill. Teachers do get it right most of the time. As a youngster all you do is get started. Make out a simple brainstorm of your story plan.Create some characters around the plotInvest new ideas into how this plot will unfoldGet started. Stay within the basic rules of writing paragraphs, good clean sentences, adept punctuation, and good sentences with connected logic to keep going.Dont panic if your story goes willy wonky. You can edit it at a later stage.Just keep going and going and going and don't stop until you've reached about 120,00 words. Thats a full fledged novel btw.Now take to polishing the First Draft, adding some sparkle and throwing out the illogical parts, cliches, detritus and parts that don't run smoothly along your pre-designed plot lines. Add flesh and emotions to characters.Whatever you do don\u2019t ever stop and criticise yourself. There are others who will do it for you!Be determined. Write everyday- without fail. Dont get out of your comfort zone until you finish your first draft.Within a year you should be holding a fat manuscript in your hand. Who knows if this will be a bestseller or not? Only you do.Pat yourself on the back and take enormous pride that you have finally written that book. I know its there on your mind and you speak from unsure steps- but hey. Just do it.One last thing. Read other writers as you go along. Develop technique. Dont read just one writer. Read many. Reading many will not cramp your style. You must read and write together. It is a ritual. A very important ritual.Good luck. Hope to see you in print soon. If you need any help please feel free to message me. ",

            "answer_text": "You are probably tempted to take universal themes and try to work them into your writing. Then you\u2019ll wonder why you can\u2019t quite sustain them and invest them with the gravitas you desire. That\u2019s because you\u2019re a teenager and you haven\u2019t yet known (to borrow from Yeats) the fool\u2019s triumph, love lost as soon as won, nor the best labourer dead and all the sheaves to bind. What need have you to dread the monstrous crying of the wind? So don\u2019t go there. Yet. If you\u2019re anything like I was, I\u2019d suggest that when you\u2019re a teenager life moves by fast. In some ways your life is more superficial than it will be later, but you probably feel it more deeply. You fall in love quicker, you get hurt more often, you hurt without realising it. You treat people badly and you make stupid mistakes. Your friends mean more than your family. If you were in another generation you would go off to war because it seemed a grand adventure. You\u2019re bullet proof. The future means nothing to you and the past is a prison you want to escape from. You don\u2019t need to sleep, while adults seem like dumb, lumbering creatures who look forward to an early night. You think horrible thoughts but you don\u2019t give voice to them. You might secretly hope awful things happen (like Trump winning) because you would quite like to watch the train wreck play out. All of this feels to you like it\u2019s humdrum and everyday. It\u2019s the last thing you want to write about. You probably want to write something like Of Mice and Men. But I\u2019d suggest if you\u2019re not prepared to write what\u2019s true \u2026 however embarrassing or cringeworthy - whether it\u2019s about a girl or a guy you like, how you are scared of sex, how you acted when someone kissed you (whether nobly or like some cad), what you feel like when you have to choose an outfit, what it\u2019s like when you feel rage, what it feels like to have your period (not sure if you\u2019re male or female here)\u2026 then you\u2019re not ready. If you are, then I\u2019d suggest you try capturing that. ",
