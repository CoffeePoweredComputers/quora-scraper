Crystal, I mean no insult, I just couldn\u2019t find the original post. Anyway, I did the first few. The yellow areas are the changes I made. You can check them against the original if you don\u2019t understand what they were. All APA documents now require a digital object identifier (if it exists for the document). You have to pull up the actual document, NOT just the Google Scholar reference, to get the DOI. You can use one of two forms for the doi, either the way I have it in the picture below, or as an http://doi. etc link. However, if you start off doing it one way you have to keep doing it that way. Right now the way it is written is in flux; APA is supposed to come out with a firm rule in the next six months or so. The point is, it has to be there if it exists. So no more \u201cRetrieved from www.thomaswilson.edu.pa\u201d if it is an academic document.  ",
