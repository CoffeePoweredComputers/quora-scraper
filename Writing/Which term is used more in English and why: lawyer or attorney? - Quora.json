            "answer_text": "There is no difference between lawyer or attorney in the US--it comes down to personal preference.  For example, I never refer to myself as a lawyer--I always use attorney--but I don't care if other people call me a lawyer.  Even the State Bar of California uses both terms interchangeably.  On their homepage, for example, they have an \"Attorney Search\" and a \"Lawyer Referral Service.\"  http://www.calbar.ca.gov/. In fact, on the Lawyer Referral Service page they use both terms in the same sentence:  \"If you need to hire an attorney to handle your case or want to consult an attorney on a potential case, a certified lawyer referral service can put you in touch with a lawyer who can handle your problem.\"  I guess the Bar Association needs to hire an editor who is not a lawyer or an attorney. Lastly, with respect to which term is used more often, a quick search on Google and Bing reveal the following search results, both of which demonstrate that the term attorney is more common than lawyer: GoogleLawyer: 86,900,000 resultsAttorney:  182,000,000 results Bing:Lawyer:  59,500,000 resultsAttorney:  78,000,000 results Lastly, you will also find some attorneys in the US who put \"Esq.\" after their name.  It is short for esquire, and it is simply a shorthand way of saying attorney.  Whether someone uses it or not is just a matter of personal preference--I, for example, never use it.  It should not, however, be confused with an esquire in the UK, which is a title of dignity that ranks above gentleman and below knight. ",

            "answer_text": "That was one of the first questions that I asked the Google N-gram viewer.  Here are the results for American English vs. British English. (There are six lines because the viewer is case-sensitive and these are often used as part of a proper-noun phrase.) American English -- roughly interchangeable as common nouns, attorney dominant in a proper noun phrase, and nobody says solicitor    British English -- lawyer is the dominant common noun, followed by solicitor, with attorney the most common proper noun.  Dan's comment above that \"Attorney\" is no longer official in the U.K. is particularly interesting, given that the term is still more frequent as a proper noun than either Solicitor (or Barrister -- I checked).   Sure, it's just a set of book scans that can't disambiguate meanings (like for \"solicitor\").  But the answer the topic question seems to be that the two terms have been fairly interchangeable in the U.S. for a long, long time.  In the U.K., there are particular customs to adhere to (that Dan is mentioning). ",
