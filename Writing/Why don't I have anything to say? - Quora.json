            "answer_text": "Many people don't have what to say. Many people say something, but better they did not. Many people have what to say worth listening, but do not and better they did. Only few say something worth listening.  Having to say something worth listening comes with a price, paid forward usually in pain and suffering. Most of people go through it unwillingly. A few chose such a path.  If you don't have what to say, lucky you! It means your life is pretty good, in a sense that you are not torn by contradictions, and the world around you is the same one as it always had been. Good for you! Don't force yourself to say something. Live your life and be happy as long as you can. If trouble comes your way, it might break or even kill you and you will not be able to say anything. Or it will hit you so hard that you will have to say something worth listening, but you will not want to. Only few go through troubles and came out having to say something and able and willing to do it. Writers, especially those few good ones, are able to hear what was said very quietly or they feel what was not said. That's one of the big contribution of literature - saying what many feel, but not willing or not able to express. Try to read good books. Try to hear those few words worth listening - such words usually not trumpeted around. Try to feel what was not said but worth feeling. That is another way of being able to say something - saying what other people said quietly or felt and did not say, but worth spreading around. Life is good, but can be hard. Everybody  has own way, not like any other way in this world. Observe and listen, live your life and chances are eventually you will have what to say. Almost everybody has, eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "Because on some level you know it is not worth it.  But, Lets break this up into smaller parts :  Is it just the speaking/communicating part that you are talking about or Do you usually  have no opinions/comments at all in all of your discussions ? If you are categorized 'introvert' ( nothing wrong in that, I am one ), you probably listen and receive the meaning and implications of the discussions going around you but have this fear of jumping into it. You would rather keep your thoughts to yourself  than expressing and becoming a part of the conversation.  Lately people have been classifying introverts as if they did not exist before the social media and internet ( and thanks to the advent of social media - it actually increased the number of aggressive introverts on the internet expressing and  commenting as now we can express our thoughts without being interrupted - mind that you will still be judged irrespective of being an introvert or an extrovert or a pervert :P ).  Second case, Is where you ignore and do not care at all about the regular stuff that goes around you  in your life( now that may or may not be a bad thing ). Maybe people and the topics of discussions around you are not really that interesting and intriguing enough to deserve one's attention and involvement. Maybe you just don't fit in your hang out circles.  This is again not a big problem, but life will be better where you think you fit in and can feel free to express yourself more openly.  Answer this : for example, Do you happen to talk more with your friends/family/internet ( social media) than you do at your workplace? If yes: think of working on some ways to develop interest in your current occupation or switch. Sadly, more than 50% of us live this life.  There are a number of good ways to convert you into an extrovert ( forcing yourself to be more socially active and eventually being accepted and loved by the society by taking deliberate conscious actions while in a group )  And, by doing that, it is possible to reflect your enhanced confidence and other improve other social skills ( Remember there is nothing wrong being an extrovert either) But Is it worth to change yourself to that extent where every minute of social encounter is like an examination ?  Stay the way you are and be at peace or try and force yourself according to the people/ society into a different person that the world wants you to be. What is it gonna be ? What would you say?  :p ",
