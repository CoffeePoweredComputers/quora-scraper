You should be very clear in your thought process. SOP is just a support ladder to your whole application. While drafting the Statement of Purpose you should always keep in mind never to digress from the topic. We have written some points that will help you make note of what to write The student\u2019s background \u2013 you\u2019ll need to go back to your roots!Academics and professional experience have helped you a long way; go on brag about your beautiful mind.Extracurricular activities; all work and no play makes you a dull creep.Your urgent and future dreams and how you think that the particular institution will give you a much-required push towards it.Why do you think you\u2019re special?Try to make the SOP interesting, little humor is in fact quite helpful in making your SOP more noticeable.

You\u2019ll approximately need two months\u2019 time, so no pressure.While drafting the SOP you should make it in fun, enthusiastic, upbeat and interesting. Try incorporating anecdotes, stories about your past and present or even something that\u2019s so unusual that it\u2019s amusing.Avoid cliche and generic comments such as \u201cI want to pursue post graduation in Artificial Intelligence because I\u2019m really interested in computers and I want to know more about it.You should use assertions like I believe, your institution will help me grow as a student and I\u2019d be on top of the world if I get in\u201d, you could write something as assuming as \u201cEver since I read my first book on Physics, it has connected me to the world of wires in a mesh. I\u2019m positive you couldn\u2019t resist my potential once we form a closed circuit.The first content is of 45 words and the second is of 34 words. Judge for yourself which one would you remember if you are handed with 500 similar applications.The college authorities want to know about you, how could you be an advantage to the subject, institute, how serious are you about your pursuits and how competitive can you get.You can also ask for an international scholarship through your SOP. But, mind you, let it be funny. Humour can\u2019t ever be dull!After completing your SOP, you should try to get it reviewed from different people to negate the cognitive bis and give it for a fresh look by experienced reviewers to enhance its quality.We are also attaching a sample SOP for mechanical engineering As a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student with an ardent interest in the industrial work environment, I learned about the intrinsic fundamentals of machine, tools and processes which broadens my research horizon. This particular interest motivated me to apply for a master\u2019s course in Mechanical Engineering in your esteemed Institution. I believe your institution will augment my knowledge and will provide a world class platform for my future aspirations. My inspiration towards this field comes from family\u2019s automobile business. My father too is a mechanical engineer, he introduced me to praxis in this field by teaching me the operations of Lathe Machine, Gear Cutting Machine, Hydraulic Cutting Machine, Steam Turbines, Compressors etc. and plants like Steam Generation Plant, Ammonia Plant at a very young age. This triggered an organic desire in me to explore about the happenings of these machines. In addition to that, I did my internship in BHEL and also published a research paper in an international journal pertaining to the project that I worked during the internship My deep interest in the Mechanical Engineering field helped me secure a good rank in the Joint Entrance Exam, I secured a seat in SASTRA University, Thanjavore. During my studies, I learned a lot about basic principle such as Thermodynamics, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning, Heat and Mass Transfer, Mechanics, Mechanical Vibrations, etc. During my under graduation, I frequently visited various industries including mine to get an inside look at the working procedure. My thirst for knowledge enabled me to score A grade in all practical exams during engineering. My interest is more towards the interdisciplinary nature of studies, so I took extra certifications such as AutoCAD to help me gain more features pertaining to design.

Create a Statement of Purpose that is original, fresh, unadulterated and an honest portrayal of yourself.

Make sure that each of them is exclusive and unique by adding details and reasons specific for each institution. For example you may specify certain aspects of the course or classes or even teachers and mentors whom you find particularly inspirational and intriguing.Plagiarism is strictly forbidden Don`t copy-paste from the internet or other resources nor hire someone to write a fascination SOP for you. Put in the effort to create your own SOP as an earnest reflection of your zeal and potential.Recheck Don`t leave the composition of the Statement of Purpose till the eleventh-hour and jot down a hastily and carelessly written essay. Prepare early so that you can assemble your thoughts well and revise and make corrections if necessary.",
