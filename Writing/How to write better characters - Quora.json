Strengths and Weaknesses:  Good characters are usually three dimensional, which means just like the audience, they have a similar range of good attributes and negative attributes that they carry around at any given time. Pictured above is one of my favorite characters, Clark Kent. Clark Kent has super powers, but behind closed doors, he\u2019s a regular guy like the rest of us. Sure, he\u2019s got plenty of strengths, but he\u2019s also just as unsure about doing a good job at work, making the right decisions when the stakes are high, and how to date the woman he really admires. In short, he\u2019s human in the ways that count. Relatable to the audience in some way: This does NOT have to be as specific as you might think.  I\u2019m not a Russian immigrant with an indestructible body, but Colossus was my favorite X-Man growing up as a kid. Why? Because despite all that strength, he was a gentle guy who really just loved art. The writers wrote Colossus to be this way, and I happened to gravitate towards that aspect. Other people might like him because he\u2019s the muscle in the group, or relate to the problems of being an overprotective brother, or understand what it\u2019s like to have someone much younger than you be attracted to you. In other words, as you write a character, you can target specifics if you want to hook certain audience members, (we\u2019ll talk about that down below in the secondary aspects), but really, you just want to paint what you think is a three dimensional character who seems to react in their circumstances in a believable way. If you do that, you\u2019ll likely be creating characters that someone in the audience relates with. Have a clear, defined arc, or arcs, for their character in the story:  Good characters should not be aimless! If you\u2019re writing a story, you should know where it\u2019s going! This is for ANY story. Good characters have planned arcs; typically, those arcs are defined by what changes either internally inside the character. Luke is a great example: his major arc in Star Wars, (the Original Trilogy), is that he wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like his father. The mini-arcs are Luke joining Obi-Wan and the Rebellion, learning the Force from Yoda, and trying to save his father. There are tinier arcs within those arcs even that are punctuated with lessons that Luke has to learn or events that shape his path\u2026 like the deaths of is Uncle and Aunt, the death of Obi-Wan, and the confrontations with Darth Vader. Characters, even little ones, should have a clearly defined purpose for the scene you put them in, and you should know where that character is going, why, and how in the arcs that you write. Can be tied to themes the audience understands:  Stephen King is a masterful writer who I\u2019ve enjoyed since I was a kid. You don\u2019t need to be a prisoner or have broken a law to relate to the characters we see in this film because they are tied to themes we all understand universally. Regret, loss, age, suffering, but most importantly, hope. Good characters in some way on the arc you\u2019ve planned for them, may be on an emotional journey that takes them to one of these places or AWAY from one of these places. This is a major way that the audience connects to characters. It\u2019s not just about the plot getting a character from point A to point B\u2026 the emotional journey the character is on and how they choose to approach the struggles on that journey becomes the themes that shape the piece. Are defined by their actions and deeds, as well as the fiber of their character\u2026 not just surface level attributes:  \u00a00:00-0:30 Captain Benjamin Sisko is my favorite Star Trek Captain, (followed very closely by Captain Edward Jellico), by a country mile. In comparison to other Star Trek captains, Sisko is a man who is a father, a builder, a religious figure, a man of science, a conflicted patriot who has made some brutal calls, and a warrior. In the course of the series, \u201cDeep Space Nine\u201d, it\u2019s not enough to just hear Sisko talk about ideals\u2026 he puts his ideals into action. He also has to learn, change, and grow\u2026 more so than any other Star Trek captain, in my opinion, as he becomes more closely tied to the religion of Bajor and his son grows up. Avery, the clip above, makes a great distinction between playing a character, and playing into a stereotype. He didn\u2019t try to play a \u2018black captain\u2019\u2026 he played a person who also happened to be black. For good character writing, focus on the character first\u2026 who this character is, what they think, what they stand for, what they believe in, what they fear, what need, and what they want. Then layer in other attributes that inform that character. But don\u2019t fall into the trap of writing for attributes. \u201cI\u2019m writing a strong, female character!\u201d - This can be the kiss of death. Write a good character first that the audience can believe in who also is a woman, this will take care of itself. Struggle:  Good characters struggle. The effort it takes for that character to get out of whatever jam that they are in is what endears them to the audience. Characters that win too easily don\u2019t capture our attention as easily as characters who have the odds stacked against them. Let\u2019s take a look at the classic film, \u201cDie Hard\u201d. John McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time. He\u2019s a New York cop on the outs with his wife at a party he doesn\u2019t fit in at when it gets taken over by a bunch of thieves hell-bent on making the police and FBI dance to their tune. They are well-armed, well-trained\u2026 hell, even well-spoken! John doesn\u2019t have a chance in hell of beating them\u2026 but that\u2019s what makes the movie so good! There\u2019s a lot of different ways to make a character struggle, but the important thing is that character DOES struggle. Adapting, improvising, overcoming, or digging deep and just finding something inside of us that we didn\u2019t know was there before makes a struggling character into a hero we want to cheer for.  And really briefly, let\u2019s talk about some other, more secondary goals that can help you make a great character. Be written with a target audience in mind:  You don\u2019t *have* to do this, but it can help. Harry Potter is a great example of a story, character, and setting that was originally designed with children in mind as the target audience. You still can\u2019t skip the other things I mentioned, but for sure, knowing the audience you are writing for can help inform the character you are writing. But, with that in mind, don\u2019t cheat your audience. Characters like Harry Potter or Spider-Man, though written for a target demographic, had WIDE appeal because the themes, arcs, and struggles of the characters were very well done and therefore resonated with audiences far outside the target demographic. May not fit traditional archetypes:  This is where we\u2019re walking a little on the wild side\u2026 I\u2019m talking about Anti-heroes, Anti-Villains, or characters don\u2019t necessarily fit in the traditional \u201cGood guy vs. Bad guy\u201d kinds of molds. Comics like The Punisher and Daredevil, TV Shows like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d, movies like, \u201cSneakers\u201d and \u201cGone in 60 Seconds\u201d, etc. feature protagonists and characters who can be morally bankrupt. Good characters in these types of stories still need the basics: they need depth, they need to struggle, and they need good arcs. But this also hopefully shows that you don\u2019t need to have a story where the good guy is always wins or that we can\u2019t root for the bad guy once in a while. Have wiggle room for the author to speak: This can be really well done, or quite frankly, very annoying. Use with caution.  On some level, you, as the writer, are going to be expressing opinions through the mouths of your characters. If you planned arc, you\u2019ve decided on themes, then at some point, a character will open their mouth and whatever morality or thematic decisions you want to impart upon the audience will come out. Andrew Shepherd, (and most of the characters in the movie, \u201cThe American President\u201d), serve, (in part), as Aaron Sorkin\u2019s commentary about his views on politics. There are good ways to do this and many, many, many bad ways to do this. I\u2019m not going to go into too much detail here because this honestly worthy of it\u2019s own article. To some extent, your voice as the author needs to be heard in the piece you write\u2026 but need to make sure you don\u2019t sabotage your own work by making this the all-encompassing desire of your writing. Which brings me to a related point\u2026. Avoid making an author insert/Mary Sue/Marty Stu!     Drizzt Do\u2019Urden is a very popular character from R.A. Salvatore\u2019s fantasy novels\u2026 he\u2019s also a gigantic Marty Stu. He\u2019s memorable for a lot of the wrong reasons in storytelling. Making a Marty Stu or Mary Sue is a huge trap that\u2019s not always easy to avoid, and I\u2019m not saying that the character still can\u2019t be popular or loved. They just won\u2019t be as good as they could be in comparison to other characters in fiction. I remember when I first read, \u201cThe Crystal Shard\u201d, I felt like Drizzt was taking over the book from Wulfgar, who was being presented as the main hero of the story. And that\u2019s exactly what happened\u2026 Drizzt became the flagship character and pet for R.A. Salvatore. I stopped reading Salvatore\u2019s Drizzt books because the character started to become really annoying. Kirito is the main character from \u201cSword Art Online\u201d, and one of the worst protagonists I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t want to write a novel about it here, but it boils down to \u201che\u2019s special, because he just IS!\u201d which is pretty much the kiss of death in my book for taking the character seriously. Rey is a hotly-debated figure in the new Star Wars films, and regardless of whether you feel she is a Mary Sue or not, we can see through interviews with J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy that she is a \u2018designed\u2019 to be a \u2018strong, female character\u2019. Check back up with Avery Brooks on what that\u2019s a bad idea. For Rey, it\u2019s hard to watch on her on screen in the Force Awakens because she\u2019s never truly in danger. She flies better than Han, fights better than Luke, and can escape captivity at-will, unlike Leia. She can do anything the plot demanded, from speaking Wookie and Droid, to fixing the Falcon, to wielding a lightsaber and beating a Sith with no training. When compared to Ellen Ripley or John McClane, or heck\u2026 Luke Skywalker, Rey falls flat because she doesn\u2019t need any other characters, has no real initiative or journey, has no personal stakes, and no arc to follow. America Chavez from Marvel Comics is an example of an author\u2019s mouthpiece\u2026 in reverse, in some ways. She was created to be a half-black, half-latina lesbian super hero, and Marvel actually found a half-black, half-latina lesbian, Gabby Rivera, to write for the character. But as such, the character has devolved into a sounding board for Rivera\u2019s political opinions. Many of the books at Marvel at the time, (2017), were canceled and relaunched, but the bottom line was that they didn\u2019t sell very well. This can be a large trap for authors\u2026 do you write what the audience wants or what you want? That\u2019s a decision that is up to you\u2026 there\u2019s no right or wrong answer. But if the conversation is about good characters, then take note that good work on good characters almost always finds its audience.  At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of great books about how to write, and these are my thoughts from what I\u2019ve read and experienced from different forms of fiction. There\u2019s no hard-and-fast rules, but in general, good characters do share a lot in common despite being so vastly different. Good characters usually are defined by their character and actions, by their struggles, by the themes the writer tries to connect to, and usually have clear arc that the writer uses to try to bring the character along to a particular destination.

            "answer_text": "While I believe there are ton of things that go into great character creation, here are my basics when I\u2019m writing a story: CHARACTER NAME A relevant and appropriate character name is imperative to your story. Keep things like genre, time frame, and social status in mind when building your characters and determining their names. CHARACTER BACKSTORY Though you won't divulge your character's entire backstory in your novel, you should know it all. Or at least have it compiled in one place, so you can easily reference the information. This goes into a later tip, which talks about character consistency. THEIR PERSONALITY & STYLE Personality and style are two things that attribute to our individuality, so we shouldn't forget them with our characters. Know who your characters are (inside and out) and let them shine in the eyes of their readers. Make them different - not just a generic, cardboard cutout or shadowed silhouette. THEIR SECRETS Though this ties into character backstory, knowing your characters secrets is key to understanding how they might react in certain situations, and how they might shy away from others. AGENCY Don't gift your characters agency. DEMAND IT. You know who they are (if you created a character profile), so you know how they'll react and their actions given certain situations. Your characters shouldn't be wallflowers, unless that's the exact arc type your writing. PERSONAL MOTIVATION Outline and define your character's motivations behind their decisions, and clearly communicate this with your readers. You don't need to spell it out for them or hand-hold them through the process. Show them through their agency and actions. BALANCED STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES As you build your characters you'll likely have an idealistic vision of who they are. But also during this process, you'll need to identify what their strength counterparts are, and how you can exploit that in your writing. All too often people focus on the strengths, and not enough on the parts that make their characters more... human. Not only will your characters HAVE flaws and weaknesses, but you'll need to exploit them throughout your story to make them relatable to your readership. CONNECTIONS, OR LACK THEREOF Throughout your story, your character should be building connections with the antagonist and supporting cast in your story. Communicate and use these connections, or lack thereof, to dive deeper into the psyche of your characters and show your readers who they truly are. DEPTH & COMPLEXITY Every tip on this list builds to the depth and complexity of your characters, and you'll need that complexity to relate and engage with your readers. No one wants to read about flat, one-dimensional, or filler-esque characters. No one wants a \"insert anyone\" character. Make your characters REAL. Make them tangible. CONSISTENCY If you refer and update your character profile, you should be writing consistent characters. It's good to note that consistent doesn't mean they aren't growing, but they shouldn't have stark and unwarranted changes that leave your readers confused and annoyed. THE GROWTH FACTOR Though they should be consistent, your character should grow as a person throughout their journey. Otherwise, it wouldn't be much of a journey, now would it? Ensure your characters grow by giving them obstacles they must overcome to reach their objective. ",
