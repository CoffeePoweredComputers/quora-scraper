            "answer_text": "As a B2B SaaS company, we actually have a similar target demographic, only web agencies or marketing and SEO agencies who are creating sites for clients. While our blog is hosted on our own platform, I'll have to agree with Fran\u00e7ois Lanthier Nadeau,  Medium is an amazing place to publish with a large, active community to boot. The \"tech\" category alone has 26k followers and \"technology\" has around 13k. The platform itself is extremely easy to use and on the flip side, it also serves as a great place to find inspiration for your next blog.  Aside from Meduim, you also have LinkedIN's publishing platform which is a highly underrated but extremely effective medium of distributing content to both your community and potential customers. While it might not be considered a traditional blogging platform, it's highly targeted with much of the audience you are reaching, decision-makers or influencers. A new kid on the block that I haven't yet tried out but would like to, is Exposure.so.  I'm not sure how relevant it would be to your service, but as a web design platform, I'm looking forward to having our designers test it out to compose stories about our company visually. I feel that it will be a good way to deliver content to our users who are highly visual by nature. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Do you already have a website/domain name? If so, make sure you either 1) use your existing CMS or static site generator to create a Blog section (e.g. yoursite [dot] com/blog) or 2) use another platform (WordPress, Ghost, etc.) with a custom subdomain to firmly attach the blog to your product website (e.g. blog [dot] yoursite [dot] com). Having your own, self-hosted blog will greatly benefit your business mid to long term on a SEO level. Especially if you include smart SEO considerations in your content strategy. I mean, chances are your small to medium tech business targets will be actively searching online for tools and ways to optimize their business or solve their problems, right? Ranking for a few mid to long tail keywords on Google will most definitely do your business some good. At Snipcart, our own blog helps us rank and drive lots of highly-converting traffic. And running a self-hosted blog is the best way to go about this approach. However, you don't want to rely solely on Google to leverage your blog. You want to build an audience. And that stuff doesn't quite come easy. Crafting your own content and distributing it through existing, go-to channels (social media, email) is a long term game. In your case, to jumpstart traction and followings, I'd give Medium a shot for sure. It's an active, clean blogging platform that's constantly animated thanks to a passionate community. It's also a very popular place to go discuss SaaS, startups and tech in general. I'd be willing to bet a few bucks that your small to medium tech businesses targets are already reading stuff on Medium and interacting with it. So go ahead, use existing blog posts to publish on Medium (with appropriate \"this post originally appeared on [...]) mentions, or write quality content exclusively on the platform.  There are a few cool collections on Medium that might just pick up your articles. And everyone that's following you will get notified when you publish + receive email digests with your content. It's a good way to go make a name for yourself and your business, and drive back potential users to your own product site. Hope this helps a bit. :) ",
