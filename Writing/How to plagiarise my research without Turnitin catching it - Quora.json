            "answer_text": "It's easy. At the end of any piece of information that you plagiarize, write in parentheses the last name of the author you stole from, the year of publication of the material you are stealing, and the page number you got it from. Then, at the end of your writing or in a footnote, write the author's full name title and date of the publication.
