            "answer_text": "The baseline is the end line at each \u201cend\u201d of the court. The court boundaries demarcating the long dimension of the court. So, when \u201ca player drives baseline\u201d this is referring to a dribble drive from the wing toward that boundary. Of course if their foot touches that line, they went out of bounds. Or, another example is that after a team scores, the opposing team will be in-bounding from the baseline. ",
