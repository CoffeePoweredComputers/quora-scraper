Some exceptions that are important to consider is the political framework of any country that you are residing in. For example, if you live in a nation with a Muslim government, you may wish to take caution in what you might write about Mohammed. Or if you lived in a nation such as Thailand, you might want to be very careful what you wrote about a past king. ",
