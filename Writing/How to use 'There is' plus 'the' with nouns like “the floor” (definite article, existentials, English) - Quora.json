If you say there\u2019s the coffee cup, it\u2019s not existential there\u2014it means it\u2019s over there. It can be replaced by here is the coffee cup. If I say, There\u2019s a problem with the coffeemaker, that cannot be rephrased as here\u2019s a problem with the coffeemaker. This is existential There. I can\u2019t use a definite article and say the problem. But if I say, Where\u2019s the coffeemaker? Here\u2019s the coffeemaker. there\u2019s the coffeemaker, then it\u2019s an adverb of place. And it uses the definite article. So my sense is that Existential there precludes the definite article. ",
