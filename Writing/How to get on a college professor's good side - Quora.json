            "answer_text": "TL;DR: Ask good questions. Assuming you\u2019re just in a professor\u2019s class, then it\u2019s pretty easy to get on a professor\u2019s good side. Professors work pretty hard and have lots of responsibilities that go far beyond the class room. Most professors generally enjoy teaching, but most univerisities say that a course should typically account for 25% of their effort per class. So they\u2019re supposed to be putting in 10 or so hours per week. This time should include the class time, the prep for each class, the creation of the homework and exams, the grading of the exams, and the office hours. If that sounds like a tall order, it is and most professors generally they go far beyond that allotted time. With that in mind, most professors want to feel like they are making a difference in the education of the students. Most professors don\u2019t consider grades part of the education, so asking about every point on a homework or exam is not going get on their good side. Student work is meant to help students diagnose their own understanding and help them with the learn the material, it is not the end-all. Asking well-formed questions about in-course material that you find confusing is really valuable. Chances are other students have similar confusions and so these types of good questions can help the entire class. Good questions are all unique, but bad questions come in lots of common shapes and sizes. When students are trying to ask good questions, they typically run afoul in common ways asking about something out of context to the classIn Calc 2, asking \u201cHow does this relate to Stokes theorem?\u201d \u2014 to which the professor thinks \u201cumm it does, but only one or two people in the class have the context to understand it.\u201dasking about something that is nit-picky\u201cIs that 2.5 centimeters per inch or 2.54?\u201d \u2014 to which the professor thinks \u201cwere you really confused about that?\u201d(I\u2019ll try to expand this later). Good questions are ones that are about synthesizing information. Oftentimes there are long discussions on something specific and the main point can get lost. If the professor doesn\u2019t circle back to the big picture, asking \u201cWhat is the bigger picture of X?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see how X and Y relate?\u201dif it was about an example \u201cHow is X an example of Y?\u201d\u201cHow is X used in practice?\u201dThese will likely stimulate good discussion and they\u2019re about learning the material.

            "answer_text": "Demonstrate genuine interest in the subject matter by reading ahead, thinking, and asking good questions. Do the very best work you can, and seek help when you are stuck. Put in the work. Then do some more \u2026 master the assigned material, and then think beyond that, to further implications and connections with what you have learned. Make connections to other subjects you are interested in, especially if there is something you might know more about than the prof, because profs love to learn from their students. Think rigorously, not sloppily. If your course material requires writing, draft and rewrite and polish until it is the best you can do, and then study your prof\u2019s critique of your writing so that you can do it even better next time. If your course involves projects, draft and revise and polish your projects until they are the best you can do, and then study the feedback you receive so that you can do it even better next time. Go to office hours, but go prepared: Make good use of your prof\u2019s time by getting as far as you can before asking questions, whether they are questions about the assigned work or questions on related material of interest to you. Be humble, but be courageous enough to share ideas you are not sure of. It isn\u2019t easy. You can\u2019t fake it. But if you have a genuine interest in the prof\u2019s subject, and are willing to work for it, that\u2019s what it takes. ",
