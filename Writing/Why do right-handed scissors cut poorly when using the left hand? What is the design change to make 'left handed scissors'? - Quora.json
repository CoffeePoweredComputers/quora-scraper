            "answer_text": "If you think you make a mess of things when using right-handed scissors - you should see the utter bewilderment of a right-hander using left-handed ones!  how scissors are left-handed The blades on left-handed scissors are set so that, whichever way up you hold them, the left blade is always on top. This means that the cutting action of the left hand pushes the blades together to give a smooth cut the whole length of the blades and also that a left-hander has a clear view of the cutting line. When a left-hander uses right-handed scissors, they have to push the thumb and index finger together in an unnatural way to make the scissors cut, causing marks on the hand and eventually callouses. Also, they have to look over the top blade, which obscures the cutting line. With properly designed left-handed scissors these problems do not arise, as your natural cutting action matches that of the scissors. Just hold the scissors straight and naturally and do not try to twist the blades. After a short time, you will be completely comfortable with your new scissors and wonder how you put up with mis-using right-handed scissors for so long! All our scissors are fully left-handed with blades reversed and left hand moulded grips.  Left-Handed Scissors With the blades reversed so the left blade is on top, you can see the cutting line and the blades have a proper cutting action when squeezed together. The grips are moulded to fit comfortably around the thumb joint.  Right-Handed Scissors The top blade covers the cutting line so you usually end up cutting inside it. The blades are pushed apart by the left handed squeezing movement and the paper bends between the blades. Also, the handle shape is very uncomfortable and leaves marks on the left thumb. A word of warning! As we have explained, it is not possible to make \"ambidextrous scissors\", although many manufacturers claim their scissors are \"universal\" or \"suitable for left and right hand use\". This only refers to the handles, which have not been moulded to fit the right hand knuckle, but they have no advantage for left-handers whatsoever as the blades are still set right-handed!

            "answer_text": "The natural action of cutting causes a slight twisting motion in the scissors. If you're using right-handed scissors in your right hand, this tends to push the blades together, ensuring a clean cut. Use them in your left hand, and the same twist tends to force the blades apart. This will either make a poor cut or cause the paper to slip between the blades. The cut line is also obscured by the top blade of the scissors, which will be on the right of the cut whichever way up you hold them. This makes you less accurate. For this reason, there are no true 'universal' scissors. Most that are sold as such simply have symmetrical handles, so you can hold them in either hand. However, the blades are still set right-handed and so have the same problems when used in the left hand. The solution is a set of proper left-handed scissors. These are a mirror-image of common right-handed scissors. The blades are set the opposite way so that the left blade is always on top. These can be used by a left-handed person without difficulty. It's somewhat amusing to see a right-handed person struggle to use them and suddenly understand the issue a lefty faces ;) ",
