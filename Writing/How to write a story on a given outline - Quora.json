            "answer_text": "A lot of the writing depends on what kind of story you want to write. IMO there are mainly two types in which you could tell a story. The first one is straight forward way of stating the story.  Imagine how a children's story or a fairy tale would be. Direct approach to the story. No hidden implications or indirect inferences necessary.The second one is fairly convoluted way of writing a story. Lots of hidden nuances and indirect innuendos conveyed by subtle hints. Now, you have to have the whole story clear in your head. Again, it's my opinion. Others would differ. Descriptions of the scenes, characters, the feelings of the characters and the author[you], the narrative, giving little hints which would lead to the main plot will fill up the story nicely. Use of grandiloquent words is up to your discretion :) Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the outline carefully once or twiceTry to pick out some real life incident which has some resemblance to the story lineTry to focus on one main character and use he/she instead of a specific nameyou can even take a leap in time in your story , for eg: 10 years later she is  standing at the same spot, wondering\u2026..Use quotes in the endingFocus more on the starting.. Your starting needs to be really impressiveTry to bring plot twists.. Something which would be less likely to happen in a random situationYou can include some social message as wellLastly and MOST IMPORTANTLY , Use your imagination , imagination encircles the world. I hope these points help you.. Best of luck:)",
