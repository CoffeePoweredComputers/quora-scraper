            "answer_text": "Thanks for your A2A. Tricks Professionals Use For Richer Writing... 1) Create an evocative scene in two steps. The first step is to create a visual picture. Follow that with a second sentence making use of one the other sense. In other words show something then evoke a smell, taste, sound or feeling. \"The trellis was alive with yellow flowers. The sweet scent of jasmine hung in the warm night air.\"  2) Deepen a character with two distinctive traits, one physical and one psychological. Use these traits throughout your story to lock that character in the mind of the reader. For example your heroine could wear glasses and be afraid of highway driving. During the novel have her push her glasses up her nose, or clean them, or drop them. Have her take back roads or be late because she won't take the interstate.  Using something funny or odd endears your character to the reader. Let's say our hero always seems to be invisible to waiters. Much as he tries, he can never get their attention. They walk right by him. 3) Create a mood in two steps. Mood is often tied in with emotions. Setting a mood isn't an easy task. Begin with a detail: \"A car pulled into the driveway.\" Next announce the mood change because of that action. \"Even before looking, she knew it would be bad news.\"  \"The mail dropped through the slot and hit the floor and suddenly there was a morning rush feeling in the house.\"  4) Create a memory in two steps. Memories bring details to scenes that otherwise wouldn't be there. Start with a physical object and then associate it with a memory by the use of senses. For example a pressed prom corsage could conjure up memories of her date coming up the walk with the plastic flower box in his hand, his hair slicked back and dark with gel, and his tie a little crooked.  5) Twist a plot in two moves. Throw trouble at your characters. Make it totally surprising. \"It was the anniversary of his wife's death, something he never got over. That night as he was watching a live webcam of people in Times Square, he saw his wife walk by.\"  This works well with secondary characters. \"Mary was stunned to learn that her quiet housewife neighbor was a phone sex operator at night. How could she let that woman babysit her kids now?\"  6) Deepen your storyline two ways. Use a witty remark or choose a subject at the beginning of your story, then repeat it near the end. Search for sentences that sum up the mood of the piece or some object that will tie the piece together. A man buys a fishing tackle box at a yard sale. At the end of the chapter have him fishing for a way to ask our heroine out. Or say she hooked him better than any lure in the box. Use of a symbol. Yellow is usually a cheerful color but make it always bring trouble to your hero. Maybe a school bus hits his car, or he tries to impress a woman who is wearing a yellow dress and he fails miserably. When he sees yellow, he walks the other way. This symbol could also be figurative. For example, the heroine could live on the banks of a river. As with a river she finds her life rushing by or flowing or raging.  7) Create a distinct voice with two techniques. Regardless of their use of language, if your characters still sound alike give them vocal differences by use of pitch, timber, or volume. Another way to differentiate them is by use of unusual or exaggerated behavior. \"You make me sick,\" Tom said his voice low and menacing. \"And you're an angel?\" Ray's shrill voice carried across the bar. He smiled as he cracked the knuckles in his right hand with a sickening pop.  Throughout the story keep Tom's voice deep and mean. Tom doesn't chit chat; he gets right to the point. Ray likes to be more physically aggressive, cracking his knuckles, making fists and generally being macho. You won't get these two men confused if you keep them in character.  8) Craft your comparisons. Descriptions like tall, fat, old and funny are too vague. And boring. She had large eyes. \"She has Bette Davis eyes.\"  The young man was well built. \"He reminded her of a Spanish matador with his dark hair hitting his collar, and his muscular chest showing through his open shirt.\"  She was fat. \"The lady was unable to get out of her chair, her generous bottom catching the arms and holding her prisoner.\"  Now you're writing like the pros.

            "answer_text": "What is blocking you? Do you write descriptions but don\u2019t like them? Do you have descriptions but you don\u2019t feel they are very clear? I\u2019m going to assume that you either don\u2019t know what to describe, don\u2019t know what your are describing, or don\u2019t know how to describe it. So I\u2019m going to walk briefly through some ideas of point-of-view, research, aids, five-senses, and integration.  Fiction has a point of view. It is a shaped experience, a selective experience. The point of view may be an omniscient, distant, and silent observer. Or it may be the intimacy of first-person narrative. Modern fiction, particularly genre fiction, gravitates toward first person, and third person singular. That is, the words on the page are the words of a person experiencing those events. \u201cI saw the fire erupt.\u201d Or \u201cShe felt the heat of the fire on her skin.\u201d So description is what that person sees. It is also what that person notices. It is also what that person feels about it. \u201cA steam locomotive pulled in, red and black, hissing and huge. Harry\u2019s eyes went huge.\u201d \u201cA cherry 4\u20130\u20138 Lex-Paulson-Robely prime mover in red and black livery pulled in, cylinder vents popping with that sweet, sweet cloud of hot vapor. Sarah wondered would it would take to get a checkout ride.\u201d \u201cSome kind of old-fashioned crock wheezed in. I hoped they weren\u2019t gonna make us ride in it.\u201d Same train. Three very different impression, filtered through opinion and focus and personal knowledge and experience.  To describe it, you need to know it. You need to become an observer. And you need to read and watch and listen and more. I didn\u2019t research the above; the railfan POV there is meant to be a laughably bad attempt because if I actually did the research I\u2019d be all day just writing this post. But let\u2019s keep it simple for now. Writing a scene that is in a place? Here\u2019s the easy stops: Weather. There are several websites that let you pull up the weather for anywhere and (within reason) any when on the globe. I just finished writing a rooftop meeting\u2026with the nearly-full moon behind them and a chilly night breeze and yeah, between NOAA and other sites I could work out everything down to the tide tables. The map, please. Building interiors are a different challenge (please don\u2019t ask about what I had to go through to write the scene after they got off that roof) but exteriors and city streets and so forth it may be that google maps is all you need. What it looks like. Besides using the google-earth satellite and pseudo-3d view, street view and the linked amateur pictures. And I\u2019ve been making a lot of use of various people\u2019s video tours \u2014 again, free to watch and just a couple of search terms away. That right there gives you the difference between, \u201cIt was daytime. They went into a house that was on the street.\u201d And, \u201cThe sun was breaking through clouds as I stepped out into rolling hills of coarse green grass, marked by tufts of bracken and spattered with golden leaves. Woods lurked behind low stone walls, outlying copses surrounded by their own little split-log fences. Gray outcrops of rock came through the ground at intervals and there were birds everywhere and at any moment James Herriot was going to pop out from around a tree.\u201d  This answer is getting long so I\u2019m going to be brief about organizing. I use Scrivener exclusively so I am able to create research folders for every location. I cut and paste excerpts from research material and paste in-line images. For the previous book I had so much back-and-forth in one city I finally screen-captured a big chunk of map and drew all over it so I could keep track of where my locations were relative to each other. I\u2019m in clean-up on a scene right now in a new location and I have images of the inside of the place pasted right into the text so I can reference them as I write.  Five-senses writing is that although we are primarily visual creatures calling on the other senses fleshes out a description and also gives it more emotional impact. Because of this impact, the smell, the sound, the heat, the feel; those are the things where the personality of the observer can come into focus. When you have your point-of-view character notice the cold, the reader sympathizes and shivers with them. Five-senses is also when the research can get fun. I write with local and appropriate music playing in the background. For the last book I ate some of the foods. For the current book I tried out a sling. This touches on the appearance of verisimilitude as well as the emotional impact. Being able to correctly name ouzo or show what it looks like is one thing. Being able to describe the way it clouds before your eyes when cold water or ice is added, and describe the bite of it (like getting hit in the throat with a licorice stick), well, that is something else indeed. It gives the text immediacy and impact and emotion and it makes the reader say to themselves, \u201chey, this guy knows stuff.\u201d  And that leads us however indirectly to integration. Huge blocks of unbroken description are, well, unusual. In most cases, you want the person in the picture. Notice the above; \u201cI stepped..\u201d So now we\u2019ve got our protagonist interacting, no matter how slightly, with the scenery. And at the end of it, she makes an observation and a quip. So break it up with action, even if it is just camera moves, \u201cHe looked to his left. The trees were thinner there, and he thought he caught a glimpse of sky.\u201d Pause the description to have them do something even if it is no more than tying their shoes. And of course dialog and interaction. \u201cA bird was singing somewhere above them. \u2018Nightingale?\u2019 Thomas guessed. Sarah snorted. \u2018Are you kidding? That\u2019s too shrill and loud for a nightingale.\u2019\u201d So we\u2019ve added more to the description, but we\u2019ve also added more understanding of the characters in the scene. And that\u2019s all I have today! ",
