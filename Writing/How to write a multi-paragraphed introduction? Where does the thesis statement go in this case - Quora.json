            "answer_text": "How can I write a multi-paragraphed introduction? Where does the thesis statement go in this case? The introduction to a research paper simply introduces the topic being researched. The introduction contains - A topic sentence.A thesis statement.Three to five reasons, details and/or facts supporting your research.A conclusion (relatively brief).After briefly stating your topic, you give your point of view on the topic directly and often in one sentence. This sentence is the thesis statement, and it serves as a summary of the argument you'll make in the rest of your paper. It also makes a comment about your position in relation to the topic. Where does the thesis statement go? The thesis statement - Usually appears near the beginning of a paper. It can be the first sentence of an essay, but that often offers an unexciting beginning.It more frequently appears at or near the end of the first paragraph or two.A good practice is to put the thesis statement at the end of your introduction.If you place the thesis statement at the beginning, your reader may forget about the main idea by the time he reaches the end of the introduction. A good introduction conceptualizes the thesis statement.",
