            "answer_text": "The Japanese have 3 alphabets they use in writing: -Hiragana, which is syllabic and used for words of japanese origin -Katakana, which is also syllabic, but is used for words of foreign origin, especially the many anglicisms the japanese have incorporated into their vocabulary -Kanji, which is ideographic and uses almost the same characters that the Chinese language does The Chinese, on the other hand, have only one alphabet compromised of ideograms known as Kanji. ~ Distinguishing alphabets, a beginners course:  Japanese (left) vs. Chinese (right) writing In Japanese, Hiragana characters are mostly curved: \u3055\u3063\u304b , Katakana ideograms are in their majority formed by straight lines: \u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8 And Kanji uses complex symbols derived from the chinese alphabet. Japanese writing combines all three of these writings. If you can't find curved or straight figures in a text, you're probably looking at chinese! Hope this helped:) ",

            "answer_text": "No. They had their own innovations. - They took in the Chinese characters as Kanji, part of their writing system. But they also created new symbols by taking some characters (or parts of them), and call them Hiragana and Katakana. Hiragana are usually whole Chinese characters in shorthand font. Like \u306c, which is shorthand for \u5974, and \u3042, which is shorthand for \u5b89. Katakana are usually parts of Chinese characters in printed style. \u30d2 is part of \u6bd4, \u30db is part of \u4fdd (the lower-right part). Hiragana and Katakana are used as phonetic symbols. Their pronunciation are usually similar to that of their original character. ",
