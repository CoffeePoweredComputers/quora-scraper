            "answer_text": "Hi Friend, There could be many reasons behind having a bad handwriting. Some of them include having worked in a career that does not give absolute importance to good handwriting. There are other reasons like laziness, sheer apathy, etc.  Following factors make the handwriting neat and clean! Constant length of letters and spacing between wordsUniformity across entire content (the end should be as beautiful as the start!)Each letter and word should be distinctly visibleIf you wish to make your handwriting neat and clean, you can do so within a month's time! :) Kindly follow the plan mentioned below: Day 1: (time: 60 minutes) Develop a prototype. Decide 'how' you are going to write. Based on your experience, chose a style that best resonates with you and one that suits you the most. Come up with a standard handwriting style that you would follow 'ALWAYS'. Refer a guide for best practices on day 1 and have a master copy of your handwriting style in mind 'always'. Do not change it EVER!  Day 2: (time: 30 minutes) Take a small page assignment , and write it the best way you can. Take twice the amount of time you would take to write it normally. FOLLOW the standard script you had made earlier, no matter what.  Day 3:  Now that you have already accomplished writing in the best way you can, your mind has already gained confidence that you can write in a good handwriting style. DONE. This is what is needed - making your mind believe you can do it. Take up writing assignment but continue to allocate more time for writing any thing that you would otherwise do faster. Day 4 to Day 15:  Persist. Allocate more time to write anything you are writing. On Day 15, analyze your progress. Tell your mind that your handwriting has improved. Rectify any mistakes you had been doing, and continue. Remember to follow the same PROTOTYPE that you had made earlier.  Day 16 to Day 30:  Improve on Speed. This would be easy as you had been practicing to write the same way since 15 days now.  Last but not the least: FORGET that your handwriting was not so good once. Take up every writing assignment with an aim to make it a 'MASTERPIECE.' All the Best! You can do it!!! :) If you like my answer, please follow my Quora blog: Yog.World ",

            "answer_text": "Probably because you never learned how to write properly. Writing, unlike other human skills such as walking or speaking, does not come naturally as we grow up, but painstakingly, after several years of dedication. This is because our hands are not made for the extremely fine, repetitive movements required for good handwriting. When little children learn to write, at the very beginning they use their fists: the muscles of their fingers do not yet have the necessary coordination to hold a pencil. Later on, at 5 or 6 years old, they do possess the coordination to hold the pencil between the fingers, but not the strength (and patience) required to make steady vertical or horizontal strokes the size of our letters. Each letter tends to have a different size; strokes are shaky, the sequence usually going downwards, towards the right corner of the page. Learning how to write properly takes huge amounts of patience and dedication. It\u2019s not a skill you can learn in a few days or even a few months. New habits need to be developed and it takes as much self indulgence as it takes determination in order not to despair. ",
