            "answer_text": "To be correct, a sentence must begin with a capital letter and end with some kind of punctuation. So perhaps you mean: \u201cMy exams are finished.\u201dand\u201cHave my exams finished?\u201d If this is what you meant, then note that the first is a statement and the second is a question. Both are correct but (of course) have different meanings. But perhaps you mean \u2018Which is better?\u2019 -\u201cMy exams are finished.\u201dor\u201cMy exams have finished.\u201d Both statements are correct, and the meaning is the same. I would choose \u2018My exams are finished\u2019, or \u2018My exams are over\u2019. Or I might say \u2018I have finished my exams\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "My exams are finished is a correct and complete sentence. Regarding the second phrase, if you had included the pronoun, I, it would have been a complete sentence. I have my exams finished. There are people who would say it that way, but I wonder how well they did on the exams if that is how they speak English, assuming English is their first language. But you did not include the pronoun, I, so the phrase is incorrect. One could also say, I have finished my exams. ",
