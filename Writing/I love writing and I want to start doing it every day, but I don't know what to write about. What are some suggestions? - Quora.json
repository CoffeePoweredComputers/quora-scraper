            "answer_text": "Since we don\u2019t know one another, I\u2019m going to have to make a number of assumptions, but I\u2019m hoping the gist of my answer will allow you to make the necessary adjustments if my assumptions are off-base. First of all, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re talking about writing fiction, since you\u2019re looking for ideas to get you started. Second, I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re an adult. If you are, your question is probably the single one most asked by people who start thinking seriously about writing as adults. Those who begin writing as kids or teenagers are usually born with the writer\u2019s bug and seldom lack for ideas or motivation. To keep this as simple as possible let me start with the most important thing; don\u2019t think that you have to be a \u201cgreat natural writer\u201d to start writing, or that you must produce something that will immediately become a best-selling book, or even get published. Leave all that ambitious stuff for way down the road. Your first objective is to make a start, and you\u2019ll never do that if you\u2019re weighing yourself down with tons of unrealistic expectations. Also, begin training yourself to avoid passing judgment on how good a writer you are until you\u2019ve produced a lot of work. Don\u2019t get into a competition with your favorite writers, or folks you know who are experienced writers. Leave that for way down the road, too. Your only priority is to make a start! There are countless millions of folks out there who will never write a thing because they\u2019ve intimidated themselves into a state of permanent immobility with a lot of unrealistic expectations, one of which is that you\u2019ve got to have a ton of natural talent to produce anything worthwhile. Forget all that. Now, as for what you should write. I don\u2019t know you, but I absolutely know that you\u2019ve got plenty of ammunition for a story. How do I know that? Because you\u2019ve been alive and kicking around this planet for two or three decades at least (I\u2019m assuming again, so adjust accordingly). You\u2019ve been places, done things, met lots of people, gotten into weird situations, known love and loss and probably grief, and your friends and loved ones have shared a ton of their own experiences with you, so you have their lives to call on, as well. Also, if you\u2019re thinking of becoming a writer you\u2019re probably a pretty dedicated reader also. If you\u2019re not a reader, you\u2019d better start right now, because the one thing that really will prevent you from being a decent writer is not reading what other people write. And if you don\u2019t really like to read, my suggestion is to find another avocation/activity to pursue. If you\u2019re not a reader, writing\u2019s not for you. Try golf instead. But I\u2019m assuming that you are a reader, so you\u2019ve got that experience to borrow from, as well as your own life experience. Next question is, what do you like to think about? What do you love to do? What fascinates you? Start by writing about things you know, love and know something about. If you need more information you\u2019ve got Google, so that\u2019s no problem. Google\u2019s a great idea generator, by the way. Also YouTube. Start looking up details about some topic or historical event you\u2019re really into, and use things you find to fill out your ideas for a story. Don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not a long story. Length doesn\u2019t matter - getting started does, and so does making time to write every day. It\u2019s like taking up an exercise routine; if you don\u2019t build writing time into your daily schedule you\u2019ll never get into a rhythm and you\u2019ll wind up missing more and more days until you\u2019re right back where you started. So once you start, keep it up. And don\u2019t worry about showing what you write to your friends and loved ones. Save the show-and-tell for awhile, until you\u2019ve built up a little confidence and a good writing schedule. Let it be your little secret, then spring it on them when you know your stuff is going to entertain them. Finally, and most important, buy yourself a copy of Stephen King\u2019s how-to-book, On Writing. Steve King, of course, is the world\u2019s best-known and richest horror writer. But it doesn\u2019t matter if you like Stephen King, or horror fiction for that matter. The book has nothing to do with writing horror specifically, or any other genre type of fiction. It\u2019s full of sound, practical advice, and written in plain language without a hint of snobbishness or artsy-fartsy pretentiousness. King is basically a well-educated blue-collar guy, and his approach to writing is very blue-collar, with a strong emphasis on work ethic and stick-to-it mentality. Nothing I could suggest would do you more good than getting your hands on that book, and basically everything I\u2019ve told you you\u2019ll find repeated in King\u2019s volume. It\u2019s not even a long read! But most of all, just start writing, damn it! You\u2019ve got absolutely nothing to lose, and you might be the next Pulitzer Prize winner, so get going and good luck!
