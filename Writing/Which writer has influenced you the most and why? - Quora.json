            "answer_text": "Albert Camus. In certain situations, replying \u201cnothing\u201d when asked what one is thinking about may be pretense in a man. Those who are loved are well aware of this. But if that reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that odd state of soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the chain of daily gestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connect it again, then it is as it were the first sign of absurdity. - Albert Camus, We live in a world where the state of humanity could have put Descartes\u2019 theory to shame. In the 1982 classic, Blade Runner, a robot resents his nearing death by reminiscing how everything he has experienced and seen will be reduced to dust, as if his lifetime left behind no significant value. As if he had never lived at all.The advantage or disadvantage of \u201cthinking\u201d that used to be characteristic of solely humans has lost meaning as humans are getting more mechanical while robots, more cognitive such that soon there will be a time, when humans fail the Turing test. Our histories are wrecked under the weight of a thousand unforgivable genocides and our future is a Schrodinger's tunnel with a light at the end which has every possibility to be a nuclear war. For this world battered down by a human crisis, Albert Camus is an outsider.He is the Sisyphus, who derived meaning even in the impossible and cursed act of rolling a rock to the top of a hill despite knowing that it would inevitably hurl down again. It would be an understatement to shrink his philosophy to be contained within the fathomable walls of existentialism. He is an absurdist; he finds purpose while embracing death with a bare breast. He carries the philosophical question of suicide on his shoulders while having a freedom fighter\u2019s rebellious heart that has never known quitting. He loves life while knowing it\u2019s just another plague. The Myth of Sisyphus begins with the quote, \u201cO my soul do not aspire to immortal life but exhaust the limits of the possible\u201d, hence summarizing his philosophy in a sentence. He reminds time and again, \u201cThe final conclusion of the absurdist protest is, in fact, the rejection of suicide and persistence in that hopeless encounter between human questioning and the silence of the universe\u201d. Reflecting his thoughts even in the fiction he wrote,\u201cI love life - that\u2019s my real weakness. I love it so much that I am incapable of imagining what is not life\u201d, from The Fall.  In a way, absurdism is every layman\u2019s way of life. Our myth and beliefs, our self imposition of religion and theism, our constant struggle to make relationships long-term and permanent, our affinity towards art; all is but an evidence and manifestation of our fear of death and loneliness. \u201cThe certainty of a God giving a meaning to life far surpasses in attractiveness the ability to behave badly with impunity\u201d according to Camus. His revered idol Chestov said, \u201cThe only true solution is precisely where human judgement sees no solution, Otherwise what need would we have of God? We turn towards God only to obtain the impossible. As for the possible, men suffice\u201d. Dostoevksy\u2019s novel Demons which Camus adapted into a play justified Dostoevsky\u2019s theism in a way that his nihilistic and absurdist soul was stripped naked, \u201cMy friends, God is necessary for me if only because he is the one being who can be loved eternally. Therefore God must exist but I know that he does not and cannot exist. Don't you understand that a man with these two thoughts cannot go on living?\" Camus loved theater because he thought art could personify our internal conflict in form of flesh. He seconded the eponymous protagonist of Hamlet, \u201cThe play\u2019s the thing wherein I will catch the conscience of the king\u201d. He did not believe that love had to last long to prove that its strong, that the constancy of its source would validate its purity. He redefined the whole concept of polyamory wondering \u201cWhy should it be essential to love rarely in order to love much?\u201d He decoded even the absurdism of science, deconstructing its monumental image built on the bricks and cement of reason and logic by excavating its foundation. \u201cAt the final stage you teach me that this wondrous and multicolored universe can be reduced to the atom and that the atom itself can be reduced to the electron. All this is good and I wait for you to continue. But you tell me of an invisible planetary system in which electrons gravitate around a nucleus. You explain this world to me with an image. I realize then that you have been reduced to poetry: I shall never know\". Albert Camus did not let his philosophy stick to paper and preaching. Just like he believed defying the urge of suicide would be the ultimate rebellion against the mortality of human life, he advocated co-existing freedom and harmony. He materialized into political terms, this metaphysical rebellion in which man protests against his condition. In a conference in support of the workers riots in East-Berlin (June 1953), he said,\"When a worker, somewhere in the world, raises his bare fists in front of a tank and shouts that he is not slave, what are we then if we remain indifferent ?\"He was a socialist, like Sartre, but unlike him, did not believe in revolutionary violence. They bonded strongly over their philosophical and political approaches but soon a rift led to the souring of their friendship because Sartre believed in radical freedom and hence thought the killing which came with communism was justified. While Camus did not encourage killing just for the sake of an ideal. He thought, \u201cClaiming the unity of the human condition, it is a force of life, not of death. Its most profound logic is not the logic of destruction; it is the logic of creation\u201d.They also had issues in their personal life when Sartre's long term girlfriend and the intellectual feminist Simone de Beauvoir asked Camus out. The issue was not her asking, but Camus' rejection of her offer. When Camus died , many years later Sartre said in contemplation, \"Probably he was my last friend\".  Albert Camus detested absolute freedom since that would mean, one man\u2019s freedom hampering another\u2019s. \u201cAbsolute freedom mocks at justice. Absolute justice denies freedom. Tobe fruitful, the two ideas must find their limits in each other. No man considers that his condition is free if it is not at the same time just, nor just unless it is free. Freedom, precisely, cannot even be imagined without the power of saying clearly what is just and what is unjust, of claiming all existence in the name of a small part of existence which refuses to die.\u201d In his essay \"Reflections on the Guillotine\", he opposed death penalty. \"Society does not believe in the exemplary value of death penalty, that it talks about. Or else it would have exhibit the heads.Society would give executions the benefit of publicity it generally uses for national bond issues or new brands of drinks.Statistics drawn up at the beginning of the century in England show that out of 250 who were hanged, 170 had previously attended/witnessed one or more executions. Showing, fear of death is indeed a fact but however great it may be, has never sufficed to quell human passions.Death penalty is a form of retaliation. Retaliation is related to nature and instinct, not to law. Law, by definition, cannot obtain the same rules as nature\". Having lost a father to the World War 2 and raised by a handicapped mother who lived in the vulnerable Algiers where the French persecuted Arabs and other indigenous inhabitants, he had seen the repercussions of war closely and spoke against Hegel\u2019s interpretation of history being the eventual and progressive drift of mankind towards a definitive goal of universal peace which would mean all wars and genocides were warranted and serving the purpose. His beautiful speech \u201cThe Human Crisis\u201d that he delivered in the United States, still strikes the chords of my heart. It reveals that he must be one of the rare philosophers that human species has ever seen, who cared to combine rationalism and reason, with empathy and humanity. Following is a small part from it, I would like to illustrate through 4 short stories about a time the world is beginning to forget, but which still burns in our hearts. In an apartment building occupied by the Gestapo in a European capital, 2 accused men, still bleeding, find themselves tied up after a night of investigation. The concierge of the building begins her careful household chores in good spirit since she probably just finished breakfast. Reproached by one of the tortured men, she replies indignantly, \"I never interfere with my tenants business.\u201dIn Leon, one of my comrades is dragged from his cell for a 3rd round of questioning. Since his ears have been badly torn during a previous session, he is wearing a bandage around his head. The German officer who interrogates him is the same man who conducted the previous sessions. And yet he asks him, with an air of affectionate concern, \u201cHow are your ears doing?\u201dIn Greece, after an underground resistance operation, a German officer prepares the executions of 3 brothers he has taken as hostages. Their old mother throws herself at his feet and he agrees to save one of them. But only at the condition that she designate which one. She chooses the oldest because he has a family, but her choice condemns the 2 others. Just as the German officer intended.A group of deported women, including one of our comrades, is repatriated to France by way of Switzerland. As soon as they enter Swiss territory, they notice a funeral taking place. And the mere sight of this spectacle sets of their hysterical laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s how the dead are treated here!\u201d they say.I\u2019ve chosen these stories because they allow me to respond with something other than a conventional yes,to the question \"Is there a human crisis?\"They allow me to reply just as the men I was speaking about replied, \u201cYes. there is a human crisis because in today\u2019s world we can contemplate the death or the torture of a human being with a feeling of indifference, friendly concern, scientific interest, or simple passivity.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "James Duncan Lawrence. A writer you probably never heard of because the bulk of his work was ghostwriting. I learned to hate reading as a child. I loved picture books\u2014I could get lost in the images and the story hinted in each image would play out as a story in my head. Learning to read just killed any interest I had in reading. As children advance in reading levels, pictures are used less and less in the narratives. To the point where pictures are dropped completely. It turns out, I needed those pictures to build the image in my mind in which I would begin to watch the story play out while I read. The story subjects chosen for various stories in the readers used for teaching were subjects I had absolutely no interest in. Reading lessons became hideously boring and I began to drift off into daydreams that I found much more interesting. Thus, I struggled with reading and began to fall behind. There was one glimmer of hope. One strange story in the reader that stood out from all the other stories. I still remember when\u2014ignoring the boring reading assignment the teacher gave us, I turned to a different place in the book. I sat up in astonishment! It wasn\u2019t about boring sports. It wasn\u2019t about boring doing chores. It wasn\u2019t about boring other stuff. It was called The Smallest Dragonboy and it was about a boy who got a dragon! I sank into that story like a fish finding the only pond in a desert! Then my teacher caught me as I read it for the fourth time and made me turn the page to the assigned story which was about a boy walking his dog. My soul shriveled. In the third grade at 8-years-old, I then suffered the ultimate humiliation. The kids in my reading group were moved to advanced reading and I was moved to a lesser reading group. I was mortified. I was no longer one of the top kids. I was left behind. I was shoved down into the lower classes with the paste-eating navel-gazers. My social standing was utterly destroyed. My soul dried to a husk. I hated reading. But my tribulations were not yet over, as I would soon be faced with the ultimate test: library day. I enjoyed going to the library. But I normally went right for the media center in the library where I would pull out the film loop cartridges of the Apollo Moon landing and watch the spaceships and daydream. There I would pilot my Lunar Lander down to the surface of the moon, swerving it back and forth looking for a safe landing space until just as the fuel ran out, I would cut the engines and drop onto the surface with a lurch. When I would go to the public library\u2014where my friends and classmates couldn\u2019t see me\u2014I would immediately head for the picture book section where I could fill my head with the images and let them play out the story in my head. That was not what was going to happen today. We had to pick out a book to read at the library and bring it back to read. We marched down to the library, walked through the door and\u2013 The smart kids turned left to the \u201cadult\u201d book section. That\u2019s where the real books were. Of that group, one is now an ambassador for the United States in a very diplomatically difficult and dangerous country. Others became doctors and surgeons, a couple of scientists, some lawyers, politicians, and successful business entrepreneurs. The kids who turned to the right towards the kiddy books\u2026if you hear their names in the news, it is usually about the results their sentencing hearing. I froze. I wanted to head for the kiddy books; a little Dr. Seuss to light up my synapses. But as my former peers disappeared into the stacks to my left, I didn\u2019t want to further my social disgrace by being seen with a kindergarten-level book. As a black depression filled my heart, I turned left and dragged my feet in the direction of the adult books. I had no idea what to look for. I glanced down the aisles where the others went and couldn\u2019t guess at what they were perusing. I made another left turn into a darker corner of the library I had never entered before. It was an odd corner stuffed out of the way, with one light on the shelves. No one could see me here. I was safe. Then I saw it. Have you ever had one of those moments when everything goes silent? When the universe seems to both spread away from you and collapse into one infinitesimal point that you cannot tear your eyes from? I saw it. The universe compressed to a singularity in my mind and my brain exploded with the light of a million stars! On the cover of the book, was the picture of a flying submarine. A FLYING F\u2022\u2022\u2022ING SUBMARINE DAMMIT!!!!!! HOW COULD I NOT KNOW SUCH A BOOK EXISTED!!!!!!! Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter by Victor Appleton II (James Duncan Lawrence, I would later learn) I devoured that book. The teacher had to come find me when it was time to return to the classroom because I was so engrossed in the book. Tom Swift and His Replatron Skyway, \u2026His Triphibian Atomicar. Somewhere reading those two books, a switch got thrown in my brain. With the image on the cover, my brain could construct an image in my mind and instead of the words on the pages, my brain began to construct the images the words described. I stopped seeing words on pages. When I opened a book, I would go into a trance and the print would fade away as the story would play out like a movie in my head. Every one of the books in the Tom Swift series that drew me in like that were written by Lawrence. If it hadn\u2019t been for the stories he wrote, I never would have discovered my love of reading. I would never have reached out to other books and begun to read those when I found I was outgrowing the Tom Swift series. And I dove lovingly into those new books I found. These books were ADVENTURES! They had spaceships, airplanes, exotic locations, dangerous villains. They didn\u2019t deal with such boring subjects as doing chores, fishing, trying to hit a ball. They dealt with survival against dangerous odds, visiting other planets. Trying to solve problems before it was too late for the world. Subjects that just stretched my mind and thoughts to the extents of the universe and beyond even that. There was a whole collection of books I never knew existed and they never let us read in class. I had discovered science fiction! And a year later, I would be introduced to writing. The rest was history. Oh, one other thing: years later, I would come across a story that left me stunned because it was so familiar and wonderful and new at the same time. It was The Dragonriders of Pern, by Ann McCaffrey\u2014the very author who wrote The Smallest Dragonboy I had found 10 years earlier. ",
