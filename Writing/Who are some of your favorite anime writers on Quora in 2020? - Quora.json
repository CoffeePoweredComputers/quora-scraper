            "answer_text": "Personally I\u2019d like to name a few so far. James Pizarro is an amazing Naruto writer. Very informative, straight to the point, and answers things frequently. Very highly quality simple answers.  Next I wanna say Ryan Pennywell. His Naruto and Bleach crossover is arguably my favorite series on all of Quora. It\u2019s very well written and adds more adult actions like cursing which makes more sense. He is also very consistent. And even if one chapter doesn\u2019t get as many upvotes, he keeps going and makes the next one better. It\u2019s insane dedication \ud83e\udd2f  Next is my man Kenroy Paddyfoot, Kenroy has some of, if not the best Bleach analytics on this platform. It\u2019s like when he writes an answer he always does extra. It\u2019s amazing. I may have finished Bleach, but I can\u2019t understand half the things he can.  Another amazing writer is Jesse McCammon. Extremely quality answers. Just like James Pizarro. Short, straight to point answers for when you have a My Hero Academia question. He understands the show in a way I can\u2019t.  Next is Mate Pavi\u0107. Probably the best One Piece related writer on Quora. You can tell he actually knows what he\u2019s talking about and he\u2019s good at showing it. All around great writer definitely check him out.  Jason Murphy is another great Naruto writer who has amazing high quality answers. His analysis\u2019s are great and he puts time into his answers and they come out very nicely!  There are way too many writers for me too name who I love so don\u2019t get butthurt. Some honourable mentions: Nicolas Black, Thomas White, Akiro Laxus, Michael J. Elijah, Jonny Dee ",
