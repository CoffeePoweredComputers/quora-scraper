            "answer_text": "I have never corresponded with a prisoner but I have known people who did. One friend of mine was President of a small songwriting group. A prisoner from the nearest prison asked for critiques regarding his songs - something that the group offered to the general public. My friend provided reasonable but gentle critiques; but promptly regretted it as he began receiving hostile letters from the prisoner escalating in severity after the prisoner was released, causing my friend to severely regret ever responding to the prisoner. However, the situation ended without further incident. If you wish to correspond with anyone in prison, (even a lifer - soft-headed governors have been known to release them, and even lifers have friends who do get out - sooner than you might think), I would suggest at least the following precautions: Ignore any unsolicited letters addressed to you by a prisoner, particularly if addressed to you by name or sent to your home address;Remember whatever you send will likely get passed around in prison to others, who will soon be out and may be far more dangerous than your nominal correspondent;Use a pseudonym for your correspondence, do not under any circumstances use your full name. For myself, I would never send a picture of myself or any of my family or friends. Your prisoner correspondent will ask for or importune you for these;Use a PO Box or Box at a UPS Store as the address on all correspondence. Do not reveal where you work or hang out;Do not believe anything they tell you unless you can verify it completely independently. If they send you a picture, do not believe that they even remotely resemble the picture;If you are not very strong willed, do not write to a prisoner. Many are psychopaths or sociopaths and are extremely skilled at manipulating people. You can expect to be \u201chit up\u201d for money for the canteen, nude pictures, reading materials, etc. Do not be surprised if your kindness is not appreciated, but non-compliance with any request or demand is venomously remembered - after your correspondent gets out.Not all prisoners are disturbed or dangerous; but a great many are. Even if the person you are writing to is a decent, completely innocent person, he is in a situation where he has very strong influences over his behavior by people by others who are far from decent and innocent and may soon be out. Never do anything that could conceivably make it even remotely possible for them to locate you if they are released. If you still wish to correspond with a prisoner, consider corresponding with a prisoner in a foreign country, perhaps England, Australia or New Zealand. The chances of your correspondent greeting you by surprise in the lobby of your Hoboken or Wichita apartment building are far smaller. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a question right back, why would you think it would be dangerous? If you take the normal care you would take writing any other stranger it is no different. A awful lot of people in prison have made a mistake and are paying for that mistake. No one you know including the Pope himself has not done something they could have (notice I didn\u2019t say should have) gone to prison for, this includes yourself. That being said any time you are writing a stranger you should use a little caution and not give out vital information. Stop and think you may actually be doing a good deed giving someone a possible friendship to someone in need, just be careful in what you include in a letter. I know that in the many years I spent in prison I ended up writing quite a few people who were strangers to me and through correspondence I made some very good friendships that have lasted for many years. Those people took a chance and replied to me for whatever question I had and for some of them it began a lifelong friendship. Being careful try it and see if maybe you might have a new found friend.

            "answer_text": "This is one of those questions that depends solely on the person who plans on engaging in writing to an inmate. I have written to many inmates and counseled them, as well. As long as you do so intelligently, I would always recommend it. People are incarcerated for hundreds of different reasons. Honestly, many of them could be the person at your dinner table or mine, these people just got caught. Of course, there are also people in prison for far more serious crimes such as rape, drugs, murder etc. The problem is, more often than not, you won't know a prisoner's charge when you begin to write them. That doesn't mean that they don't need human interaction too. Regardless of the why, they are in prison, which means that if you are going to write to them, you need to do so responsiblely. There are many inmates who just want a friend, prison is a lonely place. There are also inmates who run elaborate schemes for money and other things. Some criminals are master manipulators that are waiting for their next mark. You need to know that most mail is read by guards. So never write anything that you would not write straight to a police officer. Don't EVER include pictures. Set up a PO Box, next city over from yours, and never disclose your address to the inmate. I never used my real name. Keep your personal information, such as siblings, school information, out of your conversations. Don't promise to send anything like books or stamps. If you can, you will, and leave it there. It's very easy to think you're 'falling' for these people. YOU ARE NOT! THEY ARE NOT! It seems complicated. It's a bit tricky, but if you use common sense, it can work. Alot of these people really need that thread of human connection. So, if you feel that you can handle this without getting lost yourself, that would be great. Keep your head, you could always be reaching the percentage that are the manipulators. Look for the signs, and if so, move on. You could also be helping someone during the worst few years of their lives and make a best friend for the rest of yours! Best of luck and be safe!\ud83e\udd40 ",

Don\u2019t say anything in your letter that you wouldn\u2019t want the department of corrections reading because incoming and outgoing inmate mail is screened by prison staff. Otherwise, I urge you to write. In my experience, mail call was always well attended and inmate\u2019s were on good behavior. Unless you have been in prison, you can\u2019t really appreciate how much a letter from a friend or loved one means to someone who is incarcerated. One of the great fears that comes with incarceration is being forgotten. I urge you to write when you can make time to do so. ",
