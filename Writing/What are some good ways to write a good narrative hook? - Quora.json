            "answer_text": "Some of it will depend on genre, but some aspects of writing the first few sentences of a story (whatever the length of story) will hold. You need tension and story questions, even if you\u2019re only establishing a setting. For example: No amount of sunscreen and shade could soften the hot, Arizona day. There\u2019s an implied person or people in that sentence, which adds interest, and the time setting has to be fairly modern, or at least since the advent of sunscreen. There\u2019s some tension there, because heat is uncomfortable. You can do better. How about piquing some interest by twisting expectations? Melissa decided that if there was such a thing as a hot hell, this would be it. We expect hell to be hot, so the specificity of hot hell, not just \u2018if there was such a thing as hell\u2019 is interesting. The character is simply deciding something, though, and that\u2019s static. Melissa decided that if there was such a thing as a hot hell, this would be it, as she took aim with her Barrett MRAD. Now we\u2019ve got story questions in addition to the somewhat quirky phrasing. What is she aiming at? As you progress from the first sentence, ideally you want to answer some questions, especially the ones that readers expect to be answered right away. You don\u2019t want to hold back too much, because the reader will get upset with you. Normal beginner \u2018cheats\u2019 that come off as cheap gimmicks include never naming the primary or point of view character, even when their name would naturally come up, being evasive about the pov character\u2019s identity in other ways so that their role is so ambiguous you start to wonder if they\u2019re simply an AI robot, being evasive about the setting, and so on. But you don\u2019t have to give it all away, either. You can plan your reveals. As long as you keep the narrative lively, and keep the information flowing, you can arrange that information just about any way you like. As you progress into the rest of the paragraph and beyond, you\u2019ll want to continue to add story questions. Usually those story questions get bigger, but less frequent, with an underlying \u2018what\u2019s going to happen next?\u2019 holding it all together. There are some really good books on how to begin stories. You should try some of them. I usually point people to Writing Active Hooks Book 1: Action, Emotion, Surprise and More - Kindle edition by Mary Buckham. Reference Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. as a good starting point. I\u2019ve learned some great stuff from Mary Buckham\u2019s other books as well. I hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "A text driven by narrative would benefit first from thoroughly establishing the \u2018credentials\u2019 of the narrator (storyteller) as authentic. So the \u201chook\u201d I am suggesting is simply that authenticity. With the narrator settled as a plausibly-accurate relator (one who relates, not a realtor), your book will by virtue of that have a tone substantially informed by the narrator as a reliable source. Many readers seek the \u201cvoice\u201d of the narrator as presumably God-given. It's a rather old reference, but there was a minor public figure named Euell Gibbons who often appeared in U.S. TV commercials (for Post\u00ae Grape Nuts breakfast cereal) and became famous for saying things like: Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible.I think it bears mentioning that this \u201cpublic figure\u201d instantly evaporated from TV-space upon his death at age 64. Prior to that he was presumably regarded as a wise elder! TV ad \u201cmarketing\u201d is/was surely a fickle undertaking. A narrator is only as good as his or her PR (public relations\u2014meaning perceived status in society). The beloved actress-cum-talk-show-host Oprah Winfrey is just the sort of believable narrator I would strive to emulate. She practices her elocution like any skilled actor, and \u201cspeaks from the heart.\u201d Another believable voice often pressed into narrating some corporate or charity organization\u2019s message is the redoubtable senior and Oscar\u00ae-winning actor Morgan Freeman, also known as \u201cthe voice of God.\u201d My final suggestion is to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain\u2019s classic of the genre, noting how plain-spoken yet compelling the captured-African Huck is when telling his own life story. That book is a real \u201cpage-turner.\u201d I didn't set out to present African Americans as the only believable narrators. The legendary poet-activist and performer John Trudell\u2019s voice was/is another great one telling stories. Trudell passed away at age 69 in 2015. His poetry and recordings will long outlive him. Your narrator need not be a senior citizen! There's another possible hook: a child\u2019s innocence informs your otherwise-flawed [childlike-language] text (warning: I'm fairly sure it's already been done). ",
