            "answer_text": "I have been using InDesign to design websites for several years now. I realize that there are many pros and cons to designing in both InDesign and Photoshop, and folks will be very passionate about their opinions, but let me give you my top reasons: PROS  Versions using pages. Because ID is a layout program, I can do multiple versions of a layout by using a page for each version. I can even create a header or footer in a separate ID doc and import it into my design, thereby having the ability to make global changes. In Photoshop, I would need to create multiple documents or layer groups. For me, layer groups as site sections and pages are messy. Excellent columns and margin support. No need to worry about my layout resolution. In photoshop, in order to make sure your assets work in Retina screens, you must create a 2x layout. If you don't, the assets are worthless. In ID, you import your photos much like you will when you build. Plus your elements widths, font sizes, line-heights, kerning, etc, stay 1:1. 18px text in ID is 18px test in CSS. Layers in ID are used more like artboards, meaning you can lock you background, and select groups of elements on the page by layer. In Photoshop, each element is a layer, and I've always found direct selection to be a bit wonky. CONS There's no ability to export your site directly to code - I prefer to hand-code, so it's not an issue for me. Image placement can be a real pain for anyone not familiar with Indesign. Document Height - there is a tool that allows you to change individual page heights (as opposed to document height), but it's a little finicky.I hope that helps. I also know several web designers who have turned to a program called Sketch, which has the ability to mirror CSS a bit more, and has better export tools.  Happy designing! ",

            "answer_text": "Speaking from a design rather than development perspective, anything that requires layout should be done in InDesign as that is what it's designed for. Trying to lay out anything in Photoshop is very, very painful until you have done enough of them that you learn all the shortcuts and workarounds to mitigate the pain of laying out in a program designed for editing photographs and drawing pictures. You end up with a thousand layers, hundreds of smart objects, text not connected to anything, they are almost always a labyrinth for anyone except the original designer to navigate. Having master pages, a layout-based column and margin system, vector tools, text and object stylesheets, libraries etc etc makes InDesign a great tool for wireframing as you can design cleanly and effectively - then if you want you can move to full layout andpass designs out to a developer who can slice it out in Photoshop if they want. But many of them will hate it as they have 10+ years of getting PSDs and they don't like change. Having said that, Adobe have yet to put in all of the tools necessary to make it a no-brainer to use InDesign. An option to view pixel dimensions in the same way Photoshop does would be great, as well as a Save For Web export. Improving the Object Export function would seem sensible, or some slice tools.  They have added hex colours in the last update which shows they are thinking along the right lines. Oddly Tristan's answer begins like this: 'InDesign is more a composition tool than anything else. It's used to design anything that's larger then one page.' Well, that's a website. ",
