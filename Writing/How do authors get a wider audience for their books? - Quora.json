            "answer_text": "I have not yet reached this stage of writing. I have heard some things a published author should do but I am not sure in what order. Here goes: You promote your book.You contact bookstores.You do TV commercials.You do a book tour.You have a book launch to which you invite dignitaries and have media coverage. Also invite all your friends and family.Some of these things are pretty expensive. You\u2019ll have to figure out what works for you. If it\u2019s not too late in the game, I suggest you get a literary agent to find a publisher. When negotiating with the publisher, you can try making the publisher responsible for selling the book. Before signing the contract, be careful not to agree to more work than you are willing or able to do. Remember that you may want to be working on your next book while others are selling your current book. Hopefully, you kept your day job to pay the bills. ",

The most I\u2019ve been able to do is reach out to sites that promote advertising books, put promos wherever I can, tell friends and family about the book, etc. Sadly, the reality is, marketing costs money, more often than not, and there\u2019s no guarantee it will pay off, even if you find a free service somewhere.
