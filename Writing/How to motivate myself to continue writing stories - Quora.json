            "answer_text": "Motivation is nothing if you don\u2019t cultivate discipline. Waiting or looking for motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing things we feel like doing. Wake-up. It\u2019s a real world and there a lot of things you just need to do even if you don\u2019t feel like doing it. If you really want to reach a great result - discipline yourself. As a proof to my opinion you can read a lot of success stories of famous people like Elon Musk, for example. He just works hard and doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re motivated enough today. Have a goal - work hard. No excuses. In summary, motivation is trying to feel like doing stuff. Discipline is doing it even if you don\u2019t feel like it. ",

EVERYONE gets stuck and de-motivated at this point. Do some Google searches on story structure and \u2018writing life\u2019 and find out how others get through it. This is the part that makes the difference between people who finish novels and people who become dissatisfied cranks. ;) If you want to write you\u2019ll have to figure this part out. Luckily, there\u2019s lots of support and information out there for you. Good luck. ",
