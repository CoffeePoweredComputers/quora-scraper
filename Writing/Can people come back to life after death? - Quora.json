            "answer_text": "Who would have thought I could revive someone who was about to leave this world. No medical training, not good with the sick. I\u2019m on holiday with a male friend, we had driven from my home the previous day staying overnight en route, had dinner and an early night. Having driven the second day since breakfast, stopping for a quick bite for lunch we were both becoming weary mid afternoon within an hour of our destination. Our friends expected us late afternoon. We stopped to top up for fuel at a Caltex garage. I said \u201cI\u2019ll drive the remainder and give you a break should only be an hour away now\u201d. \u201cNo need I\u2019m a bit stiff from sitting but I\u2019ll be okay, be back in a tick\u201d. In the passenger seat waiting my eye caught a man running towards the fuel pumps, gesturing to someone, realising I was that someone as he stopped beside my car. \u201cQuick come with me as he opened the door. Your husband/partner is having some kind of seizure, hurry come with me, quick, he repeated agitated! My heart gave a lurch, I ran after the attendant into the garage shop, people standing back giving me room to go to my friend. They told me he walked up to the counter, gave the attendant his card to pay, felt his brow briefly, then fell sideways hitting his head on the corner of the counter then the nearby food stand on his way down, then cracking his head on the tiles when he landed. He is a tall man 6\u20322\u2033. He fell heavily. I saw blood pooling under his head. I was shocked as I knelt on the tiles beside him, his face colour was a weird blue/black kind of mottling, he was unconscious of course and dying. \u201cI said he needs CPR can anyone help, I will give mouth to mouth. A man came forward he was of solid build, strong looking I suggested he began the CPR please\u201d as I held my friends nose giving mouth to mouth to try and resusitate him. A woman Caltex staff member held his head for me. An off-duty nurse hearing a scream from a woman in the store came running from around the corner from a food counter. She called Emergency Services. The chap and I were working unaware of anything around us except my friend on the floor. Emergency services were telling the Nurse to advise us how we should continue doing what we were doing, help was on the way. There was an eerie quietness as the two of us keep up the breathing and CPR counting the only sound. There were quite a few people trying to enter the store to pay for their fuel, they were all asked to please wait outside, I was vagely aware of how everyone and everything was quiet around us as we worked away. We were still working on my friend when two ambulances turned up and the Paramedics tookover. When I stood up I was shaking badly, feeling exhausted, a little dizzy. I went to the Hospital in the second ambulance whilst the first Ambulance had raced away. I sat and waited for some news as my friend was being operated on, before long the cardiologist came to speak with me. \u201cI\u2019ve put two stents in your friend\u2019s heart, he\u2019s had a cardiac arrest, then two further heart attacks. You saved his life! He really shouldn\u2019t be here\u201d! He continued, \u201cIf it had happened on the motorway you both may not be alive right now. You did a good job, well done. I am surprised he is alive as he has two arteries fully blocked and half of his other artery is blocked, he was like a walking dead man.\u201d There was a fear of brain damage once he came out of the induced coma in ICU as he\u2019d had two further heart attacks whilst in the coma over the next week. He recovered okay eventually. When the Dr asked me how everything had unfolded at the garage I explained the colour of his skin on his face. The Dr said he was seconds from death, that is the colour of someone on their way out. I may not have described this colour correctly but I was aware he may have died had I and the kind gentleman who helped me had not acted as quickly as we had. We brought him back\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "Doctors have told me that medically, I should not be alive now. I technically \u2018died\u2019 twice in July, 2016. My heart stopped beating on July 13, 2016. Medics were able bring me back. The doctors wanted me to gain strength before they operated on my heart so they kept me in an Acute Care Unit, put me into a drug induced coma, and hooked me up to heart and lung bypass machines to keep me alive. I was not gaining strength and my kidneys were starting to fail. On July 20, 2106 (while still attached to the bypass machines) my heart stopped again. Medics were able to bring me back once again and they took me to surgery. After surgery, my kidneys shut down\u2026 I was now on heart and lung bypass machines as my heart was to weak pump blood, chest muscles too weak for me to breathe, and I was on 24 hour dialysis to bypass the kidneys. After I came out of the coma, August 20th, 2016, I asked the doctor how long I was without oxygen and all he said was that they were monitoring me for brain damage. I know I was without a pulse for a few minutes each time my heart stopped, and the closest durations that I can determine is July 13 was less than 10 minutes and July 20 was less than 5 minutes. Technically, I died twice \u2013 no pulse, not breathing, and kidneys shut down on second occurrence. It was very hard for me to accept that I died because I could see and hear the doctors, my wife, and others. So, how could I have died, and yet see and hear, when death is permanent? I do not think I reached the point of being brain dead, but, the doctors had told my wife that they would not be able to tell if I had suffered brain damage until after I regained conciseness. At first they were concerned as I could not remember anything since 2014. But, over a couple of weeks, I did recover most memory, but still cannot remember anything between July 4, 2016 and August 20, 2016. A physical indicator that showed I indeed died was that all of my fingernails had stopped growing each time that my heart stopped. I noticed the anomalies in December, 2016 and had a doctor look at my fingers. He verified that the thinning of my fingernails were due to new cells not being produced while I was \u2018dead\u2019 and that the growth rate of my fingernails was correct for a 5 month period to have elapsed.

In the Bible, there is a narratives that shows man can\u2019t come back when he died. The Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19\u201331) 19 \u201cThere was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day. 20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man\u2019s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores. 22 \u201cThe time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham\u2019s side. The rich man also died and was buried. 23 In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. 24 So he called to him, \u2018Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.\u2019 25 \u201cBut Abraham replied, \u2018Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been set in place, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.\u2019 27 \u201cHe answered, \u2018Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my family, 28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.\u2019 29 \u201cAbraham replied, \u2018They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.\u2019 30 \u201c\u2018No, father Abraham,\u2019 he said, \u2018but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.\u2019 31 \u201cHe said to him, \u2018If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.\u2019\u201d Tahnks ",

            "answer_text": "I just want to point out that all the scientific explanations I\u2019ve heard are, at best, circumstantial evidence in regard to the belief that the Human Brain is the SEAT of consciousness, and that consciousness does not and cannot exist without a brain and nervous system. Here\u2019s the thing. All we REALLY know is that such brain phenomena happen at the same time as the experience of \u201cconsciousness.\u201d This is hardly proof that the brain IS the seat of consciousness. That would be like saying that all human beings are computers because they all appear as electrical impulses on the computers connected to the internet. A measurable phenomenon that occurs completely simultaneously for sure, but NOT the same thing. My experience includes vivid memories of previous lives, as well as the \u201ctimes\u201d between physical incarnations. I remember it as \u201cHome\u201d and yes, there are times I get \u201chomesick.\u201d Of these events, some occurred with A brain present, but not my current brain, and some of them occurred in states where I had NO brain at all, yet I knew, I felt, I experienced, I observed. Interestingly, I have had a fair amount of corroboration from others, but the clincher for me was my youngest son. At the time, he really was just barely old enough to talk. I had been quite scrupulous about NOT attempting to guide or indoctrinate him in matters of spirituality, reincarnation, religion, life, death, all the good, juicy existential stuff. STILL, he began one day to tell me of his past lives. He had been a child in the two lives he remembered. He had died young in both cases, and he remembers the sadness and disappointment of betrayal from the parents who beat and killed him. He THEN began to talk about how he and his mom would play \u201ccatch\u201d with an IMAGINARY Blue Ball of light when he was no more than 1 month old. My wife is an artist, and a very visual person. She most certainly DID do this with my infant son \u2014 she would mentally picture a glowing Blue Ball of light, and gently propel it toward the baby. He would catch it and toss it back, giggling the whole time. She told me about this at the time. No, I did NOT find it weird. Such things seem perfectly natural to me, based on my own life experience. It\u2019s one of the things I love MOST about my beautiful wife. This time, though, we were stunned! Neither of us thought he would remember this, and of course there was always a shred of doubt that this exercise was anything more than an imaginary dalliance. See, that\u2019s one of the challenges about visualization, manifestation, and any sort of clairvoyance \u2014 it feels like you are just making it up at the time. This is why so many people believe that it doesn\u2019t exist. If you understand a little Quantum Physics, and/or Process Psychology or the Aussie Aboriginal Dreamtime experience, you will know that this is a piece of wisdom that has shown up in multiple situations throughout history. BUT, here is the corker. In this conversation with my son, he then went on to describe his experience of being \u201cin that other place where everything is just LOVE, all the time\u201d and wanting to reincarnate again. He said they offered him several choices of parents, but HE chose US. We are honored. He said they never had expectations or tried to influence his choice, but just blessed it all. Side note: My wife and I were VERY aware of the importance of choice in making a baby, and we had both \u201cput it out there\u201d that we wanted a truly amazing soul; an Old Soul for our child together. What can I say? IT WORKED! ",

            "answer_text": "Your personality is not getting reborn, only your soul. Personality and the human mind and body image continue for a while even after death, but eventually get discarded, possibly stored somewhere as worn clothes, since souls can still meet their friends and relatives looking like their old selves after they die, or when they appear to us in dreams. But each soul will have the whole \u2018wardrobe\u201d of their past life personalities after many incarnations. There is also Akashic Records of all the lives souls lived, and a soul can study its own past lives in Spirit World in the Hall of Records or Library. The soul usually chooses a new life after spending some time in the Spirit World, but it does not have to. Souls can stay in the Spirit World and study or have occupations there, or travel around the Universe exploring different civilizations and worlds. Some souls unite with the Source/God and lose all their individuality, become All That Is - dispersing all their energy in the Source Energy. But most souls reincarnate - on Earth or any other planet or world. If the soul is enrolled in the Earth School - it has to experience the cerian amount of lives on Earth, usually about 100, but different authors have different numbers, it is not set in stone. It is more about learning lessons than the number of lives. An advanced student can become a Spirit Guide, helping other souls in their physical lives, even if they still reincarnate themselves once in a while. Senior Guides do not reincarnate at all but only help other souls, and train Junior Guides. Some souls are into healing - they reincarnate as doctors or healers, and eventually, just stay in the Spirit World helping souls who come home after traumatic lives and need healing, or healing people still living in physical bodies or being Spirit Guides to doctors and healers on Earth. There are many other occupations in the Spirit World, and there is always something to do there, so souls do not have to reincarnate all the time. Very advanced souls - the Ascended Masters, do not have to reincarnate at all, but they still get a human body sometimes to teach people or participate in important historic events or create new technologies or amazing art.

Is the moth reborn when it emerges from its cocoon? Is a tree reborn when its acorn drops on the ground and grows, yet retains all of the information from its previous existence? What people say (consistently while under deep hypnosis, as reported by Dr.Helen Wambach, Michael Newton and the 45 cases I\u2019ve filmed) is that we \u201cas energy\u201d leave this body once we\u2019re done with it, and \u201creturn home.\u201d When we \u201cget home\u201d we appear pretty much as our idealized self. Is that energetic construct our self? Well we retain all the memories of our lifetime, and further, people claim we reconnect with the energy that retains all the other memories of all of our previous lifetimes. (People claim we only bring about a third of that energy here to the planet during our life.) Once we return home, and reconnect with the energy we left behind are we reborn? Well, the same as the water traveling into mist and finding its way back to the ocean is \u201creborn\u201d as being \u201cback in the ocean.\u201d Except in this case, people report that we return to our \u201csoul group\u201d - the individuals that we normally incarnate with. (It\u2019s not sacrosanct, people do travel in and out all the time,have affiliated groups they work with etc. But that\u2019s a topic for further conversation.) They claim that when we get \u201cback home\u201d we reconnect with our guides and loved ones and plan our next adventure together. They further claim that we can defer to come back with our loved ones - in fact we can say \u201cno\u201d because we have free will. (Which throws out of wack the theories that somehow we are forced to reincarnate depending upon how we acted in a previous lifetime.) What these people say consistently, is that we choose the journey we\u2019re going to take, and we work on who or what that journey will be. This is not my theory, belief or philosophy on the matter - I\u2019m reporting what people consistently say. ",

            "answer_text": "Consider the fact that life is experienced by being aware of an electric current through the brain. After death, all the brain cells are still there. They do not immediately die, although I'm sure within an hour or so many of them will start to die.But imagine just for a moment, taking the electrical current out of the brain. Also stop the heartbeat. So death is the current state. Consciousness quickly fades from the brain. Then by re-activating the muscles in the heart, the blood pulse continues, forcing oxygen into the brain, causing the pattern of electricity to begin flowing through the cells. So the person can come back to life, remembering and living exactly as before, because, except for a few negligible broken pathways, most of the electrical activity in the brain will be the same: concentrations of amino acids will be nearly the same, and sugars in the blood nearly the same. Of course, as each minute passes, and the system falls into decay, the worse the damage will be when the person is revived. This of course, will be possible up until a certain threshold is crossed, where too many systems are out of sync, or damaged to being functioning again. I\u2019m sure a doctor can be way more specific. But I am telling you about what my near death experience was like. I distinctly remember losing contact with the sense of a body, a self, identity or brain, but I still had some little bit of feeling, like I could still feel my fingers. I could not see them or understand in any way that I was linked to them. Then fingers left as well. Some kind of great satisfying void. And then everything came swooshing back-together in one instant and the feeling was like being pulled into my body by the breath. ",

            "answer_text": "No one can tell you that for certain. It may be true that the essence of one\u2019s consciousness and personality is stored or maintained by electrical impulses in the brain. Alternatively, however, that might not necessarily be true. The brain is surely the instrument of reasoning and memory, but those are not all of which constitutes the individual. There are many people who believe that the individual is not anything electrical or biochemical, but that the essence of the individual is something evanescent, called the soul. Now, at the time of what we call death, the brain shuts down. All electrical activity ceases. Within a very short time, cellular decomposition begins. All the neural pathways break down, and the pattern of interconnection is irreversibly lost. It cannot be reconstructed, both because of the physical and biochemical complexity, and because there is no recording made of the previous organization and information storage in the brain. Hence if you believe that everything you are as an individual resides in your brain, you could never possibly be reconstructed after death. There is no known way, and most likely no possible way, of preserving a brain intact and functioning after death. Freezing, for example, would utterly destroy it, leaving only a pile of frozen meat. As an illustration, every so often a Wooly Mammoth is found frozen and intact somewhere in the far north \u2014 perhaps the victim of an ancient avalanche of snow, asphyxiated and flash-frozen. But science has no way of re-animating that creature. It is no more liable to be resuscitated than a frozen hamburger. If the individual is actually something that resides in a brain, and if in some manner that brain could be preserved electrically and chemically intact at the point of death to be later restored into functioning life, then there would have to be something going on in the preserved brain. We know that memory and reasoning are not a matter of static charges, but of the dynamic movement of electrical impulses \u2014 whether one is physically conscious or not. That being the case, imagine what might be happening in that preserved brain. One who has been deprived of senses, by death, would be dreaming or hallucinating. You might be having the most extreme possible nightmares inside that preserved brain, maybe hundreds or thousands of years of the screaming heebie-jeebies, with you not being able either to scream or to wake up. The eventual reconstituted human being would surely awaken, irrecoverably and irreversibly insane. I do not think you would like that. It is possible, however, that the individual is something other than a functioning brain. It may be that the personality and consciousness and memory are incorporated into what is called a soul. Many people, billions actually, believe that. And billions have believed that, over thousands of years gone by. Some of those who believe that humans have a soul, feel that it goes to some other place after death. Many feel that it is a place not within this physical universe, nor even anywhere that has the dimensionality of this universe. There are various names given to the place or places where departed souls are believed to transfer into. These include Heaven, Hell, Paradise, Hades, Valhalla, Nirvana, Underworld, World to Come, Asura, Purgatory, Tian, Good Kingdom, Moksha, Eden, New Jerusalem, Glory, Elysium, Gehenna, and many others. Some people, both now and over centuries past, feel that souls can return to earth and be reincarnated. A portion of those feel that human souls are reborn into other human bodies. A portion feel that human souls may be reborn into other creatures such as cows, dogs, monkeys, cockroaches, or bacteria. Most beliefs hold that a reconstituted soul does not retain conscious memories of prior existences. Some individuals, however, feel that prior memories may be responsible for sensations such as deja vu, or for one\u2019s phobias, or for a particular sense of affiliation with certain other people. Some people believe prior memories can be reactivated through hypnotism or by great traumas or by magical spells. No one, except perhaps those who have already died, can say for certain what (if anything) actually occurs after death. Or whether there is any form of rebirth or reincarnation. No one can say whether it is like awakening, or whether it is a slow progression into self-awareness as happens with infants growing into children growing into adults. Some people feel that souls live on, but in a disembodied form such as ghosts. Others believe that souls return in their original form, except in a non-physical way, in which they inhabit their former homes in a way called haunting, where there are occasional viewings possible by the current residents. Yet others feel that souls remain near their loved ones, in a manner called presence, and can guide or protect or even speak to the living. You may choose to believe whatever you want. Or you can believe, as some do, that death is extinction of the individual, with no continuing consciousness; a total blackout. The majority of teachings, and religions, around the world and over the ages, suggest that one\u2019s current life is neither the ultimate nor the end of one\u2019s existence. While there are vast differences in views about what will happen or how it will happen after death, there has always been strong unanimity of opinion that the purpose and the value of one\u2019s present life is to prepare for the next life, whatever that might be. Generally speaking, it is thought that appropriate preparation includes learning as much as possible, in as many areas as possible. It also includes doing good works or helping others or alleviating suffering of others. It also includes developing one\u2019s relationships with others, learning such qualities as love, compassion, sharing or charity, self-sacrifice, selflessness, empathy, and honor. As it happens, learning and practicing these actions and qualities generally contributes greatly to the quality and happiness of one\u2019s current life, quite aside from whatever it may or may not do after you die. So, both to give yourself a better life and as insurance to prepare yourself for another life should it occur, it is probably very smart to cultivate all of those. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Will I be reborn as a human being after my death? - Child Prodigy in Piano Playing (All our life, so far as it has definite form, is but a mass of habits. William James)-In psychology research literature, the term child prodigy is defined as person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer. Child prodigies are rare, and in some domains there are no child prodigies at all. Prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence. (From wikipedia) -Some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child, and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures. Others believe that the environment plays the dominant role, many times in obvious ways. -In child prodigy, there were many children talented in piano playing. They were recognized for piano playing ability since very young. Among them, many of them lost interest in piano playing in adulthood. Some of them continued to play in concert and are still famous as gifted piano players in later life. A small portion of them became famous composers in addition to gifted piano playing. What is certain is that those who continue to become musicians are devoting significant amount of time in practicing piano playing besides their in born talent of piano playing. It means they need a lot of practice to maintain the piano playing ability. -If someone is not a piano prodigy and if he is interested in playing piano, he has to do a lot of practice and needs a lot of years to become a professional piano player. -So what is the nature of child prodigy in piano playing? It is not due to inheritance from genetic traits because many of them have no talented piano players in their previous generations. Some said it is due to in-born trait (like just lucky brain development which makes one easy in learning piano playing). -In a book called the power of habit written by Charles Duhigg, there is a chapter about a man called Eugene Pauly who got viral encephalitis and it destroyed part of brain and made him permanent loss of the recent memory. He could remember his past, his previous experiences very well. But he could not remember what happened each and every moment after viral encephalitis. When he met a stranger and he was introduced to that man and made conversation with him for a time, he couldn't remember that particular man when he met again him later that day. He didn't even remember what he did an hour ago. After watching a particular TV program, when someone made him watch that again, he would watch that program as if entirely new to him. So he could not form recent memory and remote memory starting from the time of viral encephalitis. -When he was discharged from hospital, he and his wife moved into a new house with new environment. His doctors warned his wife not to get lose him. His wife took him on a walk outside their home, always together and always along the same route everyday for a period of time. But one day, Eugene went out without his wife and he returned safely later. When he was asked, he didn\u2019t know whether he went out along and how he walked back home without losing his way. (\u2026\u2026. It was clear to Squire (The scientist who made research on Eugene) that Eugene was absorbing new information. But where inside his brain was that information residing? How could someone find his way home when he had no idea which house was his? How were new patterns forming inside Eugene\u2019s damaged brain?To test if Eugene was forming new habits, Squire devised an experiment. He took sixteen different objects\u2014bits of plastic and brightly colored pieces of toys\u2014and glued them to cardboard rectangles. He then divided them into eight pairs: choice A and choice B. In each pairing, one piece of cardboard, chosen at random, had a sticker placed on the bottom that read \u201ccorrect.\u201dEugene was seated at a table, given a pair of objects, and asked to choose one. Next, he was told to turn over his choice to see if there was a \u201ccorrect\u201d sticker underneath. This is a common way to measure memory. Since there are only sixteen objects, and they are always presented in the same eight pairings, most people can memorize which item is \u201ccorrect\u201d after a few rounds.Eugene couldn\u2019t remember any of the \u201ccorrect\u201d items, no matter how many times he did the test. He repeated the experiment twice a week for months, looking at forty pairings each day.But as the weeks passed, Eugene\u2019s performance improved. After twenty-eight days of training, Eugene was choosing the \u201ccorrect\u201d object 85 percent of the time. At thirty-six days, he was right 95 percent of the time. After one test, Eugene looked at the researcher, bewildered by his success.\u201cHow am I doing this?\u201d he asked her.The experiments demonstrated that Eugene had the ability to form new habits, even when they involved tasks or objects he couldn\u2019t remember for more than a few seconds. This explained how Eugene managed to go for a walk every morning.-Excerpt from the power of habit by Charles Duhigg) - -Suppose that Eugene is able to remember what he does for one day and forgets on the second day. Suppose he has never used bow and arrow in his whole life. Suppose we train him to shoot a target with bow and arrow everyday. He will wake up everyday and he will feel that he has never practiced shooting a target with bow and arrow previously, his arrow shooting skill will get better and better day by day. And finally one day, he will very surprised to find himself that although he feels that he has never shot and practiced arrow shooting in the past, he can shoot straight into target nearly every time he makes attempts. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of arrow shooting. -Just like above example, suppose that we train Eugene to play piano likewise, ..................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. -And finally one day, he will very surprised to find that although he has never learned to play the piano in the past (so he thought), he finds out that he can play the piano very well. He will be surprised and satisfied about his in-born skill (so he thought) of piano playing. -Just like above example, suppose a human being is interested in music and learns to play the piano his/her whole life and he/she can play the piano very well finally. He/She grows old and dies one day. Suppose that philosophy of Theravada Buddhism is true and each and every so-called soul or spirit or mind or consciousness will come into cycles of life unless he/she becomes liberated (reach Nirvana). Suppose that particular he/she comes back to human life. Suppose that although he/she cannot remember previous life, he/she will find out he/she can play piano very well since very young. People will be surprised about his/her in-born skill in piano playing. - Tabula rasa (Children are blank slate) - (Human intellect at birth resembled a tabula rasa, a pure potentiality that is actualized through education and comes to know. Persian philosopher Ibn Sina)(At birth the (human) mind is a \"blank slate\" without rules for processing data, and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one's sensory experiences. John Locke)-Generally, the tabula rasa thesis favors the \"nurture\" side of the nature versus nurture debate, when it comes to aspects of one's personality, social and emotional behavior, and intelligence. -Scholarly and popular discussion about nature and nurture relates to the relative importance of an individual's innate qualities (nature) as compared to an individual's personal experiences (nurture) in causing individual differences in physical and behavioral traits. From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_versus_nurture - -Generations later, people questioned about the blank state theory of mind. When observing the children, they found out that the children had distinct personalities, characters, talent since young. Within same culture, within same environment and even within same big families, some children were introvert, some were extrovert, some were easily angry, some had sense of humor, some learnt easily in studying, some had talents in arts, music, dancing, playing piano, etc., some had talent in different sports since young, majority of children had sense of morality since young (they knew what is good, what is bad without learning from adults) -According to evolution, all the life in earth were arise from simple DNA. First it started as a single cell as an unicellular organism and later evolved into complex multicellular organism. All those organisms are related and evolved by the simple DNA instruction. Charles Darwin was the first to formulate a scientific argument for the theory of evolution by means of natural selection -So DNA is the life of organism. No DNA, no life -In human being, DNA of the child of is given by mother and father. The child's external features (physical characteristics) are built up according to those shared DNA. So scientists figure that the internal characteristics (Personalities, intelligence quotient, Emotional Intelligence, etc) of the child must be also derived from the parents -According to current science idea, all of those identical children must have same personality and not so different intelligence. When DNA makes a human being, mind spontaneously occur in that human and it permanently disappear when that living being dies -Science can explain about the physical appearance of children by inheritance of genes from parents, but science cannot explain about the internal characters (personality, I.Q, E,Q) by inheritance of genes from parents -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, each and every human being has own unique soul and when that human being dies, most of the souls has continual repetitive cycle of birth and death called samsara (not just in human world, also in other living worlds) according to his karma -If that particular soul comes back to human world as rebirth, that particular human being will have distinct personality, I.Q, E.Q according to his daily routine doings, habits. Those characters are not derived from his own parents, according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism -So one human being will have personality, intelligence distinct from his father and mother. In other words, if one pair of parents produces a lot, a lot of children, the parents will find that their children will have so many distinct personalities and intelligences different not only from the parents but also among the siblings -Science will not accept above concept because science does not accept concept of soul. - Whether human are born indifferent or not, one can know by observing identical twins pair -The identical twins will have similar physical structures according to same genes. But they will have different characters, personalities, intelligences and thinking processes because those traits are not determined by genes -One can observe whether above traits are genetic or not by studying identical twins. If those traits are genetic, identical twins will have same traits. If not, one will find different traits in identical twins. Actually, some behaviors can be observed since very young. If one observes very different behaviors within the same identical pair, personality traits are not genetic although they are present since very young. Some people explain the reason of different behaviors within same identical twins pair by interaction with environment after birth by those twins. But the explanation is not satisfactory enough -In present day science of genetics and evolution concept, it cannot explain how the identical twins have different personalities, different I.Qs, different characters, different interests, different sexual orientations, different thinking, reasoning processes, etc. One will see a lot of explanations with different mechanisms. But those different mechanisms can't explain the initial differences during the first 3- 5 years of ages. Genetics can only give identical external physical appearances. Genetics cannot determine so called internal characters. Those internal characters are determined (inherited) by different unique (so-called) soul or spirit or consciousness -Although science cannot explain the cause of differences in internal characters between identical twins, extreme differences between children and their parents (i.e very, very far from the tree), those differences can be explained by rebirth concept -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, although the identical twins have identical physical appearances due to identical genes, each has different intelligence (I.Q), personality, character according to actions and habits, etc from previous individual's lifetime. So one will see different personality, character, intelligence and talent, different sexual orientations, different thinking, reasoning processes between identical twins. It must be miracle to see those identical twins have same or identical so-called internal characters between them because they have different souls -And those extreme differences will be more and more common in society like USA because USA is the land of immigrants and rebirths may (or may not) occur in family of different cultures, different concepts, different values, etc, because one cannot select to rebirth in family with same culture, race with previous one -But science will not accept that kind of answer because science has no concept of soul and science denies concept of rebirth -Which concept is right -One needs to look into identical twins studies (made without bias). Thousands of twins pairs were studied by scientists in the past. Or one can ask directly to those twins or their parents if you have friends with them. - - According to Theravada Buddhism. \u2026\u2026 \"Venerable Sir, I have heard this: 'The recluse Gotama claims to be omniscient and all seeing, to have complete knowledge and vision thus: \"Whether I am walking or standing or sleeping or awake, knowledge and vision are continuously and uninterruptedly present to me.\"'\"Vaccha, those who say thus do not say what has been said by me but misrepresent me with what is untrue and contrary to fact.\"\"Vaccha, if you answer thus: 'The recluse Gotama has the threefold true knowledge,' you will be saying what has been said by me and will not misrepresent me with what is contrary to fact. You will explain in accordance with the Dhamma in such a way that nothing which provides a ground for censure can be legitimately deduced from your assertion.\"For in so far as I wish, I recollect my manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births,\u2026 a hundred births, \u2026 a hundred thousand births, \u2026 And in so far as I wish, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the+ human, I see beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These worthy being as who are ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy being as who are well-conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.' And by realizing for myself with direct knowledge, I here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints.-From Majjhima Nikaya 71:5-10 (Tevijjavacchagotta Sutta \u2013 The Threefold True Knowledge) - \u2026\u2026. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives (lit: previous homes). He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details.\u2026\u2026. \"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees \u2014 by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human \u2014 beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings \u2014 who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views \u2014 with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings \u2014 who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views \u2014 with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus \u2014 by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human \u2014 he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.From http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/S...

When I was 19 years old, I was in a really bad place. I had been working in the library at my University, and I had suffered a bad fall- I injured my back pretty severely. Now, I ended up only requiring the aid of a cane, but I was lucky- I was told that I\u2019d likely need to use crutches for the rest of my life, or possibly even a wheelchair. I was not okay with this. I was already a drug user, I had been for years. So I went home and I popped a handful of Xanax, a handful of Vicodin, and washed it down with a fifth of Vodka. I put on some cartoons and waited to die. I woke up in the hospital. I have no idea how, and I have no memory of doing this, but apparently at some point I had wandered out onto my front lawn before passing out, somebody had found me and called an ambulance. When I was in that ambulance, my heart stopped. I was clinically dead for almost four minutes. But here I am, writing this answer now. So, yes, people can come back to life after death. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the elephant in the room here is Jesus coming back to life, which I personally subscribe to. The texts documenting his resurrection actually present it credibly, and there is no explanation for what happened to his body. If someone took it, they could have dismissed the claims of early Christians by presenting it to them, and guards were stationed at the tomb, so it is unlikely thieves could have gotten to it. No folower of Jesus would have been in the postion to take it either (they did not even know he was supposed to come back to life, and they would have gotten busted by the guards, anyway). Add on that those who claimed he came back to life would not have had an ulterior motive for claiming this (they could have been severly persecuted and even killed), and that multiple witnesses were said to have knowlingly encountered him and were later killed for that belief (Saints Peter and James, for example) it makes for a pertty credible case of someone dying, and then coming back to life. Oh yeah, and the cast majority if academics agree Jesus was a real person, so there is no ground here for claiming he never lived. Check out this link, which shows some more Biblical evidence for His ressurection: What Precautions Were Taken to Keep the Tomb of Jesus Secure? . There was even a guard placed at the tomb (Matthew 27:66). Oh yeah, and there have been multiple well-documeted miracles that would seem to confirm his resurrection, as well. See here: 5 Extraordinary Eucharistic Miracles that Left Physical Evidence (With Pictures!) | ChurchPOP . Hopefully this sheds a little light on at least one verifiable instance of someone coming back to life, and why it is rather commonly (realtive compared to other incidences of coming back to life) believed to be true. Obviously, this instance has great implications for humanity as well (at least it is an excuse to celebrate a spring holiday like Easter). Have a good day. ",

            "answer_text": "It is through a soulful connect between two people; one who is a mortal and the other who is immortal that the departed soul takes an emotional form. And if you are curious to know the reasons behind this magical transformation, it is through a volley of emotions and sentiments that were shared between them that eventually infuse life into a dead person. Coming back to life need not always be in the physical sense. Death; the end of physical life goes on to attain a higher state when both the people engage in soulful conversations between each other. As time passes, the mortal begins to relive all the memories which he or she has shared with the departed soul. Going down the memory lane, a strong connect is established between the living and the dead, accumulating all the expressed and unsaid feelings between the two people in question. Enabling the living person to experience the \u201cunseen presence\u201d of the soulful person, a magical immortalised connection is thus established. Adding a personal touch to my response, the following revelations will substantiate my response. These situations are the binding force for me to move on with my life after the demise of my dear mom. I see my mom in my dreams very often and there was one dream in which she told me that she will be waiting for me for breakfast. And since then, I haven\u2019t skipped my breakfast with the hope that I am sharing my first morning meal with her. Isn\u2019t she making her presence felt in my life as if feeding me my first meal; every single day? She is!I seek her help to handle tricky situations. There was a time when I was frantically hunting for my debit card. I kept it so safe that I forgot where I kept it. And then, I prayed to my mom, informing her of my financial necessities. After explaining my predicament to her as an earnest request, I was taken in by a surprise when I lay my hands on the card which was kept in a wallet that she used before she left me.PS: I took her purse as a memorabilia to cherish the umpteen times she gave me money as a gift, every time I went to call on her.

            "answer_text": "The answer from this question is been asked by many. Some people beleive about dead people stories and many doesn\u2019t. But none of them are close to truth. If you believe, you can never know because you are already confident about something which you never experienced. We as woman or man or watever are neither body nor mind. Please see, when we were born we were so small now we are so huge and large, obviously we are gathering. Gathering what? We are gathering earth, mud & soil through food, plant or watever we eat. So, what we gather, we cant claim it as I. However, I can see it is mine. Similarly body is gathered. Mind is also gathered. If i wipe up your memory, you will not know anything. So, memory or mind is also gathered though 5 senses since the time of birth. Our mind is amalgamation of our past memories, ideas, beliefs, assumptions, experiences etc. Now the question arises who're we then? Why we are born ? Where we go after death? and lot of million other questions. Some people say we are atman, parmatan and all. I will use the word consciousness instead of all that because those words are highly corrupted and you will start imagining things. We are consoisness, which is not a matter, not a thing, no shape. It is a bliss and never dies. Only body dies but not consciousness. So, when a person dies because of various reasons. It is another question why a person dies?. Will go on this topic some other time. Only body dies, leaving behind the consciousness. But you can't see that person and neither the dead person. Lets call a dead person a disembodied. Disembodied is not after you, because it is not capable of holding any grudges, because it doesn't has a body and mind to hold anything against you. But has a content of the mind not discretion ability. So they work with their vasnas. For example, while living a person likes eating and food and always do everything for food, after living body, that person will go towards a body where he can get maximum satisfaction out of food. So may be he could get a body of a pignin next life. Nature doesn't think on the terms of reward or punishment. It wants to give you what you like. So if a person wants to have sex and thing about sex all the time or works or gets a promotion for getting more sex, after death he could be a lion, because a lion can have 36 times orgasm a day. If a person dies unnatural death like suicide, accident or any kind of body harm be it disease or heart attack, after death that person can be felt around. It can't harm you without body but if you see a distorted figure of a person you will have a fear and you will suffer and also it can enter your body taking control of your body than it can harm you but it is very very very rare thing to happen. To defend yourself you can do many things. One of them is to wear authentic rudraksh mala or if you are meditative by nature they will be away from you. They will wait for their karma to dissolve and than gets a new body and past memory will be erased. So, I and you both have been living before this life but don't remember anything and we will get a new body after the death. Actually life and death are same. Death means you will born again.

            "answer_text": "This used to happen! We have evidence from cemeteries that had to be dug up, and the coffins moved to a new site. There was evidence of people trying to claw their way out of the coffins. It is because, before we had advanced methods of detecting actual life in a body that may just be in a coma, many people were thought to be dead, and buried immediately, because bodies deteriorate quickly. I have read that they used to attach a string from the coffin to a bell suspended above ground, so that if a person \u201cwoke up\u201d in a coffin, they would pull the string and ring the bell, meaning of course that the person in the coffin was still alive and needed to be dug up. They used to have grave keepers, who were supposed to keep watch in order to hear the bells. Well, apparently from evidence, this didn\u2019t always work so well. Also, there are many situations in hospitals these days that a person may be actually clinically dead for a matter of minutes, and then resuscitated. Up to about 7 minutes max. That is why hospitals have \u201ccrash carts.\u201d You can read stories about people who have \u201cgone to the light,\u201d but then were pulled back. In fact, this happened to my mate twice. He had been burned in a house fire, and was not expected to survive the first night. When he did, he was air flown to a burn center. He still has memories, although a little vague. ",

            "answer_text": "We are born( we have no choice ) , as per perfectly designed process of reincarnation . Our body system consists of Soul energy + causal body (ego energy- mix of accumulated energy of goodness + energy of passion +energy of ignorance ) + subtle body ( Intellect + mind + subtle senses ) + gross body . Our causal body ( ego energy ) continuously changes as per action- reaction process . For example , Good action increases energy of goodness and bad action increases energy of ignorance .At the time of death , soul surrounded by causal body + subtle body gets separated from gross body . In the previous birth , at the time of death , based on the state of our ego energy , as what specie , we will be born in next birth gets decided .If at the time of death, our ego energy is dominant in energy of passion, we will take new birth as human being, if energy of ignorance is dominant, we will be born as animal and if dominant in energy of goodness, born as angelic specie. There is gap between previous death and new life . Gap depends on complexity of nature of specie transformation. For example , if a human being in previous birth is going to take birth as animal , it is complex and time gap would be long . It is training to comfortably adapt as new specie . We are born with with same state of ego energy , as it was at the time of previous birth . What changes is our subtle body that is intellect + mind + subtle senses . Let us say , a human being in previous birth is going to take birth as dog , his intellect + mind + subtle senses would become that of dog . To sum up , we continuously go through the process of birth-death-birth and we have no choice . However ,a human being have been given full freedom to design and execute his actions and therefore , ultimately,he decides how his ego state is going to change , as per action-reaction process and he will be born as what specie in next life . This defines \u201c Purpose of Life \u201c - to purify ourselves that is to eliminate our EGO . This is achieved when we , all the time , always , think and do good to others without any expectation of returns , in any form , at any point of time . ",

            "answer_text": "Ever since humanity found its consciousness, this very powerful sense of \u2018I\u2019, as distinct and exclusive from others, this question of death and what happens after death continues to present itself before every human alive on earth. However, modern contemporary humanity has gone at least a step ahead by doing something, which seems like initiation in right direction, even as singular objective answers are still elusive... The death and what happens to this \u2018I\u2019 after death, or can someone once dead, come back to life through any possible means, etc were questions, which earlier pertained to the domain of religion, spiritualism and philosophy. Now, we of contemporary generations have accepted that these questions do not belong to the above-mentioned domain but are in the sphere of \u2018physics\u2019. We are attempting answers in terms of knowledge of matter and different probabilities that matter can take in the cosmic arrangement... We have a global consciousness project started to ascertain the above-mentioned questions and most nations are participating. Scientists are attempting to understand the core realism of consciousness \u2013 this sense of \u2018I\u2019 or personal feeling of exclusive \u2018Me\u2019. Many aspects of consciousness and sub-consciousness are already being accepted after enhanced knowledge of how our brain works, as compared to that of other creatures... Both life-living and death are being defined in terms of the physics of consciousness. All realisms of human existence - even this definition of death is being relooked in terms of understanding consciousness and cognition. Death itself becomes a causality between consciousness and cognition. Once it is clear as what essentially constitute death, it may well be possible to look into the aspect of reversing the process, which creates the causality called death\u2026 For know, there are no singular logical and objective answer to the above questions and even when scientists are doing every bit to unravel the mystery, they also admit that this universe and the way matter and physics works here are probably too complex for human mind to understand and unravel... Still, as science has been able to ascertain good amount about consciousness, there is this wider acceptance among growing number of people that the physics of body and realism of intangibility of \u2018consciousness\u2019 are decipherable and even early humans could feel and accept this. There is a growing belief that consciousness is \u2018an emergent intangible information processing by the brain and this consciousness keeps changing throughout the life, as per the changes in the ambient and larger milieus... It is said \u2013 This sense of \u2018I\u2019 or me, distinct from others is also decipherable and science says \u2013 we have knowledge (Of I) as we can experience (because of superior brain) and we can experience because we have knowledge. This means, as we have evolved in time and space to have such an evolved brain that we have the capacity to experience and that is why we have developed such knowledge, which creates a sense of \u2018I\u2019, making it possible for us to experience this \u2018I\u2019 as distinct from others. This facility is exclusively human, even when some higher animals have consciousness. But they do not have his personalized feeling of \u2018I\u2019 or \u2018Self\u2019, as they do not have this higher brain evolution to \u2018experience\u2019 and store these memories of experiences as \u2018knowledge\u2019... All this means, science is gradually moving towards the realism that we are like all other species in life and death cyclicality. We are also like all other matter on earth, which has a shelf-life like universe still has a life of 35 billion years and Sun has a life of 4.5 billion years etc. However, we have this troubling evolved consciousness, which makes us experience the \u2018I\u2019 in personalized way. Somehow, everyone can do his or her own experiment with realism, which contemporary science is talking about. Ask yourself, \u2018why don\u2019t I remember my early childhood days when I was one year old? Why do not I have awareness and memories of what pains I had when I was coming out of mother\u2019s womb? Why I was crying then? etc. You do not remember as then, you did not have enough experiences which could create the knowledge, which is necessary for this personal sense of \u2018I\u2019. However, we all distinctly remember things from the average age of three or four because by then, we had enough neuron pathways (grey and white matters) in the brain to start facilitating memories of \u2018experiencing\u2019, hence engendering \u2018knowledge\u2019... Science also has enough logical explanations about why humanity at large has this innate feeling and acceptance about the belief of God, ghosts, after life, rebirth, etc. They assign all these to the very nature and scope of the physics of consciousness... Modern science has extended the definition of physics to make it more holistic... However, nothing is finality, and it may never be... However, humanity needs to accept newer knowledge with objectivity. At least, we all must accept that answers of life and death do not belong to the domain of religion, spiritualism and philosophy as the very questions do not belong to them. Both questions and answers belong to physics \u2013 the holistic science... Thanks and all best... ",

            "answer_text": "There are a decent number of accounts of people who have \u201cdied\u201d but came back and even made a full recovery. The problem though is that we actually still have a *very* nebulous concept of what \u201cbeing dead\u201d actually means. If your heart stops, there is still a period of time when your brain is still alive (specifically your cells are still viable and your memories have not begun to be erased from lack of oxygen). We actually don\u2019t know for sure what the window for this is. Most of the time if a heart stops you have between eight and twelve minutes before permanent brain injury begins. Note that qualifier \u201cmost of the time.\u201d Because there are documented cases of people being without a heartbeat for over an hour and still being revived with no discernible brain damage or memory loss. Usually there are other circumstances at play (children are more likely to be recover, or someone was dunked into freezing water and the severe cold may have slowed the process of decay, etc). Which still means there is a pretty much unknown window of time in which a person can still be brought back from this \u201cdeath.\u201d On the extreme end you may wind up with a vegetable but technically they are still \u201calive.\u201d We basically don\u2019t have a way to measure if a person is truly dead. Brain death doesn\u2019t occur right away after the heart stops. Lack of brain activity is not a sure sign of death either. Failure of autonomic systems doesn\u2019t necessarily mean dead (people have been brought back from that). I would hazard that most of the stories of people being \u201cbrought back from the dead\u201d are people who weren\u2019t actually dead to begin with. They were close to it, and were either brought back through medicine or their bodies somehow pulled back from the brink on their own. ",

Afterlife exists and on judgement day god the great creator of everything that exists will bring back all life he created and there will be justice for all. I know there is mixed opinions about this topic but if your opinion is different from mine it's up to you, at the end of the day nothing simply just happens for a coincidence or in a accident. Everything happens for a reason i mean think of it: Do you really think everything that happens in our everday life will just happen for nothing that at the end it will all just be destroyed for for once and for all? Think about your life, there's animals, there's plants, there's trees, theres fish, theres water (Salt and fresh, dirty and clean), theres dust and mud, fire and light, oxygen and gas. Can you think of how a great circle of life all this creates? How a fish in fresh water live it's all life in ocean and come back to die in fresh water? And in return they provide for animals and how the nutrients they carried in their bodies provide for trees and how the trees provide for birds and humans. See how greatly all this is connected and balanced, do you think all this would simply happen by accident? If sp great miracles can happen by accidents why don't Mobile phones do, why don't cars do, why don't air planes do, why don't computers do? Face it everything has it's reasons and it's creator same way as the above tools are created we and all life that exists within are created by god and in the same way we can burn plastics, metal and recycle them into brand new products god can bring us back to life after our demise he can create us back from dust to life. Do you still think that life is just a accident? There will come a time when this world and everything that exists within it will be destroyed and that will be the day of the judgment, a new beginning the afterlife. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m aware of there being something much more extreme & extraordinary which is *possible* regarding \u201cresuscitation\u201d & which applies well beyond the normal conditions under which we might be expected to have even half a chance of pulling someone back from being close to death. I don\u2019t yet know what it is exactly, though Ive felt it happen within me. I believe I must be much more brave to experience this possibility in full flow but one day soon, I\u2019ll \u2018risk\u2019 trying again to have happen again what happened to me (a terrifyingly event LOL!) a few years ago . I didn\u2019t understand what was happening but over the months that followed - which saw me refuse to enter my own Lounge without taking a golf club with me - (yep, that wierd & unnerving) I slowly accrued more information which supports a belief that it\u2019s possible to literally raise the dead. I can\u2019t believe I just typed that. I\u2019d also like to understand why several times in my life Ive experienced Life-Critical Body Parts/organs (inc teeth!) \u201cvanishing & coming back\u201d. Given that Im 100% mentally well, this seems a little odd. One day I had a strange dream in which I saw another person, a portly white-haired man, I think he was connected to The Church, tho which, I\u2019ve no clue; he and another man entered a room and whilst one stood guard at the door the other did something *non-harmful* to someone in whose position I was seeing things from; What he did was exactly the same thing as I\u2019d \u201caccidentally done\u201d last year which was part of the event that scared me half to death\u2026. ironically LOL. It seems I may have had the dream to \u201cshow me\u201d what it is I\u2019ve to do, & to reassure me that it\u2019s absolutely ok to do it. I can see that someone else has asked the Q. \u201cIf you could bring someone back to Life who would it be?\u201d Ive thought about that so many times since my Mum died. If it was her or my cat Lucas who was killed by a lockpicking junkie(?) in 2014, it\u2019d be an uncomfortably close call decision because I loved them both. Before she died, Mum and I shared an extraordinary experience which Ive yet to be able to explain yet whose similarity to events potrayed in the shows MEDIUM and Ghost Whisperer cannot be argued with. We both woke at what was mutually believed to be the same time on the same day to find a bunch of people standing at the foot of our respective beds. My mother was in Hospital only for Tests at the time, She gave no indication that she thought the people to be anyone other than physically present uninivited non Medical Staff, Non Family/Friend \u201cvisitors\u201d. 4\u20135 miles away I too woke to find a bunch of pepole standing in my room(!) I saw one as fully bodily present in my bedroom which was a bit frigging spooky! The rest looked like they\u2019d semi-materialised off the USS Enterprise Transporter\u2026 Mum said she didn\u2019t recognise any of the uninvited guests, but curiously - I did. IF the 3\u20134 people we both saw (unknown to each other until several days later when fortunately Mum mentioned waking to see them in her room otherwise I might have thought I was going nuts) were dead but had somehow re-appeared, to a greater or lesser extent, as embodied people, that\u2019s the closest Ive ever seen to full blown Ressurection. By the way Im not remotely religious and nor was Mum. If anything, I\u2019d guess that those who are murdered can be brought back to life because such an \u2018impossible\u2019 event seems the only appropriate possibility for Restorative Justice. ",

            "answer_text": "We are citizens of two worlds and there is plenty of research about this. Ghosts, OBE, NDE, and Reincarnation all provide some information about what happens in the spiritual world after we die. You can find many on-line references on my book\u2019s website. Basically, it is quite simple what happens after we die. People who do not believe in the after life and have led a materialistic life notice no difference after they die. They are wearing the similar clothes and their spiritual body looks no different than it did before they died. They can wander around a long time before they actually realize they are dead. People who believe in an afterlife and have been basically good people are always met by their guardian angel and relatives. They are taken to a place to continue their learning and to prepare for their next life. Religious fanatics are welcomed with stern faces because they often make demands like, \u201ctake me to the right hand of God.\u201d They are usually left to their own for a long time until they find some humility and start asking for help. Once they do, then they will be prepared for life with the fitting karma to help them learn more humility. The best book on life between life that I have read is Life After Life. Although many people think this is a simplistic view, I find it very comforting. Comforting that everyone gets what they deserve in the end and that there is so much help on the other side helping us all. The book has 12 stories ranging from people who have just started their reincarnation cycle (materialistic and selfish) to a story of one who does not need to come back and earned her place in the spiritual world. Modern Christians don\u2019t like this book because of their arrogance, that just because they were born into a Christian family, they deserve the ultimate reward. Sorry, that\u2019s not how it works\u2026 ",

First, let me explain the soul part that FutureHellDweller couldn\u2019t cover despite his promise:Adding a soul to the equation would indeed make us exist longer than that moment, but that is it. It cannot alter the laws of physics. It cannot alter the mathematics that'll govern the physics of any other universe that may exist. Since it is not known to interact with our reality in any way, the only thing the notion of a soul accomplishes is - our eternal existence. Aren't we then, being too self-centered in thinking that such a thing would manifest itself, just to ensure our eternal existence? Didn\u2019t we make the same mistake when we claimed (without evidence) that the universe revolves around us? In my opinion, we only exist at the current moment. And, any given moment exists 'eternally' in space-time (think of time as an additional dimension that we traverse). That moment in past may remain inaccessible - but it is out there. So are our loved ones. They are there and will remain with the -\"us\" who are no longer \"now\". ",

            "answer_text": "There are many instances in the Bible where people were brought back from the dead (1 Kings 17:17-22; 2 Kings 4:32-35; 13:20-21; Matthew 9:23-25; 27:52-53; Luke 7:11-15; 8:40-56; John 11:43-44; Acts 9:40-41; 20:9-12). Even the resurrection of Jesus Christ is part of the Gospel (Isaiah 53:10-12; 1 Corinthians 15:1, 4). So, bringing someone back from the dead is not far from what God can do today. \"For I am the LORD, I change not\" (Malachi 3:6). I Jesus declares in John 14:12, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.\u201d Therefore, since God's power to raise the dead remains unchanged, and since Jesus promised that His followers would perform great miracles after He's gone back to heaven\u2013 yes, bringing back people from the dead is still possible today. In fact, there are some credible reports from Pentecostal and charismatic Christians around the world, showing that people have been brought back from the dead. Here are a few of the links to check on this subject: www.deceptioninthechurch.com/bonnke... www.charismanews.com/opinion/watchm... www.the-new-way.org/testimonies/ris... http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11244348/The-evangelicals-who-believe-they-can-raise-the-dead http://www.godisreal.today/raised-from-the-dead/ However, someone has rightly made this point which is very instructive: Surely if a person was raised from the dead in the name of Christ, it would convince everyone to receive Jesus as Savior. Right? Wrong. Jesus addressed this very issue in Luke 16:30-31, \u201cBut if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. .. . If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.\u201d Why does raising the dead probably not occur today? Amazing miracles are not what lead people to genuine faith. If a person is rejecting the Word of God, no miracle will convince the person to repent and receive Jesus Christ as Savior. All a miracle would do is cause people to clamor for more miracles (Matthew 12:39;John 6:26) ",

It has passed the lips of countless people all the way back to the beginning of time. loneliness,remorse, sorrow, pain, grief and longing have kept it alive to this day. I've read several books on the subject and many people have, to one degree or another, been able to contact the spirit of their departed. Mediums, psychics, shamans and priests have been able to bridge the gap between this world and the next. My own thoughts on the subject are based on a view of life that has evolved from many, currently unexplained, events I have experienced. Everyone you meet in your life, everyone, you meet them for a reason. You may never understand that reason until you are lying on your own deathbed, but that doesn't change the fact. The people that leave us, the ones we want to bring back, hold a special place in our hearts. This is most likely because we knew them in a previous life and have reestablished that connection in this one.We often don't look for the reason we met them in the first place, so letting go is difficult. What did their existence impart to you while they were here, What did your existence impart to them?  You can find solace in the fact that if your connection to them was so strong in this life, you will probably find them again in the next.  \"Don't spend so much time communing with the dead that you forget about the living\"                       Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil ",

            "answer_text": "Life and death are mutually exclusive; one cannot be both alive and dead. But if we stretch the word \u201cafter\u201d a bit then the Christian Bible tells us of a programme that involves a resurrection from the dead into a new life at a different level of quality - a life that will no longer be subject to death: eternal life. Now, if I understand your question somewhat differently, the answer is different too. Many people believe that some part of a person will survive the death of the body and will continue in some form of spirit life. In broad Christian circles this part that survives is called the \u201csoul.\u201d However, understanding the Bible properly shows that this belief in a soul that continues to live in some form is a serious misunderstanding caused by the introduction of Greek philosophy into the early Christian church. The easiest way to see this is by going back to how the Bible records the origin of life. Right at the beginning of the Bible in the book of Genesis (a word that means \u2018origin\u2019) we learn that after creating the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1) God created the first couple of people, a man and a woman, Adam and Eve, on the 6th day (Genesis 1:26\u201327). How the creation of Adam was done is then further explained in Genesis 2:7 which tells us that \u201cthe Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\u201d whereupon \u201cman became a living being\u201d ( or \u201ca living soul\u201d in some translations). Here we learn that a human person consists of two elements: a body made from chemicals available in the \u201cdust of the ground\u201d, and a life force that brings that body to life by giving it the process of breathing. Note especially that Genesis 2:7 does not say than man was given a \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d, but that the combination of body and breath (life force) produced a \u201cliving being\u201d or \u201cliving soul\u201d. Thus it is clear: the soul is the being, the person. When a person dies the reverse process takes place. This is clearly stated in Psalm 104:29 (and in many other passages) where we read, \u201cYou [God] take away their [the living creatures\u2019] breath, and they return to dust (words in [ ] inserted by me for clarification). The person dies. The body cannot live without the breath, and the breath (life force) cannot live without the body when it has no longer access to lungs and a heart. Note though, that is not the end of the story. The Bible also teaches us that there is a resurrection, a reunion of body and breath to create a new person now privileged to live eternally without ever seeing death again. The life, death, and resurrection of God\u2019s Son Jesus Christ is the prime example of God\u2019s beautiful plan to offer humanity new life when Jesus comes back from heaven (see John 11:23\u201324; Corinthians 15:51\u201354; 1 Thessalonians 4:13\u201317; Revelation 21:1\u20135, and many other texts). So, taking the long view of your question, the answer is YES. We can live (a long time) after we have died because God has made provision for all people to join Him for life eternal in a world made new where death and all kinds of misery will no longer be found, and life will be lived in the way it was originally intended to be lived.

            "answer_text": "If we look at this question from the Vedic point, each and everyone of us comes back from the dead, the theory of reincarnation proves just that, since I am a staunch follower of Vedic knowledge, I subscribe to the theory of reincarnation. The form is changed, the memory is apparently lost, nothing else changes, we remain same. The basic ingredients never changes, it always remain same. But I understand the perspective of the question as to returning from the dead, in this very life. There had been certain instances described in our culture, our history and we hear, sometimes, such rumours but I never had any experience note I had witnessed one. Yes, I have returned from meditation, many a times rather always and meditation has also been called as death from a different perspective. Actually, it is not possible to return from the dead since the death happens only after this apparatus is no longer fit to carry the life, this physical body has lost its capability to carry life within hence the death. How this capabilities are lost is not important, age, accident or disease, somehow the functioning of the body in an efficient way has become defunct, life goes away from the body and there cannot be any returning. In some cases, we hear, it is simply that the life has not gone out of the body, the body was still functional but we could not detect the life, it was our inability to detect life, it was our tools through which we measure presence of life have failed to measure life in the body but the life was still there and after sometime, things returned to normal, the life bubbled in that body. It may appear that that person had returned from the dead but he or she was not dead first time, we assumed, it's our fallacy. That's all. We also have heard them describing hell and heaven, those are nothing but the dreams they had suffered through when they were unconscious, which is what happens exactly when we actually die, our consciousness goes in sleep mode and the dreams gets started. The whole journey after death is completed in dreams with few instances of complete blackout. This is another subject, not relevant here. It's not possible to return from dead since it is not in our hands, it's the duty of some other forces which are not in our control and they functions as per cosmic law not as per our aspirations and whims.

Me and Anne were on our way to Bob's place to settle out the situation. On our way there, I prepared myself for \u201cbattle\u201d, as I knew that it was going to get ugly, so I called upon all my spiritual protectors. As we were getting closer, I could feel the protection that he has put around his place, and, as soon as we entered in the about 100 meters area around him, Anne was attacked (psychic), and fell down (out cold). In that exact moment, I put my right hand on her back, and the left hand reaching to the sky, calling the Angels. She was actually dead, for about 1 minute, and when she came back, she asked: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d. \u201cYou died!\u201d, I said, and continued our walk. So, believe me, Angels exist, and anything is possible in this 3D world. ",

If your body functions cease for a moment you are in helpless state, with your conciousness and mind on halt. If you stay that way you become dead when body cannot recover by any mean - but if you are revived you were at extreme state of \u201cable to keep living despite\u201d - this is because your vital organs - and especially brains - survived that situation so your life can continue. You were able to live the whole time, even when body was in (total) shutdown for some time. Death happens when you cannot recover no more. Not when your conciousness \u201cslips away\u201d for whatever reason or when your hearts stops beating. Death is defined by that point of no return, when you have no more enough-functional vessel or external method to reboot that vessel that keeps you connected to the world. Because it\u2019s one way street there is nobody coming back - those coming back were not dead - they were nearly there, but not trough the gate. Only way after death is - in some form - forward - if something is beyond death. ",

            "answer_text": "Please read the book \"The Laws of The Spirit World\" - By Khorshed Bhavnagri. Each of us have three bodies - the physical, the astral, the spiritual. When we die, we transcend from physical to astral and then to the spiritual. The souls who choose to remain in the astral form, without transcending to their spiritual being, are what we call ghosts and they accumulate a lot of karma by doing so. Its the law of the almighty that we go back to the spiritual world. Yet, he has given everyone the free will to make their choices. And based on our actions in this life, we will be placed to one of the 7 realms that exist; the more good you do, the higher you go, the more bad you do, the lower you go. We all reincarnate to pay off our karmas. We decide our birth and death date before we incarnate. There is usually 3 death dates, the 1st two usually pass off as an illness or accident that we survive and on our 3rd due date, we die. If a soul is unhappy, their subconscious mind requests the Almighty to take them back, when the person is in deep sleep, always without the conscious knowledge of the person. The life of a person is always in his hands, its a contract between him and the Almighty. The choices we make shapes our destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not that a person is reborn. It is our spirit who attaches to a series of physical lifetimes for the lessons they are expected to provide. Upon your physical death, your spirit will return to the spirit world, but you will experience it as your return; your human consciousness will be intact. You will be welcomed by the Light, greeted by loved ones from this and previous lifetimes, and your spiritual energy will be replenished. On the plane of learning, you will review every thought and action of your lifetime, and, with the guidance of Masters, determine what you might have done differently. You will compare the lessons that were to have been learned with what was learned and select the lessons for the next lifetime. This will take from several weeks to several years (of our time), depending on the status of your spirit and the complexities of your life. Your human identity will have been gradually merging with that of your spirit, and by now your spiritual identity will be dominant. On the plane of decision, you will decide which of the memories of your lifetime will become a part of your permanent spiritual identity. Your spirit might then begin to prepare for their next lifetime, which will be at least a year (approx..) after your death and perhaps many decades later. My sources are two spirits who spoke to me through another person (not channeled). To learn more about my experience with them, see profile link to The Invisible Choir. ",

She lifted her child in her hands and hugged with wet eyes but after few moments the child started crying. He became alive. What would you all this; is there a doubt to know about great master under whose law we are working as puppet (divine lila) certainly moving with certain absolute flawless law. This does not answer the query. The body is like clay image of various mineral that are perishable. The body is given with senses and MIND to interface which changes the perspective of life and so the meaning. The mortal is useful and has shelf life whereas the mind which is again housing intellect within and spirit much deeper are energy and or mix with consciousness that are not perishable so keep existing. A person would die and leave the mortal behind but how much the person has taken care of the imperishable element is important. Thus life after death or incarnation can be viewed from such perspective when each new life is a new drama with same goal of purifying the consciousness. It is a matter of believe and if doesn\u2019t still living life of value is a better way to spent life which anyway is going to perish. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus Christ promises: \"For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.\" John 6:40 The evidence that Jesus Christ is able to do this lies in the fact that He, Himself was raised from the dead. It is not a trivial matter to review all of the evidence for this, but are two good sources, both former antagonists of the idea that Jesus rose from the dead. The first is Lee Strobel, who started out as an investigative reporter with idea that he would use the tools of his trade to disprove this. Instead, Lee ended up proving it. He reported his finding in his book, \u201cThe Case for Christ\u201d. The second was Josh McDowell, who started a dis-believing student headed for law school. Josh wanted to use legal evidence to disprove this. He ended up proving it instead. He reported his findings in his book, \u201cEvidence that Demands a Verdict.\u201d Neither of these books is exhaustive but both contain compelling evidence and there are follow up books as well. If you are seeking the truth, I suggest that you read them. If you just want to reinforce your disbelief to make yourself feel more secure, don\u2019t bother. You have to be willing to accept the truth when you see it before you can know what truth is. ",

It is not supported by fact nor is it meant to offend or cause any distress due to the morbid nature or the lack of spirituality.* I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat death, I never do that. If you want a happy answer about being alive in people\u2019s memories, then read another answer. Besides, even if that is true, it\u2019ll only last about 100 year maximum then you\u2019ll be forgotten unless you\u2019re famous. Anyway\u2026Here is my version of reality: Unless you\u2019re like me and get resuscitated from \u2018death\u2019 before brain death, no. Once brain death occurs, it\u2019s impossible to be alive. That\u2019s your consciousness, that\u2019s your personality, your entire life gone. A bunch of tiny little neurons and sparks inside of a long tubular organ stop functioning Once this happens, there is no feeling, hearing, seeing, thinking. It\u2019s nothing. You, as an organism, cannot exist outside of your brain, once this dies, you die. There is no soul to be taken up to heaven, you go into a hole. Or a furnace if you desire. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how serious the incident they are in is. Say someone passed out while they were underwater for about half a minute. If they are not breathing as supposed to when pulled out of the water, lay them in the recovery position, call the ambulance, and do CPR. If you are not able to restore their breathing before the ambulance arrive but still have a pulse, the ambulance will take care of it and will most likely be able to restore them within a certain period of time. On the other hand, if they were to be stuck and to be drowned underwater for several minutes, there is a small chance of them surviving. While the victim is underwater, they obviously cannot breathe. If they are stuck like this for several minutes, their lungs and heart will stop working permanently, due to lack of oxygen. The body needs air for it to be fuctioning properly, and with no air, the body stop working and goes to a complete stop, which is lead to the death of the civilian. Don\u2019t take my word for granted though.. There have been cases where people have drowned and been submerged in water for ages, And are still able to be revived thanks to our modern technology. If someone has drowned, don\u2019t give up hope, because they can still be brought back to life. ",

Plants are a great deal like other life forms. They need attention. They need nurturing. They need sustenance. I\u2019d given this plant up for dead. I was ready to pluck it out of its pot and add it to the compost pile. The easy way out is to give up and move on. I would have except my son gave me this miniature rose bush last year for Mother\u2019s Day. I enjoyed the fragrance of the tiny roses all summer long then brought it inside hoping it would survive. I didn\u2019t want to tell him how easily I\u2019d given up. I didn\u2019t want to tell him I\u2019d thrown it out. So I worked at it then worked some more until eventually, it responded to my attention, my nurturing, and the sustenance I gave it. Now look at what it produced in gratitude for my perseverance.  This wintertime rose bud represents hope. Hope when all is thought lost. Edit: Many thanks to Cynthia Coleman for her advice on the how to nurture a rose bush. ",

You may have read in the book of Luke when Jesus first showed his resurrected body to his 11 Apostles who had gathered to discuss the events of that significant day: 36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.43 And he took it, and did eat before them. (Luke 24:36\u201343)We learn from this that the resurrection reunited the spirit and the physical body of Jesus Christ to bring his body back to life. You also note that in that condition he still ate the food his apostles ate. As for the extent of our own future resurrection, let me give you what a famous prophet in the Book of Mormon taught his own son about it and it is very specific as to how much of your body will be restored to you. \u201cthere is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works. Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets. The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame. And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets\u2014 And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God. (Alma 40:21\u201325) ",

On December 23, 1987, following a night of sex, drugs, and rock n\u2019 roll, Sixx injected one last syringe of heroin before calling it a night - promptly passing out cold and turning blue. By the time the emergency team arrived, Sixx was declared dead. As a last-ditch effort, after two long minutes, the paramedics gave him adrenaline - two shots, straight to the heart. Following the second injection, he instantly came to, and the rest is history. Moral of the story: Don\u2019t. Do. Drugs.  Fun Fact: The tune \u201cKickstart My Heart\u201d - one of Motley Crue\u2019s most recognizable and popular hits - was written by Sixx about the above incident. He wrote the song shortly after attaining sobriety. ",

I did not cross over nor do I have any memories of anything like that, though I believe in it. However, when I awoke, my artistic tendencies blossomed and I have become an Artist! It messed with my life, because before I was really focused on my career as an Executive Legal Assistant. I always loved working and being good at my job. However, my art is my soul shining and breathing, and I am so grateful for this gift. 16 years later, I am about to launch myself out into the world with a Shopify site, and I never believed that would happen to me! I even had a professional portfolio review, and my critic told me he could see my work hanging in museums one day (!!). I cried. Thank You Grandma Callis, I dedicate my art to you, because it involves flowers, and you so loved them. This was the very first image I did with a newer technique I taught myself in 2004, scanning flowers live with fabric as a background. I experimented madly for months and have hundreds of images from that time. I do not enhance anything about the image other than to erase lint and pollen because I finish the pieces in large format. My heart sings!  ",

Lots of people have died and come back to life through medicine. The body is a system, and the system can break if the vital parts aren\u2019t working properly, kind of like a car engine. If you can restore them to working order, you could come back to life. However, after a few minutes of having no oxygen, the cells themselves start breaking, making it effectively impossible to come back to life again. It\u2019s like the metal that makes the engine breaks apart, so fixing the engine parts doesn\u2019t solve the problem, anymore. In the end, it kind of all comes down to having the blood circulate in the body, and being able to breathe to get oxygen to the cells, and get CO2 out from the body. This way, the cells can survive. But obviously, if the brain is too damaged, we cannot be revived. Theoretically, it should be possible to revive someone no matter how long they\u2019ve been dead, assuming we had the \u201cperfect\u201d tools and science needed to do so. There\u2019s nothing theoretically impossible about it, it\u2019s just incredibly hard, and right now, we stand no chance of being able to do so. But in the future, perhaps.

The definition of death has undergone changes with new medical discoveries. Clinical death is the medical term for cessation of blood circulation and breathing, the two necessary criteria to sustain human and many other organisms' lives. It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest. The term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research. When a human's body is declared clinically dead, and there is no longer any available method for resuscitation, then NO, that person cannot come back to life. Once the available cellular ATP energy is depleted (within minutes), the body is dead. You have nothing to fear about any corpse rising from the grave, a zombie apocalypse, etc. \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf83 ",

We all experience that, virtually day in, day out. Certainly there are myths and anecdotes suggesting instances to the contrary but all lack anything like the compelling evidence that we tend to demand for things that are typically not also the subject of faith based belief. Can such events have happened, or might they in the future? We can\u2019t absolutely dismiss the possibility but, when it comes to the dearth of actual credible, testable evidence for it having happened already, the resultant infinitesimally small likelihood the physical laws, as we understand them to be, were violated, makes it reasonable to go about our business as if resurrection doesn\u2019t happen (until actual evidence appears, that is).

According to the philosophy of Gita, the death is defined as the soul leaving the body. We are not just the external looking body. We are soul living in the body like a driver driving the car. As when driver leaves the car, car cannot move. Similarly when the soul leaves the body, body is said to be dead. Our Body has 2 parts : Gross body which we can see composed of five elements - earth, water, fire, air and space.Subtle body made of Mind, Intelligence and Ego.During death Soul along with the subtle body leaves the gross body (now called as dead body) and goes to the next destination. Now where the soul goes is very interesting, it all depends on what kind of actions we performed, what kind of desires we accumulated accordingly we will go to Human body or any animal body or any species of life.Heaven or Hell for reaping reward or punishment respectively.Spiritual World if we acheived perfection of human life.Hope this answer helps you to some extent.

            "answer_text": "Resurrection actually means moving away from the physical body in which we presently live into a spiritual body given to us by God. No human being has the capacity to resurrect a dead body. Only God can do it. Jesus Christ is known as the first-fruit from the dead. God raised Him after He was dead after His crucifixion. Many people came back to life after they died in the Old Testament as well as the New. But they died again after some time. We read that Enoch [Genesis 5 : 24 ] and Elijah [ 2 Kings 2 : 11 ] went to be with God without going through the process of death. That is actually transformation of the body. It cannot be called as resurrection. That is the reason why Jesus is called as the first fruit from the dead. He was resurrected from the dead and He lives for ever in heaven, never to die again. Jesus said before went to the cross,\u201dI go to prepare a place for you. And if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and I will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also\u201d [ John 14 : 2, 3 ]. This hope He has given to all who are redeemed by Him and have believed in Him. Therefore, we await His coming any time. Apostle Paul writes, \u201cFor since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel,, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words\u201d [ 1 Thessalonians 4 : 14\u201318 ]. ",

In the Bible, God plainly states that for those who are born again of the spirit, \u201csaved\u201d: \u201cto be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord\u201d. Unfortunately, for those who reject the gospel message, the Word of God, and to die in there sins, their soul go to a place known as Gehenna (Hell) where they await their final Judgment at the \u201cGreat White Throne\u201d judgement where God himself ask for an account of their life and if they are found to be guilty on even one part of the law, they will be sentenced to death. This is the Gospel (Good News) message, that Christ came and died for our sins and for all who believe in him and call on His name, they will not die but have everlasting life. Through one man, Adam, sin came into the world and through one man, Christ, salvation has come. God Bless!! ",

It is possible, though it may be difficult, to bring back such a person from death. This accounts for all the NDE cases (near death experiences) who have narrated their death experience after revival. And there are a few lucky ones who have shown signs of life after being declared dead and before their bodies were cremated or buried. Death actually happens when the silvery etheric cord that links the etheric body to the dense physical body, at the navel. When cord this is snapped, death becomes irreversible. It is said that even God cannot bring back such cases to life. Unfortunately, doctors cannot see the etheric cord, but clairvoyants can. ",

If the person\u2019s memories and personalities are permanently lost upon death, then no amount of physical resurrection will bring those people back; you might as well have brought to life a husk of a person, while the person themselves stayed dead. But if we can map every neuron and every pattern in the brain and how they change as memories and personalities change, then we can probably keep a snapshot of your mind at a certain point, and then transfer that into a new shell (be it biological or mechanical). See SOMA on Steam for the possible implications of being able to bring back people from death in this manner. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of death. People can be revived after Clinical death - when breathing and the circulation of blood cease. Attempts at resuscitation are also believed to have be the cause of Lazarus syndrome, the spontaneous return of circulation after failed attempts at resuscitation due to a buildup of pressure during CPR. So yes, you can come back from clinical death, but only if clinical death occurred recently. People have also on occasion \u2018come back from the dead\u2019 after being erroneously declared to be dead, as in the case of French Astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil, who returned to Paris after an eleven year expedition to discover that he had been Declared dead in absentia, his wife had remarried and he\u2019d been replaced in the Academy of Sciences. (Interesting side note - Living Ohio man Donald Miller ruled 'legally dead' - BBC News). People do also on occasion fake their deaths, before being found alive. One example that comes to mind is the story of John Darwin (Canoe Man Documentary - part 1) , who was found alive in 2007, five years after his supposed death in a canoeing accident. The fraudulent death allowed John and his wife, Anne, cash in \u00a3501,641.39 in life insurance and pension payouts, and plan a new life in Panama. However, a change in Panama's visa laws prompted John to return to England, claiming amnesia. This supported police suspicion over his disappearance and prompted an investigation. People have also on occasion been declared medically dead in error, as in the case of this unfortunate Polish Woman Polish woman declared dead wakes up in mortuary - BBC News. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There is no scientific evidence that it has ever happened. Every account of someone coming back to life after death is either from a religious text, in which the person returned from the dead via supernatural means, or someone currently alive who says they were dead and came back. The first category isn\u2019t something we can verify one way or the other. Maybe it did happen, but we can\u2019t prove it, especially since nearly all of the supernatural resurrections are said to have occurred long ago. In any case, since none of us are deities or have direct physical access to one in the present time, it doesn\u2019t matter. Even if someone did come back from the dead through supernatural means, it\u2019s not something we can achieve. The second category is nearly all people who went into cardiac arrest, and therefore some people say they \u201cdied\u201d before their heart was shocked back into beating. But that\u2019s not really death; actual death is when brain activity ceases (I would maintain this to be true even in people who are \u201cbrain dead\u201d but whose bodies keep functioning due to artificial means). The brain can continue to function for some time even if the heart is stopped. And as long as it is still functioning, the person is not dead. ",

However, people who have sustained too much trauma either from whatever it was that killed them or due to cell death resulting from oxygen deprivation when blood stops flowing, if the degree of trauma is servere enough, can be beyond current medical science to resessitate. In the future, some forms of trauma that cannot be reversed now may eventually become within the realm of possibility to reverse and repair, which is why some people go to great lengths and expense to use cryogenic preservation of their bodies upon death in the hopes that a future civilization may be able to repair their body and bring them back to life (this is not to endorse cryogenic preservation, which often does not make sense monetarily or socially, but rather to point out the connection between these two topics).

He is dead but he is still alive because of his love for the country,because of his ideals, his works and will be alive for the comming generations to inspire them too. you know this man?  Do you think he is dead? Well I don\u2019t think so.He is very alive in the soul of every Indian.And trust me he is not overrated,he was much needed man for India\u2019s independence at that time.His thoughts, beliefs ,his principles will always be alive. You know this man?  At the age of 23 when we complain our moms to give us money for new cell phones and other stuffs, he was suffering extreme torture by the Britishers for the nation. For me atleast he will always be alive. Do you know her?  Single handedly troubled the whole British army. She can never be dead. Do you know this man?  Does he needs introduction? At that time when nobody even dared to stand against the orthodox beliefs he stood against the whole society and helped to abolish the whole \u2018sati pratha\u2019(which was one of the most heinous crimes against women). So my friend if one is dead then he can be still alive in the hearts of everyone through his works,his values,his beliefs and his actions as n inspiration for everyone. Peace Jai Shree Krishna ",

So, if you can bring the person back from the state, it is not \u201cdead\u201d. However, we could manage to resucitate patients from states that would normally considered \u201cdead\u201d. In which case, those states would be removed from the \u201cthis patient is dead\u201d assessment. The answer, then, depends on how advanced the state was. For instance, there is no coming back from having your brain incinerated. However, it may turn out to be possible to stimulate a flat-lined brain into live where there is some semblance of the original personality there. Without the original personality, how is that bringing the person back? Also: would recording the personality into a computer and then replacing the brain of a dead person with that so the computer runs the body count as bringing the person back? It\u2019s not the original person, but a copy of their earlier mind\u2026.. tricky. So really\u2026 it also depends on what you mean by \u201cbring back\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, yes. The most reliable record of ancient history extant today, the Bible, records several accounts of people who were raised from the dead. Now, to begin with, this doesn\u2019t mean that the Bible is the kind of book that teaches that people can just come back to life all the time, willy-nilly. Rather, it is the Bible that teaches that death is a very serious thing and an enemy of mankind. However, the Bible does teach that there is one who is stronger than death, i.e. God, and therefore we ought not find it shocking that God, being all-powerful can raise the dead. The Apostle Paul made this point in Acts 26:8, when he said before King Agrippa, \u201cWhy do any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?\u201d Now, these \u201cresurrections\u201d I\u2019m about to list were in fact temporary in nature. They were more than the medical resuscitations that sometimes occur on the O.R. table (and thank God for those!), but they were nonetheless not permanent. As far as we know, all of the following people eventually died again. However, there is one historical personage who stands apart from this list, and that\u2019s Jesus. He rose from the dead, and did so permanently. Paul called him \u201cThe firstborn from among the dead\u201d (Colossians 1:18), indicating that there would be others who would experience a similar (permanent) resurrection. But before that, let\u2019s list those folks who came back to life (again, temporarily) in biblical history (I got this list from gotquestions.org, and you can look it up for yourself over there).[1] Before Jesus (raised by holy men acting in the power of God): The Widow of Zarephath\u2019s son, raised by Elijah the Prophet (1 Kings 17:17\u201324).The Shunammite woman\u2019s son, raised by Elisha the Prophet (2 Kings 4:18\u201337).The dead man raised out of Elisha\u2019s grave, after being tossed in (2 Kings 13:20\u201321).Raised by Jesus (God the Son in the flesh): The only son of the Widow of Nain, raised during his funeral! (Luke 7:11\u201317).Jairus\u2019s daughter (Luke 8:53\u201356).Lazarus, the friend of Jesus (John 11).Raised when Jesus died \u201cMany holy people,\u201d raised when Jesus gave up the ghost in Matthew 27:50\u201353).After Jesus Tabitha, a good and helpful woman raised by the Apostle Peter (Acts 9:36\u201343).Eutychus, a young man who couldn\u2019t stay awake during Paul\u2019s lengthy sermon, fell out the upper floor window, died, and was \u201cawakened\u201d by the preacher who had put him to sleep (Acts 20:7\u201312)!So the short answer is yes, this is possible. But the long answer is that, believe it or not, everyone will. The desire to live on after death is an ancient one, and it\u2019s undoubtably shared by the vast majority of humanity. What many don\u2019t realize is that, one way or another, everyone will experience a return to life after death. Some will live forever in a new Heaven and Earth, with God and God\u2019s people. And others will be punished forever\u2014not exactly a glorious resurrection! The Prophet Daniel foresaw a time when, \u201cThere will be a time of distress, the likes of which will not have occurred from the beginning of nations until that time. But at that time your people\u2014everyone whose name is found written in the book\u2014will be delivered. And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, but others to shame and everlasting contempt\u201d (Daniel 12:2). The dividing line between those who enjoy their afterlife and those who do not will be whether they turned from their sin and gave their allegiance to the Son of Man. See this other prophecy by Daniel: \u201cI saw in the night visions,and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man,and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him;his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away,and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed\u201d (Daniel 7:13\u201314). According to the Apostle John, those whose names are written in the Book of Life in Heaven are those who belong to the Son of Man (Revelation 20:15), and it is they who will receive eternal life as children of God (John 1:12). There is only one way to be sure that you will receive a glorious resurrection and immortality: turn from your sin and believe in Jesus Christ. He said this about himself in John 11:25\u201326: \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?\u201d I hope this answers your question, and I truly hope you decide to be one of the ones who live forever with God!

There is a point of no return (diagnosed brain dead), but the line seems to be fuzzy. There are many cases of brain dead patients making almost full recoveries. The most touching being of a father who barricaded himself in his son\u2019s hospital room threatening to shoot himself if anyone entered. The doctors were going to pull of the plug on the boy. After a long stand-off the son showed signs of life and recovered. I don\u2019t know what happened to the father, but I\u2019m sure he has no regrets or feelings of guilt. I wouldn\u2019t. So no, you can\u2019t bring anything back from the dead. Any instances that seem that way are example of us not fully understanding what our bodies can take, with possibly some providence thrown in imo. ",

Do that we are looking at death as into a tunnel, the end is no different than then a kind of the Begining and the logic or the shape of the begiining or whatever you want to call it, is the logic you see going into it. We are born in a body programed to be what you are now. That wisdom in your body in each cell is what is all around you and in you. You are just a harmony of light, a fold of space inhabited by the potentiality that causes you that is pinched of sorts between awareness and reality. Reality is an echo of potentiality. We are sound caused by a HARMONY of literals of \u00c2N\u00c2, the first light, aka dark matter. What you see as bright light is a true vacuum because white is the logical absence of light while black is the logical presence of all the colors.

Is the universe expanding or breathing (expanding and collapsing)? If we go back to a singularity and it big-bangs again, how could the expansion be any different then before? a singularity is a singularity and by definition is uniform. How could it possibly expand in a different way? Because if this I think we are stuck in an infinite loop doing the same thing over and over, becoming concious at birth, repeating our same lives the same way, and as soon as we die, time becomes somthing we can't experience until the universe contracts again, then big-bangs again and we pop out the same vagina and repeat it all again, with all previously stored memories resetting and rebuilding the same, all without us knowing it is happening.

Gautama Buddha described entering Nirvana as the great death. Nirvana is a very deep level of cessation but even here it is not absolute because it is followed by the Awakening, the literal meaning of Buddha. Gautama called it the great death because unlike most deaths here you don\u2019t reincarnate. Rather you recall all your past incarnations. The way the \u2018Dead\u201d come back to life is by resonating with that which Awakens one from Nirvana. Gautama called it Tathagata, or that which Comes and Goes. Lao Tzu called it Tao. The Bible refers to it as the un-Caused Cause. These term are all pointing to the same thing. It\u2019s a vibration but one unlike any other. It\u2019s eternal perpetual motion\u2026Eternal Life if you will. ",

Doctors in a hospital check the patient's vitals and say that he/she is dead. But in the meanwhile, the souls of the dead persons (if they exist) could travel to another world and come back. In one case, a lady went into coma. And for some time, there was not puse. When th doctors reviwed her, she said that she was taken to some world where the lord of death told her that she was not due to die then. And sent her back. Once my grand father heard someone talking when he was half awake in the morning that his time has come to die. Then another person said that \"No, this is the wrong person. There is another person by the same name.\"  The next day, my grand father woke up to find that another man by his name had died in the town. Now, some believers in Indian religions may believe this incident to be true. But there are others who have already decided that there can be no GOD, hell, or heaven, etc., (even believe what they say) say that it is all rubbish. They have no proof that there is not GOD, or no hell or heaven. They also only believe that they do not exist without any proof.

            "answer_text": "The answer is \u2018Yes\u2019 and \u2018No\u2019. How? Reincarnation is a very interesting and complex subject. For understanding this type of subject we requires background knowledge about soul (jiva, the living entity), super-soul (param-atma or Ishvara), eternal time (kala), nature (prakriti) and activity (karma). When we discuss about reincarnation, it is applicable to jivas i.e. living entities. But there are two type of living entity. First nitya badha (eternally conditioned), second nitya mukta (eternally unconditioned). And it is nitya badha who is undergoing through the process of reincarnation, not the nitya mukta. Nitya mukta comes to this material world only to take part in the activities of the Lord. Nitya badha are souls/jivas who are coming in this material world to lord and enjoy the matter. Therefore, they cannot become nitya mukta without the mercy of nitya mukta soul(s). Unfortunately, we all comes under nitya badha jivas. Hence we all will go through the process of reincarnatiion i.e. birth after death. And the type of body what we are going to received will be decided by the activities (karma) we performed in this very life. Now the question may arise: Will nitya badha jivas ever escape reincarnation? The answer is yes, they(we) can escape. The process is very simple. By devotional service to Lord Krishna (God has unlimited names, I m using one of His name. We can use other names of Him as well). We all can escape reincarnation and never return back to this cruel mortal material world again. For more information you can visit the following site.

If you mean as you are now, as soon as we die we have no conscience, every thing goes black. It would feel just as we felt before we were born. However, there is some evidence proving the existence of paranormal, so we could even come back as a ghost in certain circumstances. But whether or not we'd be conscious is a different question. Or maybe we could actually wake up. Wake up into an alternate dimension which is actually reality, to find out that our life was one huge computer simulation (check out the matrix!) So, there are lots of different possibilities and beliefs of whether we come back to life or not. Believe in whichever one you want to! ",

The closest thing you can do is get a VOLENTARY lender to TEMPORARILY share thier body with the spirit you conjure, they would have different conciousness making it so that neither would have the others memory but you must only make this commitment temporary or the souls will fuse togther, creating a split personality of sorts. No more than 15 minutes to an hour in the same week is the safest way to do this. Let me be clear, this is not safe for the volunteer in any way at all. None what so ever. If the other soul is stronger than the living soul then the deceased soul could kill the living one and take it's place if they don't want to go back to being dead. ",

For example, if someone\u2019s heartbeat weakens to the point of stopping, but the hospital staff successfully gets it going again with the crash cart / paddles, it\u2019s likely that there will be little to no lasting damage, especially compared to what would be if their respiration and heartbeat stopped for enough time to cut communication to the brain. Now, in terms of \u201cafter death\u201d, I would say the answer is no. Once every life function has ceased down to even the most trivial functions of the brain, or those nervous reflexes not controlled by the brain (such as the Lazarus reflex- a rare phenomenon where a dead body will extend its arms and cross them over its chest), there is no returning as far as I know.

This unique storage process allows the cells to continue to consume their backed up reserves of oxygen and sugar and create lactic acid. The acid continues to break down the muscle tissue creating a very soft tender meat. This process continues for 28 days. After 28 days each cell would have to be provided with new nutrients in order for it not to starve to death so theoretically it takes 28 days for something to truly die. If you could revitalize each of the cells with new fuel stores then find someway to get the entire system to become self-sustaining again through advanced life support it might be possible even at that point to bring the target back to life . The key would be controlling the degradation process if it exceeds too far you're done. ",

Assuming you could bring someone back to life, I would imagine that the person would be a different person altogether. The brain consists of synapses which I liken to an old cine camera. They store and process memories, emotions, feelings etc but once the person dies, the synapses \u201csnap\u201d and erase\u2026. If the brain (i.e. the cine film) was turned back on the synapses would be damaged. The person would need to re-learn how to write, walk and all memories would no longer exist. In short, the revived person wouldn\u2019t be the same person anymore. Said person might also have sustained brain damage while they were deprived of oxygen. I don\u2019t think there will ever be a possibility to bring someone back from the dead. When you die, I am pretty confident you die permanently. ",

Take special care of your health, and you will be able to for instance copy a painting from a place you've never been awake to, as a proof of leaving your body when you sleep. I once had an accident, and I remember saying to myself while analyzing the injuries in my brain: \"Oh this is for at least one year of rehabilitation\".

If you apply the strict definition of death - \"the irreversible cessation of all vital functions of the body, especially as indicated by permanent stoppage of the heart, respiration, and all brain activity including that in the brain stem\" - then the answer is categorically no. However it's common to hear people whose heart and respiration has ceased being described as dead, however this isn't strictly correct, and there are literally thousands of cases where people \"have been brought back to life\" after this has happened.  The one common factor in all such cases is that there's still brain activity going on, so whilst it might be correct to say they've suffered heart death, it was neither permanent nor irreversible. But what is very clear is that once one's vital organs and entire brain have ceased to function, there is no going back. Thanks for the A2A. ",

If you believe in God, you know He exists, but not physically, not in this dimension. So, following from that, you can bring dead humans to life by remembering them, by keeping them alive through you. This is why those who gave their lives long ago for the defense of your country, whichever it may be, are still alive. Their essence lives on through those who remember them. So, although being physically dead, they are alive. Their memory still has an effect on those who are physically alive. If this answer isn\u2019t satisfying, you can always try to bring the dead back like Moses or Jesus, though you chance of success will be a little more than the chance of this answer getting a million upvotes.

Human beings were created in Paradise first by God in their actual image, then they\u2019re dead and sent to Earth in a spermatozoide, after that they are born and don\u2019t remember anything from before. After that they live their FIRST LIFE on Earth which is a Test for human kind to distinguish the good and the bad ones. Then they die and go back to Earth. Lastly, when the time comes for The Day of Judgement, all human beings inside Earth will regrow like Plants and Trees after Rain, then everyone will face God and will be judged for what he has done on Earth. Finally, if you\u2019ve done more good than bad you will have an eternal afterlife in Paradise, if not, you will go to Hell. THAT\u2019S THE STORY OF CREATION. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of dead. I am assuming you mean someone who is medically declared dead and has the final rites performed and cremated. Only ashes are left. No, he cannot be raised from the dead. Only Jesus rose from the dead if you believe that. Recently some scientist were able to restore electrical activity in the brains of pigs that had been slaughtered for meat by perfusing them with solutions carrying oxygen and nutrients. Sheep have been genetically cloned but the personalty of the clone is not the same as that of original. This leads me to believe that life is a series of experiences electrically recorded by neurons. Once the neurons are dead the records of experiences is deleted as well much like the hard drive of a computer experiencing power failure. If you are talking spiritually as through mediums etc then the short answer would be nobody knows for sure. The scientific community would say no. But there are people who believe otherwise and you cannot argue with peoples beliefs. Hope this answers you question at least partially. ",

            "answer_text": "The way I see this is that it is our soul (spirit) that is reborn. So I personally will not be reborn - my soul will take on a different situation, possibly a different gender and possibly in another part of the world with a different language. But as I am also my soul deep down, so the matter is a little more complex. The easiest way to understand it is to see your present situation as a projection of your soul. It is like a character and drama that you (soul you) is playing out. And this in order to learn something or contribute something - otherwise there would be no point to the experience. We are all heading back to Love on our individual soul journeys. I hope this helps. PS If you are looking for a spiritual take on life. My book, Life and Death: Making Sense of It will help - particularly with this discussion. It has just been updated and right now it is at a rock-bottom price on Amazon: Kindle \u00a31.72, Paperback a staggering \u00a30.86 (normal price \u00a310.97). It is changing day by day.

I think recurring life can\u2019t be proven scientifically because the \u201cme\u201d inside our consciousness is very complex, so even though it\u2019s true, there\u2019s no way to know maybe currently I\u2019m living my #12.211th life.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it\u2019s possible to revive someone who has just died. Defibrillation paddles can be used to re-start the heart, and CPR is common practice. A lot depends on how the person died. If there are obvious traumatic injuries all over the body, such as might occur in a car wreck or similar accidents, chances aren\u2019t as good for revival. If medical help isn\u2019t readily available, chances go down. If a baby rattlesnake has just bitten you and you are alone on a hiking trail, you may not make it. Sometimes people are revived only to die again on the way to the hospital. An oddity of death is what happens if someone goes into very cold water and doesn\u2019t get fished out right away. In some of those instances the person\u2019s body responds by slowing the heartbeat and moving heat to the core. People have survived and been revived after accidents like this, without brain damage or harm to other vital organs. ",

These are facts that still cannot be proven or measured because we have not developed the technology or the personal righteousness to look beyond the veil. The only way we can know it is true would be to go to that spirit world and see what it is like. Unfortunately, very few people have come back to give us any idea of what it is like. One thing I do know is that it is a better place for people who behave themselves in this life, than it will be for the people who indulge themselves and commit crimes as part of their normal life.

What really swung it for me was the various reports of the afterlife through a number of Spiritual mediums, non of which could confirm any reincarnation taking place \u2026.end of! I say \u201cthank God for that\u201d as I really don't like the idea of being stuck on a perpetually revolving wheel of repeated lives which means going back to school again and again and again \u2026..Yeeeeauchh that sucks.

There\u2019s no documented modern cases to my knowledge, and those that are claimed have happened outside of a hospital setting, implying that the person was in a state that mimicked death but was not dead, which is a thing.

To be born again means that your soul is regenerated free from the bondage of sin so that you are fit for heaven. You will eventually become spiritually and morally perfect.

Thus it can be a good thing, so; I think people's deaths sometimes are more moral and beneficial than their lives.. If you know what I mean. If you're speaking in metaphor, I assure you that those dead people can be brought to life, just they must not wait for people to save them or rescue them. The tip here is in finding your potentials, in finding what you love and hate, what you don't wanna do, and what you wanna do and then comeback to life and put your mark there ; whether by plotting the best revenge or writing the best book or maybe just maybe.. Be a better person , a happier one for yourself . ",

HE spoke to me and while HE was ascending upwards towards HEAVEN, i ask HIM if i could please go with HIM. HE gently told me it was not my time and i must tell the people that HEAVEN is REAL and that GOD is REAL and they must please except HIS SON JESUS as their LORD AND SAVIOUR before they die. My wife is my witness. Three days later HE asked me to start reading the Bible [KJV which is the nearest to the original manuscript languages of Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament - ALL New Bible translations are corrupted]. After JESUS at one time took me into the lowest part of the earth, i experienced the reality of HELL. JESUS visited me four times. MESSIAH Blessings and JESUS-LOVE to all\u2026 ",

After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. 1 Thes 4:16-18 \"And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.

            "answer_text": " Under certain circumstances it is possible to return a newly deceased person to life. Today these circumstances occur more frequently than in the past thanks to the modern techniques of cardiac resuscitation. The most interesting thing is that a large percentage of these \"returned\" people describe a similar phenomenology. They talk about how they abandoned the physical body, how they floated above it, how they could move with the only thought. They speak of the deep well-being they felt and of how at a certain moment they were propelled through a tunnel at the end of which shone a white Light that did not blind and that irradiated a tremendous love. Of how when reaching the Light they ended in Heaven or Paradise; how they were received by their deceased loved ones and other spiritual guides. How these guides told them that they should return because the time of their death had not yet arrived; and how they were sucked back through the tunnel to wake up in the midst of severe pain on the operating table or wherever they were resuscitated. This experience is called NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. (The image is from a painting by Hyeronimus Bosch, El Bosco, 15th century) ",

In some cases, people have been essentially frozen and without air for close to an hour, and still managed to make a full recovery. The human body is a funny thing. People have been killed by the most random things, but they've also survived things that we'd think were impossible. There are a number of people walking around today who were considered technically dead at one point. ",

It becomes smaller for them and their bones are broken and ribs go into one another. On the other hand the people who did good deeds are also rewarded in their graves. A window from heaven is opened in their graves. But if you are saying that become alive after death in the form of vampires and ghosts then that is not true. It's called science fiction. ",

If a person has been dead for more than 20 minutes, chances are that the brain cells are already dying off, blood starts to cloth throughout the body, making sure the heart, even when it starts can not revive yhe dying tissue or organs.

The alternative is unthinkable, because the decision you make now is for all eternity. You cannot be reborn because you are appointed one death only. The evidence of God is irrefutable when you look at created things. The odds of evolution are billions to one against. The historical evidence of Jesus is without question.

Claim your life as your own, live each moment to the fullest, try to be as productive as possible, having as much fun as possible. Imagine this is your only go around, and actively work to make it a good one. Interestingly, the popular notion of YOLO (you only live once) presses importance on choosing to make the most out of life, but the opposite does the same. YALA( you always live again) a philosophy made popular by the activist singer of the band MIA, says that you have infinite chances to live again, therefor you should make the most out of life and not be afraid to takes risks. I live my life as if both are simultaneously true, I don\u2019t know which is, but it will only benefit you to actively seek out fully experiencing whatever you can. ",

By dead man i assume you mean that you feel lifeless that nothing gives you pleasure and you cant feel happiness and achievement in anything you do. I can relate to the feeling. The best advice i can give you is to get out of your COMFORT ZONE!. try new things in life. One of the best quotes i have ever read is \u201cLife begins right outside your comfort zone. You have to stir the water a little. look at the river vs the sea. When there are events happening in your life; you will feel alive. I can suggest a few things for starters: working out! (number one on the list)dance classesdating websitesjoin a community on facebook or any social media that shares your interestsReconnect with people you once felt you were happy with (im not talking about ex-s) :)MediationThe trick here is to be willing to find the inner energy and motivation to do those things. this would be easy if you feel dead inside basically because you have nothing to lose .. so why not try out new things ;) .. hopefully this helps and good luck with your life.
