            "answer_text": "To Eugene Makhanu, Turnitin and other software applications are extremely effective at detecting paraphrasing, which is a modification of someone else\u2019s work and is considered plagiarism. Software is set up to catch identical wording, so a paraphrase will be flagged if it leaves certain words unchanged and only modifies some words. In fact, Turnitin posted an article on this topic: Does Turnitin Detect Plagiarism? As Turnitin states on that page regarding similarity between documents: \u201cTurnitin offers a tool that helps educators (and their students) make informed evaluations of student work rapidly.\u201d However, even if plagiarism is not detected, the student\u2019s instructor may figure out that the student merely plugged in synonyms into someone else\u2019s work, which Turnitin would not catch, but the end result would sound strange. Either way, the student loses. Here\u2019s an example of two pieces of text. The first is by Shakespeare. The second is my wonky paraphrase. Any instructor would recognize what I did and fail me. SHAKESPEARE (from Romeo and Juliet): What's in a name? That which we call a roseBy any other word would smell as sweet; SARAH\u2019S PARAPHRASE: How much information does an artificial appellation really contain? We may label it a flowering specimen from the genus Rosa, yet if we were to choose a different title, it would still affect our olfactory system in the same sugary manner.   A flowering specimen from the genus Rosasource: pixabay \u2014 photographer: KleineKiwi (Heike \u2022 Deutschland)  TIPS: PRO TIP #1: If you change EVERY SINGLE WORD in your paraphrase to avoid detection by Turnitin, your end result will sound stilted, which will be a red flag to the professor even if the software might not catch it. PRO TIP #2: Wouldn\u2019t it be much easier (and more ethical) to simply write your own material? WARNINGS: These applications will detect and highlight strings of words that are identical to another piece of text, even if you changed multiple words within the original material.  TRUE STORY: I have a friend who got caught when her university\u2019s software flagged her paraphrasing (plagiarism). She is from Moldova, and thought she wasn\u2019t plagiarizing because she had changed many of the words. She had done primary research for over five years at a respected university in Germany, and most of her doctoral dissertation was her own work. She became a little sloppy in citing at least one source, and should never have copied such a large amount of text into her work. She changed select words here and there (to paraphrase the original), but the end result was recognizably taken from someone else\u2019s work, and the sentences and arguments were in the same order. It would have been fine to quote a short section, that is, copy a few lines and properly quote them, but she made several key mistakes. She should have added quotation marks and provided proper citations and references when doing so.  PRO TIP: Don\u2019t be lazy. Write your own stuff! \u2014Sarah M., 11/3/2018 (revised 11/10/2018), I write my own words.  QUESTION: Can Turnitin detect paraphrasing? How effective is Turnitin? ",

            "answer_text": "Turnitin will detect paraphrasing if it is a direct quote from your source. Best bet is to use quotes and paraphrasing sparingly with purpose, and rephrase concepts and idea\u2019s in your own words as much as possible. It shows you have a solid understanding of what you\u2019re writing about and brings down your plagiarism percentage. I know at my university, Turnitin even detects quotes from my own and other students previous assignments (students across the other side of the country!) so no reusing old assignments! If you\u2019re teachers are really awesome they may allow you to view the plagiarism % in the review screen when you submit your assignment. This rarely happens for me but it is a super useful tool for understanding how Turnitin works, and how to avoid plagiarism when you have the opportunity to use it. You can see highlighted exactly what are not your own words with their detected sources, and have a raw percentage. Aim to be nothing more than 30% direct quotes, anything more will likely incur penalties in your marks. If your percentage is really high the work will be considered plagiarised. If you have the ability to edit your assignment to bring down the percentage of direct quotes, when you resubmit your assignment, it will take 24 hours for you to review plagiarism % so don\u2019t leave it until last minute! Your teachers are your best resources if you\u2019re unsure of what their expectations are regarding paraphrasing, quotes, etc. Ask your teacher for help if you\u2019re not sure what they want from you :) To every one offering to set up accounts for Grammarly and Turnitin at \u201cfriendly pricing\u201d\u2026 what are you on about?

            "answer_text": "At this time, Turnitin does not appear to catch paraphrasing. But paraphrasing is not necessarily plagiarism. Verbatim plagiarism is the only plagiarism that is de facto plagiarism; the paraphrasing of research and creative articles is essential to the work of journalists, who could not otherwise comment on the work of others. So-called patchwriting is something else. This is where you take an existing piece, and find synonyms for some of the words in it, and turn that in as your own. That IS plagiarism. ",
