            "answer_text": "Alot of info about SOP's of all sorts can be easily found on the internet. But I will make the effort to highlight some points after reviewing the draft of your SOP you sent me. (Get prepared to be judged in public ha ha!) Don't repeat facts and expressions. Once you have written it all down, go through it once again to check if there are any repetitions.Where ever you are highlighting an achievement or quality, support it with real life examples, of what you did. Don't merely say that you are a good team player. But say that you have been working with synergy with the diff project teams you have had to work with and have quickly adapted to their needs/ or always been the guy making extra effort w/o being asked during crunch days to pull the team along.SOP isn't about too much detail though.Don't give the whole story away here but do use action items to highlight qualities rather than only adjectives. Kind of let them know that there is a story. But the SOP is about the bigger story of how you ended up applying for whatever it is and your motivations rather than the details of smaller stories.Make sure the purpose is clear through-out the statement. The opening statement talks of your motivations. The body talks how your experiences have helped you prepare for the role you are applying for and the conclusion clearly talks about what you want to do/achieve/learn at said role etc.P.S: Hope it helps you and others too.",
