            "answer_text": "By not following 90% of the \u201cadvice\u201d in the link. That\u2019s a bunch of hooey. I\u2019m a magazine editor, and I\u2019ve used freelancers for more than 20 years. (I\u2019ve also freelanced.) During a typical year, we\u2019ll need about 24 freelance articles. Our pay\u2014based on the writer\u2019s ability, experience, the difficulty of the article, and other factors\u2014ranges from 50 cents to $1.00 a word. We run articles from 1,500 to 3,500 words, so we\u2019ll pay, on average, $1,000-$2,500 an article. In other words, we\u2019re real. Actually getting freelance writing jobs is fairly simple: Identify a niche, or multiple niches: Sports. Healthcare. Technology. Human resources. Science and the environment. Transportation regulation. Small business. TV celebrities. Build a portfolio of articles. You may be faced with the \u201cchicken or the egg\u201d conundrum. Without a portfolio, how do you get assignments? Well, you get them by identifying several publications that run the sort of articles you can write. Aim for the smaller ones, likely with little or no budget. Be persistent. You\u2019ll get an assignment. Do a good job on the assignment. Turn in a clean article that matches what the editor asked for. And turn it in on time. Keep at it until you have 8\u201310 or so good published articles. Now identify the next tier up. Those are the publications with at least a moderate budget. Get familiar with those publications\u2014what sorts of articles they run, the lengths, the \u201cvoice\u201d of the author, and so on. Next: Contact the editor, or whoever makes the article assignments. Have some ideas you can pitch. Don\u2019t expect those to be accepted, but that\u2019ll demonstrate you have a feel for the publication . . . and that you\u2019ve actually looked at it. It\u2019s very likely the magazine has an editorial calendar with articles scheduled for the next year. What you really want is for the editor to assign you one of those articles. Be persistent. The editor will ask for samples of your articles. If you have a website, you can provide a link. If you have a Dropbox account or similar, you can give that out. Or you can pick and choose and then email selected articles to the editor. You\u2019ll also send a resume. Then stay in touch. I don\u2019t mind an email once every 3\u20134 weeks. Maybe a phone call once a month. Different editors will have different preferences. Remember that editorial calendar I mentioned above? Sometimes articles get inserted, killed, or shuffled around. Last week, the editor may have though everything was scheduled. Then an article got killed or moved, and he/she has to scramble to get another one written. If you happen to call when the editor is looking, your chances go way up. Be consistently good. When you get an assignment, do a good job on it. Turn it in on deadline or before. (I like before, but if the deadline is March 15 and the article comes in on March 15, I\u2019m happy.) If the editor considers you to be dependable and a good writer\u2014and you stay in touch\u2014you\u2019ll keep getting assignments. Join one or more groups that represent freelance writers. You\u2019ll get a lot of good information and leads from them. I said above that 90% of what\u2019s contained in that link is hooey. Here are just a few examples: In discussing resumes/CVs, the posting says: \u201cIt can also help to broaden your search to include terms such as \u2018remote writer\u2019, \u2018contract writer\u2019, \u2018copywriter\u2019, \u2018sales writer\u2019, \u2018SEO writer\u2019, \u2018content writer\u2019 and \u2018digital content\u2019.\u201d Those are different roles requiring different skills. An \u201cSEO writer,\u201d for instance, isn\u2019t writing for a person; he/she is writing for web spiders. The SEO copy I\u2019ve seen is almost unreadable. And I have no idea what a \u201cremote writer\u201d even is. Focus on the areas you\u2019re actually good at. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re something you\u2019re not.\u201cSet up your own website. Having a website shows your professionalism and can be used as an example of your writing. A website also makes you more accessible as a freelancer because businesses can get in direct contact with you.\u201d A couple of the freelancers I use have their own websites. Most don\u2019t. As for making you more accessible \u201cbecause business can get in direct contact with you,\u201d I\u2019ve found that the phone or email works just fine.What you need: \u201cPayPal account \u2013 PayPal is the most common way clients will pay you for your business and it is completely free to set up an account.\u201d Huh? A PayPal account is fine. But in 20 years, I\u2019ve never paid a single writer via PayPal. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an exception.Those are a few tips on becoming a freelance writer. ",

            "answer_text": "The best freelance writing jobs aren\u2019t posted online. They come through inbound requests, and more specifically, referrals. But, if you have little to no experience and you don\u2019t have the luxury of inbound prospects or existing customers, where do you start? A list of tactics is a start but it doesn\u2019t really tell you what you should be doing on a daily basis to generate business. Here are some steps you can take to get started. Define your Unique Selling Proposition and Positioning - What do you offer that other freelancers don\u2019t? You need to identify your ideal customer and figure out how you can solve their problem better than anyone else. Don\u2019t be a generalist. Be a specialist. This will help you stand out from the crowd of other freelancers.Create an informative and professional website - Have a \u201chome base\u201d that prospects can use to learn about you before they reach out to inquire about your services. As soon as your website loads on their computer/phone/etc. it should immediately show your value (USP) and inform them of how you can help them. Work samples are mandatory and testimonials are very helpful.Create a super simple sales funnel to build a reliable pipeline for your business - Prospecting is like shaving. If you don\u2019t do it every day, pretty soon you look like a bum. What you need to do now is create and execute a simple system for getting clients. The simpler the better. All you need to do is two things. (1) Generate traffic to your website with cold email, social media, using job boards, etc. and (2) convert a percentage of that traffic into a phone call, email, opt-in, etc. You must have a reliable method (or methods) of getting in front of prospects and starting a conversation with them. The traffic generation strategy you choose is dependent on your skills, what you prefer, and ultimately what provides results for you.Create an ascension and referral program - Acquiring a customer is the hardest part. Once you\u2019ve gained that customer, you should offer them more expensive and more valuable services and preferably ones that have a continuity component, i.e., a retainer. Once your customer is happy, ask them if they know anyone else that could benefit for your service.Rinse and repeat",
