            "answer_text": "\u00a00:00-0:30 You are actually above normal, you lucky soul! Your subconscious mind is attempting to communicate with you through your dreams. Every human has three dreams per night \u2014they simply don\u2019t remember. Dreams occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep. Our eyes move around even though our eye lids are closed. This cycle occurs around 90\u2013120 minutes at least three times during the latter part of our sleep cycle. Humans have a \u201cself-conscious mind\u201d and a \u201csubconscious mind\u201d \u2014 but few people realize that their potential lies in the ability to develop a relationship between the two. Our self-conscious mind is what I call our \u201cdaylight mind\u201d \u2014 it is our reasoning, logical mind that we use to make decisions in our everyday life. Our \u201cmidnight mind\u201d is our subconscious mind that records every single sensation we experience during the day \u2014 what we see, hear, touch and smell.  Source: Francesca C. Simon Photography I mentioned this book by Carlos Castenada, regarding dreaming techniques. I wish to make clear that I have never, ever taken any kind of drugs to induce lucid dreaming. Castenada has written many books, and the first few are based on his experiences assisted by the use of hallucinogenic substances. I did not read any of those books because I wasn\u2019t interested in drug-induced experiences. The first book I read was \u201cJourney to Ixtlan\u201d where he began to have experiences without drugs. One of the best exercises I learned from his books, was to look for my hands in my dream, when I realized I was dreaming. I will never forget dreaming that my mother, who was deceased, walked into a newsroom where I was working. I immediately began to look for my hands, but they felt weighed down by tons of water. But I finally succeeded\u2014 I raised my hands up to my face \u2014 it was exhilarating, despite the fact that my body was sleeping. I was consciously fully aware on that higher realm! You may find it hard to believe the experiences he writes about, but I found his books to be filled with techniques that can be helpful \u2014 but only if you are disciplined enough to do the work required!Always be a walking question mark.

            "answer_text": "Yes & yes! Dreams can be really really weird sometimes. Other times the weirdness is timed down but still present. Some people just experience more trippy and plan weird dreams. Why? Couldn't tell you lol that being said even being able to REMEMBER so many of your dreams is kinda rare. Most people forget up to 50% of their dream just i believe it was 5 minutes after waking up. 25% lost within the first 60 seconds of being awake! I feel like I hardly ever dream but the truth is: Everybody in the world dreams EVERY single night. Whether you recall them doesn't matter. Not remembering them doesn't mean you didn't dream that night. Just means you can't remember it. Fun fact: people actually have many many! Dreams every night. Each one in real waking life time lasts mere minutes. Some even just seconds. Though a dream can seemingly down over years, really took maybe 2 minutes? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is normal for a person to dream every night. Believe it or not, you actually dream everyday when you sleep. An average person dreams about 5 times per night. Even though you might not remember your dream or you did not feel like your dreamed at all, you did. Most of us forget 95 to 99 percent of our dreams. We don\u2019t know why, but a theory suggests that it is because you\u2019re not concentrating on them while you\u2019re snoozing. Another theory states that the hormone associated with memory (norepinephrine) is turned off while we sleep. Everyone dreams at some point, so yes it is normal. It does not matter if you remember your dream or not. So is it normal that we dream every night? Yes. But the things we dream about? It depends. ",

Let me brief on this\u2026 If you have dreams consecutively when you\u2019re sleeping at the right times and in a quiet dark room with no disturbance. It means you are having a very good deep sleep They say we always or have many dreams but we just don\u2019t remember them. When I say it\u2019s not. I mean, it\u2019s not normal because it\u2019s hard to get quality sleep without having a few bad night sleep here and there. So that\u2019s pretty weird.. Means you\u2019re very lucky, fortunate and taking care of your self :) Sigh.. I need to fix my sleeping patterns too ^^ Happy dreaming dreamer! ",

Dreamless sleep is a grace which is not available to every one, one to strive for it, a sustainable focused and constant effort is required to have this grace. But nothing to worry much, even if one is living simply with simple means without hankering too much about unnecessary and mundane things of life, one can have dreamless sleep, to some extent. But please don't make it a goal otherwise it will elude you. Live your life simply. Not saying that you should not work to accomplish your dreams, that should be done but without attaching to much value to it, you try and it will come, may take time, so be it but not to be disheartened just follow your dreams.
