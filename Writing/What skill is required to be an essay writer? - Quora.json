            "answer_text": "In this EssayLancers\u2019 blog post for freelance academic writers, you\u2019ll find some great materials as to how to improve different kinds of skills to become a successful essay writer. I\u2019d like to share some of my personal thoughts though. I deeply believe that being a good essay writer you need to display a healthy combination of several skills: - Sensitivity - your ability to perceive other people\u2019s feelings and transfer them onto the paper; - Analytical mind - in order to find and mix facts; - Creativity - not to be afraid to come up with new ideas; - Perseverance - since editing and proofreading require a lot of time. But the most important skill is surely the love for words and the power they transfer. If you can entertain yourself with a book, a notepad and a pencil - then this is your vocation. Hope it\u2019s so for you. ",
