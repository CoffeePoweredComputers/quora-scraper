            "answer_text": "When someone sends me a professional thank you email, it\u2019s because I have done something for them and doing it well enough that it impressed them. As a professional, it\u2019s important to cultivate a network of individuals in different businesses with different specialties that I can call on in the future, if need be. I will respond to the email with a brief message thanking the sender for their email and inviting the sender to contact me if my assistance is needed in the future. I then will send myself an email that summarizes who the person is, what I did for them and the outcome. When I get that message, I file it in my electronic file under network and and in whatever it belongs. That way, I don\u2019t have to rely on my memory, and I can use the details of the previous interaction to jog the person\u2019s memory if and when I contact them again. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A , I would have very much liked to write it for you but I don\u2019t know what I would thank the person about . In broad principles you write that you wish to thank the person for the time they spent with you and / or on your problem and that you appreciate it would have taken valuable expertise on their part . You inform them that this help has been useful to you and you wish them all the best in the future . In another situation if you are thanking people for a professional association you have had at work for example . You inform them that at the end of your association with them you wish them to know how useful and valuable your relationship with them has been and that you will always remember their sincerity and helpfulness . You wish them all the best for the future and you express your desire to keep in touch with them from time to time. ",
