            "answer_text": "Similar to what Ivor Davis said. If you are paying to have something published in a newspaper, it is probably not a news article but an advertisement. The exception is often considered unethical and possibly illegal for one or more of the parties involved. That is when an individual or organization wants an article published and for it to appear to be a news story coming from the newspaper itself. This might involve a secret payment to a reporter, editor or publisher. Varying shades of gray area occur when someone wanting a news story invites reporters to a news announcement with a fancy dinner, drinks, provides access for picture taking, flies reporters or photogs to a story site in a company plane. Just \u201chelping them to get their story and make it easy\u201d, and expecting positive coverage. I don\u2019t think this is what you were asking. ",

            "answer_text": "Roksana: I think your question is back to front. The way it is written, suggests you are writing a paid advertisement. If you want to announce something of your choice, advertise an event, you may have to pay by the word. Obits for example usually work that way. Your questions might be \u2014how much do they pay to publish a newspaper article (if you are a freelance writer, perhaps) and the answer is: it depends on the newspaper. If it\u2019s a big daily newspaper they have their own rates. If it\u2019s your local free weekly, they will pay you probably zilch. But then you can call yourself a \u201cpublished writer.\u201d ",
