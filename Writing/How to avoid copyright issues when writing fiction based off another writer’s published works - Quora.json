            "answer_text": "It is generally taboo to take another author's work and try to extend the story. Few authors give permission. Fewer publishers are interested in this context. And certainly this is copyright infringement if done without permission for works that are still protected by copyright. But fanfiction gets written all the time. As long as you aren't publishing outside of fanfic forum--and definitely not trying to sell it--authors rarely enforce their copyright against you. There are exceptions. J D Salinger was adamant about not letting anyone write additions to Catcher in the Rye. But if you find fanfic online, the original author is probably cool with more. ",

Anyone can write fan fiction, you just cant make money on it. But before you do, check if the author would prefer to co-author with you. It\u2019s becoming more common now.Make you own world up. This is easier than people think. All books are based on what\u2019s come before, but the test of an author is making up something new which incorporates what is considered \u2018normal\u2019 for the genre.As a general comment, if I read the first chapter and say \u201cThis is\u2026..\u201d (insert book, series, tv, or movie name here), then I won\u2019t read any further. Classic examples of this are anything using \u2018frak\u2019, which immediately tells you this is an author with a BSG fixation. Bounce! ",
