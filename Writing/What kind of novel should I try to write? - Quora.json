            "answer_text": "The better question is what kind of novel do you WANT to write? There are lots of genres that are easier to sell than others. Some publishers estimate that about 75% of the novel sales out there are romance or woman's interest. So if you have an interest in romance genre novels or what they call \u201cbonkbusters\u201d or \u201criches and bitches\u201d novels\u2026then you should probably go in that direction. Roughly speaking novels that fell into an easy genre\u2014-such as Westerns, Sci-Fi, Legal, Technothriller, Horror, Romance, Crime, Mystery or Fantasy--- have a built-in audience but they also have a lot of competition from other writers. There are also the same kinds of differentiations for young adult novels. But YA has gotten very sophisticated over the years and the sales have skyrocketed. Now YA novels handle everything from drug addiction to issues regarding sexual orientation. But you really need to know the genres and enjoy reading them. Don't go ahead and write a fantasy novel if you have never read any fantasy novels. Normally the people who publish in these fields read everything in the genre. Nongenre novels include literary fiction and general trade novels. That's like The Notebook all the way to the latest Pulitzer prize winner. Most novels that do not easily fall into the established conventions of genre fiction and are designed for a wide but literate audience. Here's a test that I always give my students: if your house was burning down and you could save only 10 novels that you really enjoy reading, what would they be? Those 10 novels will give you an idea of the kind of preferences you hold in your reading and maybe the direction your writing should take. ",
