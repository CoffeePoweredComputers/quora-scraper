            "answer_text": "Well it\u2019s sort of a moot point. A will written by a minor would not be legally enforceable. If in the truly tragic event of your passing while still a child (which I hope this is not a cry for help) your parents/guardians would be the lawful owners of all your possessions. So you could write a list to your parents about your preferences for your stuff like if you want to give a specific video game to a specific friend. However, your parents would have no legal obligation to follow your wishes in regards to that. Even if a minor\u2019s will was valid it would only apply to items you fully purchased yourself. Gifts from custodial parents are not usually honored as true gifts since the parent would still have the right to take back the gift if you were living. You got a new TV for Christmas, seems like a gift. But, if you do poorly in school and your parent takes the TV away, it was a privilege not a gift. So if you plan to give the Xbox your parents gave you to someone else, they probably won\u2019t be down with that. If you feel strongly about leaving people tokens of affection I\u2019d stick to the stuff of lower monetary value for a better chance your parents would honor your requests. Again, truly hoping you\u2019re just an overly prepared person in the event of an accident, not considering suicide. If it makes you feel better you can treat it as a creative writing activity for what you would leave to the people in your life if you could. And why? What do those people mean to you and how do you think they would feel about what you left them. ",

            "answer_text": "My question would be why do you need a will? Is something wrong? If you\u2019re feeling that depressed - please, please find help. There are available venues for such problems. A will essentially disposes of property after death, within the limits set by law. In some jurisdictions, there are mandatory restrictions about preteriting heirs. More importantly, a will is a legal document and requires the maker to be of legal age. Even if you just feel like writing one, the validity and effectivity of the will prepared will be affected by your age and the question of whether or not property is involved. Since you said you\u2019re barely a teenager, no, you can't write a will. It\u2019s a null ab initio piece of paper. Void from the very beginning. Do consider determining why you think you need a will. If you need help, there are ready, waiting, and available channels. Official ones and those run by NGOs. ",
