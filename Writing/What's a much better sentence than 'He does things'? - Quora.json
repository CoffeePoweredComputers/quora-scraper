You are an undercover agent, posing as an envoy for a mafia boss from another city, and you to a meeting with the big shots. \u201cNice meeting you, Mr. Scavullo. This is Luca, my assistant, and this is Joe. He does things.\u201d Hmm, you wonder, what kind of \u201cthings\u201d does Joe do, and will he do them to me if they find out I\u2019m a cop. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh man, while that\u2019s a grammatically correct sentence, just about anything is better than it. \u201cHe does things\u201d is so vague. A reader such as myself has no idea what you\u2019re referring to. Who is he? What things is he doing? The biggest thing to change is to clarify what he is doing. \u201cHe is doing the dishes\u201d or \u201che is running\u201d are both much clearer. If you simply mean he is in a state where he is doing a lot of things or is occupied, then you could say \u201cHe is busy.\u201d Best wishes! ",
