            "answer_text": "Donald E. Westlake wrote the best and most humorous detective novels anywhere. He has one book where the main character murders an adversary and makes it look the he was the intended victim. The police believe him completely as they investigate, sympathetic to his predicament that someone is trying to kill him. The lead detective is thorough, dedicated and honest and takes the murderer under his wing. He even brings him home for dinner and introduces him to his wife. The killer seduces the detective\u2019s wife and they carry on an affair. It looks like he\u2019s going to get away with everything but then the killer is arrested when they find an incriminating piece of evidence - but it was fabricated. The detective discovered the affair and planted it. He doesn\u2019t care that the \u201creal killer\u201d will go free - just that the guy banging his wife is put away. The killer is captured totally by his own pride and vanity. I can\u2019t remember the name of the book but Westlake wrote dozens, including some made into movies. He was a giant. He died some time ago. ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with Sukh Dutta\u2019s selections, but if you haven\u2019t read the books DO NOT READ ANYTHING MORE THAN THE TITLES. Read the books themselves. For other candidates: Anything by John Dickson Carr is generally worth reading \u2014 several time \u2014 and the ending of The Burning Court is surprising and controversial; I think it\u2019s quite original. The very last line of the short story \u201cThe House in Goblin Wood\u201d qualifies. The ending of his \u201cThe Wrong Problem\u201d is brilliant. The structure and solution of She Died a Lady is highly creative, to my mind. I have certain biases for certain kinds of endings, and while I can\u2019t say it\u2019s the most original ending, I find the conclusion of the Perry Mason mystery The Case of the Perjured Parrot to be highly satisfying. Another great ending to a mystery with more than one original component is Rex Stout\u2019s Nero Wolfe mystery, The Doorbell Rang. A very astonishing Ellery Queen mystery novel, with a unique ending, is And On the Eighth Day. For a foray into the overlap of science fiction and mystery, I think the ending of Asimov\u2019s The Naked Sun is remarkable. To appreciate it, one must first read The Caves of Steel. But any excuse to read Asimov should be eagerly accepted. And back to Agatha Christie: the short story \u201cWitness for the Prosecution\u201d has, to my mind, the best last line. ",
