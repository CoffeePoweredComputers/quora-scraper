            "answer_text": "First of all, I like it. You've undertaken a retrospective style, not unlike H. P. Lovecraft, or even E. A. Poe, harkening to the grave density of an earlier style. I would not change that; you have a flair for it. That said, while you are a student of that sort of prose, you haven't yet mastered it, thus the passage is inconsistent. I've made a rewrite that addresses this. Consider comparing the two. Better yet, read them to yourself aloud. I believe it'll be quite clear when you do: Were I to speak truthfully about Marie, I could not ascribe malice to her, for though she forever rejected me as a friend, she first gave me a chance to know her.  In the beginning she was altogether gracious, not judging the many words I wrote for her, and willfully becoming my friend. What then was the reason for her later rejection?  Having gained full opportunity to converse with her, I sought other means to know her more completely. That is to say, I gathered news of her from other sources. Desiring to be entirely honest, I told her as much. Alas, upon hearing this, she ended our friendship straight-away in its infancy.  If my confession be true, and I not having bent my words to her favor, nor falsely in agreement, mayhaps Marie is justified. For though I might justify my deeds, Marie would not have it, no matter my justification be true. Marie, it must be said, acts according to her own perspective, and within that influence she is not malicious. Update:Above I have put the passage in good period style and nomenclature while attempting to keep the author's intent and tone. Having done so, I feel the whole piece is a trifle difficult to understand. It remains puzzling in its quick juxtapositions. Therefore, I've taken another run at it, this time focusing on understanding. This was mainly via rearrangement of existing phrases, altering mainly the bridges between. I hope this provides additional insight: Were I to speak truthfully about Marie, I could not ascribe malice to her, for though she rejected me, she first gave me a chance to know her. In the beginning she was open, even gracious, unjudgemental of the many words I wrote for her. In time she became my friend.  Why then did she later reject me?  Sad to say, the fault was likely mine. Having gained full opportunity to converse with her, I found myself in heady fixation. Unfettered by forethought, I sought other means to know her even more completely. That is to say, I gathered news and confidences of her from other sources. In my fever, desiring to be entirely honest, I told her as much.  Alas, upon hearing this, she ended our friendship straight-away in its infancy. And try as I might to justify my deeds, Marie would not have it, no matter the truth in my soul. Marie, it must be said, acted always according to her own perspective, and within that influence she was neither vindictive nor malicious.  If my confession be true, and I not having bent my words to her favor, nor falsely in agreement, mayhaps Marie was justified. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems you are aiming for a slightly archaic style. It's reminiscent of MRJames or HGWells.  I have some issues with punctuation and phrasing: \"I sought to know her through other means; that is to say, I gathered information from sources other than her and, wanting to be completely honest about everything,  told her what I had done.\" Writers of English in the late 19th and early 20th centuries made far more use of colons and semi-colons than modern writers; hence my replacement of the first comma in the quoted sentence with a semi-colon.  This separates the second  clause from the first because the first is a description of action taken, while the second clause, which is dependent on the first, is an explanation of what action was taken.  Note also that i have moved the third comma in the sentence to after the \"and\". This because the phrase  \"wanting to be completely honest about everything\" is an explicatory insertion. The commas are parenthetical - they separate the insertion from the rest of the sentence - and you should be able to remove it from the sentence without altering meaning or flow.  I also dropped the second \"I\" as it's redundant in context. You could have legitimately done what I did there and put the insertion between two dashes, but this  would be conceived of as a modern construction.  Earlier writers made much more use of commas for parenthesis.   The past perfect \"had done\" is more appropriate and elegant than the  past  simple tense \"did\" In the last sentence you begin with a conjunction: \"but\". Modern writers often break this grammatical rule for effect and emphasis but if you are trying to emulate the style of earlier writers you have to be a little more pedantic, sticking much more closely to established rules of grammar.
