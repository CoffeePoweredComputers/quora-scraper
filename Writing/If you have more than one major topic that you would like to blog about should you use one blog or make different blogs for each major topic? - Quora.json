            "answer_text": "Instead of making one blog for every major topic, create different blogs based on major topics.  You may think that it is difficult to manage multiple blogs, but let me tell you it is more difficult to manage a messy or unorganized blog.  Suppose, you wrote a post last year and it has some relevance in the context of something you currently writing, so to give reference, you need that post. Now, to find it from a messy blog is so difficult. You would need to scroll down and go through each post to see whether it is relevant for the current topic or not.  But, if you will have a blog for each topic, it will be comparatively take less time to find relevant post.  So, keep a separate blog for each major topic to keep your blog organized. And, it will be easier for you to manage.  ",

            "answer_text": "I want you to imagine the reader who will be your potential customer. If you want to generate income, please do not create a blog without some thorough thinking and strategy. The amount of time I read many questions that say.. \"I got a blog but how I make money off it\" is a mistake many make. They are not thinking about what they want to achieve and who they really writing to. If you want your blog to be successful, then bear in mind of the following: Context.Context is about the focused event, problem, event, background,  which also helps creating a blog focused on attracted targeted potential readers who want It's about the circumstances the purpose in which gives your blog a focus. When people land on it, they immediately know who it's for, who it's not for, what it will solve or the benefits they'll get from it.So you need to know who is going to read your blog. But first... Let's say you got an idea for a blog where you're passionate about writing books and you're solving problems around that...i.e. writing stories, developing characters, getting an agent because once upon a time you wanted to get a publisher to publish and distribute your book. However you found it difficult.  You learnt there is a process but also you discovered your writing needs some work, format, a style, etc etc.  You had to go back and learn how write compelling stories and how to get agents interested, and this helped you succeed. So you got  alot of knowledge, skill and experience that will help other writers. And you also solved a way for writers to publish their own work and know how to market it to. You may even have your educational system on how to write stories, novels, fiction etc etc.  You will probably have other training programs and so the blog provides tips but also different means of paid subscriptions and training. Maybe even live workshops in the future or online consultancy. So it has context, there is a personal real story behind it, it has an event, there is background to it, there was a circumstance in which your idea came for this blog to happen. A story you will show over and over again. It has purpose why you're passionate about doing this blog and it resonates with your targeted audience, potential customers as well as your partners. Then you got another idea.. You always had a passion for photography and the story goes your grandad gave you a small camera. You always wanted to do wedding photography but as you grew you didn't know how to get into the industry. But you found away. It is less confusing, easier to measure to have two seperate blogs. They have their own platform, own story, own strategy, own theme, image style, content stye, products or services. One for about writing and publishing books and other for photography wedding blog service. I am only giving very brief example but really, to make one blog work, you're going to decide the following right now.. What is your passionWhat are the skills/knowledge your passion solvesIs there a demand for itHow big is the market? Enough for you to generate income and some?What are the challenges?Who are the competitors?Who is the target audienceWhat is the most urgent wants right nowWhat is their fears and will prevent them to buy if you're selling.Where do they hang about i.e. which social media platform do they use. Don't be everywhere. Don't fall for this myth. How will you attract them to your websiteWhat will they be doing i.e. your websites strategy and goalsThere are other questions but for now just wanted to share these. Why all these questions important? It helps you to develop a consistent marketing message.  This one blog, if you're selling products will have each product having it's own page. It's own sales process. All of it is around one theme. This one problem that has other problems related to it. It's going to take work. Have this in mind as you focus on one blog. Let it grow, give it the chance to grow your own audience.  Put your focus on this one blog because it will bring many lessons on how to succeed or what to do different to make it a succcess. One blog will take a lot of energy, time, knowledge, skill and resources. Make one idea work because that will be your credibility for future ideas, blogs, products or services. ",
