            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know the exact sentence. He was offered presidential pardon IF he agreed in running a reconnassaince black ops mission. As Dave Younie mentioned in the comment, in the beginning of FIRST BLOOD PART II Trautman says: \u201cYou don\u2019t wan\u2019t to spend another ten years in here, don\u2019t you?\u201d This probaly means a 10\u201315 sentence against a life time jail for first degree murder. Why\u2019s that? The helicopter pilot probably testified about Galt\u2019s behaviour and being Rambo a medal of Honour recipient he was given a very light sentence for involuntary manslaugter. Once Rambo accepted accepted the mission he accomplished it against / far beyond the orders he received (he turned the reconnassaince mission into a rescue mission with open field firefights) but was pardoned anyway. Rambo dies in David Morrell\u2019s novel that created the character. So, the novel that created it all feature no Rambo receiving any sentence. ",
