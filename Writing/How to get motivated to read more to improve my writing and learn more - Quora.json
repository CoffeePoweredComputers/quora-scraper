            "answer_text": "Well. First of all - ask yourself - why do you want to improve your writing? What is your actual cause for that? Is this something that you should do, because of different social factors, or it is because you WANT to improve your writing? What do you want to achieve by being better in writing? Why writing - not any other activity that you may spend time on and have more fun? Finding your real \"root cause\" for any action might be the thing that gives you the motivation. If you don't have the reason, maybe your subconscious is yielding at you saying that writing is not for you? Secondly: about what do you want to write? What do you want to say to the world? Consider this very carefully; today's world is full of text and pictures that no one cares. Is the thing that you would like to write on having the real value for others? Last, but not least: there are triple filter tests of Socrates: Is it true? Is it good? Is it necessary? Please, don't treat this post as an actual demotivation. Your time is limited. Use it wisely. Please don't waste it. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of the various things about a character (or writing about one) you can learn \u2014 what would be interesting to you? The more you read, the more you will notice about how authors differ in their approach, and you might find one you\u2019d like to emulate. You\u2019ll become a more rounded person. Remind yourself that book don\u2019t have to be boring. Then, look at the books Amazon sells \u2014 of a favorite topic or genre you like \u2014 and watch your motivation raise a couple of degrees. :) ",
