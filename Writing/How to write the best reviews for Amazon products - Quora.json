            "answer_text": "I assume you want to write product reviews in detail that can cover all the aspects/features/benefits of any item. But in order to make your review compelling and influential for the buying process try to layout your review in a manner that reader can make their buying decision based on your review. You can achieve this by using the AIDA model to carefully craft the product review. AIDA means : AttentionInterestDesireActionAt first you need to grab the reader\u2019s attention in your opening lines. Then build some interest by explaining how a particular product will solve the problems of prospective buyer. Now try to differentiate your product and make it stand head and shoulders above the competition by sharing some facts and figures or unique functionality. This will create the desire in the mind of the reader. Last step is action where you need to write a strong recommendation for the buyer and encouragement to buy that product in order to solve their problem or fulfill their desire. ",

In case it\u2019s about a product, I hope you have used the product (as writing a fake review might bring you to Amazon\u2019s fraud detection team\u2019s attention and you might have to face the consequences as a buyer-your account might be locked or suspended). Amazon will itself ask you to provide review about your purchase in a separate mail. In case you don\u2019t get the mail, you can always go to the product detail page and scroll down to the review section where you will find a button that says, Write a review. There you have it! In case, you want to write a review for Amazon, the company, it depends on the platform where you are providing your review (ex- Glassdoor, it is pretty straight forward as they have the review buttons on their homepage of the company that you are searching for.)
