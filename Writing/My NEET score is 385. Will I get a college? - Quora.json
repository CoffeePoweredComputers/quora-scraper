            "answer_text": "Firstly, I'm sorry for the late response. You can get a private college through COMEDk. But I would suggest that you drop a year and start fresh again. Take a break if you want. Go visit some new place and enjoy for a few days. Come back strong. Stay motivated. Set a target in your mind and work toward achieving that. Analyse your mistakes and try to correct them. Don't go through anything apart from NCERT in Biology. Solve MCQs and clear your doubts ASAP. All the best! And I'm ready to help if you are stuck somewhere. ",
