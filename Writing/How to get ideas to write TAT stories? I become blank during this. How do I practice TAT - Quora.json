            "answer_text": "A tough question to answer as to how do I get ideas to write the stories! Let us start from what is the meaning of apperception in Thematic Apperception Test? And before that what is perception? Perception is the way we perceive things and Apperception\u2026! Let me give you an example. If I put a small snake in front of a six months old child what will the child do? Most likely child would like to catch it when it sees it moving. And what happens if I put the same snake in front of you? You may move back, kill the snake or get scared. Why? Because you have previous experience related to snake and the child has no such previous experience. Thats why for child it is perception and for you it is Apperception. So in other words Apperception is perception with past experiences. That's the reason despite our showing same picture to the entire group, still every candidate writes a different story - apperception. Now let's see what your story should be comprised of. Your story should have four elements namely 1. name of the hero, 2. aim of the hero, 3. bit of a challenge 4. and how he overcomes the challenge to come out as hero. As far as getting the ideas is concerned try and keep the existing themes in the country in your mind e.g. female foeticide, swachh bharat, droughts and floods, farmers committing sucide, child education, child labor, corruption etc. Do not force an idea on a picture. Picture should be the centre of your stoty. Roughly speaking if I make a movie on your story and put it in PVR next to your house will you go and see it or you will be doubtful spending 250 rupees. If you are doubtful then the story is a flop. Happy Selection! Col Pradeep Walia SSB Aspirant The Talent Bridge Jalandhar 9739915968 ",

            "answer_text": "Why the heck you are searching for an idea to write story. In SSB they just tell you to understand the picture and write what lead to the situation, what's happening and what is final outcome. It is just a simple thing which you need to follow. Let anyhow you get an idea (which is not natural response) about your story and finally you write it then in SD,WAT you are going to have an different personalty. And finally it will take you on the track of non recommendation. Let the responses be normal, try your story is practical and most importantly logical. And that's all your are done from your side please don't sit and search for idea which will make your story beautiful. Now if you really want to make your responses practical and logical then start thinking in a same way in daily routine life and you are done Coming to the blank slide it would be better if you write your own real circumstances where you have put efforts and accomplished the task/work. In other words try to write a scene which has brought a change in you. That's all my thoughts over this question Cheers to selection. Thanks for reading ",
