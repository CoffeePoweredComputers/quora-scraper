            "answer_text": "I have been using Google Docs for Writing a Novel. These are the things I like about it: Using it on multiple devices and staying in Synch. This means my laptop or a tablet where I am at. I was writing while at my son\u2019s martial arts in the beginning.It has a set of standard styles (Normal, Title, Header 1\u20133) and you can change them.I can share it my daughter in suggestion mode and she can make corrections and notes that I can accept. This will be useful in the future if I have an editor.Complaints: It\u2019s performance is TERRIBLE on my tablet since the document got long. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s exactly going on, but sometimes I can type something and wait ten seconds for it to show up. Is it trying to synchronize the whole document on each keystroke? This complaint pretty much negates the benefits of #1 above - once it got long.There is no means whatsoever to add a style. Dumb but true. I would like to add a few styles like \u201cTexting\u201d, \u201cTweet\u201d, \u201cNews Quotation\u201d but no luck.I can\u2019t limit what portion of it the shared users are looking at. This is minor - I can just tell my daughter to stop where it says DO NOT READ PAST HERE because those chapters aren\u2019t done yet.I\u2019ve still been using it but wish some of these things would work. Complaint #2 means I might have to use something else to format it before self publishing. Because of Complaint #1 I\u2019ve just been working on a tablet or desktop, and that\u2019s more efficient anyway. But what about when I go on a road trip? A tablet is much easier than a laptop to use in a vehicle. Nathan ",

            "answer_text": "It is okay to use whatever text editor / word-processor software you like. The key features of any writing tool are that: 01. It does not get in the way of your writing. 02. It allows you to organise your writing. 03. It is easy to cut, copy, move and otherwise edit your writing. 04. It is secure from theft / hacking 05. It is backed up. 06. You own the access to your writing. Of these, the last three are often overlooked. In the case of Google Docs, Google is a big enough corporation that you can trust your documents are secure and backed up. However, what if Google decided tomorrow not to support Google Docs any more because the corporate strategy had changed? What would happen to your potential best-selling novel then? As a general rule, you should never rely on the continued existence of a third party or specific third party strategies for anything which really, really matters to you. Make your own copies (download a copy) of anything you create in Google Docs so that, should the worst happen, you don\u2019t lose all of your hard work. Google Docs can export word-processor files in a number of different popular file formats. If you don\u2019t own your own copy of Microsoft Word, you can download the well-respected - and free! - Apache OpenOffice office suite. It is an open source replacement for the Microsoft Office suite and pretty much as powerful. ",

            "answer_text": "I use Google Docs for all my writing. Literally all of it. My novels, my poetry, and all my school work has been done in Google Docs. I used OpenOffice for a time (while living in the middle of nowhere without decent internet access) and then Word for much longer (because my dad purchased a subscription for the whole family) but when the subscription ran out, I switched to Google Docs, and I don\u2019t regret it one bit. It autosaves, so I don\u2019t have to worry about losing my work if my computer crashes or the battery dies (which is often) and I can access my writing from any device once I log in. Google Docs is convenient and useful, and follows the same formatting standards as Word, apart from the fact that your writing won\u2019t actually be in a Word document. Also, it\u2019s free. If the only reason you\u2019d purchase a Microsoft Office subscription is for word, just use Google Docs and save yourself a good chunk of cash. ",

It's useful since it auto-saves, now has an offline feature, could be accessed across multiple devices, and is great for collaboration. It also has a \u2018document outline\u2019 feature which lets you leap from chapter to chapter. However, there are still some flaws. If you're writing your entire story in one document, it's going to get fairly laggy at one point. Using the document outline and comments could create this weird glitch which shifts the document to the right, instead of being in the middle. I find this slightly annoying. ",

You can also upload a Word document to Google Drive and edit that, which is even better than just using Google Docs as it behaves more like Word. Particularly good if you already have a .docx file in standard manuscript format to upload as a template. HOWEVER, the free version of Google Drive / Docs etc is only for personal use. If you\u2019re an author making money from your work, my understanding is that using the free service for writing breaches their terms of service. That means you\u2019d have to pay for the business version. My personal recommendation is to use Scrivener and backup with Dropbox. ",

            "answer_text": "Google Docs works well but it's less streamlined than Scrivener (once you get to know Scrivener - which takes some initial patience). I think it probably boils down to finances because you can get a 30-day free trial of Scrivener (counts only the days that you actually use it), but after that you're looking at a once-off payment of around $47. I don't have words to express how I love Scrivener, but before I discovered it I was happy with Google Docs. So if you think you can find $47 in the next few months, I would very seriously suggest you try out Scrivener - but if you don't, Google Docs will help you keep everything organised - no problem. PS: The creators of Scrivener don't pay me anything for saying this :) ",

When starting off it can see like a handful, but once you get used to it, you\u2019ll never want to go back to anything else. But that\u2019s just me. :) But for starting out, Google Docs is perfect. I\u2019ve used it often in the past myself. Best of luck with your novel. ",
