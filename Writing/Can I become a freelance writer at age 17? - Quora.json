            "answer_text": "Probably, but you will learn the hard way what customers do and don\u2019t want. If it\u2019s writing stuff for one outlet, like a news site, then you can slowly learn the ropes. But I don\u2019t consider that freelancing - you\u2019re just an employee with no benefits. True freelancing means having more than one client. To maintain that, you need to know how to handle your clients - and that\u2019s experience you pick up best while working for someone else in an office. Alternatively, find a mentor who can guide you. ",
