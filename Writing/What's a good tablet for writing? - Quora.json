            "answer_text": "You might like to take a look at the Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 tablet, which is Android based \"retina\" resolution with a built in wacom digitiser.  OneNote is available on Android and syncs to your Microsoft account. You can plug in a USB keyboard and mouse to the tablet (like you can to most Android tablets and phones).  I have this model incidentally, so speak with personal experience. Alternatively, consider a Microsoft Surface Pro 3, which is within your budget (without the add on keyboard - you can use your USB keyboard) which is a full Windows computer. This also includes a decent digitiser (from N-trig, replacing the Wacom technology that was on the previous model). ",
