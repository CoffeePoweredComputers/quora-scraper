            "answer_text": "I actually have tried a lot of article spinners. So, CleverSpinner is the software that gives me the best impression so far. The difference between this one and other tools is that it is able to understand meaning of the words. Check the pictures to see what the tool is able to do:  It can also spin multiple zipped txt files, using a form like this:  It is not easy to find a software that is able to rewrite content and ensure that it is both unique enough and sufficiently readable. I also proffered tools that are not slow. Because its really difficult for a software to understand actual word meaning, tools are either very simple or very complex. Simple tools to do use AI and are not accurate enough, while the ones that do use AI tends to be very slow. However, this software is optimized so its very fast. Probably the fastest article spinner in 2019 that can do the job very good. You can compare it with free software and you will find that quality of free tools is much worse. This means you will have to spend a lot of time editing the text to make sure its does not sound bad. Because free software makes so many mistakes, you have to check each and every word, so its very slow. Actually its better of to rewrite the text on your own without usage of any software, or use this article spinner as it does not make a mistake. Sometimes there is a word that does not fit 100% naturally, but this is quite rare. There are quite a few levels of quality. The highest quality will have the worst uniqueness and the lowest quality will have the highest uniqueness. So far, it only works for English language. It works in pretty much any browser, I personally use Firefox and Chrome. No need to install any software, just open it in a browser. NLP is quite resource intensive, it requires high end graphic card, so I am really happy that it runs on their servers.I just add text and click spin and in 10-20 sec I get the result.   I forgot to say this earlier, there is a manual mode which you can use to add more synonyms. You can also add your own synonyms, which is find quite handy. Everything is very near, and its clearly explained in FAQ section. Manual rewrite mode is not completely manual, you get the suggestion and you just need to manually choose more synonyms if you want. However, automatic mode is accurate, so I use it pretty much all the time. The software is: Very fast.Very accurate.Uses advanced NLPYou can add your own synonyms into it.It can spin zipped txt files to save you time.",

            "answer_text": "If you're fed up with visiting your website's traffic dead in the water, or else you have been seeing the number of conversions decrease steadily over time, then you've likely been hit with all the Google Panda update. While there are many reasons that websites are being penalized, one reason is generally identified as non-excellent content created by automated article spinners. If your internet content is made up of spun posts, chances are you are visiting negative results. There was a time where Google algorithms would detect SEO keywords regardless of content quality, and search engines could ditch people on to optimized sites with reckless abandon. Today however the environment is significantly different; folks must read your articles and also get something of value from it so as to receive those conversions. Google has set out to utilize the very same standards and find worth in sites in order to promote them to the front page. Recently I have found a online tool Online Article Spinner - Best Article Spinner 2019 | SEOMagnifier for the article spinning purposes. It\u2019s basically double edge sword and you need to use it carefully. Reader participation is now the name of the sport. You want to have readers that are interested in the articles which you present in your site or website. In order to do that you will need content that is written by a human being. Mechanical sounding content written by an informative article spinner is great for robots and machines, but machines don't convert. You need your content written and read by a human being that conversions can occur and your internet business can operate. Let us compare and contrast a bit of content that is subscribed. Contemplate the next sentence for a minute: Not exactly Shakespeare, but compare that to merchandise from a Normal post spinner: \"The unsurpassed battery-operated aerobics at the moment create brushless motors and lithium ion series\" Huh? A formatted computer software might come across this last bit appealing, but maybe not a true reader of the English language. This is the issue with article spinners. Here is how we use it for spinning purposes. How to spin article online using SEO Magnifier to create unlimited for your blog? Follow our guidelines to know how to this best content spinner provided by SEO Magnifier: First of all go the tool page. First of all, you need to find the available content on the web that you want to spin for your website. After that, all you need is to copy the content from the source and paste the copied content into the spinner. After pasting the content, select the language that you want to spin your article in. After doing all the above steps hit \u201cSpin Button\u201d without any hesitation. Apply your favorite words. Select the document file. Click the Download Button to download your document file. Check for plagiarism if you want to analyze for plagiarism issues. Many would assert that these anomalies are easily edited and corrected, and oftentimes, this would be correct. However, editing real content is unpleasant and editing spun content is much worse. The identical material may frequently be made faster and better by a human being. It is much simpler to do a little bit of research and apply the grey matter within our own skulls to come up with content that's interesting and engaging to viewers. Isn't that what you want? Engagement is the trick to success. In case you have some interest, have a step away from automated spinners and compose real content, or hire somebody who can do that for you. ",
