            "answer_text": "On the Gmail desktop view of your inbox, there are checkboxes (tick-boxes) on the left hand side of each email. Click on those next to the messages you wish to delete, then click on the dustbin icon at the top of the screen. (This only appears when you have at least one checkbox ticked). On the smartphone app, touch the icons of the messages you wish to delete (the icons will either be the sender's Google+ profile picture, or the first letter of their name on a coloured background). Again, when you've selected at least one, a dustbin icon will appear at the top of the screen allowing you to delete them. Note that Gmail also allows you to archive messages instead of deleting them completely. This removes them from your inbox but lets you find them again later by searching for them should you need to. To archive multiple messages, just follow the same instructions but use the archive icon (a box or drawer with a down arrow on it) instead of the dustbin icon. If you wish to delete or archive messages automatically, you can use Filters (similar to \"Rules\" in Microsoft Outlook and some other mail clients) - but that's probably a different question! ",

            "answer_text": "Build a filter to select the emails you want to delete (use the search box top center with Boolean search commands on the gmail filter help page). You can modify the search slightly until you get it right.  On the second page, tick the box that says something like 'delete these' or 'send to trash' Then click the button at the bottom to make it happen. Not long ago I used something like \"older than 3 years\" to delete a few thousand in one pass. You could do the a thousand at a time like \"from: gap.com\" and delete. The filter help page will guide you through the process. ",
