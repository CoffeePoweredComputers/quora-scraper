            "answer_text": "The next wave of small business aid Mills joined the Obama Administration and his National Economic Council in early 2009, and led efforts to help small businesses recover in the wake of the 2007-2008 recession. She has been drawing from that experience in recent weeks as she helps government officials explore ways to shore up the 30 million small businesses that provide almost half of the country\u2019s jobs. THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS More from Working Knowledge and Harvard The New Rules for Remote Work: Pandemic EditionWhat Are Lessons for Leaders from This Black Swan Crisis?How the Coronavirus Is Already Rewriting the Future of BusinessEarlier in March, Congress and the Trump Administration authorized $7 billion in disaster loans for small businesses affected by COVID-19. The program helps businesses in states that have declared emergency status borrow as much as much as $2 million and repay it over 30 years with an interest rate of less than 4 percent. Both chambers of Congress are considering additional relief, with small business loans packages of over $300 billion under consideration. Mills hopes that the government will go a step further and offer interest-free loans and work to include new financial technology companies, such as Square and Kabbage among the permitted lenders. After all, small businesses generate almost 2 million net new jobs a year and employ 47 percent of the workforce. Even though macroeconomists rarely give them their due, Mills says, small businesses contribute 44 percent of US gross domestic product. Helping them withstand a brutal cash crunch will support the broader economy, Mills says. \u201cThis is the number one thing that we can do to keep our economy going during this particular crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is about helping small businesses, but it\u2019s also about helping their employees and their families. They need to know that there will be a job and a paycheck when we get to the other side of this crisis.\u201d What to do now While federal, state, and local lawmakers mull over additional aid, Mills recommends that small business owners: Apply for the Small Business Administration loans. In addition to the disaster loans, which only apply to businesses in states that have declared emergency status, some state governments are offering aid packages.Explore private sector programs and fintech products. Facebook said it would offer $100 million in grants to small businesses. And fintech companies such as Kabbage and Fundbox, which specialize in loans to small businesses, are also considering ways to support the sector.Renegotiate terms of contracts and debt. Owners should ask landlords for more time to pay their rent, for example. They should also ask banks to temporarily defer interest payments on outstanding debt.Concerned consumers can help by buying gift cards from their local businesses, a small gesture that can help Main Street shops stay afloat. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent way to get money into these businesses,\u201d Mills says. Large companies and government agencies can provide relief simply by paying outstanding bills\u2014now. As economic concerns mount, large companies tend to delay payments to suppliers to conserve cash. Mills recommends that organizations reject that tactic when it applies to small businesses and pay as soon as possible to support not only the vendor, but the American economy. \u201cThey should pay all of their invoices now and pay anything they can forward,\u201d says Mills. \u201cThe Apples of the world should take it as part of their civic responsibility.\u201d Mills emphasized that acting quickly, with both small individual steps and large government-led actions, is critical. \u201cSmall businesses are the very fabric of our communities, all across the country,\u201d Mills said. \u201cDays matter at this critical time. If we lose these small businesses, our communities are going to look very different when all is said and done, and it will take a long time to bring back the businesses we will have lost.\u201d About the Author Danielle Kost is senior editor at Harvard Business School Working Knowledge.
