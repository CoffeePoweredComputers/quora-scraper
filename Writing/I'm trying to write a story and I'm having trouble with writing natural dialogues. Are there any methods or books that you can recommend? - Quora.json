But I decided to start looking at how writers wrote dialogue and also study how people talk in real life. I also began trying to apply some training into real life and try engaging and in conversations as naturally and smoothly as I can. Sometimes, it\u2019s okay to botch up a dialogue a bit just as long as you know you can go back and fix it. Don\u2019t know if this is the answer you were looking for, but writer to writer: always look far ways to improve yourself and your style. ",
