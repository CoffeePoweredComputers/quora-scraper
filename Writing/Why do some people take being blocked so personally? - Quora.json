            "answer_text": "When you type a letter, in business there are rules as to how to communicate. Typing is cold, impersonal and a low form of communication. Course in Business Communication are imp. In my day you always call or make a personal visit for maximum effectiveness. People are warm human and if you are feeling for a person and get a weird, cold, text message and you are not really adult yet. You are not sure of how you are received by the world, you will take it personally. Blocking might simply come from you sent a put down, intended as banter and he took it wrong. So things get all off course, feelings come into play and now overreacting causes hurt which causes you to block out the other person. It means he has feelings and remember love and hate are very closely related. ",

            "answer_text": "Well in my opinion, the act of blocking someone is in most cases simply because you dont want to talk with them for whatever reason, sometimes people just dont know when to quit texting and that's another reason to block them, which either way its basically the same with the exception of one you simply do not want to talk to the person or you do not have the time to answer text after text, and even if they've done something to wrong you for some reason they still take offense to it, the other unless the same they think you just dont want to talk period when its not really that just not as much as they do, and unless you've told them they automatically think the worse.
