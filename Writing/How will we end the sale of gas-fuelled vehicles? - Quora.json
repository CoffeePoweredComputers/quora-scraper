            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very hard to predict the future - but I could see several possible scenarios: If enough people switch to electric cars - then the gas stations will feel the pinch and start going out of business - or switching to just having a bunch of fast-chargers instead. That could start to cause gasoline car drivers to have to divert from their daily commute by larger and larger distances - until the inconvenience of having to drive 20 minutes there and back to the only gas station left in your town. The spectre of \u201crange anxiety\u201d would finally force even the most determined people to switch. Manufacturers of gasoline cars will see this decline starting to happen and rapidly move away from gasoline and diesel. At some point, the oil companies are going to find it uneconomic to continue to refine gasoline - and that\u2019ll be the end of it.Some countries have already set a date. Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles has a list of 12 countries who have set definite dates by which it will be ILLEGAL to sell gasoline vehicles. That includes the UK, France, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. The dates at which this will happen varies between 2025 (Norway) and 2040. China have also announced that gasoline vehicle sales will be banned - but have yet to set a specific date. Sri Lanka has gone one step further and will ban the DRIVING of gasoline/diesel vehicles by 2040. Presuming other countries follow this lead\u2026we\u2019ll see the last gasoline cars sold in maybe 2050 - and with the average life of a car being 15 years - by 2065, they\u2019ll be mostly gone.Some individual cities have passed laws to ban all gas/diesel engined vehicles from their streets entirely (not just new sales). So Amsterdam, Athens, Bristol, Brussels, All of British Columbia, London, Los Angeles, Mexico CIty, Paris, Rome, Seattle, Vancouver and a bunch more - are all going to ban gasoline vehicles from their streets by somewhere between 2025 to 2040. So if you plan to live in London or LA in 2030 - DON\u2019T BUY A GASOLINE CAR - because in 10 years time, you won\u2019t be allowed to drive it there!! In Paris - you\u2019ve only got 5 years left. Bristol, in the UK have a ban that starts next year (!!) 2021. Even with these kinds of scatter-gun bans - the overall impact on gasoline/diesel car owners outside of those cities will be profound. But gas stations in those places will have to shut down or transition to becoming electric car charging stations VERY soon. As the number of gasoline/diesel vehicles starts to ramp down sharply - the profitability of selling gasoline (which is already pretty marginal) will get below the sustainable level long before the last gas car disappears from the streets. Which brings us back to \u201crange anxiety\u201d and the amount of time you waste trying to find a gas station on your commute.It\u2019s possible that electric cars are just so much compellingly better - that people simply switch of their own free will. Having driven an electric car myself for many months now - I\u2019m ASTOUNDED at the number of committed gas/diesel people who\u2019ve ridden with me and come away so completely SHOCKED by how good this car is that they\u2019re asking me how they can buy one. I think this effect will be significant - and the car companies are ALREADY panicking to rush out EV designs - be they good, bad or indifferent - just so they have something on the market.But no matter which scenario it is - and most likely, it\u2019ll be a combination of all four - the fact that existing cars last for 15 years mean that we\u2019re still going to have a LOT of gasoline vehicles on the roads well into 2035\u2026except, probably, in Sri Lanka! Pressures from the inability to drive your car in some cities - the increasing difficulty of finding a gas station will force even the most resistant people to switch. ",

            "answer_text": "How will we end the sale of gas-fuelled vehicles? Putting a carbon tax on gas-fuelled vehicles and a subsidy / tax break on vehicles that don\u2019t generate CO2 levels out the demand.Then it\u2019s time for the industry to actually produce enough EVs to cover the demand. Once that is done, tax breaks become irrelevant and unimportant since both technologies are mature enough to compete even without tax breaks. I\u2019d say a combination of the (very aggressive) Norvegian model, combined with a more gradual US model where manufacturers which entered the market get gradually lower tax breaks. US system is far from optimal too. It puts incumbents in a big disadvantage, a system which will become even more evident once it comes to cheaper cars.A break should be reduced once a manufacturer reaches half a million cars - and then it should have been a slower, gradual decline over a longer period, for example 10% every 6 months - which would result in almost no price shocks.
