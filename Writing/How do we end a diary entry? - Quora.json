            "answer_text": "If you wish to include an ending to an entry but remain personal, you can say something like, that's all I have today, goodnight dear diary. When you write in your diary, you're writing to yourself; you're sort of talking to yourself. So you can end it by telling yourself goodnight. Some answers are saying it's a personal and informal experience that is entirely yours\u2026 it is, but it is also a more formal method of talking to yourself, so having a little structure is okay in that sense. Here's a great example of an ending to a short inquiry response: That's how I would do it anyway. Your way is up to you. Good luck. ",
