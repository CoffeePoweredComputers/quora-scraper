            "answer_text": "Why are you asking someone else to help you, when you\u2019re a god? You say how it all goes. You are all-powerful! Seriously, this is one of the great things about writing. If you\u2019re using a real world setting, you need to study the place and time, but all the characters and titles and words and plot are your very own. You poke and prod and make up and dismiss, until you have something you love. All power is yours; you are a god. At least as far as your poor characters are concerned. :-) And if you happen to be writing SF and Fantasy, whole universes are yours. When it comes to the world, you can start with geology and create it from the tectonic plates up. That is godlike. And while it\u2019s fun to do with an enthusiastic collaborator, you don\u2019t have to have one. Who \u201crefuses\u201d to help you? Do you need them? I\u2019m kind of wondering why you want to write, you know? The moment when a phrase occurs and you think, \u201cchapter title!\u201d, or \u201cdamn, that\u2019s what this book is called!\u201d Those are great moments. Becoming involved as you weave your setting together to make a convincing world\u2026 Planning your characters (if you\u2019re a structured writer who functions by planning). Or listening to your characters (if you\u2019re an intuitive writer, who likes to seize the end of a piece of string and find out where it goes). These are wonderful fun, as well as being immensely satisfying when you have a good story that says something. Is it a lack of confidence \u2014 you think every writer secretly has a staff of minions who bring them stories and settings and characters, for the Master to weave together? I wish. :-) I describe writing a novel as the process of walking out over an abyss on a bridge, while building the bridge in front of you. It can be nerve wracking to think it\u2019s all your responsibility. And yes, sometimes it\u2019s good to have a co-writer. Being a novelist doesn\u2019t come with an office-full of people for a social life; you have to make your own \u2014 and sometimes, sharing a piece of work with someone who doesn\u2019t look at you like you\u2019re crazy for what you do for a living is good. Can you do it all on your own? Undoubtedly. Do you want to do it on your own? That\u2019s for you to decide. But, one person or many can refuse their help, and the writer can just say the local equivalent of \u201cfuck you and the horse you rode in on\u201d. There are books and the internet for things you don\u2019t know about your settings and maybe characters; likewise, books and the internet for almost every aspect of how to write fiction. All you have to ask yourself is, do you have the desire to become a god? Because if you want it badly enough, you will find what you need, no matter who won\u2019t or can\u2019t help you.  Q: Can you create fictional characters, stories, titles, settings and locations on your own if anybody refuses to help you? ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. That\u2019s all part of the fun. Delving into your own imagination and pulling out original, complex characters and settings etc. My only piece of advice is take your time. Don\u2019t be in a rush to have everything perfectly in place before beginning. (I have been working on a story/novel that\u2019s being playing around in my head for the last couple of years) That\u2019s one of the best things about creative writing, nothing is set in concrete. As an author you are free to chop and change any or all aspects of your story at any given time. Try and enjoy the process even if it drives you crazy at times and you\u2019re feeling a little insecure about what you\u2019re producing. You can do it if you persist and are in it for the long haul. ",

If you make up a name for a character or place and decide to use it in a story, however, I highly recommend Googling it just to make sure it\u2019s not already a name or a word somewhere in the world. There\u2019s nothing quite so embarrassing as naming a character only to find that their name means \u201cpoop\u201d in one country and \u201cI did a very rude thing to your goat\u201d in another. ",
