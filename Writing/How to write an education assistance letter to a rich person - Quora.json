            "answer_text": "Don't. They get plenty of begging letters and mostly have people to (politely) reject the requests on their behalf. Instead, do some research and demonstrate that investing in your education would be worthwhile. Find out what grants or scholarships or other deals are available. Find out whether there are any jobs that include financial aid which might make your education cost more manageable. There are sometimes deals where you commit to working for someone for a specific period in return for them paying for your degree or training. See about apprenticeships or mentorship programs. Go to the local Rotary Club or Elks or Public Speaking classes and see if you can get a group of people interested in working with you. Begging might sometimes get you the money you need but it also undermines your self-respect. Instead, find ways to help other people to work with you for your benefit, but also for theirs. ",
