            "answer_text": "There are a lot of ways to learn magic. The easiest way is to research, extensively. Here\u2019s my little crash course in magical theory that can help get you started: \"Imagination is the fuel of magic.\" -Joshua Khan, Dream Magic. You want to know a big secret? You don't actually need any tools to do magic. You don't need wands or cauldrons or stones. You don't need chalices or statues or magic bags. You definitely don't need incantations. It's fun to have all those things, and they certainly make magic easier, but you don't really need them. Magic is based on intention. It's not the words and gestures that make the magic happen, it's you and your desire. Your tools just help set the intention more strongly. This is true in most fiction, too, which is why magical powers in fiction typically get stronger if they have an emotional drive behind it. To do magic, you need to pour your intent and desire into whatever your target is. If you start treating spells like following a recipe, or read incantations like you're reciting lines, you're not going to do very much. This is also why spells won't work if you expect them not to. That sends a conflicting message \u2014do you want it to work, or not to? The less you doubt yourself and the more confident you become, the better! (Easier said than done. Still working on it myself.) You want to be luckier? Hold a good-luck charm of your choice to your chest and say, Everything goes well for me. (I tend to phrase spells in future tense out of habit, but it's better to use present tense because it's even more effective if you act like you already have what you want.) Say it like you mean it. Attach your intention to be luckier to the charm that you hold. You don't technically need the luck charm, but it's much easier to attach the intention to something physical then to leave it floating out in the Astral world somewhere. Then, put the charm someplace safe where you can forget about it until the spell does its work. You can put it under your pillow, in a magic box, or carry it around with you for a few days. You have to eventually forget about the spell, so you can let it do its work without continuing to influence it. (Note that spells still work within parameters. If you wish for money, you probably won't win the lottery or have a million dollars show up at your doorstep. However, you might get a job offer, or some other opportunity that can provide you with the money you need, and when you see the opportunity, take it!) Similarly, if you call on gods and spirits to help you, you actually have to demand their assistance. They're busy. They have more important things to do if their presence is not requested. Sometimes, especially when I'm desperate, I find myself slipping into prayer instead of actual spellcasting. Prayer is much more passive, because it's begging for what you want from the gods instead of requesting that they help you get what you want. I find that, when I ask for what I want from the universe, I tend to get it! I just have to actively send my desire out into the world. You'll know a spell is working if you feel energy moving. Imagine that fire is really shooting out of your hands, or that a light is expanding from your heart. If you feel powerful, you will be! (Before moving on, I feel like I should mention love spells. Love spells are ethically tricky because they may involve other people. Don't cast a spell so that a specific person will fall in love with you. That's interfering with their free will. Instead, cast a spell to bring a romantic relationship into your life, and let the gods push you towards the right person instead of meddling in other people's lives.)  \"People see what they wish to see. And in most cases, what they are told that they see.\" -Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus. \"Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry, but why should that mean it isn't real?\" -J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. \"First sight is when you see what's really there, not what your head tells you ought to be there. [...] You think this is the whole world? ...there are more worlds than stars in the sky. Understand? They are everywhere, big and small, close as your skin. They are everywhere. Some you can see and some you can't, but there are doors, Tiffan.\" -Terry Pratchett, The Wee-Free Men. My first rule of magic: See what's there, not what you think is there. This is a simple way of explaining a kind of complicated idea. The truth is, most of reality is based on our perceptions of the world around us. Studies have shown that more optimistic people tend to be happier. That means that if you perceive that your life is going well, it will! By molding your perceptions, we will be able to mold your reality. That's easier said than done, of course, but I'm constantly learning more and more about how to do that. The first thing to do (and possibly the hardest) is to recognize the difference between perception and reality. If you tell yourself, this test will go horribly, then you're setting yourself up for failure because you went into the test believing you would do poorly. I'm not a naturally optimistic person, so I really struggle with this. The next step, and the magical part, is to actively decide that the test will go well and set the intention to do well. Just shifting your perception does a lot. Actively deciding to get the outcome you desire is the magic part. The other big piece of \"see what's there\" is to accept the possibility of things not making sense. You think you just saw a ghost? Don't dismiss it as a trick of the light. You think that a spirit spoke to you during your meditation? Well, maybe it did. You think you might pass into another world if you go behind the standing stone? Walk around it a few times until you see something weird. Let yourself see the world as a child does. Believe that anything is possible, and then make it possible. Also keep in mind that the physical world is not the entirety of existence (as Dumbledore reminds us). Another super important rule of magic is \"Like attracts like.\" Seriously, remember that one. What you put out into the world, you get back. That's why you create a self-fulfilling prophecy if you believe you'll fail your test-- you put out negativity, so you get it back. It's also another reason why optimism makes you happier-- if you put out happiness, you'll get it back. This is the idea behind the \"Threefold Rule\" in Wicca, and the Hermetic philosophy \"As above, so below\" that exists in most magic systems. \"As above, so below,\" suggests that the heavenly and Astral world corresponds to and reflects the earthly world and the human individual. \"Like attracts like\" is also the concept behind sympathetic magic-- if you do physically affect some symbol of your desire, you will also affect whatever it represents. (\"Voodoo dolls\" are a popular Hollywood depiction of sympathetic magic, but sympathetic magic is much more often used for healing than hurting people, because obviously the latter would be unethical.) Symbolic representations of things are really useful as magical tools for this reason, like putting an owl statue on your altar to connect with Athena, or burning a piece of paper to banish emotions you no longer need. Okay, I know there was a lot in there, but it's important to understand the theory before you can begin to do any kind of spellwork. That way you actually know what you\u2019re doing, and you can find the most effective ways to set your intentions. Here's a final quote about names, that I think is also important to remember: \"What others call you, you become. It's a terrible magic everyone can do, so do it. Call yourself what you wish to become.\" -Catherynne M. Valente, The Girl who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two. ",

            "answer_text": "Magic powers are within us all. We use them without realizing it. Start with your 5 senses. Remember that you can actually feel when someone is about to knock on your door. Notice when you think of a friend, seconds before she calls. You can smell when a fruit is ripe or rotten, and you can smell when your perfumed deceased grandma is around you. You can dream of places before being there and you can visualize what will manifest later. Your 5 senses are your tentacles to the information out there. Pay attention and acknowledge the information you receive to start developing your magic powers. Here\u2019s a game you can play to enhance your sensorial magic powers; (great for parents who want to check up on their kids from a distance;) Stay still exactly where you are, sitting, standing or lying on your bed, and relax your body and mind. I like to see myself in the middle of a crystal blue lake with just pure potentiality around me.When you are ready, close your eyes and mentally scan what is around and beyond you. Take your time doing this, pretending to be out of your body, being on the other side of the door, or outside in your garden, or flying with an airplane to an unknown destination. You don\u2019t need to see or feel or hear anything. Some people are more visual than auditory or kinesthetic (feel). If you are auditory, scan the difference in frequencies around you. Allow for different vibrations and sounds to flicker in and out. If you are kinesthetic, your body and your auratic shield will start to feel differently according to where you place yourself. Distance will be felt. If you are visual, images will flash in and out, until you steady your space and bring details to focus.Let your mind flicker in and out of points of interests as you scan in and out of areas beyond you. Relaxing yourself deeper and deeper, you\u2019re sensations become clearer.Ask your mind to go visit X. Be clear on that one person you choose, and invite sensations to be experienced. Take note of your first impressions and guide yourself intuitively toward X.As you approach X\u2019s vibration, you immediately notice a difference in sensations. Allow for any of your 5 senses to be triggered, as if you are actually experiencing being in X\u2019s company.With your toddlers or pets, you can have fun figuring out how close or far they are to you, what objects are near them or what they are listening to. Have fun with the process, and enjoy getting better at it!Write down your impressions.To grow your sensorial magic powers, whilst playing this game, ask yourself these 3 simple questions: a) What do I see? b) What does it feel like? c) What do I hear? Keep practicing ~ You\u2019ll soon be remote viewing!",
