            "answer_text": "In 2008, my family and I shifted to Pakistan from Ireland. I was 8 at that time. As soon as I joined school the first problem I faced was that I didn\u2019t know how to read or write urdu. Though I did know how to speak as the language spoken in our household was urdu. The thing that helped me out most while learning to read and write urdu was knowing how to read arabic (as I had started reading the Quran at that time). This helped me out a lot as there was almost the same alphabet in both languages. If you have even the most basic knowlege of urdu you would know that Urdu is actually a mixture of Hindi, Farsi, Arabic, Turkish and many other languages. If you have any knowlege of these languages your learning slope will be quite flat and you will learn it in no time. However, if you know some other europeon language that is different from urdu you are going to have a very steep learning curve. In the second case I would suggest the following steps: Start with the alphabet.After completing the alphabet start adding a single letter to each letter such that you get two letter words.As you get a hold over this keep adding letters such that you learn how to pronounce the different soundsOnce you learn how to pronounce words try listening to famous newscasters of Pakistan like Mr. Tariq Aziz to get a know-how of the accent.Once you are done with this I am sure you will start getting a grip over the language.Make slow progress to learn general sentences that are spoken often and your vocabulary will also improve with time.",
