            "answer_text": "There is no single answer, but the history of some of them is pretty clear. A lot of poetic devices we still acknowledge or even use today were once primarily mnemonic. Homeric epic is rife with personal epithets and stock phrases that gave the bards time to think and improvise later verses. Meter itself may be tied to memory, or to a connection with music, or both.  Others are probably more descriptive than anything; the relatively small canon of Greek and Roman writers who were studied in the old classical curriculum developed idiosyncrasies that were analyzed, named, and taught as part of good style. Then people educated in this system strove to imitate these tropes and schemes. This seems clear when we consider just how many named literary and rhetorical devices there are; we can coin a new one whenever we notice a new interesting feature in our favorite novels, poems, songs, essays, etc. Finally, at their best, literary devices expand what is \"sayable\" or \"thinkable\" about a topic by allowing us to think of one thing in terms of another. In this way, we can relate specific experiences to general ideas, or one physical experience to someone else's, etc. They can be a kind of Rosetta Stone, translating one experience or mode of thought into another.

They keep you turning those pages, (foreshadowing.)  They make you hear the written word, (onomatopoeia.)  They make you think, (oxymoron.)  They help us to remember what we read, and turn writing into music, (rhyme and rhythm.) ",
