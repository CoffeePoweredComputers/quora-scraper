            "answer_text": "Don't think about it. That's the best way to write a poem. Writing a poem is like letting yourself into a storm. Not like an helpless boat, but like a windchime.. that's the only thing that never bothers a storm, or rather loves to embrace it.. get the undertone.. If you scratch your head out and think that- \u201cNo I have to write better. \u201c \u201c I could use some better English word here!\u201d \u201cOh this doesn't rhyme\u201d .. You think and you think.. but you can never write. Because there is no limit to being better. thinking is not poetry, unthinking is.. you just need to unthink.. because the moment you start to bury yourself under loads of thinking, you aren't yourself, you are transformed to someone else.. and that thing you 'try' to write is not yours.. it's someone else's, precisely, someone less than you. Because you can only be yourself when you are naked in your thoughts.. and your mind is empty. You are acceptance itself. Don't bother what your line has to mean in someone else's head. You just look at your writing and a smile appears on your face. That's poetry. And you are absorbed in it. Or to be exact, at that moment, you are the poetry. It's your creation.. you don't write a poem, you give birth to it. And you are not supposed to know what you are giving birth to, how will it look, or what will it be like. You simply give birth. But remember, maybe you will not know anything about the birth you give, but the moment you see it, you will fall in love with it and there cannot be anything better in the world than it. Remember, a mother's first look to her newborn baby. She didn't know what he (or she okay, now I am not a strawberry feminist) will look like. But the moment she looks at him or her, she knows he/she couldn't have been any better. Poetry is just like that. Let yourself fall. Let yourself free. You will suddenly realize that you have written a poem. You did not even start writing it, and you don't remember when you ended it. All you remember is you were looking at some leaves leaving their trees in adieu.. but suddenly you wake up, and with amusement in your eyes, see that you have written your first poem! At that moment, there's a small change that will happen with you. You will be born again too. A second time and the last time. Because now, you will never die. There's just one reason behind it. Because you have now born a poet. Never bother \u2018writing\u2019 a poem. Wait for its 'happening'.. if you can be yourself, open like a fragrance, that does not choose to love, it will 'happen' someday.. And trust me, that will be the best day in your life. Don't forget to tell me about your poem, and if you want you can read my writing at YourQuote too, by the name 'Shiladitya Sarkar\u00a9'. Hope I could reach your thoughts.. :). ",

            "answer_text": "Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam once said, \u2018\u2019Poetry comes from the highest happiness or the deepest sorrow.\u2019\u2019 If you are a new comer into the beautiful world of poetry then I will suggest you to read some poems in the language you are going or wishing to write so as to understand the structures and standards of poems of some famous writers. It is just like to know the taste and smell of the dish you are willing to prepare. For example you should know about radeef, kaafiya and beher while writing a ghazal, you should know how to write a geet so it can be sung in rhythm etc. After you have read a sufficient poems, your poetic subconscious mind will begin to work and you will be able to get ideas and thoughts. A movie or a novel of same genre you're going to write will also work if there's nothing in the mind initially. A true writer writes when his or her feelings are in the state that if he doesn't , he'll be in a state of trembling hands and bodies. Nothing to worry about it, just give a start, share it among your friends and be ready for the appreciations.. True and genuine appreciations always work as a catalyst in the improvement of any skill so is in the case of writing\u2026 Always be adaptive and strechable in the case of thoughts and genres. Try to understand what people want to read and serve them as your own creation\u2026 Cheers to your write up and I hope you will also be a writer soon. Hope it helps. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the best way to write a poem is WHAT YOU FEEL Poetry is not difficult, poetry is all about expression of your thoughts or feelings. How I have considered writing poetry is by being true to myslef. Whatever comes in your mind just pen it down. A guilt, A expression of love, A heartbreaking word. Simply, anything. And once you will start writing and reading othe poets you will realize you are no less than the other popular writers. Tip: Once you start writing observe the things around you to create metaphors.
