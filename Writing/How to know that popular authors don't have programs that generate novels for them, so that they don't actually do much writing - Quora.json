            "answer_text": "A lot of good answers to this already, just want to add my opinion\u2026 First, a lot of the \u2018generated by AI\u2019 memes you see knocking around are faked. I recall one recently where it was claimed as AI had been fed \u2018X hours of Batman comics\u2019 and had produced something comedic that had some links to Batman but only in very silly ways. In fact, this is the image I saw:  Now, even if this were genuine (friends of mine claim it is not and they know computers and stuff better than me, I am erring on their side but open to persuasion) does this look like the script for a comic or movie that would score well in audience or critic reviews? A lot of it is nonsense. If this were a full length script, someone would have to go through it and edit it heavily, more than they might have to do with a script from a professional writer. In fact, you\u2019d end up rewriting a lot of it, at which point you have not really saved any money because you might have to hire a writer to fix the script\u2026 Secondly, if there were a good AI capable of writing, it would have to be capable of knowing when and how to break the rules. That requires a lot more complicated thought processes than is currently possible with technology. AI produced content would tend to be very samey - stick to a known structure, utilise a lot of common tropes and so on. OK a lot of professional writers do that too (I still get flahsbacks to the 80s and all the many many Tolkien clones\u2026) but a great writer manages to bend or even break the rules in ways that turn them into new tropes. A human writer would, while writing, have a level of metaprocessing where they are thinking about the possible impact of what they are writing - predicting the possible future where this would be published and how audiences might respond to it. This will inform the decisions they make while writing - should they kill character A or let them have a last minute reprieve, for example? Which is more dramatic? Which would have the most impact. An AI would not have that. While GRR Martin can very deliberately consider something like the Red Wedding, knowing it will cause massive outcry in the fans and how that might influence sales, the AI would be effectively flipping a coin to decide the fate of each character. So, an AI produced novel would be somewhat derivative, bland and lack certain creative twists. This is not to say it cannot happen in the future but from what I have seen on AI\u2019s currently I do not think they are capable of fully replacing a human writer. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! Many people nowadays grossly overestimate the power of artificial intelligence. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it did evolve to peaks we did not imagine ten years ago, but it is still rather primitive, at least when compared to what the flamboyant public opinion seems to believe ( some people even think that in the near future doctors are going to be replaced by knowledgeable robots). To answer your question, it is possible to generate a whole novel using a computer program\u2026 But it will sound silly and make little to no sense at all. People DID try to generate screenplays using AI and the results were hilarious. Not something a popular author would attempt. However, robots seem more talented at painting. \ud83d\ude0a That\u2019s because algorithms specialized on image manipulation are more advanced than the ones producing (convincing) text. Below are some paintings created with AI, in the style of famous painters. You can read more about this technology here: Can We Make A Computer Make Art?  ",
