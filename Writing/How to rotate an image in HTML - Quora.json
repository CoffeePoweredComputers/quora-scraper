            "answer_text": "Another answer suggested the image-orientation CSS property, which is only supported in Firefox. A more inclusive method would be the CSS transform property with a rotate method applied: img {\u00a0transform: rotate(90deg);\u00a0}\u00a0You can use a negative number to go the other way. If you need to support IE 9 and/or older versions of  iOS Safari and the Android browser, include the browser prefixes: img {\u00a0-ms-transform: rotate(90deg);\u00a0-webkit-transform: rotate(90deg); \u00a0transform: rotate(90deg);\u00a0}\u00a0Also you could use the scale method to flip, or flop and image. Scaling an image negatively on the x axis will fl0p it (make a mirror-image), scaling on the y axis will flip it upside-down. /* flop, or mirror image */ \u00a0transform: scale(-1, 1);\u00a0\u00a0/* flip upside-down */ \u00a0transform: scale(1, -1);\u00a0",

Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc  The -webkit-transform feature is widely implemented and cooler when used appropriately, but it's overkill for 2D and it's a nonstandard feature, to boot: Can I use...
