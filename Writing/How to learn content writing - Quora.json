            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re just starting off, a lot of content specialists will start off their advice with \u201cpractice writing\u201d or an equivalent statement. As someone who\u2019s seen hundreds of content sites generate enough monthly net profit so an entire family doesn\u2019t have to work and live a comfortable lifestyle, I can tell you some of the skills you need to create great content. First off, the advice to practice your craft isn\u2019t wrong. But I\u2019d argue quality over quantity rings especially true in this instance. Highly valuable content achieves two things: meets a specified business goal and generates traffic to the content. Start with \u201cWhy\u201d? For the first goal, ask yourself what is the purpose of your content. Some common goals include: Become a go-to article about a specific topic in my nicheEducate readers about what\u2019s trendingProvide an in-depth analysis on a phenomenon like a high-performing product/serviceKeeping this goal in mind gives you direction when writing the content. Knowing the goal helps you answer who are you writing this for, what\u2019s the problem you\u2019re addressing, and what is the solution you\u2019re offering. I like to use the \u201cJobs to be done\u201d approach when thinking about my content. Professor Theodore Levitt from Harvard Business School once said \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to buy a quarter-inch drill, they want a quarter-inch hole!\u201d People want to know how your services or product will help them. If your service is writing about products in a niche, the value you provide is saving people time with thorough research and sound evidence behind why you recommend certain products. Demonstrating your expertise really gives readers confidence in what you\u2019re writing about and gives them peace of mind when making a choice between products. All eyes on me Content isn\u2019t useful if no-one is reading it, no matter how well-written it is. Optimizing your content so it\u2019s SEO-friendly helps your articles appear in front of more viewers when they look for answers on search engines. Learn what keywords are and how to research them. Keywords are the phrases people punch into Google, like \u201ccalories in ice cream\u201d. Structure your content around these keywords. You can analyze the intent behind them. Take the \u201ccalories in ice cream\u201d example\u2014someone could be searching for the actual calories amount because they\u2019re on a diet and want to make sure they\u2019re within their calorific budget. Pivot on the intent and create content to help answer what people are looking for. Other benefits of creating great content for SEO purposes are: Increases traffic to the siteGet backlinks from sites with high-authorityGenerate leadsOptimize your site for readability and make sure it\u2019s a seamless experience transitioning from page to page. Visitors can get turned off and leave very quickly if your site loads very slowly or widgets are misaligned. Start with a KISS Kiss stands for \u201cKeep It Simple Stupid\u201d. I\u2019m not a huge fan of the acronym but it\u2019s easy to remember when you write your content. In school we learn how to insert adverbs and flowery descriptions to beautify our writing. That doesn\u2019t work when you\u2019re trying to great awesome content that brings people back over and over. The average reading level in the US is the 8th grade (13\u201314 year olds). Keep vocabulary limited and your sentences easy to read. Shorter sentences and small paragraphs are effective. Even if your target audience can read very complicated things for their job, no one wants to. Attention is at a premium nowadays and people often want quick and easy solutions. I\u2019ve described some of the core aspects of creating great content. You can start writing about things you\u2019re interested in your own blog. After you build up enough content, this serves as a portfolio to show to people looking for help with writing. Apply for freelancing gigs as a side income stream. If your blog gets enough traffic, you can even monetize it so it earns you a bit of passive income each month. Many entrepreneurs build online businesses that generate enough monthly net profit that replaces their main job. I\u2019ve even seen content sites sell for $100,00 upwards, with our largest sale being $1,470,000. Learning how to create really good content is a fantastic skill that will be useful for a while. Don\u2019t worry about your whether your current content is good enough right now. Focus on improving with each article you write. If you earn money from side income, I\u2019d also suggest reinvesting it back into yourself to level up your skills and you can charge more. Attend courses by experienced writers. Read books to learn some great copywriting and writing principles. Keep striving to be a bit better than you were yesterday. Think of the process as making 1 degree changes. Up close, your progress seems insignificant. But over time, you\u2019ll see your ability veer so far away from where you originally started. You\u2019ll barely be able to recognize yourself from when you first started when you become an amazing content writer. ",

            "answer_text": "Content writing is different from what we think as hobby writing.
