            "answer_text": "One I find interesting is the conjecture of quantum graphity. Probably the most well-known result in topological phases this century is the mechanism proposed by Levin and Wen connecting tensor category theory to topological phases via string-net models. This is essentially a lattice gauge theory describing a network of spins whose interactions are determined by group-theoretic fusion rules. For the case of SU(2), this is very similar to the spin-network models studied in Loop Quantum Gravity. So similar, in fact, that it led several prominent physicists (including Lee Smolin, one of the founders of LQG) to suggest that the same mechanism underlying the formation of topological phases in string-net models is responsible for generating the Standard Model in spin-networks. Despite a lot of effort to understand this mechanism, the connection between spin-networks and string-nets remains unclear. The program to unite the two goes under the hilarious name of quantum graphity. ",
