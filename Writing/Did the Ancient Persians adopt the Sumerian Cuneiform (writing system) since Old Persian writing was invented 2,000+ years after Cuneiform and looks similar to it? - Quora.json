(source)  (source) So no, Persians didn\u2019t adopt the Sumerian cuneiform for writing the earliest stage of Persian, but the writing system which was made for the language was inspired by the Sumerian cuneiform. Same goes for Elamite, although it did directly derive from the Akkado-Sumerian cuneiform, as far as the script is concerned (just to be clear that I\u2019m not talking about the language itself).
