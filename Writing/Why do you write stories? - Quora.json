            "answer_text": "Because if I didn\u2019t, the voice in my head would never stop. I\u2019m an active, outgoing guy by nature. I speak well and I\u2019ve even been referred to as \u201ccharming\u201d enough times that I almost allow myself to believe it. I\u2019ve got my life together. I\u2019ve got direction, man. Big boy responsibilities, even. But my brain\u2014my brain is a chaotic mess of ten different perspectives of every situation, snapshots of people\u2019s eye flutters and voice inflections, what-ifs, coulda-beens, furniture details, anxieties, angers, pop culture references, fleeting obsessions, microcosmic realizations, deep thoughts, and so much more stuff that I\u2019ll never ever explore it fully in three (or four) lives. There\u2019s a voice in there making sense of all those thoughts. It\u2019s different than my own speaking voice. It\u2019s more assertive, darkly funny, irreverent, world-weary. When I write, that voice takes shape. A lot of times I don\u2019t want to write. It\u2019s not always due to my own inherent human laziness, though sometimes it is. Most times, however, it\u2019s because I\u2019d like to keep all that stuff bottled inside me and maintain a firm grip on what\u2019s displayed in a public forum. The voice doesn\u2019t always reflect what I want to present to the public. Sometimes writing is not a clean, fun thing for me\u2014it\u2019s a pithy, greasy, dirty rollercoaster ride with no discernible end. And it can be exhausting. But I do it anyway. I make a living at it, as a matter of fact. When I write copy for companies or write stories for the newspaper I am an editor at, the words are fairly regimented and straightforward. It\u2019s more clinical than creative, though the voice always manages to sneak in there anyway. When I write for myself, however, or I\u2019m writing for a publication with a more liberal bent, I can exercise my \u201creal\u201d voice. That\u2019s when the floodgates open a little wider. And that, my friend, is when my true inner voice gets to saddle up. That\u2019s why I write\u2014because it\u2019s in there, and it has something to say, and it\u2019s only happy if it gets on that mean horse and rides. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever since I was a kid, I actually had a vivid imagination, and while one of my outlets was drawing. There were moments that I can\u2019t put things on paper. It\u2019s like this itching thought at the top of my head that wanted to be explained. Often stories I\u2019ve written started with either a question or an actual movie like scene in my head that just won\u2019t stop bugging me either when I slept or when I daydream on the bus. Eventually, I started writing it down on my journals, and over a few weeks I began plotting it out as a story. I knew some of what I wrote was inspired by the books I\u2019ve read, as if a smug inner side of me kept whispering things like \u201cwe can write something better than the book\u201d but truthfully I couldn\u2019t. Often, I share my stories to my close friends. They\u2019d encourage me to finish the stories because if it was something I genuinely wrote and a story I\u2019d like to read, there might be others out there who\u2019d like it or find it good. I was never really too confident with my writing style either. Yet, with a lot of encouragement, I just kept writing. Usually, I would write out the plot, or whoever the character that bugs my consciousness. Sometimes my ideas sucks, but there are some that my friends and a ton of online readers kept telling me it\u2019s good. Personally\u2026I write as a way to find even a small piece of escape from Reality. I find fun in world building and creating adventures for my characters. Sometimes they are really grim stories, others are fantasy filled. But I just simply find joy with making a story that I personally would drop anything and sit down and read about. So, idk, maybe others see that in my stories, or the bunch of grammatical errors that would urge them to strangle me too haha. ",
