            "answer_text": "This is a great question. There are many LinkedIn Members who are seeking the proverbial \u2018Viral Post\u2019 or to garner as many Likes & Comments as possible to make us feel fabulous. I won\u2019t lie to anyone, I too long for the day I post something on LinkedIn (or elsewhere) that goes Viral. However, in business, that is not as important as consistently sharing content that my Most Important Viewer (target audience) may find useful that can build my brand on LinkedIn. With the truth stated, creating and sharing content that is memorable, witty and inspirational can help build your brand and drive LinkedIn Profile views, as well as messages, emails and/or phone calls that open doors for business (or career) opportunities. Here are a few tips (Teddy edicts) that help me to create and share content that may be memorable, witty and/or inspirational: \u201cNever do, say or engage on LinkedIn in any way you don\u2019t want to be seen, heard or perceived of in life.\u201d @TLBurriss This edict has kept me out of trouble more often than I should admit.\u201cIt\u2019s not all about you or your business Teddy. It\u2019s all about your Most Important Viewer, their needs, interests, challenges, and hopes, relevant to what Teddy does.\u201d\u201cEverything does not need to be a Broadway production. Most LinkedIn Members want to see & hear you as a real person sharing ideas that make them think, not get them excited about the production.\u201d\u201cBe consistent Teddy. Slow and steady beats out loud, fast and unsustainable every day.\u201d\u201c#PSA - Pay serious attention to what your Most Important Viewer is asking or talking about. This is the type of content you want to get involved in.\u201d\u201cAsk questions Teddy, ask your Most Important Viewer what they want to know, learn, discover, hear, etc. They know best as to what content they want.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be robot Teddy. A typo here and there in a memorable and witty post shows you are human. Stop fretting over the little stuff.\u201d\u201c90/10 is the RULE. 100% of your content needs to be focused on your Most Important Viewer, 90% of your content should not be about Teddy at all and if you need to, 10% can be about how you work with & serve your clients.\u201d\u201cSharing is good. Engaging on highly relevant content is Great. Don\u2019t always try to start a conversation. Rather, jump into ongoing relevant conversations with meaningful ideas where you can.\u201d\u201cPull the right people into relevant conversations when possible, and appropriate by using @tagging of LinkedIn Members and Companies.\u201d\u201cLook for content that is highly relevant and useful to your Most Important Viewer that you can engage on and/or share for their benefit.\u201d\u201cIt all must be TRUHE before you share it or engage on it.\u201dTransparentRelevantUsefulHonestEngaging / Exciting / Educational / Entertaining\u201cDiverse content appeals to a diverse audience. Share & engage on posts, articles, images, videos, documents, company page content, in Groups and Events.\u201dThis sounds like it could be a lot of work, and it is. However, remember edict #4 - slow, steady & consistent. Visit my Quora profile to discover more about me. Thanks for the A2A Teddy BurrissLinkedIn Coach & Trainer ",
