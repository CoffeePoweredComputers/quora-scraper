            "answer_text": "There are a few templates one may adopt in order to write an e-mail politely. Bear in the mind that, other than in instances of deliberate malice or opprobrium, the content of an e-mail will usually not be interpreted as offensive or impolite. There are two primary categories of personal e-mail, business (formal) and friendly (informal) e-mails. There are several subtle distinctions between the two, both in style and in grammar and punctuation. Stylistically, business e-mails will be composed in concise yet sophisticated language, with little use of rhetorical devices or metaphors in the process of composition. Since the primary purpose of a business e-mail is to solicit, invite, or otherwise communicate with an individual in a professional setting, one must refrain from including statements which are ambiguous, grammatically incorrect according to the rules of standard written English, or otherwise construed as unclear or unprofessional. Friendly letters ought to be reasonably cogent, but the lack of the decorum characteristic of professional situations allow friendly letters to feature greater liberty in selecting vocabulary and phrases than business letters. While the content business letters is composed according to the maxims of a rigid etiquette, the content of friendly letters is composed according to the relationship of the writer of the e-mail to the recipient. Additionally, several discrepancies in mechanics distinguish the two types of letter. In a business letter, the salutation (the greeting of the letter followed by the recipient\u2019s name) is followed by a colon (:), whereas the salutation of a friendly letter is followed by a comma (,). In a business letter, the title of the person (if the gender or profession is known) should be included prior to the individual\u2019s full name (i.e. Dear Mr. John Smith:). If the recipient of the business letter is known by the sender and is commonly referred to by his first name, then it is acceptable to solely write the first name of the individual in place of a title and last name (i.e. Dear John:). A friendly letter allows for alterations to the salutation, such as the substitution of a different greeting (e.g. to, or simply the individual\u2019s name) in place of dear. The closing (end) of both types of letter is marked with a comma (e.g. Sincerely, Rachel Smith). Since your goal is to write an informal e-mail, you need not abide by any particular formulae specified above, but it is imperative that your letter adheres to proper standards of punctuation, grammar, and style in order to be adequately read and enjoyed by the recipient. Here is a sample friendly letter. Dear John, It was a pleasure to meet you at the library on Saturday. I never knew that you were so learned in history and literature. Our discussion regarding the effects of the American Civil War on American poetry was truly enlightening, and lent me a new perspective on the unique experience of authors during times of strife, a perspective that is often ignored by the public. Your gift of George Santayana\u2019s Character and Opinion in the United States is greatly appreciated \u2014 I cannot wait to read it! It would be great for us to meet again if you are not otherwise occupied. Thanks, Georgia Here is a sample business letter: Dear Mr. John Smith: Your excellent ethic of service during your time as an employee of Medical Supplies, Ltd. has not gone unnoticed. We would like to express our most sincere thanks by raising your salary from its current level of $150,000 per year to $175,000 per year.
