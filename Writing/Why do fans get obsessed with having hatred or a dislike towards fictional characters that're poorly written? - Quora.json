            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t call it an obsession - but for sure I have deep, deep grudges. ;D Why? Because stories make us feel things. If you\u2019re stone cold indifferent, the story ends up being boring. Even with the highest stakes in the world for the story, if you don\u2019t give a f**k while watching/reading, why are you even wasting time? Do something you enjoy instead. So yes, we\u2019re invested in who\u2019s going to end with whom, whether the big bad will be killed and by whom, and so on. If you have a poorly written character, it means that what happens doesn\u2019t make sense. The best friend suddenly turns up abuser? The character suddenly has powers they never had before, without so much as a line of explanation, or that don\u2019t fit with a non-magical setting? You can bet I\u2019ll hate the character. They just ruined both my precious relax and the story I am so interested in!!! And I will also hate the writer, who managed to slip such shoddy work in and get paid for it. Would you wonder why people have hatred for the chefs that give them food poisoning? ",
