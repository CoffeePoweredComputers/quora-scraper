            "answer_text": "There are quite a number of essay types and writing each varies from the other. We have: Descriptive essaysThe speak more about describing something it could be you, your friend or any other subject. It depends on what topic you are given. Being a descriptive essay doesn't mean being so exaggerative with your choice of words.. Narrative essaysThis is also another kind of essay that seems more like telling a story. It may demand you to think of something that is yet to happen or has occurred in the past. Argumentative essaysThis is one of the complex aspect of essay writing that request the writer to focus on both angles given. You may begin by giving a brief highlights on both subjects and later emphasize on what it is exactly you stand for. This more like sharing an opinion on the subjects given.. Expository essaysDemands an explanation of a subject to somebody who knows little or nothing about it. It may require you to write on the process of getting something done. Report writingIt is an essay meant to provide an objective or a factual information to an interested party. The report writer is presumed to know more about the subject matter than his audience. Speech writingA speech must be introduced by vocatives. In fact a speech for an important occasion should carry all the formal features of a speech notably opening and closing vocatives. These and many others are examples of essays and all an essay demands is a creative writer who can think around the clock to produce something at any given time. In some cases, a story may be started and you will have to complete it, in other you can only be asked to write a n essay based on a proverb or quotation. Which ever way it may be just have an idea of what to produce that would explain or speak of the subject. A scenario may be: Write an essay on the topic monkeys play by sizes\u2026 OR write an essay ending I shall never enter that room again\u2026  An example is below\u2026 As part of the activities marking the independence anniversary of your country, you have been asked to deliver a speech on the topic \u201c some outmoded customs and practices that should be abolished. Write out your speech\u201d.  Mr. Chairman, Honourable Regional Minister, Distinguished Guests, Chiefs and Elder of the land, Ladies and Gentlemen. I feel highly honoured to be given the opportunity to speak on the topic \u201cSome Outmoded Customs and Practices That Should Be Abolished\u201d. As we celebrate our 50th anniversary of our political independence, it is fitting and proper that we reflect on this all important topic. Our customs and practices set us apart from other people and we ought to cherish them. Yet, looking at the Ghanaian society, one notices some customs or practices that need to be done away with, mainly because they are irrelevant and out of touch with modernity. I will like to begin with inheritance which to all intents and purposes is out of relevance. With this system, a man for instance succeeds his maternal Uncle and not his father. Quite often this has resulted in the situations where widows and orphans are driven from the family home by the deceased's maternal relations. A nephew is quickly chosen to inherit the property of a man who has toiled with the wife and children to set up a home and acquire some property. Is it fair for a widow to be chased out of her marital home with her children because the husband is no longer alive? Matrilineal inheritance should therefore be abolished forthwith. Another custom generally criticized is the \u201ctrokosi system\u201d. What happens here is that, for the sins or crimes which their relatives committed so many years ago against a god, some girls are attached to a shrine for life. They live as property of the shrine and are married to its custodians or priests. Though slavery is no longer practised anywhere in the world, it is very difficult to draw a line between the \u201ctrokosi\u201d system and slavery. It is quite obvious that it is the most outmoded customs in the country today and its abolition is long overdue. Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Guests, Chiefs and Elders of the land, Ladies and Gentlemen, talking about outmoded customs and practices brings to mind, the injustices some women go through in the name of widowhood rites. Although this differs from tribe to tribe, the general trend reveals a subjection of widows to what amounts to a torture. In some tribes, it is customary for a widow to be fed on an egg a day for a week, walk barefooted for quite a long time and even be refused of handshake at the funeral. Judging by the fact that mainly a widow would willingly give all there is to save a husband's life, need we subject them to such an ordeal? I don't think so. Lastly, in some Ghanaian tribes to bury the dead with precious items like jewellery, pieces of cloth and other valuables. Aside of being sheer waste of resources, burying the dead with these things encourages grave looting. So those desirous of honouring their beloved relations. All things considered, there could be no better way to honour the dead than to take care of the surviving spouse and children. In conclusion, it must be stressed that the practical realities of the day has rendered some of our customs and practices outmoded. They should therefore be banned outright. Among these are the matrilineal inheritance, the \u201ctrokosi system\u201d bondage, inhuman widowhood rites and the burial of the dead with valuables. I am appealing particularly to our Honourable Members of Parliament to give these views due consideration. Mr. Chairman, Honourable Regional Minister, Distinguished Guests, Chiefs and Elder of the land, Ladies and Gentlemen, I think I'm done\u2026  Now that was an example of an essay in the form of a speech. These are what essays are about. They should contain elements that are need to discuss or address the subject given.  In others you might be asked to develop introductory paragraphs\u2026 Make an efforts to put up your best and it should contain all the necessary details to keep the audience glued to read. ",
