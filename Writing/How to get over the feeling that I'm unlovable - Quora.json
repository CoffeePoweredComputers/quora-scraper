            "answer_text": "Unlovable is a shame conclusion you came to because your original caregivers couldn't, or wouldn't, give it. The typical response is trying to get others to give you that value but they are unable to, even though they may try. Your interpretation of this is to confirm what you already believe through experience, ie: You're unlovable. All the performing you do will ultimately be futile because they cannot make up for what you believe you need. Namely your parent-Gods were supposed to love you unconditionally. Love isn't supposed to be something you earn. To heal that soul-wound, you have to trump your original (Gods\u2019) messages about your worth, you received as an experience. In addition, it really isn't the adult you who needs the validation. It is that little ghost-child inside who is still lonely and insecure. That kid needs you to create an experience where the blessing is a given. That is why most all societies have Priests, Shaman, or Holy people to help people discover the truth of who they are. You can't be subjective and objective at the same time. So to get over it, or heal it, You have to find someone skilled in helping you find the truth. That little ghost-child was lovable \"just the way they are\", to quote Mr. Rogers. The child was lovable just because it exists and belongs in this world. It is not a truth you are unlovable, just a feeling. Your feeling can be changed with a new paradigm. There are a number of therapies and processes designed to change that. Find one that works for you. ",

            "answer_text": "I was asked to answer for the first time, thanks for that. I think first and foremost that no one is truly unlovable so I think I'd rather answer \u201chow do you cope with *feeling* unlovable?\u201d because I have some experience in that and that may still be of help to you. I have felt unlovable many times during my not so long life. There are notes I've written at thirteen, fourteen, fifteen (you get the idea) that ask this very question: what is is about me that's so awful that no one can love me? The answer was: nothing. I wasn't unlovable. I grew up thinking that my parents didn't love me, which I now think they do in some way even if they're far from the best parents in the world. This, I applied to everyone as a rule since I also wasn't very popular in school, didn't have many friends, some people made fun of me, I was always pickes last in PE, the list goes on. As far as romatic relationships go I only recently had experience with that (at twenty) but I still haven't been kissed (long distance). I think the reason I have such trouble with people is that I am a bit different than them, especially people my age. Growing up the way I did made me have to grow up very quickly, I always felt older than my peers and I think they could tell too that I had other values than they did. That's why my romatic interest is eleven years older than I am\u2026 whoops\u2026 My mother hates it but I have never met anyone who accepts me like he does and I've realised that I would've settled for a lot less than that. I still don't have that many friends due to my living situation but I am hoping that'll change and I think it could. So. How do you cope? You realise that you're a bit more of an acquired taste than others might be and that you just have to find the people who'll appreciate you for it. Unless there's something critical in your behaviour, like that you don't treat people well for instance, you should be fine. Finding people with similar interests is always a good start to get to know people and -here's the clich\u00e9- you have to try to push yourself to accept yourself as you are, despite what past you have that makes you feel this way. It's just a feeling in your head, you control your head in this case. That's not to say it's easy, I still struggle almost every day to stay positive, but it's worth fighting for, it really is. I hope you find a way to cope! ",
