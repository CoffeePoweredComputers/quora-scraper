            "answer_text": "The availability of topics for short stories is literally unlimited. Your experience is what is important in terms of writing those short stories. The reason I say this is if there was a potential for a short story in an area that you had little or no appreciation for, or no understanding about, would not be the subject that you should be writing your short story about. The unique experience is what you are trying to share, and what a short story should contain. So writing about a terrible experience while flying an airplane would not be appropriate if you have never flown in an airplane. Similarly a pilot, who has never lived in a Indian village, should not be writing about the difficulty that that life may present. Instead he should be writing the airplane story. Trying to fake experience can easily be detected and not particularly appreciated by those who might be reading your short story. End of story! ",
