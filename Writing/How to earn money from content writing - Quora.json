            "answer_text": " I wondered whether I would ever get paid for my writing. I questioned whether my writing was good enough. In 2007 I started blogging on my own site to practise getting my thoughts, ideas and experiences down. I knew nothing about the BUSINESS of writing for money or who would pay for anything that I had to write about. Over the years, I learnt something valuable: Becoming valuable as a writer is largely dependent upon identifying your unique voice, developing consistency, and using your writing ability to express something that matters to others. I knew nothing about the BUSINESS of writing for money, and for 6 years I didn\u2019t get paid to write. So I focused on developing my craft so that others COULD see value in it. I continued writing and publishing daily on my blog, even when nobody was reading. As I became a better writer, I contributed guest content on other people's blogs. I also developed the ability to write for different audiences based on specific challenges and questions they wanted answered. People started to see value in my work and I got the opportunity to become a contributor for Huffington Post. I then took a job as marketing manager for one of Australia's largest coworking communities, and wrote consistently for their blog and newsletter. I was finally getting paid to write. In mid-2016 I pitched a discounted offer for my new blog writing service in an online group that I was a part of. I had 2 people sign up for it. I now own a business that provides outsourced writing services to growth startups who struggle to get high quality content out consistently. We have a team of writers and editors to deliver the work for our clients. So if you're asking how you can earn money from content writing, then ask yourself: What can you do to improve your writing skills, share it consistently and get your writing in front of people who will pay you for it?
