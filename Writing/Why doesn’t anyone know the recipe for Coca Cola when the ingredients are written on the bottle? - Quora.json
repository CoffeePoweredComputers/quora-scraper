            "answer_text": "There are two ways\u2026 First off, the ingredients list carbonated water, sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine and natural flavors. That doesn't tell you how much sugar, how much caffeine, how much phosphoric acid, etc. It doesn't tell you what order to add the ingredients, how to mix them, at what temperature, and what timing to use. You can't duplicate the recipe from the ingredient list alone.That last item, \u201cnatural flavors\u201d, is a nice catch-all. Does that mean vanilla? Banana? Mint? Pepper? Plum? The two publicly known flavors are cola nut and coca leaf. The rest, a secret.",
