            "answer_text": "As a child i was very fond of horror stories, but that one incident was literally a nightmare. I live in kolkata. My grandmother is basically from a remote village which is somewhat 2hours away from the main city. I was 12 or 13 years old (as far as i can recall) and my summer vacations had just begun. So my mum and my masi ( mother's sister) decided to take my sister and me to that village. Now let's first describe the place. The place was too green with loads of trees , bushes and shrubs. Every family have their personal ponds. The population is so less there that if all of them gathered in a place you could finish counting them within 1 mintue.  ( This picture is taken by me from our courtyard) Now if you zoom in, you can see an unfinished building . People say that it's haunted and that's why no one could ever finish the construction. My sister and me were too young to understand all these so we were just forbidden to enter that area. But we were that typical stubborn children. When we heard the word \u201cforbidden\u201d , we just knew what our next mission was. One such afternoon, when everybody was asleep after having their lunch, me and my sister stealthily escaped from our house and went \u201cthere\u201d for playing. It was supposed to be a two storeyed building but as i said it was an incompleted one. So only few stairs were built. We were having fun until we heard a loud noise. We were scared and we knew that it was now the time to run away. But as soon as we tried to run away, my sister tripped over some rocks and fell down. The situation was turning worse. I tried to pick her up but she was becoming heavy with each passing minute. We both chanted some religious matras that we had been taught and magically my sister became perfectly normal. We wasted no more time and ran away. We didn't tell anyone about that incident but we were scared like hell. Since it is a village, people tend to sleep early and wake early. The place becomes totally dark after sunset. After feeding us our dinner, both of us were sent upstairs to sleep. We insisted to keep the lights switched on but no, my mum didn't listen and turned them off but kept the lights of the balcony switched on. She then went downstairs, keeping the scared little idiots with each other's company in the dark. We were trying our best to sleep but all in vain. The suddenly i saw someone standing oustide on the balcony. I kept staring at that thing for more than 5 mins and signalled my sis to look at that. We both could see someone standing there , facing us. We realised that it was a female as we could see some long hair waving, as if there was wind blowing outside. We were about to shout for help when we heard a voice saying \u201c sshhhh chitkar noy, nahole r beche thakbi na\u201d ( shhhh don't shout else you won't be alive anymore) We probably fainted after that. I remember nothing what happened after that. Whenever i try to ask my mum what happened that night, she avoids that topic completely. Now, after 6 years, when i visited that place again i came to know that a woman was murdered in that building and since then it is said to be haunted. I don't really fantasise horror stories anymore ! Some more pictures of that place.   ",

            "answer_text": "13th Dec 2014. \" That was a tiring day, \" I had been walking down the street and not able to see a single person walking on the street. It was almost 8 pm; I had been thinking about what had happened at the office... I could hear dogs barking at the end of the road. I started walking as fast as I can; so that I could give curry to mom; which I bought on the way from my office. As I walked with my head down; I heard the sound of some footsteps coming closer. As I lifted my head up; I saw a tall man with formal black shoes, neatly ironed clothes, a tucked shirt and an umbrella in his hand. That was a similar walking style of someone who was once very close to me, but I couldn't see him because of the umbrella. As the person came closer, I was open-mouthed. I never thought; I could meet him again in my existence. We had a glance, at each other for about 20 seconds. He passed over as if nothing had happened. Tears rolled down my cheeks and within a fraction of seconds, my mind started to recall those good memories which we had together. A few years ago... Those were the last few days of our third year; B-tech. It was a boring class and almost half of the class was dozing, I started yawning. Suddenly; I heard a loud voice calling ``PRIYA..!! I stood up. \" Get out \" she yelled at me. I silently went out and stood at the door. Later when everyone was busy listening to class, I found a boy staring at me. He had immediately shifted his gaze to the board. My friends started signaling and teasing me for getting punished by the lecturer. when I was busy signaling them back; I saw his glance once again, he was snickering. That smile was striking! I couldn't shift my glance from him. After that hour; during the break, I and my friends were having a pastime with some random nonveg jokes; teasing each other, by oversight I saw his glance once again. I gave a smile, he immediately turned out and walked off. I had begun to think about what was going on. The next day, I was a bit early to class. So, I had started to use mobile by hiding it under the desk. All of a sudden someone came and sat next to me; slowly I raised my head up, it was him. I could hear my heartbeat. I pretended as if I was occupied with my work. That entire class we haven't uttered a single word. All of us were busy preparing for exams, I had realized that something was wrong. I started getting \"feelings\" for him. Both of us were not ready to go through that phase...and we knew that; it's not going to work out in the future. I had stopped reacting for whatever was happening. However, there are a few emotions that cannot be shared with anyone. You don't know if it is right or wrong. And you don't know if you should go with the flow or not... I am confused with my feelings(on him) and with the fact that it's not gonna happen. There are millions of thoughts running in my mind: what if he feels the same, what if this is gonna work out, what if he doesn't have all this in his mind, what if my friends judge me, what if...I thought of holding on my thoughts but I couldn't... I never shared a single word about him to any of my friends. But then I realized imagining all this barely make any difference. I chose my career. 13th Dec 2014. I came back to my senses and I had paused recollecting my memories for a while. I had started walking towards him; \"Look, Chandu...wait, Chandu, wait, ' he was not responding. The wet, desolate street was in silence as the black sky wept over it. I could still hear the dogs barking, at the end of that street. Street lights had started to flicker, I could feel the cool breeze and it started to drizzle. The small green trees and bushes along the roadside swayed as the strong breeze hit them. 'Chandu... please wait, suddenly one of the dogs started howling and moaning. I could hear some vehicle sounds far away; on the main road. 'Chandu..wait, he was really fast. I heard another sound of footsteps from behind. It became louder and louder. I thought someone was close by, I stopped. I looked back. I saw no one. A few seconds later the street lights went off, a shiver of fear ran up my spine. Suddenly, with a loud sound, my phone started ringing. It was one of my college mates, \" Priya! Have you heard the news? Our classmate Chandu had passed away one hour back in a road accident. ",
