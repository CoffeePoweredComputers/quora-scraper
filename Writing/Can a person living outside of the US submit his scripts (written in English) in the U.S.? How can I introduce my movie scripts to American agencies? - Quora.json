            "answer_text": "Most would recommend various contests and other oportunities. You can go this way and submit script/treatment etc, depending on their requirements. Also yo can submit script to the agencies directly. Check the web, check the agencies, check the requirements - go for it. Third option - search for producers. Some might refuse, some would require agent but someone can be interested. Or just start production by yourself. Doesn\u2019t matter which way you\u2019ll go, basically you\u2019ll need a lawyer. There could be tonns of nuances and complications, that require someone who do this for living and knows ins and outs. ",

            "answer_text": "Most agencies are already inundated with unsolicited scripts. They don\u2019t take on clients that have not sold scripts or had them produced. They want to make money by helping you find buyers, but to do that they need to see you have a proven track record of already doing that. They are not a way in, they are a way to continue the career you have started. The best route for you is to look into film festivals that accept screenplays, win laurels, win other contests and when you are good enough, enter into the Nichol\u2019s Fellowship run by the Academy (Oscars). Check out Film Festivals, Screenplay Contests, Submissions for international contests. Good luck. ",
