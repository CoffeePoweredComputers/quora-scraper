            "answer_text": "Both are correct. Here\u2019s a quirk about the English language: Often the present tense isn\u2019t used for present time. Picture this situation: You ask a friend what she\u2019s doing right now. She says, \u201cI write.\u201d Nope! No native speaker would ever say that. She would say, \u201cI\u2019m writing.\u201d \u201cI write\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cI\u2019m writing at the present moment.\u201d It means \u201cI write continuously\u201d or \u201cI often write.\u201d My husband writes gardening columns for a newspaper. He\u2019s writing a column right now. The same applies to most present-tense verbs. (The verb \u201cto be\u201d does signify right now: \u201cI\u2019m a teacher.\u201d) ",
