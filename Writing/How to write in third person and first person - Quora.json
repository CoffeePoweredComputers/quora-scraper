            "answer_text": "Third person uses \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d pronouns exclusively outside of dialogue. \u201cHe went to the store. The clerk smiled when he walked in.\u201d First person uses \u201cI\u201d to indicate the point of view character and narrator. \u201cI went to the store. The clerk smiled when I walked in.\u201d First person is perhaps easier because the narrator is always the point-of-view character. The only internal thoughts or emotions you express are the narrator\u2019s. For example, you could write \u201cI thought she was pretty\u201d because you\u2019re inside the narrator\u2019s head and know their thoughts. You couldn\u2019t say \u201cShe thought I was pretty\u201d because the narrator isn\u2019t in her head and can\u2019t actually know that. Third person is perhaps more difficult because the writer has to make a decision about point of view. Is there only one point of view character? If so, the writing follows the same rules as first person - you can only indicate the thoughts and emotions inside the POV character\u2019s head. For example, \u201cHe thought she was pretty.\u201d Alternatively, is the narrator able to see inside everyone\u2019s head, meaning there are multiple POV characters? For example, \u201cHe thought she was pretty, but she thought he was ugly.\u201d Alternatively, is the narrator totally separate from all the characters, meaning there\u2019s no POV character? For example, \u201cHe smiled flirtatiously. She rolled her eyes.\u201d First person is great for showing how one person perceives the story. Third person is better when you want to have multiple POVs and/or show how several different people perceive the story. ",
