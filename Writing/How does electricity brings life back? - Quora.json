            "answer_text": "If you're referring to the \"CLEAR!\" - BANG thing with the two chest pads, that's defibrillation, and it's only used when the patient's heart is fibrillating (beating much too fast and inefficiently and not actually moving much if any blood around the system). In this case, electricity is not restoring life to a dead person, it's being used to prevent (or delay, anyway) death in a living patient. If you're referring instead to the \"Young Frankenstein\" thing, where a corpse is energized by lightening, that's pure fiction. In this case, electricity is also not restoring life to a dead person, it's being used only to entertain you. ",

            "answer_text": "Electricity does not bring life back. Using a defibrillator is just a way of impacting a persons nervous system to see if that impact will start their heart pumping again. Using electrical power is like using a baseball bat that will not break bones or leave bruises and other blunt force trauma. It doesn't bring life back. It just allows a bodies own natural nervous system to restart. ",
