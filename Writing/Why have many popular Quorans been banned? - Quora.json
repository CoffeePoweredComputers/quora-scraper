            "answer_text": "High exposure of intemperate answers. Answers of popular Quorans are generally more exposed than other answers due to the engagement they receive. Therefore, when popular Quorans violate the BNBR policy (Be Nice, Be Respectful), it is detected quite fast. Popular Quorans can easily influence their audience, so a disrespectful answer written by a popular person has a larger negative impact on Quora, than if it is written by a less popular person. But in general, Quora bans people to protect the community from offending answers. Nonetheless, I am not the one to judge whether or not the BNBR policy is reasonably strict or the bans are unjustifiable. ",

The whole thing is about intelligent forms of destructively subtle illusions and allusions the high- minded delight in. Those who get banned are just being taught this valuable lesson, which is possibly ultimately intended to create genius. ",
