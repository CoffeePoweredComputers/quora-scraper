            "answer_text": "You write, or not write, because you have an idea, or lack of one, for a story. You write because there is something that gnaws at the very core of your soul and you have this necessity to reveal it to the world, either to gripe about it, do a commentary about it or to teach people about something that has touched you very deeply. If you don\u2019t know what to write about, then don\u2019t write. It is okay to dabble with words if you enjoy the process but if you don\u2019t have something to say, or to teach, then just think about the type of book that would issue from that source. I have a constant bombardment of story ideas rifling through my mind like a nuclear missile ready to level a continent. My peeve is that I lack the time necessary to work on all the ideas that come to me. I wake up after a dream and there is something to write about. I look out the window and an image strikes a nerve with me. I hear kids playing in the courtyard under my apartment window and I can create a story. A piece of music can inspire and entire epic story to flash through my mind. Then there is internet, social media, YouTube videos, and this forum where I am answering this question, all of which crams ideas into my mind and only for lack of the free time, do I have the chance to tackle all the stories I wish to write. Inspiration is the source for all art, regardless of the medium, the artist chooses to use for their expression. Sketching, painting, sculpting, photography, and writing are only tools for an artist to utilize to create a commentary on something that sparked a significant light within them. You really cannot gain inspiration by asking: \u201cWhat shall I write about?\u201d. If you worked for a newspaper and were told you need to come up with 200 words about some specific thing, by a specific time, this is not inspiration, it is a job. Writing and enjoying the process, inspired by something significant to you, is what makes any book worth writing. Should you decide to try and publish and the book is successful, then this means that a reader had the same chord struck in them as had inspired you. Here is an exercise. Get a notepad and a pencil. Go to a mall and watch people, or ride a bus and do the same. Listen to people talking, and watch their mannerisms and the inflections in their voices. If you have neighbors that are arguing, listen and take notes. Watch the News on television \u2014 if this does not inspire something visceral to write about, then I cannot understand someone that claims to lack ideas on which to write. If you are, by chance, wanting someone to bestow upon you some original idea you can fly with, ask yourself: \u201cWhy would that person give up such a great idea?\u201d The answer usually has to do with the fact that Shakespeare pretty much wrote all there was to write which could be considered as \u201coriginal\u201d and since those days, practically every story that we have come to adore has been a variation on a theme. How the writers approached and executed their story made it fresh, but probably not \u201coriginal\u201d. I, therefore, return to what makes you feel something at the core of your soul? This resonates with readers and even if the story is not particularly original, your slant on the subject will be yours alone, and then become part of the reader, as well. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve heard the advice, \u201cWrite what you know,\u201d but I\u2019m fond of a competing notion, which is to write what you want to know. Flip this idea over and ask this question about what you think you already know. If I know what it\u2019s like to grow up on a farm, what it\u2019s like to have a father, grandfathers, uncles, and brothers work as loggers, what it\u2019s like to be a waitress, what it\u2019s like to be a community college teacher, a mom\u2026then what is compelling about any one of those, what details call to me, what do I know when I know these things? Imagine writing the book you most want to read. What will you learn when you open that book? What will it teach you? What will keep you turning the pages? When you\u2019ve finished the book, what will you carry away? That\u2019s what you should share with your readers. Follow my blog at awritersalchemy.wordpress.com ",
