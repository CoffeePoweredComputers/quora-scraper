            "answer_text": "Nope, we are all the same, just different preferences on what kind of salty sweet sour bitter spiciness. Growing up on junk food makes you like junk food. Growing up on fresh healthy meals makes you like fresh healthy meals We grow up on foods that naturally contain \u201cumami\u201d. We don't intend to insert it into every food but traditional Japanese food contains a lot of \u201cumami\u201d which might make people think we have better taste buds but nope. Just a different lifestyle in each country makes us all different. I like Japanese food, like raw fish, raw eggs on rice with a little be of soy sauce, \u201cnatto\u201d (fermented sticky beans), \u201cnameko\u201d (slimy mushrooms you put in miso soup). But I also like Skittles, orange slices, starbursts, twizzlers, POPs (cereal), cinnamon toast crunch, sour patch kids, branches jelly beans, juicy 1lb steaks and ribs and briskets and giant burgers. And I have to address this, I rather much prefer Dr pepper over coke and Pepsi. So what may seem to be \u201ctoo sweet\u201d to other Japanese people around me, it tastes great for me because that's what I grew up on. ",

            "answer_text": "According to the BBC article referenced by Wikipedia, typically 25% of people are supertasters, but there are more than this in Asia. But it also says that supertasters don\u2019t like salty foods, whereas Japanese mostly like them. So it doesn\u2019t seem like the percentage of supertasters in Japan is really high. ",
