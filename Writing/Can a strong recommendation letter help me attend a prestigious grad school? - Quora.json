            "answer_text": "Yes, a strong recommendation letter from your supervisors will help. However, it also would be great if your work, over the last two years, involved some research and/or some advanced engineering. Then you can also cite the excellence of your engineering work. And, it is best to get a STEM graduate degree for Free. Therefore, either the college offers you a fully-funded program with a Thesis, or you attend a Masters without a thesis but have your company pay for you to attend part-time. Free is the only way. ",

            "answer_text": "Realistically, you will get into grad school on your skill and talent, not your work ethic per se. If your recommendations don\u2019t say anything positive about your skill and talent, it doesn\u2019t matter how much they enjoyed working with you (if admissions are competitive then they will read between the lines). On the plus side, if your skill and talent at an actual workplace are vouched for, then your grades will matter less. It is usually what you have done lately that matters. But realize that the more competition there is for the grad school slots, the more the grades will come into play (someone talented with better grades will likely apply, as well). ",

            "answer_text": "I rekon the Admissions tutor will want to hear you are a talented worker more so than the worker prepared to put in a 60 hour week. If I were the Admissions tutor my first concern would be that you may not be up to the course. I would want to know you would get good marks if asked to resit essential exam papers. Do you have the stamina to study till 3am every night ? That's what my bright class mates completing the full time MSc course at Imperial College were doing to keep up. I was vomlketing the course part time. These kids had completed their undergraduate degree at the College. The top universities are after exceptional students first and foremost. ",
