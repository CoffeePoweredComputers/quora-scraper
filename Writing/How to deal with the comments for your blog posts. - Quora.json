In 2018 they aren\u2019t particularly valuable for most sites. My recommendation is to define a set of rules for your community, make them available on your site, and then use them as your yardstick. In doing this you: (a) make your own assessments 100% transparent (b) have a go-to list for when you block people and they email you with complaints or threats instead (yep, it happens, especially if you publish emotional stuff) (c) give people a list against which to assess their own behaviours. They know what\u2019s acceptable and what\u2019s not, and can then choose to behave accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "Simple \u2014 I determine the comments on these yardsticks:\u2014 If they are constructive (but not necessarily polite), I\u2019ll respond in kind.If they are spam, I\u2019ll remove them unceremoniously.If they are trolling or offensive, I grade them out of 25 marks or remove them.If the comments are potentially defamatory against anyone (including myself), then I screencap them and archive the screencaps as evidence for possible use later.If the comments are potentially in breach of the law (both of the physical location of my blog server computers and of my current location), I repeat Step 3 above.Getting inelegant and problematic comments is part and parcel of the life of blogging. Don\u2019t let that affect your blogging efforts. If one is fearful of getting negative comments, then blogging isn\u2019t a worthwhile thing to do. ",
