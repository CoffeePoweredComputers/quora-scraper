            "answer_text": "Oh man this is a tricky question. Literary canons overlap, intersect, contain other canons as a subset, and, most importantly, they change over time. There is no single group that decides what literary texts constitute a canon. Instead, canon is basically determined by vague, contentious agreement. Perhaps the most famous, widely taught, and hotly contested, canon is the canon of World Literature. Historically, World Literature referred to texts from Western Europe, but has since expanded to include a broader range of texts. [1] Therefore, it is possible to consider Postcolonial literature as a subset of the World Literature canon. However, I\u2019d recommend that one evaluates Postcolonial literature on its own merits, rather than considering it as a continuation of a \u201cWorld Literature\u201d tradition, since Postcolonial literature often criticizes Western ideology. Canons are great when you\u2019re talking about a general movement of literature, but once you start trying to cram texts into them, you will always run into problems. However, in order to answer your question, I\u2019ll give you an example. The Wikipedia entry on Southern United States literature, defines that genre as: \u201cAmerican literature about the Southern United States or by writers from this region. Characteristics of Southern literature include a focus on a common Southern history, the significance of family, a sense of community and one\u2019s role within it, a sense of justice, the region's dominant religion (Christianity \u2014 see Protestantism) and the burdens/rewards religion often brings, issues of racial tension, land and the promise it brings, a sense of social class and place, and the use of the Southern dialect.\u201d[2] If you look at the history of the genre, you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s antebellum literature, \u201cLost Cause\u201d literature, and modernist/post-war Southern literature. The problem is, at least one of the texts listed on that page will undoubtedly defy the definition of the article, and then you\u2019ll find yourself in an argument over what is \u2014 or isn\u2019t \u2014 canon Footnotes[1] World literature - Wikipedia[2] Southern United States literature - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "Literary canons are more like collection of works measured by others on the basis of literary skill and value. The western canon was revolted in the 80\u2019s by a group of people who claimed women had been excluded from its collection. These group of people advocated for the fact that several other authors, poets and playwrights whose works of literature were good enough had also been excluded from the western canon. Over the years the western canon has been revisited with various qualified authors, poets and playwrights given their place in the western canon. I will just give two examples of re-known canon\u2019s we have Shakespeare and Homer who wrote the odyssey. You can search out the rest. Cheers ",
