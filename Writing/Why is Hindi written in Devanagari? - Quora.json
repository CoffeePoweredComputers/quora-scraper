            "answer_text": "I\u2019m neither an expert in Hindi nor one in Devanagari or any other north Indian scripts, but I know to read ancient Tamil scripts as well as the Devanagari script. This is an A2A! If the question is why Hindi is written in Devanagari and not in Persian (or Arabic) script (like Urdu is) then I\u2019m not sure of the answer, all I can guess is that people here just preferred to keep it more akin to Sanskrit (which is written in Devanagari) rather than to Persian (like Urdu). However, if the question is about how Devanagari came in to existence, especially as a script for Hindi, then I think I have an answer for it: Almost all Indian scripts in present use have evolved from the age old Brahmi scripts. Scripts of north India have evolved from a version of Brahmi known as the Ashokan Brahmi, while the scripts of South India have evolved from the variant known as Tamil Brahmi or Tamizhi. The Brahmi itself must have been an evolution (or inspiration?) from the Aramaic and Karoshti scripts. Brahmi script is characterized by a lot of straight lines and right angles. It had very little curves. This aspect could still be seen in the Devanagari scripts. Devanagari evolved from the Gupta Nagari (a variant of the Nagari descendants of late Brahmi), which itself is an evolution from the Ashokan Brahmi. (The Brahmi scripts evolved in to Pallava grantham and Tamil vatteluthu in the south india, and there is also a Nagari variant, Nandinagari, found there. These have evolved in to the present scripts of the Dravidian languages) Sanskrit was written in Brahmi and Nagari scripts even from the oldest evidences available. So, Hindi, a descendant of Sanskrit and other languages which evolved from Sanskrit and its Apabramsha (spoken version), was also written in the Devanagari script. [The Pallava Grantham and Nandinagari scripts were used in south India to write Sanskrit. Vedic schools in south India still use the Grantham script to write Sanskrit texts here. The term \u2018grantham\u2019 literally means \u2018book\u2019] Extra: As noted above, the Brahmi and the Devanagari are characterized by straight lines. While the southern scripts are characterized by curves. (The term \u2018vatteluthu\u2019 literally means \u2018curvy script\u2019!) The reason might be this: North Indians prominently used cloth material (silk) and tree barks to write. They had a fine textured, smooth, strong medium to write. Whereas, south Indians mostly wrote in palm-leaves. The are not smooth and are also very fragile. These habits influenced the way they wrote the letters and led to their evolution. The medium of writing is the primary cause for evolution of these scripts from the parent one (Brahmi) Thank you! ",
