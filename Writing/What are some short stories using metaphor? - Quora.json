            "answer_text": "There\u2019s something magical about the beach at night. The sky above me is dark, darker than the cupboard under the stairs, darker than the depths of the evilest of souls. Almost pitch black. Almost. But not quite. I am barefoot, the black sand between my toes cool and damp. The sea breeze blows softly, blowing my hair out of my face, billowing my skirt out behind me as I run softly to the edge of the water. I don\u2019t have to wait long before I hear it. A sound that doesn\u2019t quite belong. Not that of the waves as they gently flirt with the sand, nor of the wind that softly whispers in my ears. A voice. \u201cI had a feeling you\u2019d be here again tonight, my child.\u201d The voice is deep yet soft, one that I\u2019ve come to know as soothing and calm, one that is almost as familiar to me as my own. My eyes instinctively dart towards the west, where I can just see the moon peeking over the horizon. Luna. I wait for her to rise a little higher in the night sky before I reply. \u201cYou know me too well, Luna.\u201d The moon laughs, and it\u2019s a glorious sound, delicate mirth that tinkles like fairy bells. \u201cCome, dear one, and tell me everything.\u201d There\u2019s a path of light now, a path that stretches across the dark expanse of the ocean. It glimmers silver with the thousands of hopes that have been discarded over the years, for even when hopes are left behind, they do not lose their light. I step out onto it, and the waves support my footsteps as if I am weightless. It certainly feels to me as if I am, for with every step I take down the path of light, I feel free and unencumbered. I want to run down it forever, to put as much distance as possible between myself and the world of worry, sorrow and regret. But I\u2019m in Luna\u2019s presence, and when she is close, I cannot dwell long on thoughts that make me unhappy. \u201cNow,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat is the matter?\u201d And so I tell her about every time I let the dark enter my soul. The fear that penetrates it. The hopelessness that weighs it down. The regret that eats away at it, until I barely feel alive anymore. \u201cBut what troubles me most of all,\u201d I whisper to the moon, \u201cis the darkness I see in the souls of those I love. I want to help them, but I don\u2019t know how.\u201d \u201cLittle one, don\u2019t despair,\u201d Luna tells me. \u201cNo matter how dark the situation, you can bring light to combat it.\u201d She gives me a slender, silver chain. Attached to it is a pendant: a pearl, a single, smooth sphere that seems to almost radiate light. \u201cTake this. It\u2019ll be your little light. Whenever you\u2019re feeling hopeless, look at it, and remember that there will always be light. And you, my child, you can bring light to the souls of others, as long as you never, ever lose hope.\u201d I won\u2019t, I promise her. I will never give up hope. Because no matter how dark the night sky, there will always be stars to provide light. Even if it\u2019s just a pinprick at a time. Light exists in its many forms, and all we need is to know where to find it. As I walk back to the world of reality, my fingertips dart to the pearl that is now nestled against my heart. It feels smooth and cool and steadfast, a reassuring presence. In the east, the sky is already beginning to glow. It\u2019s at this point that I realise the truth, a beautiful fact that lights me up from the inside: Darkness isn\u2019t permanent. ",

            "answer_text": "It was 6 in the morning. The newspaper distributor guy climbed stairs and reached to flat no L-101. He dropped the newspaper in the dropbox of L-101 and walked away. Within five minutes, an old man from the next door came, took the newspaper in his hand and locked himself in his flat which was L-103. The old man read whole newspaper and dropped it back to the dropbox of L-101 before 7 am. Raj, the owner of flat no. L-101 woke up and opened the door at 7.30 am. Further, he took newspaper in his hand and closed the door. The saga continued for long. The old man always took the newspaper and dropped it back before 7. One fine evening, on the ground floor, same old man found that his neighbor Raj was leaving the flat. He firmly wanted to have words with Raj, but couldn't make it. The next morning, the old man woke up. Following to his daily habit, he was about to go & grab newspaper from the dropbox of L-101. But, when he was about to open his door, he suddenly realized that the owner of L-101 shifted and was not living in the same place anymore. So, he didn't open the door and started walking back to his room. The very next moment, someone buzzed the doorbell of his home. He moved back towards the door, walked a few steps and opened the door. He didn't find anyone on the other side of the door. He opened the door and came out. When he was looking around, his eyes scanned the dropbox of L101 flat. There was a newspaper there. He moved towards the dropbox and took the newspaper out. While taking it out, a note slipped to floor from the newspaper. The old man picked up that note from the floor. The note had only five words with a smiley that read, \"The show must go on. :)\" The old man smiled reading it, took the newspaper with him and walked back to his flat. ",
