            "answer_text": "Dear Diary, I video-called Nani (grandma) today, and she looked in as much pain as mom had described. She was lying on the bed, barely able to hold the phone in her left hand while her right hand remained plastered and motionless. Not a hint of smile even though she seemed to try hard to bring it for me. It was heart-breaking to see her like that, especially when I have seen her smiling through all thick and thin times. I feel so unsure right now. Do I leave everything and be back with the people who matter the most? or should I stay and keep focussing on earning enough to take care of their treatment. It doesn\u2019t feel like an easy choice, from any perspective. Mom had reminded me time and again to not reveal it to her, so I didn\u2019t. She said it\u2019s best she doesn\u2019t get to know right now or else it will break her completely. Worse, it would break Nanaji (grandpa) as well. He has been quite brittle of late and I know he cares more about Nani\u2019s life than his own. He cries every now and then remembering how he lost his son, even though it\u2019s been a year already. One of the worst experience for any father would be to give a shoulder to their kid\u2019s dead body. Nani is almost 76, and one would argue she has lived long enough, but when someone matters so much to you, no age is enough. You\u2019d want them around you forever, no? But I understand she has been in pain, so much pain. At the same time, she has been the one keeping everyone together. She has been taking care of everyone in her 70s when all of us should have been taking care of her. She is one of the strongest women I have known, stronger than my own mother. And not just strong, but so active. Taking a taxi to travel between 2 states to attend important ceremonies at mid 70s is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. And she keeps doing it time and again. And talk about making friends - She made more friends while visiting us in Mumbai for a week than we made in 5 years. She even introduced us to our own neighbours. Even my ex keeps texting me to ask about her well-being. How she does everything with a smile still amuses me. And the irony of it all, that smile seem to have disappeared when she is running out of time. I had only heard of people having cancer, but never experienced anyone close being diagnosed for it. And so it came as a shock, especially being told that she is in her last stage. All I can think about is of all the times when I hugged her, while she pushed me away but I wouldn\u2019t let her go. How I used to keep giving wet kisses on her cheeks and she would be all irritated and slap me in the softest way possible and I\u2019d drop kisses on her all over again. Even thinking of those memories gives me so much warmth. She still has some time, or so the doctor says. And I am not ready to say good-bye yet. All of us still need her. There are so many kisses and hugs I have missed out on in these last 2 years. So many stories that I haven\u2019t heard from her. There is a lot to catch up on. I still have to show her how London is. Whenever I\u2019d mention it, there would a glow on her face as if she really wants to see a new country. I wish I can show her. Most importantly, what I want right now is for her to not be in pain. She has had enough of it during her lifetime. She deserves a break. ",

My daughters insist me everyday to dress up well even if it\u2019s just for dropping them to school. They themselves want to be in their best clothes and shiny sandals everyday reminding us that we call them princesses so they have to dress that way. So I wrote the below diary entry for them. I hope that when they grow up, they\u2019ll appreciate the wisdom and practicality in what I have written.     ",
