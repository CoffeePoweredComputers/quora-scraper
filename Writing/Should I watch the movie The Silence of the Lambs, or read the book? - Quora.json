            "answer_text": "I have to say both. The movie was a very good adaptation and Anthony Hopkins was steller. But the book is actually more suspenseful. As to which order...hmmm...I think I'll say movie first, then the book. Though I did them the other way around. That's just going to be a personal preference. Which irritates you more: knowing the story before seeing the movie or reading the book? ",

            "answer_text": "This is something I've thought about in general for movies and books and it's hard to decide.  I'm usually a bit disappointed in the movie after reading the book, but since I've rarely read a book after seeing a movie (I tend to be far more of a reader than a movier.) I'm not sure -- even for myself, much less everyone else! ",
