            "answer_text": "My best friend once said to me 'I pray we can be together in heaven just like we are together here on earth.\u2019 That was one of the sweetest things to have touched my heart.There was this one guy who made me feel special. There were male students walking in my direction including him. As he saw me entering through the door, he put his arm back as to stop the guys, so that I could pass through without feeling uncomfortable or even touched.I am used to guys gawking at me whenever I'm in public. My friends and I had just left a place of worship, and as we were about to turn corners, I made eye contact with a stranger. As soon as I met his eyes, he looked down as a means of respect. I don't know why but he made me feel valuable that day.In my college years, this guy had feelings for me. He couldn't express them to me but I could pick up the subtle signs he used to give me. He also used to look out for me. It was like in our entire year group, I was the only female he saw. It made me feel very special.There was another time when I was being mistreated by one of my teachers, he defended me behind my back. This wasn't the same guy as the one mentioned before this. He was supportive of me despite not knowing me well. My friends informed me of what was being said around the college. I respected him for that.Someone paid for my meal once at a local food shop. This didn't only make me feel special but it made me appreciate the good in people.I had a really tough time in my school days and this one teacher was the only person who often asked if I was okay. He was the only one that made me feel strong. The rest of the teachers saw me struggling and did nothing about it. Today, I know what type of teacher I want to be and it's all because of him.A child with visual impairment in my placement school hugged me tight and told me I was the best thing to have happened to her. I felt emotional but at the same time really touched.My mentor recommended me for an award. I didn't deserve it but winning that award made me feel special.",
