            "answer_text": "I want to share with you a list of the most popular technical writing tools. It\u2019s based on the G2 Crowd score that\u2019s formed by customer satisfaction. MadCap Flare  Whether you need to create technical documentation for online Help, software and API documentation, policy & procedure manuals, knowledge bases or user guides, MadCap Flare allows you to create, manage and publish content to a variety of formats, including print, online, desktop and mobile. ClickHelp  ClickHelp is a modern browser-based documentation tool to create online user manuals, as well as printed documents in various formats. It is provided as a cloud service, no installation needed\u200a\u2014\u200asign up and get your own online documentation portal.

This is combined with powerful features for editing documentation files, including full support for multimedia and complex modular projects. These are the most famous tools for technical writing. As for me, I use ClickHelp. Its interface is more understandable and user-friendly than Flare\u2019s, for example. ClickHelp uses HTML as a topic source format and gives you an opportunity to host your documentation on their server (as well as export to all popular formats and host somewhere else). It provides various single-sourcing features for content reuse and also allows working on multiple documentation projects in a single tool. Finally, it has nice workflow features for the entire team to collaborate on topic review, and they\u2019ve recently introduced a number of useful reports, some of them are not present in Flare. It\u2019s a powerful tool for me with 200+ features, although I don\u2019t use all of them but I know that ClickHelp can meet all of my demands if necessary. ",
