            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Some of the other answers here advise you to try doing your own work and I do wholeheartedly agree. Nonetheless, I will answer your question truthfully, with all of the consequences that follow.  Assignment writing services hire college graduates and students, often history and English majors, but the most important factor will be graded in classes with extensive writing. Hopefully, just as you are committing fraud in your class, those employees aren\u2019t committing fraud with altered transcripts\u2026 Next, of course, you have to submit the writing requirements for the employee to write about in your name. Here\u2019s the tricky part. If you decide to go this route you will always have to use this service and the same writer for the entirety of the course. Otherwise, you run the risk of having someone like me read your work. I have a great reading memory: I remember just about everything I\u2019ve ever read\u2014-not necessarily eidetic, but close\u2014and also am fairly decent at pattern recognition. I have caught many of my students doing this by simple recognition of small phrasing\u2019s and word choice. \u201cHmm, I\u2019ve seen that before\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s funny, they never used that phrasing before.\u201d Then I start my research. If you don\u2019t have the same voice, consistently and constantly, including in class discussions or in-class writing assignments, your work will become suspect to the observant instructor or teaching assistant. You may also have an instructor who wants to see drafts. Do not use an assignment writing device on a one-off unless you are fully confident that your instructor is incompetent or uncaring. The risk of being caught has a probability greater than 1. Of course, since these services cost money, you will be spending quite a bit to do it right. You need to complete a cost-benefit-risk analysis on following this path. Think it through very carefully, and do some math to figure out what it will cost. Look up instructor reviews and try to figure out if the instructor is very observant or not. Try and find previous students and talk with them. Hope that helps. ",

Perhaps it would be even less costly to just photo copy someone else\u2019s college diploma and photoshop your name onto it. However, in both cases you would be called a fraud. But if you want to have a real college degree with official transcript for an employer, it would be wiser to just do the assignments yourself. ",
