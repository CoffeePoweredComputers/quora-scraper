            "answer_text": "With the rise of corporate culture and Entrepreneurship, more students are now opting for management studies in prestigious B-schools. Also, there is no lack of institutes and universities offering postgraduate and Master\u2019s programs in management. In fact, almost all management institutes in abroad offering a wide range of courses all under the same academic scale. However, Indian students often find themselves confused with the choice of two such courses, namely MBA and PGDM. In Canada, PGDM and an MBA are quite different. PGDM is a 2-year diploma program, while MBA is a full-fledged degree. In terms of the academic value of a Canadian PGDM, it will be low compared to Canadian MBA programs. The average Mba salary in Canada is $72,558 per year . Entry-level positions start at $27,121 per year while most experienced workers make up to $102,338 per year. Although there are similarities between the curriculum of both, differences exist as well. A student pursuing MBA will be studying more of the theoretical aspects of management. An MBA institute will be following a fixed curriculum as it will be based on the university guidelines. A student enrolled in PGDM course will be gaining knowledge regarding soft skills and the programme is more industry-oriented. A non-deemed institute does not have to follow university standards, so it is free to change its academic curriculum according to industry standards and subsequently change in the business environment. The programme will prepare you for a senior-level position in an organisation.
