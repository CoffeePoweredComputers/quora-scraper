            "answer_text": "Discourage is what's commonly used. You can use discourage in regard to yourself or to others. You can say, \u201cI was discouraged\u201d, or if talking to another person, \u201cI don't want to discourage you\u2026\u201d Disencourage sounds more like a word you would use in regard to other people though. However I've never heard this word used often, and never heard anyone say it really. e.g. \u201cI don't want to disencourage you\u201d, this would not sound natural imo. I would just stick with \u201cdiscourage\u201d. ",
