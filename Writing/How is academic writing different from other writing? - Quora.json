            "answer_text": "Short Answer Academic writing is generally filled with pompous, self-serving crap intended to make the writer look brilliant. Other writing is fun. Longer Answer In terms of readability, academic writing is generally dense to the point of impenetrability. It\u2019s filled with jargon, technical phrases and complex sentences. Sometimes I think academic writers take great pains to make their writing as inaccessible as possible. Keep in mind that all academic writing is done to advance one\u2019s career. The student writes academic papers to get grades and a degree. The graduate writes to be published and advance their career. Hence the phrase \u201cpublish or die.\u201d All writing is influenced by the bias of the author. Academic writing is also influenced by the bias of instructors and reigning experts. As an example, a friend was studying children\u2019s literature. One story they studied was Little Red Riding Hood, and the instructor insisted the red hood represented the child\u2019s promiscuity. My friend wrote a paper that simply ignored this assertion and put forward her own views. The instructor rejected the paper and insisted it be rewritten to include the promiscuity perspective. Outside the classroom, consider what happens when someone writes a book like Freakonomics. It received a lot of negative reviews from experts and pundits because it put forward unpopular ideas. You can read Al Siebert\u2019s story in \u201cWarning: Psychiatry can be hazardous to your mental health.\u201d Chapter 13 relates how he, as a psychiatric fellow at the Menninger Foundation, started to question the legitimacy of standard psychiatric thinking. Challenging the establishment go Al committed. Fortunately, he was able to rescue himself and has gone on to help a lot of people recover from psychiatric meddling. Academic writing is, in general, bunk. But don\u2019t tell that to the people who write it. They have invested a lot of time and energy into persuading themselves they\u2019re doing a high and mighty thing with their writing. ",

            "answer_text": "There isn\u2019t just one kind of academic writing. Requirements differ from one discipline to the next. Some disciplines will tell you never to use the word \u201cI\u201d, while others will insist on hearing the author\u2019s authentic voice. But there are a few common features: Never use short, clear words when elaborate Latinate obfuscations will do.Obscure French and German words work well too. They expose the differance of your Weltanschauung.Forget everything you\u2019ve been taught about short sentences. Short sentences are for literary Hemingway wannabes. Academics know how to make a sentence sprawl across an entire paragraph, with subordinate clauses hanging off them like pearls of wisdom, until the collection of mixed metaphors make the reader beg for mercy.Never use the words \u201call\u201d, \u201cnone\u201d, \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d. Always hedge your bets.An old Southern preacher once described his preaching style. \u201cFirst I tells \u2019em what I\u2019m gonna tell \u2018em. Then I tells \u2018em. Then l tells \u2019em what I just done told \u2018em!\u201d In academic writing this is known as the Introduction, the body of the article, and the Conclusion.Reference everything. You might think that \u201cthe sky is blue\u201d is a self-evident fact that needs no reference. The peer reviewers will disagree.Don\u2019t use the currently fashionable theory. Try to figure out what the theory of the day will be a year from now when your article actually appears in print. Just see what the French are doing: it will hit the Anglo-Saxon world a year later.Learn British spelling with ligatures. The journal editor will change it back, but it looks very learned. Also, print everything in Baskerville.Always, always end your article by calling for more research.Take everything above with a grain of salt. Except the part about calling for more research.",
