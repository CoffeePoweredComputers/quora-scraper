            "answer_text": "A: Finding your own voice comes with time. Most creatives start out copying their heroes (so I advise you to try and write like Miller crossed with Bukowski, and probably that's what will happen anyway for a start, we all emulate our `inspirations'). But over time your own voice will come through and emerge. In music (not prose) Bruce Springsteen said he started out trying to copy (ie wanting to be, and sound, like) the Rolling Stones but over time his own thing came through. You can see his influences, including Stones but `Woody Guthrie meets Elvis' and whatnot. Yet he has a pretty strong voice (ie - individual style) in the songs he writes and how he performs them. So, you don't need to try and find your voice, you just need to start writing LOADS and after a while your own voice will `be there'.Maybe try writing lots of short stories in different styles, like Deb says below. ie If you commit to a long form, like say a novel, it's hard to change the style without seeming inconsistent to a reader - or even yourself, LOL (well, unless you do a James Joyce - with Ulysses, and write each chapter in a purposely-different style/format, more or less.) But, so, if you read `Creativity' by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1996) he talks about a lot of this stuff, he studied nearly 100 eminent creatives including writers - and you'll see basically expressed (in interviews and whatnot) - a whole lot better than I have here - that: you just start writing, and, importantly, dont be critical of your early crummy work (switch off your `vicious editor' and just write and write and write), and keep writing and improving on whatever you have done before... ie Each new project is better in some way/s. Sooner or later - after a while - you realize that you are now `writing like yourself, and nobody else'. - It's a function of time. Stick at it. And - make sure it's fun! ie If you're not enjoying it on some or a lot of levels, try doing it differently. But yeh maybe read Creativity by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, there is priceless info in there on all this. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! Voice can be used in many different ways in fiction (and non-fiction too, of course), but ultimately it's about deciding what you want to express and how you want to express it. It is -- or it can be -- a lot more than just the way you yourself happen to think, your own inner narrative, or the words you tend to use a lot.  Let's start with an oft-cited example. Catcher in the Rye makes brilliant use of an individual narrative voice that jumps out at you from the first line:  If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you\u2019ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don\u2019t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. The voice both pulls you in and repels you; you might sense that the narrator is spoiled, sullen, defensive; he has a certain level of education (he's read Dickens), and yet he uses careless slang (\"crap,\" \"lousy\"). In just a few words, you get a sense that you've known this character for a long time, and you do feel that you \"really want to hear about it.\" The opening lines set an intimate tone that pulls the reader into the story.  By contrast, The Bridge of San Luis Rey by Thornton Wilder opens like this:  On Friday noon, July the twentieth, 1714, the finest bridge in all Peru broke and precipitated five travellers into the gulf below. This bridge was on the high-road, between Lima and Cuzco and hundreds of persons passed over it every day. It had been woven of osier by the Incas more than a century before and visitors to the city were always led out to see it. It was a mere ladder of thin slats swung out over the gorge, with handrails of dried vine. Horses and coaches and chairs had to go down hundreds of feet below and pass over the narrow torrent on rafts, but no one, not even the Viceroy, not even the Archbishop of Lima, had descended with the baggage rather than cross by the famous bridge of San Luis Rey. St. Louis of France himself protected it, by his name and by the little mud church on the further side. The bridge seemed to be among the things that last forever; it was unthinkable that it should break. The moment a Peruvian heard of the accident he signed himself and made a mental calculation as to how recently he had crossed by it and how soon he had intended crossing by it again. People wandered about in a trance-like state, muttering; they had the hallucination of seeing themselves falling into a gulf.  This passage is a less obvious example, but it is a sophisticated and deliberate use of voice just the same. In the edition of this book that I have, there's an afterword that quotes Wilder's first draft of these opening pages (I can't quote it, 'cause I lent the book to my Dad!). But take my word for it: if you compare the two drafts you find that Wilder worked very hard to attain the lofty, timeless, distant and omniscient voice he uses here, and it's definitely not the voice of an intimate friend sitting on your dorm room bed and sullenly trying to explain about that time he got kicked out of prep school, like the one Salinger created in Catcher in the Rye.  Rather, from the very first lines of the book, Wilder wants to show that this is nothing less than a parable about the meaning of life and death. To demonstrate that he is up to such an ambitious task, he chooses words that situate the narrator far above the flow of events, like an all-seeing eye. His language is ornate (descriptors like \"woven of osier by the Incas,\") worldly (the mention of the Archbishop of Lima and the Viceroy) and formal (\"precipitated\" rather than \"fell,\" \"persons\" rather than \"men and women\" or \"people.\"). This narrator seems to know all, from the history of the bridge going back a centuries to the reaction of a typical citizen of Lima in the days immediately following the calamity.  Each of these books would be much poorer without their careful attention to voice. Let's look at one more example if you're not tired of this already: Rum Punch, by Elmore Leonard.   The house where Louis was staying, down in the south end of West Palm, might've been somebody's dream thirty years ago. Now it belonged to a guy named J.J. who had gotten his release the same time Louis did and offered to let him stay if he wanted. J.J. had lasted less than a month on the street and was back in for conspiring to traffic. So Louis had the house to himself -- still a mess from when the police banged in and tossed it. He'd replaced the front door with one he'd pried off an abandoned house and put J.J.'s clothes back in the drawers they'd dumped on the floor and cleaned up the kitchen, coffee, sugar, Rice Krispies all over the place. Louis hadn't been home at the time of the raid and was lucky the cops didn't know he was living here, or he'd be up at Gun Club with J.J. waiting on an arraignment. There was no way Max Cherry would have bonded him out.  A significant part of Elmore Leonard's voice is that the reader needs to buy that this is a narrator who knows this kind of life. Rum Punch, better known as the book that inspired the film Jackie Brown, concerns a sexy flight attendant who teams up with a bail bondsman to outwit both an arms dealer and some unscrupulous DEA agents, and the reader needs a credible guide to the underworld of the drug trade. Have I ever lived in the mean streets of West Palm Beach? Do I know if people really say \"tossed it\" for when the police search a house, or if \"conspiring to traffic\" is a real charge? Goodness no -- I'm a Mom who lives in Connecticut. But when I read Elmore Leonard I feel like I know, because Leonard speaks of that world with authority. He uses quick, colloquial language that flows just right, and that gives the narrative an immediate ring of credibility.  These are just the first three examples I thought of! Voice is everywhere once you start to read for it (although not all writers have it or know how to use it). As for building your own, here are some ideas that can help: -Analyze every writer's voice. Ask yourself what the author is trying to do and how they're trying to make the reader feel, what experience they're trying to convey. Voice can be funny, intimate, menacing, streetwise, lofty, academic, humorless, absurd.  -Don't copy other writers' voices. Instead, pick other voices apart. Get obsessive about first lines, last lines, and lines that give you chills or draw you in. Copy them down in a notebook. Look at the word choice, the word order, the rhythm of the language. See if you can reproduce favorite lines from memory.  -Make lists of your favorite words. Run your stories through that word-cloud software to see which words you use a lot. Watch for words you overuse, and look out for great new words that you want to use more.  -Write a lot and listen to the feedback you get -- from writer friends, from critique groups, from rejecting editors. Often a line or two even in a rejection note can tell you a lot about what people think you're trying to do, and that can give you a sense of how well you're succeeding at what you really want to do.  -When you get a sense of what you do well (humor? menace? fairy-tale wonder? whatever), get better at it. Think about what you like to feel when you read. Make your readers feel that.  Hope this was helpful! I had fun writing it. I thought of about ten more examples of \"voice\" just before I hit the Submit button :) ",
