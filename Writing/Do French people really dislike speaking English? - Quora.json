            "answer_text": "Speaking from my experience a few years ago on a cruise - one of the ports was Martinique (a French colony). We were docked for 24 hours. My wife and I as did other tourists - went sight seeing\u2026everywhere we went, we were greeted for service but once we spoke, the attitude changed from outright rudeness, or walking away from us or just ignoring us. We\u2019re talkng cafe\u2019s, restaurants, shops, etc. We sat in one restaurant for an hour and half waiting on service\u2026finally went to the cashier to ask for help getting service, she went to the back, came back with a man who spoke a little English and he flat out told us\u2026no service\u2026go somewhere else. We ran into other tourists from our ship who were experiening the same. So we all bonded and stayed together. We finally saw a fellow American couple from the ship, with shopping bags, heading into a cafe we\u2019d been refused service. We told them our experience and they invited us to join them at their table. So now, there\u2019s about 12 of us at this table - I just KNEW they would refuse us again. The couple went up to the cashier, said something in French.. next thing we know, a waiter appeared outta nowhere. Smiling. Our French-speaking friends helped us order. The food was ohhhh so good. We were tempted to lick our fingers LOL. BOTTOM LINE: During the course of conversation with our American French-speaking friends reminded us that Martinique is a French colony\u2026and that French was originally the worldwide, universal language but once English became the universal language\u2026out of resentment, many of them REFUSE to speak English.

The woman at the counter went to great trouble to talk to us in English even though it was obvious we spoke French. She was taking an opportunity to practise. People seem to do this a lot. ",
