            "answer_text": "Darkness at Noon by Arthur KoestlerGletkin's personality had gained such power over him that even histriumphs were turned into defeats. Massive and expressionless, he sat there, the brutal embodiment of the State which owed its very existence to the Rubashovs and Ivanovs. Flesh of their flesh, grown independent and become insensible. Had not Gletkin acknowledged himself to be the spiritual heir of Ivanov and the old intelligentsia? Rubashov repeated to himself for the hundredth time that Gletkin and the new Neanderthalers were merely completing the work of the generation with the numbered heads. That the same doctrine became so inhuman in their mouths, had, as it were, merely climatic reasons. When Ivanov had used the same arguments, there was yet an undertone in his voice left by the past, by the remembrance of the world which had finished. One can deny one's childhood, but not erase it.  Ivanov had trailed his past after him to the end; that was what gave everything he said an undertone of frivolous melancholy; that was why Gletkin called him a cynic. The Gletkins had nothing to erase; they need not deny their past, because they had none. They were born without umbilical cord, without frivolity, without melancholy.Catch-22 by Joseph HellerThere was only one catch and that was Catch-22, that specifiedthat a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane, he had to fly them.Life, the Universe and Everything by Douglas AdamsThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the subject of flying.There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying.The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead by Tom StoppardA Chinaman of the T'ang Dynasty - and, by which definition, a philosopher - dreamed he was a butterfly, and from that moment he was never quite sure that he was not a butterfly dreaming it was a Chinese philosopher. Envy him, in his two-fold security.To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper LeeI wanted you to see something about her- I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It's when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia MarquezTaciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude.The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint ExuperyTo me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world.The Code of the Woosters by P.G. Wodehouse I was astounded at my keenness of perception. The moment I had set eyes on Spode, if you remember, I had said to myself \"What ho! ADictator!\" and a Dictator he had proved to be. I couldn't have made a better shot, if I had been one of those detectives who see a chap walking along the street and deduce that he is a retired manufacturer of poppet valves named Robinson with rheumatism in one arm, living at Clapham.Slaughterhouse-5 by Kurt Vonnegut    The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel.In it, Jesus really was a nobody, and a pain in the neck to a lot ofpeople with better connections than he had.  He still got to say all thelovely and puzzling things he said in the other Gospels.    So the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the ground. There couldn't possibly be any repercussions, the lynchers thought. The reader would have to think that, too, since the new Gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody Jesus was.     And then, just before the nobody died, the heavens opened up, andthere was thunder and lightning. The voice of God came crashing down. He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son giving him the full powers and privileges of The Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity. God said this: From this moment on, He will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections!A Mathematician's Apology by G. H. HardyThe proof is by reductio ad absurdum, and reductio ad absurdum,which Euclid loved so much, is one of a mathematician's finest weapons. It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.",
