            "answer_text": "Clarify the goals of the review. A few hundred words have to make the case plain. Is it correspondence, summary, endnote, literature review, peer review, literary criticism, philosophical, or systematic analysis? This determines whether it will be spontaneous or formal. Academic papers are objective. They fit a genre. Read the paper for composition as well as facts. What are the stated problem and recommendations? How good are the data and sources? What are the takeaways? Any reaction? Touch on the text. Hint at a much wider answer. See: \"They Say / I Say\": The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing, Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, 2006 ",

            "answer_text": "The first point is the term research paper causes considerable confusion in UK, Australia, NZ and Europe compared to Nth America. In Nth America it is used as a general term for almost anything published or unpublished. In UK, Australia and NZ and in Europe \u201cResearch paper\u201d is sometimes mistaken for a published paper and when they find out otherwise they are pissed off. For a serious publication (a published paper) you can make use of the abstract and add something about the materials and methods and techniques they used. That will make a page easily. ",
