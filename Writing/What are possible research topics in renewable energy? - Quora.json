            "answer_text": "Research that shows a path to 95% renewables that is cheaper than today\u2019s monopoly grid energy. There are too many misconceptions about how to move from dirty energy to clean. PV solar energy for both homes and vehicles is coming very soon and the public has been misinformed by various interests with massive sunk investment. Research that explains the transition phase would be very helpful. Homes will have their own conversion from the sun\u2019s energy and be fully off grid. The monopoly grid players will fight the loss of this control to the end. Explaining how to divest from the grid would be a good topic for these rich people. ",
