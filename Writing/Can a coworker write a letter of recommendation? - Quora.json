            "answer_text": "That depends on what the person wanted when they asked for a letter from you. Generally, a letter of recommendation is sent when someone is applying for a job or for college or graduate school. These letters are supposed to \u201csell you\u201d to whom the letter is sent and should come from someone who has been in a supervisory position over you - a former boss, professor, etc. - so that this person can speak to your character, strengths, etc. Sometimes, however, the company may ask for a letter from one of your peers (coworkers) because they want to find out how others see you and relate to you on an equal basis and not as someone who has to grade or evaluate you. I would not ask a coworker for a letter unless the company specifically asked for such a letter. Someone who has been in a position to evaluate you will be able to write the kind of letter that you really need. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. Anybody can write a letter for you, but it\u2019s up to the recipient as to how that person\u2019s information is weighted. A co-worker certainly has more insight as to your ability to do a job than your neighbor or your family friend. They can also respond about how you are to work with. If your manager isn\u2019t writing a letter or is not listed as a contact on your application, be prepared to explain\u2026it\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Be sure to follow the company\u2019s suggested guidelines for providing references. Some want people you\u2019ve worked with. Others want managers. Still others want more personal references. ",
