            "answer_text": "A2A.  No, the UK no longer has freedom of speech.  Paul Mainwood lists in his answer many of the types of restrictions that government may now impose on speech in the UK.  I would like to supplement this by providing some examples of actual, recent cases in which disfavored speech was subject to criminal investigation and/or prosecution: An atheist was convicted for placing sexually explicit images of religious figures in the Liverpool Airport prayer room. Atheist guilty over cartoons left at Liverpool airportFive Muslim men were tried in Derby for distributing anti-gay leaflets. The Crime of LeafletingA student was sentenced to jail time for posting racist comments on twitter while drunk. British Freedom of Speech EndangeredA Scottish TV personality was subject to criminal investigation for on-air remarks during the Ebola crisis. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-30641705A college diversity officer (oh, the irony!) was prosecuted for anti-white comments.  Silly English Woman Is Being Charged for Tweeting Rude ThingsA reality TV star (whatever that is) was convicted for advocating the killing of children born with Down Syndrome.  Tv star who said anyone with Down's Syndrome should be 'put down' faces jailA singer was arrested for performing \"Kung Fu Fighting\" at a beach bar on the Isle of Wight.  Man arrested for singing 'Kung Fu Fighting'These criminal enforcement actions cannot be redeemed by saying that they involved speech that is \"offensive.\"  The whole point of \"free speech\" is that it protects expression that the majority of people disagree with or find offensive.  There is rarely any demand for banning inoffensive speech. Which gets us to a second problem:  Who defines what is \"offensive\"?  In an age that is characterized by \"trigger warnings\" and \"safe spaces,\" almost everything is at risk of offending someone with a sufficiently thin skin.  The \"Kung Fu Fighting\" case illustrates this perfectly (well, perhaps the song offends against musical good taste, but that's a different issue!). It is the situation in the UK, then, that almost anything you say could cause you to be subject to a criminal investigation, prosecution, and possible imprisonment, as long as someone, somewhere decides to be offended by it.  It does not matter that most people can get away with offensive remarks without being hauled into court; as long as some people are investigated or charged (and these actions are made public), then everyone will be moved to self-censor to some extent.  As further reports of criminal investigations and prosecutions surface, this \"chilling effect\" becomes increasingly acute. Neither does it matter that in many of these investigations the defendant is never charged or, if charged, is not convicted.  For most law-abiding people, the stress and expense of defending against criminal charges, as well as the damage to reputation and career, will be punishment enough.  In short, to suppress free speech, the sacrifice of just a few Muslim leafleters or drunken twitterers will suffice pour encourager les autres. The UK no longer has freedom of speech.  Some other posters have contrasted the current speech regime in the UK with that in the US, where freedom of speech is protected by the First Amendment.  It is important to recall that when the American colonists rebelled against Great Britain, they were motivated by what they saw as the suppression by a tyrannical government of their ancient rights and liberties as Britons.  Foremost among these were freedom of speech and religion.  In the debates surrounding the adoption of the constitution, advocates both pro- and anti- appealed to the authority of British free speech traditions and thinkers such as John Wilkes and John Stuart Mill.  The so-called anti-federalists were concerned that the proposed constitution did not go far enough to protect the people's traditional British rights.  It was to mollify such objections that the  first amendment to the constitution expressly protected the freedoms of speech, religion, association, and the right to assemble peaceably. The modern concept of free speech originated in Great Britain. It was exported to the colonies, whence it spread (however imperfectly) to other parts of the world.  It should be a cause for universal concern that free speech is now being strangled in the land that once was its cradle. ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of interesting and helpful answers here, as well as some rather rigid answers. I\u2019d like to make a few side comments. Like many questions, this should probably be transformed from an absolute question (\u201cis there \u2026 \u201c) to a more specific \u201cin what ways and what extent is there \u2026.\u201d. When (as do many answers) you get to a US-UK comparison, then I think the \u201cin what ways and to what extent\u201d formulation is very helpful. When comparing the US and the UK, most see the US as having more freedom of speech *from governmental interference* \u2014 in the US, the First Amendment is taken rather seriously (despite the numerous exceptions). But, it seems to me important to see that in the UK there is much more extensive freedom of speech *from non-governmental interference*. Look at the US, and take two easy examples: Kapernick exercised his freedom of speech, and no governmental agency arrested him, because what he did was legal; but the social and public opinion weapons were dispatched on him with great force. The other, which I think I got either from Quora or the Washington Post, is that a woman riding a bicycle gave the Trump limo procession the finger. No governmental arrest, of course; but her boss did not like it and fired her. To me, both are instances of the limits of free speech in the US. Many answers on the thread have other examples: Quorans on the right (I presume, perhaps not accurately) object to university speakers being shouted down by students, who are using social pressures to limit freedom of speech. One way to try to resolve disagreements on this issue \u2014 or to see how they are disagreements at yet another, perhaps more basic, issue \u2014 is to ask, why is free speech important? Just about everyone will agree (I hope) that it is important to be able to criticize the government and to be able to tell one\u2019s version of events: free speech is central to criticizing the government and establishing truths. But what about the exercise of free speech that demeans others. Many US First Amendment types (maybe \u2018absolutists\u2019) will say that we cannot have government interference in speech at all (or almost at all). Many UK types will say that government interference is necessary against demeaning (and worse) speech, because that speech is not used to criticize the powerful / the government nor to seek truth, but rather as an exercise of verbal power against a (usually) weaker enemy; it is speech as a weapon. (You could reverse the above: why are some US First Amendment absolutists so willing to use free speech as a weapon, as power, and to do so without regard for other, non-free-speech values, and why are some UK etc., who are concerned about hate speech, why are they concerned about that.) What I\u2019d like to see (and what a few answers do explore) is how to think about the differences between those two stances. If you had a different mind-set from me, you could think about the question in cost-benefit terms: what are the costs, what are the benefits, of each stance. (You could also add, who bears the costs, who gains the benefits.) ",

            "answer_text": "This has been comprehensively answered already. I would only add that we in the USA are heading down the same path as the UK. Conservatives are routinely attacked in public places like restaurants, or asked/told to leave by the management, and if they don\u2019t are subject to a mob screaming hate at, and sometimes throwing water at them. If someone with a right-wing philosophy, irrespective of his or her credentials, is invited to speak at a university by its conservative club, in many cases the faculty cancels the invitation at the last minute \u201cfor safety.\u201d They don\u2019t remind students that the word \u201cuniversity\u201d means a marketplace of ideas and opinions, that \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d means not only speech with which you agree but also that to which you are adamantly opposed, or warn students that if they prevent the invitee from speaking by drowning him/her out with bullhorns or organized shouting, they will be removed from the auditorium. Instead, they do nothing when those things actually happen, including throwing stuff at the speaker. Worse, as we saw last year in U. Cal. Berkeley (ironically, called \u201cthe birthplace of freedom of speech\u201d) and others, when a conservative was invited to speak rioting mobs destroyed property, burned cars and committed arson, while the cops were told to stand down and not intervene. Another ominous sign is the designation of \u201chate crimes.\u201d You get mugged. The robber says: \"It's nothing personal I just want your money.\" Do you feel better that you weren't the victim of a hate crime? Does your head hurt less, your wallet feel less empty? Do you say, \"That's OK then, no hard feelings\"? Now what if the robber adds: \"Take that, you [epithet denigrating your race, religion, sexual orientation. ethnicity, or whatever designation may be added in the future],\" which thus qualifies this as a hate crime. Are your injury and financial loss suddenly greater? The laws of almost every state say yes. In my home state, our legislators enacted a law in 1982 stating: \"Pennsylvania considers certain crimes to be more serious when motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of another individual or group of individuals.\" So, to its eternal shame, does the Supreme Court of the United States. You may say: \"And quite right, too,\" but I have a lot of problems with this. First, ,isn't every violent crime a hate crime? Second, and most seriously, the states say, and the U.S. Supreme Court concurs, that a judge can increase a penalty because of what was on the perpetrator's mind at the time of the offense. For a crime of violence, the penalty might be, for example, five years imprisonment. But if it was determined that the perpetrator was motivated by hatred of some group on the designated list, the judge may add, say, three years to his sentence, Essentially the perpetrator will be serving three years for his thoughts and opinions, which are supposed to be protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution, a key freedom differentiating us from totalitarian states such as China, Cuba and North Korea. George Orwell warned us of this in his novel 1984, where the state tapped into people's minds and determined whether they were committing \"thought crimes.\" The founding fathers gave us the right to shout from the rooftops, or publish in any media, your dislike, even hatred, of certain people or groups of people, so long as you did not incite others to commit crimes as a result. They  held that the answer to hate speech was not repression, but more speech. Now, for the sake of political correctness, our lawmakers have said \"phooey\" to the First Amendment, And only certain Politically-Correct groups are admitted to the club of potential hate-crime victims. If your robber had said: \"Take that, you lousy sheet-metal worker,\" \"accountant,\" or even (how did these slip through?) \"lawyer,' or \"politician,\" he has committed no hate crime, despite his lifelong bitter hatred of accountants, etc. This legislation leads to all kinds of absurdities. Absent a verbal epithet, did a black thief target a middle-class white person (1) because of his race, or (2) because experience has taught him that a victim of this socioeconomic group will provide richer pickings? The former would be a hate crime; the latter would not. And what if, because of my Irish name, a mugger opened my wallet, looked at my driver\u2019s license and said, \"I hate you Papists\"? Would the fact that I am an agnostic make it a hate crime or not? Finally, political correctness, and the fear of being labeled a racist, homophobe, religious bigot, etc., have resulted in a public perception and media bias in favor of certain groups and against others. In 1998, when Matthew Shepard, a gay student, was robbed and killed, it was labeled a hate crime due to his sexual orientation. However, when to-year-old Jeffrey Curley was raped and killed by two homosexual men in 1997, this was not labeled a hate crime. When James Byrd, a black man, was dragged to his death by white men in Texas, this was called a hate crime, but when Colin Ferguson, a black man, shot and killed six white Long Island Railroad passengers and wounded 19 others in 1993, it was not classified as a hate crime, despite Ferguson's long history of antiwhite rants. Even the death of 3,000 innocent people at the hands of anti-American, anti-Judeo-Christian radical lslamics on Sept. 11, 2001, is not called a hate crime. Congress recently considered an amendment extending hate-crime legislation to federal law. Sen. Rick Santorum (Republican, Pa.) was one of the few with the courage to vote no, explaining that he believed \"the federal government should not create separate classes of crimes for the same criminal actions, with the only  distinguishing characteristic being the thoughts of the perpetrator.\" ",

Many celebrities have been No Platformed by immature university students who don\u2019t want to hear a point of view they don\u2019t agree with and, worse, want to prevent third parties from hearing. In our so called free country you can be charged with a \"hate crime\" if someone feels offended by your words even if you didn\u2019t intend to cause offence or haven't broken the law. The country is riddled with Anti Free Speech Fascists who have developed tactics \u2013 amounting to verbal violence \u2013 to silence and control anyone who disagrees with them. They yell racist, sexist, homophobe or some similar noun/adjective whenever they hear an opposing point of view... and, for them and their ilk, this spells the end of the argument. Their opponents are now dismissed as the lowest of the low and not worthy of further attention. This attack on personal expression has inevitably gone further than just dumbing speech. It has spread to become an assault on our very culture. Activities that have been regarded as normal for years, maybe centuries, now offend the AFSF brigade. For example Morris dancers have been attacked for blacking their faces, Maypole revellers hounded from their venues, a butcher condemned for hanging dead game in his shop and a market vendor banned from shouting his wares, all as the result of a solitary complaint by some gormless offendee. The list is endless... to the point where devout Christians daren\u2019t openly quote passages from the Bible. Even English humour has been kicked into touch. Many comedians will no longer gig at universities. The old, innocent but Mickey taking gags, that we laughed at in the school playground could now land you in the dock. I dread to think what would happen to someone who came up with a Christian, Muslim and Jew joke but the setting has endless hilarious possibilities. Free speech? Long gone! Oh... and for God\u2019s sake don\u2019t mention the Empire ",

Allowing insults as \u2018free speech\u2019 would be the end of libel and a sort of verbal anarchy would develop which would soon be converted to the physical. DNA has clearly demonstrated that the traditional definitions of race are rubbish. Whoever you are you are a member of the human race. Similarly science has clearly demonstrated that sexuality is a natural phenomena and not some sick deviance. Which leaves two main areas that are not natural, culture and religion, and generally the two get mixed together through ignorance or the desire to exploit a situation. All the complaints seem to be towards how a free society should recognise such differences, and it is a situation continually in flux. With ignorance many written and verbal situations we're tolerated. That these are no longer being tolerated is often put as political correctness and the erosion of freedom of speech. Plenty of people can get their point across without the need for insults and libel, and they generally do a better job. Truth is never an insult or a libel. Lies, fake news and the like is often a libel or an insult. Freedom of speech is not the freedom to lie at will. ",

The UK did incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into law in 1998, and this guarantees the Freedom of Expression.  But there are a large number of exceptions.   This is a non-exhaustive list: Threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour intending or to cause harrassment, alarm or distress or cause a breach of the peaceIncitement to racial hatredIncitement to religious hatredIncitement to terrorism (plus a lot of not-very-well defined stuff about distributing or owning materials likely to be of use to a terrorist)Treason (this includes advocating the abolition of the monarchy, though the Law Lords have \"stated the bleeding obvious\" when they opined that this has not been enforceable for many years)Defamation (this has a high burden of proof on the defendent, and leads to a worrying number of people coming to the UK to prosecute libel cases)Indecency including the corruption of public morals (again, good luck trying to enforce this one)Many restrictions on reporting court casesTime, manner and place restrictionsPrior restraintClassified materialsIn everyday practice, the UK has wound up with similar restrictions to most Western democracies.  The glaring exception is the libel laws -- they are much stricter than most. ",

            "answer_text": "Jane Fletcher gave an excellent answer in March of 2018. She distinguished, as I would, the freedom of speech to criticize the government and indeed any active politician, the freedom of speech (the press, as it was traditionally called) to allow for the dissemination of news, and the freedom of speech (much more ambiguous) to criticize and demean others. I think that she is on to something that self-satisfied \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 Americans should think about. What to me is especially important about free speech is that you be allowed to criticize the government. Here the UK allows extensive freedom of speech. Where the disagreement between US absolutists and UK free speech comes up is in two or three places. In the US, if you protest and your employer disagrees with your protest, you can find yourself without a job \u2014 look as Kapernick and the NFL (and Trump, fanning, indeed setting, the flames). That does not happen in the UKIn the US, if you try to exercise free speech against powerful private interests \u2014 I have agribusiness in mind \u2014 you may find yourself having broken state laws, and jailed. Do not try filming what goes on in factory farms in many US states; it is illegal.In the UK, if you use your speech as an exercise of power \u2014 by insulting or demeaning others who are less powerful than you \u2014 you are not free; in the US, you can exercise free speech to demean, slur, or otherwise insult others, or as a provocation (with no further end or goal). That may make the US \u2018free-er\u2019 in speech than the UK, but it does not mean, I think, that the US practice more fully satisfies the goals of free speech as discussion and debate.",

            "answer_text": "Insofar as any country does, yes. It generally does pretty well on both personal freedom and press freedom indexes (better than the US, but not as good as Scandinavia). Limitations exist around obscene images (child pornography, including drawings but not including written erotica), scandalous and libellous content, speech intended to incite hatred, classified information, information subject to a court ordered injunction, terrorist material etc. One of the myths about UK laws on hate speech is that it makes it illegal to insult or offend someone, or a group. It is not, you can talk all you want about how you hate the Jews, gays etc. You actually have to intend harm or distress, for example this is in the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006: Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system. So insult, abuse and ridicule whoever you want. It\u2019s actually, unusually, specifically allowed. There are a few quirks, such as the now infamous \u2018Nazi pug\u2019 case where, because it was published on the Internet, it is subject to restrictions that wouldn\u2019t exist if it were performed in public, in a newspaper, book or broadcast on tv. This situation is probably not ideal. Historically there has never been a positive right to freedom of speech, because everything is legal unless it is made illegal in English law so the need isn\u2019t immediately obvious. These days the Human Rights Act and ECHR give a constitutional guarantee - however they themselves have many exemptions. ",

            "answer_text": "The asker (and answers) seem to be wanting to compare and contrast freedom of speech between the USA and UK and I shall try to answer in that vein. In addition to the very excellent answers here I think there are a couple of important points. Rights in the UK are, on the whole, implicit rather than explicit. Rather than declaring \u201cYou have the right to do XX\u201d it\u2019s assumed that you do, unless there is a specific reason to stop it. A good friend of mine, who is a celebrated lawyer, describes it that \u201cAmerica has rights, England has prohibitions\u201d. Instinctively it might feel that explicit declaration of rights is better, but it ain\u2019t necessarily so. Rights can compete - prohibitions rarely do.My sense is that the UK has fewer legal protections of freedom of speech, but more cultural ones. For example, refusing to respect the national anthem or the flag in the US can cause one to lose one\u2019s job or be excluded from school, and outside of the liberal coastal cities, declaring atheism will be met with disapprobation.THAT SAID - the picture is far from clearcut. America has a long tradition of using freedom of speech to poke fun at the powerful - the British comedian John Oliver would most certainly not be able to do his show \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on UK TV, and the UK has a dark history of being the jurisdiction of choice for despots to silence dissent through very oppressive libel laws. We also have the deliciously terrible \u201csuper-injunction\u201d - What is a super-injunction (and can you get one)? - whereby rich and powerful people can stop you from being allowed to talk about something, and stop you from being allowed to talk about the fact.

            "answer_text": "So you've asked what the Government can do to limit speech in England and Wales (as opposed to other jurisdictions in the UK ie Scotland, and Northern Ireland). But the limits on speech are also imposed by civil law ie other ordinary people, and also by the judiciary which is independent of government. Let's take them in turn. Government limits on speech - acts of Parliament creating criminal offences: Hate speech. If you cause someone \"harassment, alarm or distress\" either by words or behaviour, including written words, then you can be prosecuted and in the most extreme cases, jailed for up to 6 months. Racial, sexual orientation or religious hatred can carry much longer sentences, of up to seven years.Treason/encouragement of terrorism. This has been used against people who have spoken about acts of terrorism against the UK or British personnel. There's quite a lot of anti-terror legislation which restricts speech in other ways.Obscene publications. Some types of pornography are considered to be obscene and publishing (ie distributing) these can lead to prison sentences. Obscene or malicious communications. Sending grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing electronic messages eg on the internet, email, Twitter, Quora, can be considered to be an offence under the Communications Act 2003. Insider trading. There are limits on what people who are in possession of sensitive commercial information can publish or reveal to other people. Reporting of elections. During an election period, broadcasters and newspapers must ensure that their coverage does not unfairly favour a particular candidate, which is why they will usually publish the full list of candidates when doing a story about one of them.Some parliamentary proceedings are restricted from publication or broadcast in certain circumstances eg Parliamentary TV footage cannot be broadcast during a satirical TV show such as Have I Got New For You.Corruption. Public officials who have accepted payment for giving information to journalists were prosecuted and jailed, and at least one senior police officer who did not receive any money but gave information to journalists was also investigated and arrested, although I don't know if he was prosecuted. Judicial limits on speech Contempt of court. If you breach an order made by a court which forbids publication of certain information, you can be sent to prison.Section 33 or Section 45 orders. Courts have the power to order that children involved in court cases should not be identified. This can mean that adults may not be identified if by identifying them it would lead people to the identity of the child. So for example, a father who raped his daughter could not be named in a report if the relationship to his victim was published. Jigsaw identification is an issue here.Children involved in youth court proceedings. They are automatically granted anonymity. The press are allowed into youth courts but cannot identify any parties.Victims of sexual offences. Rape victims and other victims of sex offences have an automatic right to lifetime anonymity. If they want a story to be published, they must waive that right, in writing. Family proceedings. These are beginning to open up, but in general family courts have been closed to the public, and publishing some information from these courts would be contempt of court.Various other tribunals with no public right of access.Closed Material Procedures. Aka 'secret courts' - these procedures are used in cases involving sensitive intelligence material. No one is allowed to see the material except the judge - especially not the defendant - and the proceedings are heavily restricted from publication.there are probably lots more that I've forgotten.Civil limits on speech: Defamation. Libel is the written form of defamation, slander is the spoken form. If you say or publish something that will lower someone in the minds of right-thinking people, then you can be sued for defamation. The plaintiff has to prove only that the words were defamatory, that they were published and that they identified the plaintiff. The respondent eg newspaper has various defences: justification ie that the defamatory words were true, fair comment ie that the words were an honestly held opinion based on fact, qualified privilege ie that the words were said in specific public settings such as council meeting, a police press conference and others. There is a right of reply.absolute privilege ie that the words were said in a court of law or Parliament.Confidentiality/Privacy. The law of confidentiality evolved into a de facto 'privacy law' due to precedents set in the High Court and Court of Appeal based on arguments that sprang from the Human Rights Act, right to a private and family life. It means that it is possible to gain damages if information is published that someone would ordinarily expect to remain private and that publication has therefore breached the HRA. It's also possible to obtain an injunction preventing publication although this is an ever-changing area of law.Breach of copyright.Those are the main ones. I haven't really mentioned the regulation of the press and broadcasters, although broadcasting regulations are backed by statute so breaching broadcasting rules can result in a fine or in a broadcaster being taken off air.  Update: It occurred to me that I haven't mentioned the chilling effects of legislation and state action on speech in the UK. If people fear that by speaking about something they will get into trouble, they will self-censor and therefore there is no need to enact legislation to combat it. Surveillance of journalists, for example, and the prosecution of journalistic sources as part of Operation Elveden have both had significant impacts on the willingness of people to say things in public.  Reporters Without Borders places the UK at 38 in its rankings of world press freedom.  ",

            "answer_text": "Of course it does. As the government has said: \u201cThe Government is committed to upholding free speech, and legislation is already in place to protect these fundamental rights. However, this freedom cannot be an excuse to cause harm or spread hatred.\u201d UK law prohibits expression of speech where it is used to engage in acts of hatred towards others based on race, sexuality, religion, disability, nationality etc. Put simply, it is designed to protect people from being victims of hatred: you\u2019re perfectly at liberty to hate someone if you wish, but expressing that in a way designed to cause harm is prohibited. Most notably, the restrictions are focused on those who use their freedom of speech in a hateful manner with the intent to incite violence. Some would therefore argue that we do not have free speech, but in truth, the laws focus on expressions of hatred: you can say what you like, but this does not leave you exempt from the consequences. It\u2019s a reflection of the concept that violence does not have to be physical, and that people can be harmed significantly through words as much as by physical harm. You should note that this isn\u2019t dissimilar to other consequences attached to expressions of free speech - something true in the United States, the UK and many other civilised nations. For example, there are laws prohibiting defamation, slander, libel, fraud (which can obviously be verbal!), speech covered by copyright, perjury, false advertising and, of course, threats of violence (particularly of the terrorist variety!). Put that way, no nation on Earth has free speech in any complete respect. Most, however, accept that you may say whatever you like, provided you accept the consequences of what you say. And that, as far as we\u2019re concerned here, is the most perfectly reasonable way to handle the idea. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. The answer, as I understand things, is 'sort of'. We don't have a written constitution, so there is no guaranteed, set-in-stone freedom of speech equivalent to the USA's First Amendment. Nonetheless, we are, broadly speaking, a progressive democracy, we follow international and human rights law for the most part and do recognise the right to freedom of speech. There are laws regarding hate speech and incitement - people can be and sometimes are arrested for using racial slurs, joking about committing acts of terrorism, or encouraging others to commit crimes, for example. This is not uncontroversial, but there is no significant movement (as far as I'm aware) to change it. An attempt to introduce a law against 'blasphemy' was defeated after it became clear that the public had no appetite for such a law. A few years ago some public figures had fun with 'super-injunctions' (court orders preventing anyone from mentioning both the case itself and the very fact that there is an injunction on the case), but it seemed to fall out of fashion very quickly. Overall, most people are free to express themselves as they choose without interference from the government. As far as I know it's only a handful of outliers who find themselves in trouble. ",

            "answer_text": "Eventually. What we have is KingDonkey ears from Aesop \u2018s fables. There is a tendency for authority to say - you cannot say that we have laws against it but the muttering still goes on. Eventually the penny drops that the position is untenable and you are allowed to say what was forbidden. Such a tradition stems from the army. British soldiers always complain, wise officers list to the complaints because they know once the common soldier has had his whinge he will fight doggedly. Officers usually find that the complaints are valid. Officers who don\u2019t listen to the complaints fail and officers worry if they are not hearing complaints. There is a tradition that judges have been officers in the army. The tradition does not come from the navy because there discipline has to be tight and the next step up from the Captain is God. The danger in the navy from not listening is mutiny. Any captain who loses his ship to mutiny has to go before the naval board of naval captains who are harsh judges. The sea takes no prisoners. Finally we come to the airforce where in order to maintain operational efficiency they have a system of compliant where you are not allowed to pull your punch but say the truth as you know it because get it wrong and you fall out of the sky. There are also lots of school traditions stemming from tales from Sparta. Which makes me smile about the push to have laws about islamophobia which are supposed to give Muslims the edge because British society is about blunting that edge and making it smoothe. So while freedom of speech is not enshrined in law the advice is that you had better listen to what is said. ",

Although, it is dwindling, and regrettably there is a distinct and candidly ridiculous bias against right-winged figures that surpass the Conservatives in their deviation from the centre \u2014 this cannot be as relevant as today with the recent deportation of these three:  Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern (who planned to meet with Tommy Robinson), and Martin Sellner \u2014 Sellner is a prominent Austrian activist, a nation that has tilted drastically towards the right side of the spectrum, a state I would consider part-and-parcel of the Visegr\u00e1d Group. Even a politically illiterate individual can tell this is an assault on the Tier One Far-right that has spread across Europe like wildfire. Unless one incites violence, why omit him under a nation built upon free speech? The UK\u2019s actions would be cogent if the three above threatened to maim or kill people, but they didn\u2019t, thus is an exemplification of the moral decay of our system. I hope this answers your question, Lyra. ",

So there are exceptions, as there are in the USA where the First Amendment is a constitutional guarantee of freedom. Speech inciting others to violence is not usually allowed; this particularly includes speech directed against a particular group, so-called \u201chate speech\u201d. The other restriction we have in the UK concerns reporting trials. Everyone has the right to a fair trial, and if you publish things that might influence a jury or say that someone is guilty before they have been proved to be so by a jury of their peers you will be in contempt of court and could go to prison. The single most important part of free speech is the right to criticise the government of the day. None of the very limited exceptions to free speech in the UK affect that. ",

I can pretty much say what I want, to who I want, without fear of being arrested however I might get a punch in the mouth if I say the wrong thing to the wrong person! Obviously, in a civilised society there are areas where the law has to be taken into consideration eg I would be arrested for inciting racial hatred if I stood in the middle of a predominantly Asian area and started mouthing off against Asians. Common sense really, apart from it being bad manners. I can call the Prime Minister an idiot or incompetent to his face (he is guilty on both counts) or even say I believe the country should be a Republic and the Queen pensioned off (I don't on both counts; I adore the woman) without fear of being arrested or facing a political trial. On occasion, an overzealous politically correct policeman or woman has over-stepped the mark and arrested someone for saying un-PC things in public, but the Courts quickly throw these out, as they are fierce protectors of an Englishman's common law rights to say and think what he or she likes. I've traveled the world and there is no safer place to be a political rebel than in the UK. Hope this helps. ",

Thats not about free speech, though its about others being entitled to life liberty and happiniess without oppression by wankers. ",

There is sufficient freedom of speech for political activity, which is the speech most people are really concerned about. But you can't libel people, or try to incite violence, or sexually harass your co-workers. There are quite a number of ways in which the higher public good is served by constraining public behavior, including speech. ",

According to   2015 World Press Freedom Index   it ranks #34 That is reasonably typical for a Western country: significicantly worse than Scanininavia (Finland, Norway, Denmark are #1-3)  or most of Northern Europe,  but about the same as Southern Europe and better than USA (#49) Press Freedom is one aspect - though an important one. In other ways, Britain does have laws on hate speech & incitement to violence, but it does not have laws on holocaust denial or blasphemy (not any more, though it did surprisingly recently) Probablty the biggest restriction on free speech is the very severe libel laws. Those have imprioved slightly in last few years but are still very savage. ",

The UK courts are open to all but not equally, money is power and the system will do all that is necessary to preserve itself.  I sometimes wonder if the satirist does society a favour because they get us to laugh at what we should be angry about. Laughing is an alternative to riot and so sometimes it is tolerated in the name of free speech.  Vengeful MPs, Monty Python charter and lethal threat to free speech ",
