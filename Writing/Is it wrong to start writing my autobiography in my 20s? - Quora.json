            "answer_text": "I was 68, I am now 72, when I began writing my autobiography after much persuasion, as I had led a very interesting life, people were interested in how a poor working class girl with little education could become so successful. The first part of a trilogy, my early years, growing up, was published last year. The second part, the middle years is due for release next week. The final part ? Next year. This is what an autobiography is about. A lifetime\u2019s achievements, overcoming challenges and surviving the impossible. Unless in your short life you have experienced worldly or unusual experiences I would hold back, but keep a journal of your life, this information will save you a lot of research in future years. Good luck with your project \\U0001f642 ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking. Wrong? There is no absolutely wrong time to start an autobiography. Why don\u2019t you start out by writing a childhood memoir, that covers you since birth until age 18? Your memories will be fresh and full of detail, and you may likely be very glad to have this early period covered already if you continue your project. Don\u2019t be concerned that you\u2019ll have nothing important to say about your earliest years, as this is the period in which we learn the most. Best wishes. ",
