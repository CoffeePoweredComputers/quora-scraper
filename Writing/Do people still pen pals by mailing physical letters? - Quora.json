            "answer_text": "Oh yes, some people do! I\u2019m French and I have 5 pen pals, two of them are American, one is from Bulgaria, one from England and one from Lithuania. I\u2019ve met them online, because i was looking for people to exchange letters with and I've never seen them in real life. I hope I\u2019ll be able to meet them someday. But anyway we\u2019ve been exchanging letters for a couple of years or so and it\u2019s amazing to read someone talking about their lives, their culture, their country. This process is making me learn a lot about diversity and helping me get even more open-minded. If you\u2019re curious of how I find these amazing people, I just searched for people on Instagram. I\u2019ve published a post introducing myself and explaining why i wanted to have pen pal from any where in the world. And then i have discovered this huge community of people that write letters and send them by mail to friends all over the world. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people have Instagram accounts specifically to publish pictures of the mail they\u2019re sending and receiving. It\u2019s mind blowing. And for the most part they\u2019re teenagers or young adults which is kind of crazy in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "I know for a fact my father does on a regular basis, at the very least. Granted, he\u2019s in his fifties as and has been doing this for years. This has opened up many doors for us, and his pen pals have always been happy to help us out and show us around when we went to visit their countries, namely Australia, France, and Japan, in that order. My Japanese class back in High School had a pen pal system, too. Unless something drastic has happened, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re still doing that too. I still have one of my former pen pal\u2019s letters, and some pictures she had developed when her school came over to visit. ",
