No. Even her books for adults, written under the name Robert Galbraith, have terrible prose style. The Prose of J.K. Rowling - A Mind for Madness (2017\u201312\u201322) QUORA Why does everyone seem to hate J.K. Rowling all of a sudden? How do critics view JK Rowling's writing ability? Why might someone say J.K. Rowling is a bad writer? Does JK Rowling receive far too much criticism? Other sources: Harry Potter's big con is the prose (2007\u201307\u201317; theguardian.co.uk): A nine-year-old might feel quite pleased with the writing in the Harry Potter books. It's pretty embarrassing coming from an adult. (\u2026) Here, from page 324 of The Order of the Phoenix, to give you a typical example, are six consecutive descriptions of the way people speak. \"...said Snape maliciously,\" \"... said Harry furiously\", \" ... he said glumly\", \"... said Hermione severely\", \"... said Ron indignantly\", \" ... said Hermione loftily\". Do I need to explain why that is such second-rate writing? If I do, then that means you're one of the many adults who don't have a problem with the retreat into infantilism that your willing immersion in the Potter books represents. It doesn't make you a bad or silly person. But if you have the patience to read it without noticing how plodding it is, then you are self-evidently someone on whom the possibilities of the English language are largely lost.This is the kind of prose that reasonably intelligent nine-year-olds consider pretty hot stuff, if they're producing it themselves; for a highly-educated woman like Rowling to knock out the same kind of material is, shall we say, somewhat disappointing.Children exposed to this kind of writing aren't learning anything new about words, or being stretched in any way; as Harold Bloom said, they're not going to be inspired to go off and read the Alice books, or any other enduring classic.
