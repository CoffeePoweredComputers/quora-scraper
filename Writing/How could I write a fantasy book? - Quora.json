            "answer_text": "We all go into writing for our own reasons. Mostly, we love storytelling \u2014 being on the receiving end of it or the telling end. If you didn\u2019t like listening to/reading stories, you probably won\u2019t like writing/telling them. Any story you write will be original \u2014 because you wrote it. Give 100 writers the same premise, the same characters and the same basic plot, and you will get 100 different stories when they finish. You write from your point of view, with all the \u201cbaggage\u201d that you have acquired over the years. Thus, the way to write an \u201coriginal\u201d fantasy story is to write a fantasy story. I understand that\u2019s not what you mean by the question, but it is the truth. Rather than trying to do something that is SO different from anyone else, making up your own characters \u2014 Pazdells and Qremuks rather than Orcs and Goblins \u2014 what you want to do is to write the book that you want to read. That\u2019s one of the things that got me into writing my own novels. I loved other people\u2019s novels, still do. However, they would be better works if only the authors did \u201cthis\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d, or incorporated \u201cwhatever\u201d. Now, I\u2019m not saying that following my wants would make those novels better for you, but they would have made them better for me. I eventually realized that the only way that I would get the story that I really, really wanted to read was to write it myself for myself. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done. I go back and re-read my own novels quite often. Why? Because they are the kind of stories that I want to read; they \u201cspeak\u201d to me because I deliberately wrote the kind of book I wanted to read, not necessarily the kind of book that would be popular. They \u201cspeak\u201d to some other people, too. Some say that my storytelling is great and they can\u2019t wait for the next book to come out; some say that my storytelling so turned them off that that particular book is the only book of mine that they will ever read, and even that was a waste of both time and money. Readers don\u2019t want ORIGINALITY. They want \u201cthe same, but different.\u201d I don\u2019t go into a bookstore (physical or digital) and just randomly pick out a book. I go the the SF&F section. I go there because SF&F is familiar, and I know I\u2019m going to get something familiar \u2014 the same, but different. I\u2019ll open a book and look at the first few pages. Is the writing such that it pleases me? Does the author use words in a way that resonates with me? If not, I\u2019ll put the book down because I want what I want \u2014 the same as I usually get, but different. The same, but different. That\u2019s why we have television series. Each week we get presented with the same, but different. If we\u2019re watching a police procedural, we know we\u2019re not going to get slapstick comedy. We\u2019re going to get characters we know, doing the same things they always do but something will have changed \u2014 the crime won\u2019t be the same as last week; those same characters will have to do something slightly different to catch the criminal. But they will catch the criminal in the end. It\u2019s the same as last week, but different. Thus, I suggest that you write the kind of book you wish to read. If you feel that Orcs, Trolls and Goblins will make it that kind of book, then use Orcs, Trolls and Goblins. If the kind of Fantasy book you want has Pazdells and Qremuks (I just made those names up) who have the distinguishing characteristics that you would just love to read about in a novel, then use Pazdells and Qremuks. Some say there are only 7 basic plots. Some put the number higher, some lower. Some also say that \u201cthere is nothing new under the sun\u201d. If there is any truth to any of that, then you cannot write a completely original work. It\u2019s been done before. The only question is: \u201cHow \u2018different\u2019 do you wish to make \u2018the same\u2019?\u201d The more different you make it, the more likely your storytelling will turn other readers of the genre off. HOWEVER, you may be the one to to start a whole \u201cnew\u201d niche, fantastically popular, which will inspire other writers to write the same as you \u2026 but different. ",

            "answer_text": "How could I write a fantasy book? Well, just like any other book. You open you favorite text editor (there should be one in your operating system, if not, use Google Docs, since you do have Internet access), and you write words into it until you get enough for a book. Don\u2019t forget to save often, and occasionally save your old versions in different files - it\u2019s a lengthy process where something can go wrong. When you\u2019re done, read what you wrote, and see how badly it turned out. Don\u2019t despair, all you need is to rewrite it a few times until it turns out good. Don\u2019t be afraid, unlike sci-fi, you don\u2019t actually need to know anything to write fantasy. If you screw up ecology, economy, politics, swordfighting and everything else, you\u2019ll fit right in with all the other fantasy books! But it helps if you know at least something relevant and make it a strong point of your story, so don\u2019t be afraid to learn a little. You can make everything else work like in your favorite fantasy game, they wouldn\u2019t notice. What you need to start? Some characters.A relatable main character can make or break a fantasy story for the readers, so base main character on the person you want to read your story. When in doubt, write for people like yourself..A pretty girl (or boy, or five) to breast boobily through your novel, will help make your novel popular with people who don\u2019t have enough love. In the 21st century, that\u2019s most people.For children, replace romantic interest with a friendly and fluffy animal. Like a giant blue wolf.Prepare a couple of dozen of names (and possibly short descriptions) for random people your protagonists will encounter.Villains are optional, a modern person\u2019s worst enemy is a faceless crowd, like zombies, riot police or imperial stormtroopers of non-fantasy.Sufficiently ugly faces of nonhuman races are as good as not having a face at all.If you have villains, consider the possibility of your MC solving their problems and befriending them.Some geography.Many people love drawing geography for fun, so consider borrowing theirs.Alternatively, write your story first, and draw the geography around your story.Really hardcore authors can avoid making any geography at all, but you\u2019re just starting. Picture: The Only Fantasy World Map... by EotBeholder on DeviantArt A conflict. For a story to be interesting, there better be something going on in there.Best to take a conflict that you care about, like recent elections, and make a fantasy version of it, resolved with swords and magic instead of votes and politics. As a bonus, you get to portray people you hate as vampires, trolls and other ugly and hateful creatures.Alternatively, you can have some mundane conflict, like a romance between very different people, or a girl trying to earn enough money to keep her family home. And put a fantasy spin on it: trying to date an elf princess, earning money by brewing magical potions.And that\u2019s all. Don\u2019t bother with plot, you\u2019ll know what plot is when you\u2019re done writing. ",
