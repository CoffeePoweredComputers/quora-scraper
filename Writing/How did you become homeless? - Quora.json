            "answer_text": "For me it was a combination of old haunts, bad timing and gentrification. 5 years ago I lived in an apartment complex that was the first to be bought up, completely vacated, remodeled and rented for almost twice as much. We got our evict notice an had to move out the day after Christmas. Being the first in a long wave of these kinds of evictions due to the gentrifying of the Portland, Oregon area, there had not been any help available or any laws set in place to protect tenants. Now there are laws past that help to even the plying field. For us, there was no where to turn, and no one to stop the company from ruining over 200 lives. At the time we were suffering some bad luck. I had literally JUST started to move equipment into a warehouse where me and a friend were starting a business. The first night we moved our stuff in, someone left a window unlocked and the warehouse was broken into. We were doing all we could to save money and had not yet purchased any insurance, not thinking fin a million years that we would be robbed on night one. this was our mistake and we suffered the consequences. Thousands of dollars in supplies and equipment were taken, crippling our business and leaving me without income. A week later my wife was fired unexpectedly from her job. We had both been unemployed for a little over a month when we were forced from our place. Many years earlier, when we were very young, we had F\u2019d off some money we owed to an apartment complex we lived in. We had also paid rent late a few times. Right or wrong, we never corrected that rental history because for years after it never had an effect on renting apartments. We had no trouble renting. Well, with this new shift in renting where all the power was now in the hands of the landlords, requirements to rent changed. Suddenly we could find no place to except us. So that Christmas, unemployed and with unacceptable rental history, we moved our stuff into a storage unit, drove our car around the city until we found our new home: a walmart parking lot. Over the next few years we found employment but still couldnt meet requirements to rent. One traffic stop by a cop led to a suspended license, which led to another stop and our car was towed. That winter we slept in a broken down car that we bought off a tweaker. I stayed up all night watching over my wife and our stuff from the shady kids that roamed the neighborhood. One night upon return from a trip to the library, we found our car broken into and all my stuff gone. I spent the rest of the winter wearing shorts, no jacket. I was so determined not to spend any money so that we could save enough to buy our way out of our situation. My dog died. Our two cats were hit by cars a week apart. We both grew so depressed that we lost all contact with friends and family. The day came that we finally were able to rent out a room [actually, the garage]. We were living with kids half our age who took delight in making shit hard for us. 6 months later we came home from much earned lazy day at the park to find our roommates all moving out. No one told us. The next day we were homeless again. Today we are not totally homeless, but not totally homed either. We were finally forced to move from the city we loved and spent 20 years building a community, to a small town 2 hours away where i grew up. I hate this place. But here we have one family member who stepped up to help. We currently live in a room at his house, 10 miles from town, 2 hours from the place we love. We\u2019ve traded a life we loved, living how we wanted, a community we helped build and friends we love for a depressing town full of bad memories and experiences, jobs that pay us barely enough to scrape by, loneliness, seclusion and deep, deep depression. Our years living homeless have aged us beyond our years. It has also made our outlook on life very negative and our trust in people non-existant. We suffer from low, low self esteem and I cant remember what pride feels like. Our dreams have been replaced with all consuming thoughts of survival. We are paranoid and worry about everyone, all the time. Always trying to avoid doing something that might upset someone else for fear that they will take what little we have from us. The worst is that our life has went from one being surrounded by friends and opportunity, to one in front of the TV, alone, or staring at walls. This is probably much more info than you asked for. But being homeless is much more than how you got there and how you plan to get out. What people on the outside see is someone either deserving of their situation or someone \u201cdown on their luck\u201d. We haven made any mistakes in life that pretty much anyone else hasnt. The bad decisions we've made in life are no worse than yours. We were no less experienced than you or anyone else. We worked just as hard. We were on a path, with goals that were being achieved one after the other. We are not addicts, drunks, abusers or bad people. Yet somehow we got 5+ years of homelessness where as most people didnt. How we got there is important. How we plan to escape it is important. But what it does to you in the meantime is so much more than someone who has not experienced homelessness can imagine. And what you lose is so much more than a roof over your head. i think THATS the important part. ",
