            "answer_text": "Screenwriters are primarily hired because of their track record -what they have written in the past. I\u00b4ve been on both sides of the table because I am a screenwriter as well as a producer. So, I have been hired by producers to write and also hired others screenwriters to write specific projects. Don\u00b4t believe anyone who will tell you that screenplays are written on spec. It used to be that way, back when I was a reader for Paramount and other Studios in the 90\u00b4s. But it is no longer that way and haven\u00b4t been for now, many years. In 2010 the number of spec scripts bought, in the entire industry was 55 and out of those only a small handful were produced. Today, the number is close to zero and none are produced and no matter what anyone tells you, those are the sad facts. Between the 90\u00b4s and now, there was a short transition period where Independent companies would still produce spec scripts but that has almost died out entirely. So you are quite right in assuming that screenwriters are hired. We are indeed. But as I said, this process happens usually by the strength of the writer\u2019s track record; how many screenplays has he written? and are they in the style that is required for this particular movie? -are among the questions, that producers ask. On rare occasion we find that several different screenwriters are potential candidates for a job. And in that case, Producers will interview each writer and ask them about what their vision for the story, in question, would be. I have also, once, been part of a test where several candidates where asked to write one scene on spec, to see if they could match the tone that producers were looking for. But that s relatively rare. If anyone is more interested in the current state of affair, when it comes to spec scripts, LA times, recently published a great article about it. R.I.P. for the spec script, long a source of some of Hollywood's most beloved films ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you mean for an existing property, because most screenwriters write original screenplays that get chosen to be made into movies, not the other way around. The Agent or manager of the writer will send him/her to meet with the producers of the film and the writer will pitch his/her take on the property. If the producers like him/her they may ask them to submit a treatment (short document outlining the film). If they like the treatment they may ask for a full draft of the script. Then they might give him/her notes on the script, or hire a different writer to do a different take on the material. If several writers (different writers, not writing teams) have worked on a film script all the various drafts that were submitted to the producers are handed over to the WGA (Writers\u2019 Guild of America) along with the shooting draft (the copy of the script the filmmakers were working from as they filmed) and they will determine final credit for the finished project.
