By pushing the small button on the right hand side of the carriage the paper rest will spring into position and can be pulled out to show a measure that will tell you how many lines you can write before the end of the paper.

            "answer_text": "The paper rest is an additional support that comes out of the paper table. It's most prominent on portable models such as the Corona S series. In most machines, like coronas and Olympias, they remain hidden behind or in the paper table until they are popped up. On some machines like the Erika, they collapse flat over the top of the machine.
