            "answer_text": "If you\u2019ve researched this question before, you\u2019ve likely come across some advice and statistics from various experts that provide a very clear answer to exactly how often you should be posting. An info graphic from adobe spark asserts that you should be posting at least one (and all the way up to 10!) photos each day. A post for the SumAll blog says that two photos per day is the magic number. And then there are other experts, like Neil Patel in an article for Forbes, who state that, \u201cUnlike Facebook and Twitter, posting frequency is not all that important for your Instagram marketing.\u201d Are you scratching your head? We certainly can\u2019t blame you. All of these different digits and pieces of advice are enough to make you cross-eyed. Even after wading your way through all of those tips and best practices, you\u2019re still left wondering: Exactly how many times a day should I post on Instagram? Instagram Posting Frequency: There\u2019s Not One Right Answer Like we said earlier, there\u2019s not one magic bullet answer that is guaranteed to work for everybody. A posting frequency that works well for you might be totally different from the posting frequency that the business around the corner relies on\u2014and that\u2019s OK. There are brands who have been successful posting once every couple of days, and there are others who have experienced great engagement posting 12 times per day. It all depends. So, now what? The first thing you need to do when determining how often you should be posting to Instagram is to return to your goals. Why did you start using Instagram as a marketing channel to begin with? Was your main goal to grow your following and increase your brand awareness? Well, then it\u2019s probably smarter to stick to the higher end of the recommended posting frequency. After all, the more content you put out there, the better your chances of getting even more eyeballs. But, if your objective was to really strategically promote a specific product? That might not require that same avalanche of posts\u2014you\u2019d be better posting one or two highly strategic photos per week instead. Are you seeing how much your goals play a role in exactly what you do on Instagram? That\u2019s the touchpoint you should always be returning to before making any changes to your strategy. There\u2019s another important point that we couldn\u2019t go without mentioning: consistency, consistency, consistency.  Like marketing expert, Neil Patel, mentioned in that article for Forbese, it might not be posting frequency that carries a lot of weight on Instagram. In contrast, your success might be closely tied to your consistency. \u201cIf you make a habit of posting several times a day and then transition to only a few times a week, you will start to lose followers and generate less engagement per post,\u201d explains Patel in that Forbes article. The opposite is true as well. If you\u2019ve gotten your followers into the habit of only seeing your content a couple of times each week, they can easily feel spammed when you start overwhelming their feeds. That could also cause you to lose followers. So, while posting frequency is important, don\u2019t become so wrapped up with that single number that it\u2019s all you focus on. As Patel explains, \u201cThis means that the best posting frequency for Instagram is the posting frequency that you can consistently maintain for the rest of your natural life.\u201d Your own bandwidth and capabilities are something you need to seriously consider when figuring out your strategy moving forward. Here I have a suggestion for businesses and marketers. I have recently came across a very useful Instagram automation tool which one of it\u2019s features is to schedule posts. With using post scheduling your followers will know the exact time and amount of posts you post on your Instagram every day and this discipline makes your account more appealing and you can save so much time as well.

            "answer_text": "Here are 3 things to know to help you choose when to post on Instagram: 1. How many times a day should you post on Instagram? Posting more on Instagram doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will grow faster. What matters the most is the quality of your content and interacting with people. Those 2 things will help you grow even more than posting on Instagram non-stop. Most people post on Instagram once a day. However, more and more people post on Instagram every 2 or 3 days. People rarely post more than 3 times a day. Some bloggers (like @meg_legs or @christieswadling) post twice a day. If you post more than 4 times a day all the time, be careful. Instagram might think you are a spam account and they might block you. 2. Choose a routine The key is to be consistent. Choose a routine. You can post everyday if you want to. And you can also post every 2 days if you want to. Our biggest tip: Pick a realistic routine that fits your needs and your life. If you feel obligated to post on Instagram, you will burn out. And if you burn out, you will stop posting. If you stop posting, your Instagram page stops growing. So take it easy and choose a routine that suits you. Examples of routines: Post everyday Post everyday of the work week (weekend off) Post every 2 days Post every 3 days Post once a week 3. How many times a week should you post on Instagram? Based on your routine, you can predict how many times a week you should post on Instagram. And then, you can plan your feed for the week. Easy peasy! Listen, I LOVE planning my feed. Planning your feed in advance will help you stay consistent. It will help you save time, energy and stress. You can use Preview to plan your feed. It\u2019s an app to design your feed, schedule your posts, find hashtags, edit your photos, and all that good stuff. The beauty of Preview is that you can schedule as many posts as you want \u2013 for free. So if you already have a bunch of photos, quotes, videos ready-to-go, you can upload them all in Preview. Move your posts around to design your feed, and you\u2019re done! You will be able to see how you feed will look like before you post anything on Instagram. So let\u2019s have a look how many times a week to post on Instagram, based on your routine: Post everyday = prepare 7 posts for the week Post everyday of the work week (weekend off) = 5 posts for the week Post every 2 days = 4 posts per week Post every 3 days = 3 posts per week Post once a week = 1 post per week Let\u2019s say you want to post every 3 days. Preparing 3 posts for the whole week doesn\u2019t seem too bad, right? You could literally plan your feed 2 weeks in advance (= 6 posts). ",
