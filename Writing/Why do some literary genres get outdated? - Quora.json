            "answer_text": "Literature and other types of storytelling develop alongside culture. When the culture moves on, so does the writing. Sometimes the culture moves on because of outside changes. For example, Sci-Fi used to be super optimistic about the future (Back to the Future showed flying cars, Star Trek showed black people and Asian people and Jewish people and aliens working together without racism or sexism being a problem, and some stories showed such great advances in medicine that humans were practically immortal). Most stories were utopia stories. However, most Sci-Fi nowadays is dystopic, because we are in the future, and we didn\u2019t get there, and we\u2019ve advanced so quickly that our way of socializing hasn\u2019t kept up the pace (think of all those \u201cmillenials are glued to their phones\u201d comics and articles). We\u2019re no longer optimistic; we\u2019re a bit scared. Other times, the culture moves on because it gets bored of the same thing over and over. Take, for instance, Vampires. They were all the rage in the late 90s and early 2000s, and you had all sorts of vampire stories: Buffy, Van Helsing, Anne Rice\u2019s Vampire Chronicles, Moonlight, Blood Ties\u2026 they were a bit obscure within pop culture (as paradoxical as that sounds). You could like vampires, but you were probably seen as a bit of an outsider. And then Twilight came along. And vampires became super popular. And people got sick and tired of \u201cvampires this, vampires that, vampire themed drinks, vampire satyres and parodies and spin-offs\u201d. So, the culture turned its attention to another monster: Zombies. So now you have The Walking Dead, and Zombieland, and World War Z, and Warm Bodies, and so on and so forth. I do believe there will come a time where we grow tired of zombies and turn to\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 werewolves or something. ",

            "answer_text": "Could you give an example? Oversaturation of a viewpoint can turn people off to a genre, I\u2019m not sure what type of impact it has on writers, writing it though. More an impact on publishers publishing. Sci Fi never went away for it\u2019s core readership, It seems to get picked up in pop culture then dropped again, but the genre is still there plugging away. What is happening though, is that fiction, which has always been multi-genre is being picked up by the publishing houses. They used to prefer single-genre fiction.[1] This could seem to indicate a crossing-over into the fan realm of readership. Multi-genre fiction has long been understood by fans, who have detailed genre within genre of their own. I have lamented the lack of classification of fiction works by their sub-genre or cross-over. Some classification schemes have tried to pick this up, but so far they are not adopted. Perhaps hashtags will pick up some of the slack. Footnotes[1] Is Single-Genre Fiction Outdated?",
