            "answer_text": "I have one finished now, and I have two novels in process. The one that I just finished is a collection of short-short stories written over the course of five years. The 39 stories in the collection were each written in 30 minutes, using writing improv, and are between three and six pages long. The genres vary widely, from a nautical romance to fairly grisly murder dramas. I have a cover designed now, and all photos are formatted and credited. I\u2019ve learned just how complex a book is. The collection will be published in late Spring \u201817. The novels are\u2026 you\u2019ll just have to wait. One is extraordinarily fun to write. The other, set in modern-day Prague, will require a bit more research. That\u2019s my excuse for traveling to my favorite city in the whole wide world. I just reread the question, and you specifically want to know what the books are about. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. Here is one of the short-short stories from the collection. The Lake House  I love my clients. Some of them have said the same about me after the work was finished, but I really love my clients. My latest is a divorced woman who has moved from Amherst to Belchertown, from a five bedroom big standy-uppy house in a development to a little cottage on a lake. She called to ask if I could look at her new house to see about a bathroom remodel and possibly, if there was time, a kitchen also. I didn\u2019t have anything pressing, so I agreed to meet her there the following weekend. The walkthrough almost didn\u2019t take place. When I arrived at the new house, it turned out to be a little three-season cottage twenty feet from the most beautiful lake I had ever seen. I was agog. Struck dumb. Walking across the lawn, I had the strongest sense that all would be well in the world if I could only sit down and take in the view for the next twenty years. My feet slowed, I remembered to close my mouth, and I think I may have moaned quietly, but perhaps it was part of the dream. The water was clear and deep. Ripples from the breeze moved across the surface, and water lilies bobbed in the water just away from the shore. A small frog saw me and leaped into the lake, pumping its legs to escape the intruder. It was late summer, and the breeze was warm on my face. I just wanted to stay there forever. Trees hung over the water, and a memory of a rope swing and laughing children came to mind. Watermelon and sandwiches, cousins and grownups. I could feel the water over my head, and the sandy rocky bottom of the lake, the slime of algae and floating green plants. \u201cHi! I see you found the place!\u201d Cynthia walked across the lawn with her hand held out. I took it, gave a slight squeeze, and wondered if it would be appropriate to propose right there, before I even started work, before we had a contract. I just wanted a way to stay. \u201cI love it,\u201d I said. My throat felt like cotton. \u201cThe location is beautiful.\u201d The walkthrough began, and I could see the immediate possibility of rescuing a sadly neglected bathroom and making it wonderful for Cynthia. A kitchen remodel was also a possibility. It would give me at least five weeks in heaven. I told her I would draw up a plan and pricing for her approval, and a tentative contract. Three weeks later, and I\u2019m finished with the bathroom and standing in the kitchen. I\u2019ve finished the floor replacement and electrical work. I just installed the window that will be over the sink. It looks out over the deck and lawn to the lake. The old kitchen window was a piece of crap with two panes of glass separated by a vertical mullion that divided the view. The new window was a single huge casement, which, when the protective film was removed from the glass, looked just like a framed photograph of the lake. I stood there for fifteen minutes, silent and staring. I shook myself back to reality and moved away from the view to begin the drywall. Two sheets later, I found myself back in front of the window. The smell of wood smoke threatened to take me away again to some past life full of memories. The view of the lake was still there, beckoning me. I figured two more weeks, and I\u2019d have to decide. No one ever looks in the septic tank when someone goes missing. Who would know that I had moved in? Perhaps some weights and a short boat trip to the center of the lake. The building inspector had told me recently that it\u2019s actually eighty-five feet deep. I just stood before the window and smiled. ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote one about 2 years ago. It\u2019s called Turning Tantrums Into Triumphs - The Step-By-Step Guide To Stopping Toddler Tantrums. My daughter started having terrible twos tantrums since she was one year old (yes, she was very advanced that way). There were many opinions on how parents should handle toddler tantrums. but most of them just didn\u2019t sound right to me. To be honest, many of them sounded very mean! For example, many people believe that you should just ignore the child and they\u2019ll stop. From the parents\u2019 perspective, this strategy may \u201cwork\u201d. Tantrums do often stop that way and parents are happy. But I worry about its impact on the child. I didn\u2019t believe that was the best thing to do for the kid and I wanted nothing but the best for my child. I focused on scientific evidence. After much researching, I found a solution that worked very well for us. So I wrote down my findings and hoped to help other parents. I didn\u2019t know whether it would really work for others as well as it worked for my child. Fortunately, feedback has been good and I\u2019m glad some families benefit from it. ",

The second looked at the role of charisma in the global financial crisis, and proposed a synergy between Hyman Minsky's Credit Cycle and Max Weber's charisma (also a textbook-& a case study within it was used as the basis of a journal article). The current one looks at physiological bases of irrational & emotional investing, offering both causes and solutions (my first professional title). I am a huge fan of trying to make complex theory accessible and in making philosophy understandable as it has such an empowering application to all of our lives, so each book considers research concepts and research philosophy in some depth (in particular, the third devotes a large part of a chapter to it). I feature a lot of exciting examples alongside that kind of theory so it is lighter to read. Each book has a lot of expert insights as well, as I like to connect theory with practice. Routledge will have published all three (the third should be released later this year). I always said that after 3 books I could call myself a writer. It's a real dream for me. But I think I need a big break from non fiction titles\u2026the next will be a sci fi or mystery (I have a plot ready for both)\u2026I don't know whether either will get a deal but hey, try your best and enjoy the process\u2026 ",

I can write a book - I have written sixty fictional books so far, but please don\u2019t ask me to list the titles - it would take far too long.

I think you would be pleasantly surprised at what your creative mind can do. Have a lovely day. ",
