            "answer_text": "Well, not sure how pretty it is to English speakers, but Borghild is a classic Norwegian girl name meaning \u201cProtection in battle\u201d. (The first part is related to Scottish word burgh, originally meaning castle, and the Norwegian word \u201cberge\u201d, to save or rescue.) So that seems to be the closest, and would be quite plausible for a Norwegian woman in that era. It is often pronounced with a distinct h like in the beginning of words, as if it was written \u201cborg-hild\u201d, but it is written as one word. This is generally the name with two-part names from Scandinavia. Any name starting or ending in \u201child\u201d has to do with battle and fighting, and they are disturbingly common among Norwegian women throughout the ages. I guess Norwegian girls were never famous for their meekness\u2026 Magnhild - \u201cStrength in battle\u201d. Audhild: \u201cDestiny in battle\u201d or, more disturbing, \u201cProsperity in battle\u201d. Perhaps a bit too Viking, the second part, but fairly easy to pronounce. Gunnhild: \u201cBattle, battle\u201d. Perhaps a bit too on the nose? Especially with the probably coincidental similarity to the English word \u201cgun\u201d\u2026 Another easy to say name. Torhild: \u201cThor\u2019s battle\u201d or \u201cThunder in battle\u201d. Can be spelled Torill. which may be easier to pronounce? Svanhild: \u201cSwan in battle\u201d. Norse myth and folklore associate swans with the Valkyries. If you\u2019ve intruded on swans near their young you can probably guess why. They intimidate above their weight class and have way too little fear for their own good. Speaking of Valkyries: A common Norwegian girl name is Vigdis, meaning \u201cBattle goddess\u201d. A bit over the top for your use, I guess, but not too hard on the tongue. There are many more Norwegian names, but these were the ones I thought of in your context. All of them are attested from the era your book is set. I\u2019ve omitted names with Nordic special letters like \u00f8 and \u00e5, since this is clearly going to be a book for an international audience. Best of luck with your book! ",

If your novel had been set somewhat earlier than the Victorian era, perhaps as early as the time of the Danelaw, the Norwegian names might have had more of an Icelandic/Old Norse ring to them.
