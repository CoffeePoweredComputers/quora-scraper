            "answer_text": "So, you want to become a better writer in 2019. That\u2019s great. You\u2019ve come to the right place. Quora is like a training camp for aspiring writers.  ** For inspiration you might want to keep an image of your favorite writer close at hand. Hemingway inspires me. The best I can do to help you is to tell you what helped me to become a better writer. This is free advice, so take it for what it is worth. Seriously though, give these tips a fair trial and you will become a better writer. Realize that the only way to improve your writing, is by writing. You learn by doing. You don\u2019t have to start out by trying to write the great American novel, just write something. Anything.Use Quora as a sounding board. You\u2019ll get some good feedback here from some very talented individuals. We are fortunate to have an audience here. Take advantage of it.Write every day. Even if you don\u2019t feel like it. Especially if you don\u2019t feel like it. Answer three or four questions on Quora. Length isn\u2019t important in your answer. Quality is.If you don\u2019t like any of the questions you see here, write your own question and answer it.Write about what you know about and what you are passionate about.Read content from Top Writers. Read content from people who are not Top Writers. What is the difference (if any)?Daily read at least twice as much as you write.Your surroundings matter. Know what environment you write best in. It is usually best to avoid as many distractions as possible. I have to write with headphones and the sound of rain acting as a white noise.Everything you write has to have a beginning, a middle and an end. Break it into parts. Remember, people have short attention spans these days. Let your reader digest small chunks of information at a time.Remember the immortal words of Ernest Hemingway, \u201cThe first draft of anything is crap\u201d. A good piece of writing is the result of lots of re-reading and editing. Sometimes you\u2019ll spend as much time editing as you did writing in the first place.Read your work out loud as part of the writing and editing process. How does it hit your ear? If it sounds bad, change it.Write because you love to write. After all, this is going to be taking up a fair amount of your free time.Don\u2019t write for the approval of others, or with the goal of gaining more followers or upvotes. For the love of God don\u2019t write with the hopes of making money from this one day. If you are a good enough writer, people will come to you because you offer a quality product and maybe they\u2019ll even ask if they can publish your work.Important point: Stop a writing session when you stop writing well. For example, I can tell when my work is starting to suck and I\u2019m just \u201cphoning it in\u201d. When that happens, take a break, clear your head and get back at it. You may only need ten minutes, you may need to sleep on it. All depends.To reiterate: Write, read, recite, edit, repeat. Keep at it, I look forward to hearing what you have to say. ",

            "answer_text": " I make a living by writing. More specifically, by ghostwriting. Every single day I need to sit down, listen to my clients, and put their thoughts on paper with a spin. That means I\u2019m expected to look for different angles on how to make their ideas pop up to draw the reader in without losing their \u2018voice\u2019 in the process. So\u2026 I don\u2019t have the luxury of getting stale on my writing journey. Either I write better each day, or I don\u2019t eat. Now, I\u2019m no guru in this subject by any stretch of the mark. I\u2019m still struggling to find my voice ever since I first began writing in Quora in 2017. However, as I began to transition from the former to working under Mart\u00ed S\u00e1nchez at Influence Podium, I have come up with different ways to keep learning. Here are 6 of them: 1. Choose one single type of writing style and commit to it before moving onto the next There are many different styles of writing. There\u2019s fiction writers, non-fiction writers, research writers, copywriters, creative copywriters, academic writers, ad nauseam. Each one of these has a different set of guidelines to pull them off effectively. You can\u2019t just transition from writing like Stephen King to someone like Gary Harbert and correctly pull it off. You\u2019re better off sticking to one until you\u2019re great in that domain - like \u2018I can write for someone and ask them for big bucks in return\u2019 kinda great. Only then you\u2019re free to make the switch. 2. Read a lot from those who are great in the field you\u2019re writing for It\u2019s common knowledge that to become a great writer you need to form a reading habit. But it\u2019s not so simple as to read whatever comes across you. I won\u2019t get better at writing for entrepreneurs and business owners by reading from Hemingway or Tolkien. Instead, I\u2019d have to take a look at what people like Nicolas Cole have published over the years in their careers. It isn\u2019t wrong to read from great authors to gain new ideas or pass the time. It\u2019s wrong to read from great authors when you\u2019re purposely trying to become better at something entirely different. 3. Make it a routine that you can stick to for longer than a year The more time you invest in consistently practicing your writing, the more likely you\u2019ll become better. If such\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t you design a system for consistently making it to the desk to write something, one that you can see yourself committing to for a year? In his book The War of Art, Steven Pressfield states: \u201cThe most important thing about art is to work. Nothing else matters except sitting down every day and trying.\u201d 4. Exercise your creativity by coming up with 10 ideas each day - by James Altucher Your writing process will benefit from a creative mind. Problem is many tend to think of creativity as something that flows through your hands and never stays put for enough time to catch it. But that\u2019s the wrong angle to look at it. The creative process is just another symptom of your mind connecting various ideas to form something new. And as such, you can get better at it by practicing. Just as if you want to grow your biceps by consistently hitting the required reps, you want to write down 10 ideas each idea to make your mind better at being creative. 10 ideas/day = 3,650 ideas/year. 5. Take a walk in-between long sessions of writing and quietly appreciate what\u2019s happening around you There\u2019s the writer\u2019s block that happens when you don\u2019t write often. Then there\u2019s the writer\u2019s block that happens when you\u2019ve written for over three hours straight without looking away from the screen. Your mind needs time to catch up when it has extensively focused on something. The best thing you can do for this is to take a walk outside. Don\u2019t look for your phone, don\u2019t look for anything that gives your brain a similar stimulus as your phone. Just go for a walk and let your thoughts drift as you look at things. Then come back after half-an-hour, sit down, and write some more. 6. Read what you wrote yesterday out loud When I started ghostwriting, I struggled with making my client\u2019s voice resonate through the words. That happened because I had grown accustomed to writing for myself for over a year each day, and so I\u2019d fall back in the habit of using my voice instead of their\u2019s. One mentor in particular had a different answer from what I expected to my struggles. I gave him some of the stuff I was working on and explained the issue, and he just asked, \u201cHave you tried reading out loud what you put in the paper?\u201d Your mind tends to perceive your writing as better than it actually is. Reading out loud takes you away from your thoughts, and forces you to catch the clutter, the fluff, and anything that sounds funky.  Like this answer?

However, I can make some specific steps to become a better writer in 2019. Among others the below mentioned actions can help me to be a better craftsman in the next year. Right now, I am in a 30 days writing challenge at Quora. I will write 30 answers in December. I make the conclusion at the end of this year, and probably I continue. Daily writing should be a habit for me.I would like to learn sales copywriting. Sales is a quite difficult task, but sales in print can be more difficult. If a salesman made a mistake, than only the possible buyer will notice that. If a copywriter makes mistake than thousand of people can feel the effect. Advertisement reach a lot of people. Wrong ads result low sales. I will read books about copywriting and make some baby steps in the practice.I am not a native English speaker. My grammar and literacy should be improved. I do online refresher courses on English language.I finish read the fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire from George R.R. Martin. I read the series for some years now. I never read two books next each other. I make always a brake. However, I like to see the result of the consistency and persistence. I read those books mostly during the daily commute. Days are passed and pages are read. Books are finished. The reading result reminds me, that small steps added together. Good to see as a busy parent.Networking with writers. We learn and support each other. Quality writings around the globe improve the mental health of the humanity. Time is value, do not waste your time on bad content.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The man on top of the mountain didn\u2019t just fall there. He got there one step at a time. Things take time. If you wanted to fly a plane, what would you do? You'd find a ground school and take lessons. If you wanted to play the piano, what would you do? You'd find a piano teacher and take classes. What makes writing any different? Writing is an art, but it\u2019s a learned art. To ask someone how to write a story is like asking \u201cHow do I climb a mountain?\u201d You don\u2019t, unless you\u2019ve had the training. And no, it\u2019s not rocket science, but writing is something that needs to be studied and practiced. Anybody can sit down and write crap. You see it all the time in self pubbed books. Most people will tell you to just start writing, and keep writing, but I don't agree. It's not enough to just write every day if you don't know what you're doing or how to improve something. That just means days and weeks and months of useless writing. It's like not knowing how to knit so you just keep making loops with the yarn. You can't get better, you can't turn that into a scarf ... you have the desire, but you don't know how. I'm going to give you my stock answer that I give everyone who asks me this question. I'm going to give you some good advice on how to learn the craft, and give you a place to send in some of your work when you're ready. In order to write stories that people want to read you will need to understand how to put one together. There is a definite pattern and rhythm to it. And there are certain expectations from the editors and publishing houses as to how your story is laid out. You will need a good imagination, one that can look at a situation and picture all sorts of different scenarios. You need to be able to ask 'what if' and come up with twists and lines that are new and fresh. You will need to be able to research things. For example I wrote a story set in Iran where there was a wedding. I had to research how the wedding would take place, the food, the customs, common Iranian names, clothing, etc. in order to write an interesting yet correct story. Take classes in writing; grammar and punctuation (very important... lots of self published books are swimming in glaring errors and typos), character building, dialogue, plotting, pacing, point of view (POV), inner and outer conflicts, subplots, scenes and sequels, genres, story boards, twists, chapter hooks, suspense, killer opening lines, and satisfying endings. If you're going to write sci-fi you will need to take classes in world building. Each genre of book has its own set of expectations from the reader that you will need to fulfill. For example a murder mystery must have clues for the reader to try and solve. A romance needs a happen ever after ending, known to writers as an HEA. A thriller needs fast pacing and danger. There are classes in short story writing. Where to find these classes? Local community colleges often offer writing classes. My local library has classes seasonally. Best of all there are hundreds of classes you can take on-line. They run about $25-$35 each and range from 2 to 4 weeks. Google on-line writing classes and you will get lots of sites. Try www.oirwa.com or www.savvyauthors.com. They have classes year round. You don\u2019t have to join either one but if you do you get a discount on their classes. Just because a class might be about writing romances, writing is writing; many of the same principles apply to other genres. So don\u2019t hesitate to take a course on character building or writing scenes just because the site caters to romance. There are sites that offer expensive classes, so be careful. I\u2019d recommend starting with a few less expensive ones to see if you really like writing and want to continue. IMO it is not necessary to have a degree or to take an expensive course to write well. Read a lot. Get a feel for how a story is told; how it starts, how it progresses through the story to a satisfying end. See how your favorite author keeps you interested. I don't know your age, but when you are able join some writing groups, even online groups are helpful. Oftentimes these groups offer lectures and classes in writing. They share their work and critique each other. Once you start taking classes and get a good feel for how to put a story together, write some short stories (800 - 1500 words). The more you write, the better you will become. You will make new writer mistakes, we all did. But that's how you learn. I say start with short stories because they are, well short, and don't take years to complete like a novel does. You can share your stories with others and get feedback. Take the feedback and use what you feel is constructive for you and ignore the others. Some people don't give good feedback, or there is a motive behind their negative comments. You have to learn which ones to take and learn from and which ones to disregard. And when you are reading and critiquing other's stories, be kind, give good feedback, and find something positive to say to them. It's hard to hear harsh things about your writing. It's tough love. But it works when you get it and understand why the comment was made and you go and make your piece better because of it. Submitting to contests is another way to get good feedback because the judges are usually editors and agents who have their finger on the pulse of good writing that sells. Once you feel you have written a great short story, be brave and submit it to a magazine that publishes fiction in the genre you wrote. Don't worry about rejections. They will come. Oftentimes it's not because your story is not good, it's because the story doesn't fit their needs. They are running a business after all, and they pick the stories that they feel will best entertain their readers. All authors get rejections. It's part of the 'hunt'. Here\u2019s a place to start submitting. Check out their guidelines carefully. FLASH FICTION ONLINE http://flashfictiononline.com/main/submission-guidelines/ We publish stories from 500 to 1,000 words in length. They\u2019re very short, but they are still stories. That means the best ones have strong, interesting characters, plots, and (to some extent, at least) settings. We\u2019re not that concerned about genre. Many of us have a fondness for science fiction and fantasy, but we also like literary fiction; and in any case, great flash stories aren\u2019t always easily classified. If you wrote it, and you love it, then submit it. No erotica, porn, graphic sex, or violence. Pays $60 per story. Buys reprints at two cents/word. (I checked this site on 10/12/18 and it\u2019s still operating and the details are correct.) Once you are good enough to sell a few short stories, then you will have the skills to think about plotting out a whole book.

            "answer_text": "There is an old saying about being a writer that still rings as true today as it did when it was first said, perhaps hundreds of years ago. The saying goes \u201cThe best way to be a better writer is to write\u201d. As simple as it sounds, writing is the best way to get better at writing. There is also the added help of reading. The word is the more you read, the better you will understand how to write. I have been told you should read good writing, bad writing, and in fact all writing. The above being said, in addition to writing, you can also do several things to help improve your writing skills. You can join a writer\u2019s group and learn from others as well as share input and get feedback on your writing. You can also take online classes. Several organizations offer free, cheap and even credit-based online classes for writing. If you have never taken English Composition I and II, then start there and get some college credits while you learn. If you already have a degree or do not wish to spend money at this time, there are hundreds of free classes online you can take and learn more about writing. Finally, consider how you write or at least how you complete your writing for publication. While you may use a notebook, a tablet or even a phone, nothing beats a good grammar review or software that review your writing for you. You can use anything as basic as Word and even add in grammar review programs to monitor as you write. The bottom line, even with groups, software, and study, the best way is still that age-old saying, just write. If you want to improve, just like anything, practice will help you improve. ",

Don\u2019t try to read it all, because you can\u2019t. Just read. My high school English teacher said you become a better writer by becoming a better reader. Nothing about improving one\u2019s writing is more true. As with learning any skill, there\u2019s some trial and error involved. Architects desigining houses don\u2019t always draw up winners. I\u2019ve always equated the writing process with building a house. Do it one step at a time, and the finished product will be something you\u2019ll be proud of. And you don\u2019t have to build a mansion every time. Eventually, others will be reading what you write and learning from you. ",

Rereading old answers is just as important as writing new answers, perhaps more so. I edit the living hell out of my answers. It is the true path to better writing. Write 3. Re-read 3. Learn 1. Edit.

Since I don\u2019t know the answer to \u201chow good is Sean?\u201d I have one suggestion: you know where your weaknesses are. You know where you need improvement. And if you don\u2019t, try this: what do you avoid working on? That\u2019s where you\u2019ll be weakest and that\u2019s where you need practice. You didn\u2019t think anyone would say, \u201cjust keep doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d did you? You only get to do the most fun writing after you tackle the stuff you know isn\u2019t as great. Although I\u2019m a lifelong member of the \u201cEat Dessert First\u201d (\u00a9 2017, D.K. Carlen. All rights reserved. Write for permission to re-use.) school of thought, this time I\u2019m going to say that you can\u2019t write where you\u2019re strong until you tackle one area of lesser strength every day. At the end of 2019 you can splurge, buy the newest a new copy of Chicago Manual of Style, eat dessert first, and know that you improved your writing all year. ",

Then do it again tomorrow. There are 53 days left this year, including this one. See if you can write at least 500 words in every one. By the time 2019 rolls around, you\u2019ll be in the habit of writing every day. Put as much of it as you can out in public as quickly as you can to get feedback. Pay attention to what works and what doesn\u2019t and keep experimenting. If you write at least 500 words every day, you will write more than 182,500 words next year, the equivalent of more than two full books. But the way that it\u2019s most likely to happen is if you write 500 words today. They don\u2019t have to be good, they just have to get on the page. ",

            "answer_text": "The best thing you can do is establish a writing habit. It doesn't have to be every day, but make it regular. If you need a starting point, start by observing what's around you, right where you are, with all of your senses. But first, work out your when, where and why: When can you get some focus time? When are your energy levels right for writing (buoyant enough and not too tired)?Where's the best place for you to write? A cafe? In the spare room? In bed first thing in the morning?Why do you want to write? Knowing the specifics of why will help motivate you.Once you know your when, where and why, and you've got a regular writing habit going, you'll be able to figure out your what (what you want to write, and what you want to write about) and you'll be able to figure out how, by doing a bit of research, a bit of reading around your 'what'. In the meantime, keep turning up to write. I have a few writing courses up on Udemy. There are some coupon codes here. Good luck! P.S. I made a list of some of my favourite writing prompt books on Amazon for my students. In case it helps, here it is. ",

Don\u2019t try to figure out what other people want to hear from you; figure out what you have to say.

A piece full of shit. The only thing that differs you from big writers is that they kept their shit in a file and wrote another and then another. It\u2019s not they knew they were writing shit, but they thought that they were writing masterpiece. Then one day, after a long time, they reopened the first page written by them and found that it was just a pure form of shit. Nothing less. So, here are simple steps: Write everyday. 250 words, if not more.Keep your work safe. You\u2019ll need it, trust me.Read.After one month, re-read your previous work. Laugh.Read.Write.Start it right now, why make it 1st january goal?*Simple* ",

You can sign up for services to bring you specially prepared food. You can cut out carbs entirely. You can only eat three blueberries for lunch and a banana for tea. If you\u2019ve ever tried to diet, you probably know that people start these diets full of good intentions, and end them with a binge, having become hungry. We all know that the best way to diet (for a healthy person with no other medical conditions) is to have smaller portions of food and to eat more fruit and veg. It\u2019s boring. There\u2019s no fun, gimmicky club you can join. You just have to buy smaller plates and more carrots. If you want to write well, there are a hundred schemes and tips you can use to do so. People will tell you their own writing routine. Speed-writing 500 words for twenty minutes followed by an hour break. Writing between certain times of the day. Going back and rereading your work every few sentences. Writing with abandon. We all know that the best way to learn how to write well is to read more and write more. Read any interview with any published author and they will always tell you to read more. That the more you read and the more you write, the better you will get. But that\u2019s dull. You want a quick trick to write better. READ MORE. WRITE MORE. I do not give a damn when you write or what on or what you read or where you read it. Get comfy, grab a book, read it. Consider what you thought was good about the writing, and what you thought could be improved. Then write and apply that new knowledge. It is not easy. There\u2019s no way round it. Just do it. ",

Write down a list of 10 topics that interest you (5 minutes) DesignEntrepreneurshipEducationCoworkingIdeasComicsDonutsFreelancingTravelWriting2. Turn these interests into questions (10 minutes) How do you bridge the gap between design and business?How do we make entrepreneurship more accessible?What will education look like in the future?Why is coworking becoming so popular?What is the first step in making ideas happen?What can design students learn from comics?Where can I find the best blueberry cake donut in St. Louis?What is the most important step when starting to freelance?How do I start traveling more?What is the easiest way to start writing?3. Do a little research in order to form an opinion for each topic (30 mins) 4. Answer each question in one sentence to create your BIG IDEA for each article (15 mins) In order to bridge the gap between design and business, schools need to teach business development skills to design students and design thinking skills to business students earlier on in their education.For entrepreneurship to be more accessible, entrepreneurs need to be connected to others who share their idea and have the skills they need.In the future of education, an apprentice/master relationship will reemerge to better address the individual learning of various skills needed in the new workforce.Coworking is becoming so popular because it provides a collaborative setting for the new workforce that balances productivity with camaraderie.The first step in making your idea happen is to share it with at least one other person in order to receive tangible feedback.Design students should look to comics as the perfect example for effective design, noticing their combination of narrative text and supportive imagery.After doing extensive research, the best blueberry cake donut in St. Louis can be found at Ex-Cop Donut Shop, and here is why\u2026The most important step when starting to freelance is to successfully position yourself by identifying who you are, what you do, who you help, and what value you provide them.In order to start traveling more, try focusing on working remotely, whether through your company or on your own.The easiest way to start writing is to take action and follow this framework :)5.

Show that first draft to three people: Someone you know who writesSomeone you don\u2019t know who writesSomeone who would be a target reader in that category7. Take feedback from all three people and revise your first draft (30 minutes) 8. Check for grammar and spelling (5 minutes) 9. Click \u201cPublish\u201d and get ready to share your article 10.
