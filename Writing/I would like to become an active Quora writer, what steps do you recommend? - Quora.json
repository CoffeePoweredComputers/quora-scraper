Look for questions on topics that interest you and that you know something about. If there are already answers to the question, it helps if you can contribute a different perspective or an interesting (and relevant) anecdote. People don\u2019t want to read the same answer expressed in ten very similar ways. If you are writing on an issue of fact rather than opinion, don\u2019t contribute to misinformation. Make sure you have your facts right. There are many (often very popular) answers on Quora which are factually incorrect. Adding footnotes and links from reliable sources is a good way to show that you have done your research, and is helpful for any readers who want to investigate further. If writing is not your strong suit, accept edit suggestions if they are given\u2014people are only trying to make your answer better. They\u2019re doing you a favour, not insulting you. Use spellcheck, and make sure you correctly capitalise and punctuate. Those little things may not seem like a big deal, but they all help your answers to be more readable, and therefore more acceptable to the Quora audience. Don\u2019t worry about views or upvotes\u2014write because you enjoy it, and because you think that you have something to say. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A To become a Quora writer you first have to make a start. Read up your lines of interest and scrutinise other popular Quora writers. Understand how they build audience. This is hard work and although it is sucking up your valuable time it still gives you exposure to a vast bank of readers. For a novelist Quora is a priceless tool to keep updated on rolling news. I hit on Quora, accidentally, two years ago and have now chalked up 7.63 million viewers and answered 2600 odd questions. So far it has been fun. Only one reader was reported for insulting me. But hey! 7.63 million viewers enjoyed my work . That\u2019s enough publicity. I\u2019m not aiming for any super stardom or anything fancy. All I want to do is wear some Quora bling and puff my chest out and feel my ego pushing my head a fraction. That\u2019s good enough. More than the ego boost Quora is a great tool for word gyms. I love that part of it. Although I make a huge number of mistakes in my answers most readers are forgiving. So begin your journey today. Read, Understand, write. If you can be funny then please be funny. YO can say the rudest thing in a funnier way. Always be nice to everybody. Take no sides and never get into any kind of online fight. Be flexible in your answers and wise in your questions. Be sincere. YOu can make a lot of friends and fiends. Good luck. ",
