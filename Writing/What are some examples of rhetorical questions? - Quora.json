            "answer_text": "Perhaps you\u2019re thinking of the term rhetorical question, which is what a speaker asks an audience without expecting them to respond. As for a rhetorical statement, virtually every statement is in some sense rhetorical, since the person who utters the statement 1) wants someone to listen to what\u2019s being said (whether an audience of one or a thousand and one) ; 2) is attempting to inform, inspire, and/or persuade someone of something; or 3) is initiating a dialog with someone and therefore wants and/or expects an interlocutor to respond in some way to what\u2019s being said. Every statement comprises a selection from reality, a reflection of reality, a deflection from reality, and a distortion of reality. To the extent the statement is crafted for maximum effect, the statement will be more overtly rhetorical. I suggest, however, most people most of the time do not craft their statements for maximum effect, except perhaps when they want something out of someone! Some exceptions might include folks who are \u201cnatural\u201d teachers, preachers, persuaders, inspirers, or entertainers. ",
