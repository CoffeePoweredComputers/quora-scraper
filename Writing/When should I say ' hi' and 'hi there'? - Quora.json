            "answer_text": "Hi! or Hi There, that is the question\u2014which do I use and when is it appropriate to use one and/or the other? If I were at work or in a formal meeting, I would use the Hi or better yet, Hello. I tend to reserve idiomatic language, which seems to be less formal, for after work and with friends. Using the phrase Hi There can be misinterpreted when you are at work; you may be seen to be flirting if your intonation is \u2018off\u2019. So my rule of thumb is to use more formal language for your work place. And! when you are finished working for the day, you might want to use idiomatic words and phrases with your group of friends. Do you see another way to use idiomatic language in a formal way\u2014look carefully for the idioms that I\u2019ve written into my answer. Could you use these at work without offending anyone? ",

            "answer_text": "You can use \u2018Hi\u2019 or Hi there\u2019 any time at all. Each of those is a simple casual greeting. \u2018Hi\u2019 is more commonly used (and shorter). It means \u2018hello\u2019. \u2018Hi there\u2019 also means \u2018hello\u2019. They are better when used with friends, rather than coworkers or people who are senior to you, or older people, who might expect a greater level of courtesy. For groups of that sort, say \u2018hello\u2019 instead, and save hi (or hi there) for your friends. ",
