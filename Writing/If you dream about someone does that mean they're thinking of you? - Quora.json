            "answer_text": "What i know is when you always think about someone, that person is also thinking about you. I had proven it with my self. I do not dream about people and i do not dream of them and think of me, too. Although there can be truth sometimes when you dreamt of someone, the person is thinking about you. Perhaps you were thinking of the person that you dream of him/ her. I mean the thoughts of the person was imprinted in your astral body, and you saw it there when your soul automatically entered the reversed side of your self when it also entered dreaming state. Dreaming is a symbol of \u201csomething\u201d for the dreamer. If it is a psychological dream, it does not have anything to do with symbols, nor it is about symbolical life which your astral body may have been telling you through dreaming. Remember that our astral body as our subconscious mind (the \u201cunconscious\u201d from old school) is the seat of emotions and thoughts, feelings that are connected with people, too, or the dreamer. Since the astral body stored our thoughts and emotions, it \u201ctalks\u201d to our conscious mind through the dream process. The astral body has seven layers, and each layer is subdivided in another seven layers. So, dreaming is dependent on our biological rythym. If our body is healthy, vibrating in higher level, our soul is able to penetrate the higher layers which is where our symbolical or prophetic dreams came from. If our physical body is vibrating in lower vibrational tendencies, we get a psychological dream. Psychological dreams are mere thoughts, or emotions, or sometimes we do not have emotions in the dream, and may mean nothing at all but our psychological life. The astral body of a person, when enjoined with the astral body of the Earth becomes the astral world. And with the astral body as the next layer closed to the body, our soul, the finer embodiment of our physical personality, automatically enters the astral world if we are going to sleep. If you could observe your body while you were about to enter the sleeping mode, you may notice that which connects between the physical and the astral because you feel like something is leaving out from you. It was a blissful moment for the body. The difference was that the body is pulled to a deep sleep. That was the layer or the alpha level when we were calmed to deep sleeping. If you have a sharp attention, you will remember your \u201cdream\u201d. We dream because of the connection of the astral body to the physical body. This is the nearest an ordinary individual could penetrate into everyday because we sleep. This is how i understood it from the Esoteric Teachings shared to me by our Master Teacher who is living with us in the physical level. All these knowledge are taught originating from a Master Teacher of the esoteric philosophy. And maybe this layer is the nearest that can be discussed with each person serving as proof of its existence because people sleep and dream.  ",

            "answer_text": "I have had a unique ability to connect with people my entire life but I only learned to develop this ability over the last 21 years since I met my wife. Our youngest son (12) has an even greater level of ability than I have. I can tell what people are thinking or feeling if I focus on that person. My son can read multiple people at a time with ease. There are people in my life with whom I have very special connections\u2014even over long distances. Not sure how it works, but it\u2019s odd. My wife was the first one to demonstrate that connection when we met. It is common for me to hit send on a text message and literally receive one with the exact same time stamp from the other person. They were thinking about me and I picked up on it and was composing a message at the exact same time as they were. I have very vivid dreams and usually remember them. I have dreamed about people I know and love and even texted them in the middle of the night only to find they are up at 3am dealing with some personal crisis. Look, humans share 50% of our DNA with a banana. (Yeah, take a minute and look that shit up; it was a surprise to me also.). \u201cThings\u201d are made of \u201cstuff\u201d and ironically, all the same stuff as other stuff. So it should be no surprise that we are all also connected in some way. I am pretty sure that when I dream about people \u201calive or dead\u201d that they are reaching out to me. I have even had people\u2019s dead relatives reach out to me and help me track down a loved one. I know it sounds crazy but it\u2019s true. Being alive or dead is just two sides of the same coin. They are connected, just as we are all connected to each other. Just a side note about the crossing over example for those curious: I was relentlessly bothered by this feeling and did random searches for days, not even really knowing what I was looking for. I wandered across someone\u2019s social media feed: a young woman in her early 20s. I reached out to her, and I\u2019m sure she thought it was crazy or a stalker. Anyway, I simply said that I felt compelled to reach out. The reply I got back was of a girl on the edge and out of control. She was a \u201cparty girl,\u201d filling her nights with alcohol, drugs and sex. Not really my thing. As she continued to chat, she shared that life hadn\u2019t been the same since her father passed away almost a year ago and she felt her life spiraling out of control. She didn\u2019t know what to do, but she was contemplating suicide. It was then that I realized what was happening. Her dead father was trying to reach her to save her. As crazy as it sounds, I told her the story of how this has happened before but something had been dogging me for a month until I found her. I told her that her father was worried about her. She started to cry. We chatted for a bit longer and she went to bed. My guess is that she was open to the idea and her father came to her in her dreams that night. I reached out several times after that and didn\u2019t get an answer. I was worried she had committed suicide. A few months later I got a random text message from the girl. She said she woke up the next day, quit her club job, got a \u201creal\u201d job, was off drugs and alcohol for 3 months, and had met a nice guy she had started to date. She wanted to thank me for reconnecting her and her father and for saving her life. Who knows how all this stuff works. But it is what it is. ",
