            "answer_text": "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referring to being published by a traditional (= real) publisher? Of all the people who now \u201cpublish\u201d (self-publish, or indie publish, and I am one of them), perhaps 0.00001% are traditionally published. Or at least that\u2019s what it seems to me. Millions of people self-publish now. Literally millions. The population of the Earth (just Googled it) is 7.7 billion \u2014 it\u2019ll probably be 7.8 by the time I finish writing this. lol Do some math and you\u2019ll see that I\u2019m not all that far off, am I? And how many people are out there are saying, \u201cOh, I really want to write a book some day.\u201d Count those in and the odds get closer to being something like 0.0000000001% of \u201caspiring\u201d writers. Because these latter folks are never going to get down and actually write one, they will forever only \u201caspire\u201d to write one. I said that I self-publish. Well, I started typesetting (part of the publishing world) in 1969. That would be fifty years ago. I also learned design, etc., through those years. My career went extinct when Bill Gates came along with Microsoft and introduced desktop publishing. I was out of a career ca. 1989. Why pay me (at the time $18/hr) when your little Susie Secretary will do it for you for $4 an hour? And who cares about all those thousands of nitty gritty little design and grammar rules, eh? Let\u2019s just pretend they don\u2019t exist. We\u2019ll brainwash the world into thinking that there\u2019s no difference between there, they\u2019re and their. (It\u2019s working, isn\u2019t it? :-D) I am an old lady now (almost 75) but I still remember every single little nuance of publishing, editing and especially design. That\u2019s mostly because I still work at it. I do my own books all the way through, and I edit, design and sometimes even publish other authors\u2019 books, too. I don\u2019t edit anymore, though \u2014 only for a couple of friends. I have too many books of my own to do and not that many years left to do them in. I design books only for members of the local branch of my national writing group (Canada). And not for free. (I get my own books edited by someone else before I publish and I have several people read them for glitches, etc. And not for free either.) And I\u2019m very fussy about what books my logo goes on so I don\u2019t recommend you ask. Sorry. So much to do, so little time. With ALLLL that being said, write anyway. Get those books written and save all those MSs (manuscripts) up on a Cloud or in a safety deposit box or somewhere else safe. One day you\u2019ll figure out how KDP Amazon and its ilk work and you can go out there and get \u201cpublished\u201d with yourself as the pubisher. And you will have already written ALLLL those manuscripts, right? And with all that practice, you\u2019ll have learned how to write a good one (and how to fix the first few you \u201cpractised\u201d with). Keep writing no matter what. Sherrill ",

            "answer_text": "The statistics I used to hear were that of 5000 manuscripts crossing an agent\u2019s/publisher\u2019s desk in a year, depending on the size of their publishing house, they might publish 5\u201310 of them. But keep in mind with these statistics, that when people start writing, the ones ones who get as far as completing their story and send it off, the vast majority are literally sending off their first draft of their first story, where editing isn\u2019t even always as much as getting rid of the typos or ensuring the format is what has been asked for, or that the genre is one they are interested in. It\u2019s like writing your first essay at university and sending it off expecting to be granted your PhD. And the agents/publishers can see this. Like everything, if you want to be good at it, it\u2019s a long journey with a lot of practice and learning. I mean, would you go to a doctor for surgery at the end of their first term of study? If you look at the statistics of those who have spent the time and done the hard work, and are actually sending in a polished and professional manuscript, the statistics are way different. The ones who do get published have generally already discarded a few stories. They have spent years writing millions of words, and working out how to do it better. They have spent time getting feedback, and squeezed out the hours around life. They have re written that particular manuscript maybe dozens and dozens of times. If you look at just these manuscripts the statistics are way different. If you\u2019re one of the ones who are persevering with the task, I think it\u2019s important to keep this in mind. ",
