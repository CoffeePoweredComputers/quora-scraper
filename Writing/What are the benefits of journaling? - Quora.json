            "answer_text": " Journaling is not a habit for everyone. We have good days, bad days, and neutral days. Some days pass even without realizing, without any feelings. We work, scroll through social media, watch videos, eat, and sleep. Just typical boring daily routine. It is very boring to write this every day in a journal. It is a fact. But Remember the last time you had a good day? You were happy, and people recognized your achievement? Everything you did was perfect? You wish those days repeat while you were having a bad day. A few weeks before, I was watching a cricket match. I noticed commentators were discussing maintaining a good batting form of cricketers. They were talking about a young player who is in good batting form in that series and their views on maintaining outstanding batting forms. Commentators themselves were legends of their time. Then one of the commentators mentioned a story of another player which he witnessed. Story is this: There was a player who had a peak performance for a long time. When he was asked how, he said, he journaled the first day he was in form. He wrote down everything on that day - time he woke-up, what and when he ate, what he did before batting, which balls played very well, attitude towards bowlers, every details of that day. Whenever he wanted to do the same, he re-reads the journal and follow the same. Commentators were discussing a life worth lesson in a casual daily entertainment. Of course, when you had a perfect day, you were happy, you will remember everything about that day. It might take 5\u201310 minutes to write it down, but worth a lifetime. If you had that moment again, write it. After several times, Things come automatically perfect for you every time. Few days after this match, I was having a terrible weekend. I was desperate to find a new job. Because of this pandemic, all interviews were telephonic and by video call. The whole day was packed with two or more video calls and even more telephonic calls. None of these interviews were going well because of unluck and miscommunication. Several interviews passed by, But this one time, I decided to approach the interview differently. I changed my chair to a more comfortable one for a better, relaxed posture. I dragged my table to a different position for better background and lighting. Took a couple of deep-breath before going online. This difference changed my confidence during the interview. It went well, And the feedback was also positive. Because that day was perfect, I forgot about journaling. On the day after, I had another interview scheduled. That was the moment I remembered about journaling. I started recollecting what I did the day before. After writing everything down, I started looking for what was missing, corrected what I was doing wrong on that day. That interview also went perfect. I always saw journaling as a silly thing, but it is when we do it every day and write all those boring and sad stuff. Write your perfect day down and see your difference. Sangeeth Sai ",
