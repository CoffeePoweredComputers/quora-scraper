            "answer_text": "The discoloration on the highlighter itself may be unsightly, but it\u2019s not the problem. The problem is if the pen ink is making a smear on what you highlight. Run the highlighter back and forth repeatedly on a piece of scrap paper, holding it at different angles as necessary, until it no longer leaves a smear of the pen ink on the paper. If some discoloration remains in the highlighter tip, don\u2019t worry about it. It may fade with time or never vanish entirely, but it will do no harm. ",

If it\u2019s not, then insert the narrow tip of the craft knife between the seam where the end cap and pen barrel meet. Rock the craft knife back and forth slowly to pry the end cap out of the pen barrel. Insert the tweezers into the pen barrel, grasp the ink reservoir with them and pull it out. ",
