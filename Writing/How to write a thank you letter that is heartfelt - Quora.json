            "answer_text": "If you want it to be heartfelt then you can\u2019t ask someone what to say. You can\u2019t use another person\u2019s words because then it\u2019s not coming from your heart. Put a pen to paper and start writing how it made you feel. It\u2019s as easy as that. If you need to offer a disclaimer that you aren\u2019t very good with the written word, add that. If it\u2019s someone who cares about you, they\u2019ll love it, regardless of what you write. ",
