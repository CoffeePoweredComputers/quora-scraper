            "answer_text": "I would recommend that you read \"Antifragile: Things that gain from disorder\" first. \"Antifragile\" is the core of Taleb's works. Having said that, I really enjoyed reading \"Fooled by Randomness\", it is a really good insight into the nature of all things random. I wouldn't worry too much about \"Fooled...\" influencing you in a \"negative way\", or any other book for that matter; I tend to approach the books I read in a \"math textbook\" way ,i.e. , not just reading page after page, but actually taking the time to reflect on some of the things being discussed. No book can fool you (or \"make you a sucker\" as I think Taleb would say) if you read it this way.  Another key aspect to consider: If you decide to read \"Fooled...\" first, despite my recommendation, keep in mind the following \"trinity\": What is Fragile gets hurt by volatility.What is Robust does not get hurt by volatility.What is Antifragile benefits from volatility (up to a certain point). Anyone who understand those three principles cannot really be said to have a low-risk approach, but rather an educated one. ",

            "answer_text": "You get mixed reviews and you ask for more reviews here. Any guesses on what would you get? :) Still, here are my two cents. Taleb's books had me reacting the way few books can manage (and I see that sentiment being echoed in many other reviews). I realized that it is possible to agree with most of what is said in the book and still hate the way it is written, the number of pages it takes to make the point, and number of frustrating hours you spend in coursing through the narcissist rambling wondering if there is something more... My guess is that there are other books which make the same point in less tiresome and more rigorous ways. Reading too much into mainstream success of his books is being \"fooled by randomness\". But I was so tired after reading his book, that I didn't go around reading further If you haven't yet started, it might be better to look for alternatives suggested in many Amazon reviews. ",
