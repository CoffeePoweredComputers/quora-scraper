In other words, if you use one of those organizations to write an essay for my class, I will charge you with plagiarism, the appeals committee will uphold it, and if you\u2019re silly enough to waste money taking me to court, the judge will uphold it too. Centralized government action (\u201cbanning\u201d in that sense) isn\u2019t required in order for something to be illegal in a meaningful sense. ",

            "answer_text": "First off, plagiarism isn\u2019t illegal. It\u2019s dishonest, unethical, and against university rules, but it\u2019s not a crime. (Note that plagiarism and copyright violation are different things. While they often occur together, you can have one without the other.) Assuming the essay service has the rights to papers they provide, it\u2019s only when a user of such a service offers one of those essays as his or her own that a misdeed occurs. If someone is downloading and reading essays to learn about a topic, then nothing untoward is happening \u2014 to me it would be no different than reading an article in a journal. ",
