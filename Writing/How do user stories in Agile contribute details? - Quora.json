            "answer_text": "To get to this, you can answer 2 questions: What do I need to get it ready for development, what do I need to get it done. These boil down to the \u201cdefinition of ready\u201d and \u201cdefinition of done\u201d of a team. If you have that, you can derive the extra content of a user story. Apart from the usual \u201cAs a user \u2026 yada yada\u201d. Some Examples of \u201cdetails\u201d Team asked for base layouts before estimating featuresOther team does not want layouts when estimating, but need when developing.Third team just gets the layout from the designer, because they can and don\u2019t care for process.Other \u201cdetails\u201d I have seen The classic bullet point list. You will find that everywhereDigital assetsGherkin SpecsGeneral MetadataEffort and Business/User Value! - Not only one!General MetadataLinks to confluence pagesTagsMost useful Detail that is Overseen: Examples. Remember: Its \u201cAgile\u201d. You are not forced to draw the software beforehand. BUT: Important Details need to be communicated. See how Crypto explains the \u201cAlice and Bob\u201d things and you got a good idea. Find good examples, find them together.Since I do both: Agile Coaching and Development - I know what I want: Just complete enough to code it down easily, not to brief but brief and when it is in a sprint: It should be in the area of the \u201cdefinition of ready\u201d and maybe, if shit goes down and you are not there: Maybe that extra info link, useful only in special situations is already there. Just make sure, by usage of the whole team: It can get done ;) ",

            "answer_text": "User stories are not normally detailed. They should define the business problem to be solved; not how to solve it. A user story is considered to be a \u201cplaceholder for conversation\u201d. It is expected that the developers will communicate directly with the users to better understand the need and to determine the most appropriate solution. It is perfectly acceptable to add acceptance criteria to a user story and that is one way to add details; but those acceptance criteria should be in terms of the results that the user story must produce rather than details on how to implement it.
