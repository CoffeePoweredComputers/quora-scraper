            "answer_text": "Gender Discrimination is the type of discrimination which is based on the gender of the person. Usually women are treated differently and unequal than men in their education, career, economic advancement and political influences. The discrimination issue is happening throughout the world, even in the developed countries. The root cause of this discrimination seems to be the culture. It is through culture that we come to know who men and women are and what kind of relationship do the two have with each other. According to culture, the work of a woman is home and the work of a man is community. Women are not just considered to be physically weak, but are considered to be weak in everything when compared with men and that\u2019s how the society treats them. Gender Discrimination Types: There are different types of gender discrimination in the world. Most common types that we experience on daily basis have been discussed below: 1. Discrimination in Education: Women are treated unequally when it is matter of admissions, recruitments, financial aid, grading, housing, classroom assignment, counseling, guidance, academic programs, vocational education, and discipline. 2. Discrimination in Employment: This is a major problem women have to face in workplace. They are deprived of the basic rights at the workplace and often harassed by the co-workers. Just because they are females, they are not assigned jobs which they are capable of doing. Even bosses sometimes treat women unfairly. In many workplaces, women are a minority. Therefore, females are always under the pressure from the work environment. Sometimes, even customers target the female employees. 3. Wage Discrimination: There are many situations where men and women perform the same type of work and they probably have the same education too, but still employers don\u2019t give equal pay for women. This difference is merely because of gender inequality. 4. Maternity and Pregnancy Discrimination at Work: If a woman is pregnant, some employers do not even like to interview them. Many females hide their pregnancy at their workplace just because of the fear of getting fired. Sometimes, they are even demoted. Discrimination based on sex or gender is illegal according to a number of federal and state laws. When an employer treats differently with different genders simply because they are a woman or because they are a man, the employer is illegally practicing sex or gender discrimination. The discriminatory treatment can take on a variety of forms like an employee may be fired, demoted, lose a promotion, or take a cut in salary due to his or her sex or gender.

            "answer_text": "My view on gender discrimination or any other discrimination is this: If you put 50 men and 50 women in a room and gender discrimination is in place then the most miserable talentless slug of a man is guaranteed to be in the top half, isn't he? Now, if we remove sexism and rank everyone on their merit alone, the top 10 guys don't much care because they\u2019ve earned their slot and even if they fall a place or two it won\u2019t make much of a difference in their life, will it? However, that miserable talentless slug #49 may find himself ranked in the bottom 25%. Man #49 is going fight to preserve sexism as though his life depends on it, because his life does depend on it. No amount of education in the world is going to make man #49 accept living at the bottom of the barrel if all he has to do is step on a few other people and keep them in the bottom of the barrel instead. The more people he steps on and the more people he can shove into the bottom of the barrel, then the better his view. Sexism, racism, all the \u201c-isms\u201d for that matter are a symptom of the real problem. The real problem is social inequality and nepotism and a lack of meritocracy. If we bring the bottom of the social ladder up out of a living hell and move the top of the social ladder downward to the middle class and make all the rungs of the social ladder in between closer together\u2026 then man #49 will be able to let go of his bigotry and his misogyny and just focus on his own success. The worst he can possibly do won\u2019t be all that bad and even with his limited intellect and lack of talent he can make a semi-decent living for himself. The reason sexism and racism are so bad in such a developed nation like the USA is because of social inequality and income inequality. We are a work culture and your value as a human being in this society is directly related to the size of your paycheck. We need to dig out the roots of our problem and restore the American dream of working hard and getting ahead. For the last 40 years we\u2019ve been working harder and harder and sliding further and further down. ",
