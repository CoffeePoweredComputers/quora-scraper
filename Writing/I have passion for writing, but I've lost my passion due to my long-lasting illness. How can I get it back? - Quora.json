            "answer_text": "First, don't force things too hard. I realise how painful it is to lose a passion, but I believe that forcing it may just make you sick of it, and maybe even give up on it altogether. Next, I would like to know why exactly the illness prevents you from writing; this is important because there might be ways to overcome the barriers that the illness presents. Is it a physical limitation? Is it psychological? For instance, I've seen several people come in to our clinic with cancer. Their illness and treatment caused them to be fatigued, nauseated etc\u2026 But I've noted several individuals work on their passions while receiving treatment by working around the fatigue - they would work as hard as possible for 30 minutes, and then take a nap, and then start again and repeat. When nauseated, they'd put their work down and address the nausea before going back. Baby steps, basically. Next, I advise considering psychotherapy. It might be that you are depressed and may need a therapist to help work through those issues. On this point my personal advise, after battling with relatively mild depression is: don't wait. Don't waste time. Don't be shy for asking for help, because that only wastes precious time. And the reason for this: your brain and psyche doesn't heal rapidly. It takes many weeks usually months or years to help cope with depression. Finally, I would advise you take time to reflect. Think about why you wanted to write in the first place. If it was truly a passion, then rest assured, you will come back to it eventually. But if it wasn't, then you have been given a golden opportunity to find what you are truly passionate about. I wish you well. I sincerely hope you overcome your present state, I know what it is like, it sucks. But I hope you will find your way and succeed to the best of your ability.

            "answer_text": "\u201cI have passion for writing, but I've lost my passion due to my long-lasting illness. How can I get it back?\u201d There is no guarantee that you will get it back. This may not be a result of your illness, either. I have lost my passion almost as many times as I\u2019ve found it. I\u2019ve also lost passion for some activities entirely as I\u2019ve aged. Perhaps this has happened to you not because of your illness but because of time. Simply put, the emotions we have and states of mind we are in are often out of our control. That being said, I recommend trying to consume the works of other people. Perhaps seeing others be so successful and employing literary tactics you\u2019ve never seen before will give you the spark that you need. If not, it\u2019s okay to put down your pen and walk away, if only for a little while. There are thousands upon thousands of writers out there, so if you\u2019re not having fun and getting inspired then you\u2019re wasting your time anyway. Who knows, maybe you\u2019ll find a new passion to overtake this one. Thanks for listening, and I hope this helps. ",
