            "answer_text": "Interpreting your words as meaning YOU want to write a program which will generate other programs; that is one tall order.  Programs which write programs are available.  The first hurdle is devising a means for telling the program writing program what you want it to do.  Graphic library input where the user selects from a library of graphic images the components to be assembled and selects the values of that object's parameters is the most manageable concept for input. An example of this is an early '90s video game: The Incredible Machine Is Back, Spiritually | WIRED Otherwise the obstacle is almost as large as the program writer: writing code to interpret verbal input.  Text input as a way of communicating with the program writing program comes close to a number of \"higher level\" languages ( Automatic programming) This link lists several packages which work at various levels of complexity: Acceleo is an open source code generator for Eclipse used to generate any textual language (Java, PHP, Python, etc.) from EMF models defined from any metamodel (UML, SysML, etc.).Actifsource is a plugin for Eclipse that allows graphical modelling and model-based code generation using custom templates.Altova MapForce is a graphical data mapping, conversion, and integration tool capable of generating application code in Java, C#, or C++ for executing recurrent transformations.CodeFluent Entities from SoftFluent is a graphical tool integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio that generates .NET source code, in C# or Visual Basic.DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit is a system for defining arbitrary domain specific languages and translating them to other languages.hprcARCHITECT (from MNB Technologies, Inc) is an artificial intelligence-based software development tool with a Virtual Whiteboard human interface. Language and technology agnostic, the tool's development was funded by the US Air Force to solve the problem of code generation for systems targeting mixed processor technologies.Spring Roo is an open source active code generator for Spring Framework based Javaapplications. It uses AspectJ mixins to provide separation of concerns during round-trip maintenance.RISE is a free information modeling suite for system development using ERD or UML. Database code generation for MySQL, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server. Persistence code generation for C# (.NET) and PHP including both SOAP and JSONstyle web services and AJAX proxy code.The Maple computer algebra system offers code generators optimizers with Fortran, C and Java. Mathematica and MuPAD have comparable interfaces.Screen Sculptor,[8] SoftCode,[9] UI Programmer,[10] and Genifer[11] are examples of pioneering program generators that arose during the mid-1980s through the early 1990s. They developed and advanced the technology of extendable, template based source code generators on a mass market scale.GeneXus is a Cross-Platform, knowledge representation-based, development tool,[1] mainly oriented to enterprise-class applications for Web applications, smart devices and the Microsoft Windows platform. A developer describes an application in a high-level, mostly declarative language, from which native code is generated for multiple environments;If I were personally going to attempt a project to develop a program to write programs, I would start with Automated Theorem Proving:Software creation is an economically important real world application of ATP. Although the use of ATP in software creation is in its infancy, there have already been some interesting results. The KIDSsystem developed at Kestrel Institute has been used to derive scheduling algorithms that have outperformed currently used algorithms. KIDS provides intuitive, high level operations for transformational development of programs from specifications. The Amphion project, sponsored by NASA, is used to determine appropriate subroutines to be combined to produce programs for satellite guidance. By encapsulating usable functionality in software components (e.g., subroutines, object classes), and then reusing those components, Amphion can develop software of greater functionality in less time than human programmers, with some assurance that the overall system is correct because it is built up from trusted components The Certifiable Synthesis project at NASA goes even further, generating code with annotations that can be used to extract ATP problems whose solution ensures various safety properties of the code.",

            "answer_text": "since you are the one writing the first program, doesn\u2019t that mean the second program is a programmed response, to the first? it seems to me, you are indirectly writing the second program. ask yourself this: can a computer, given just its own language, write its own program, a program responding to a problem? remember, it must first write a program, just to recognize, that a problem exists, in the first place? now, every programmer knows, computers are very good at string manipulation. so, in theory, given enough time, the computer could manipulate it\u2019s language, into a possible solution. but, how would the computer know how to manipulate? and, how would the computer know, it had arrived at the answer, to a problem it couldn\u2019t recognize, in the first place. at the present time, computers can manipulate strings of code, that have already been written. but, first, the lines of code must be written. what exists today, is a simulation of thought. branching into likely responses, serves as a kind of \u2018magic.\u2019 it seems like the computer, is reading our thoughts. but, it is by no means original thinking.
