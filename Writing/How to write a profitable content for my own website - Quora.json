First, it makes your writing swimmable and therefore easier to read. People are more likely to share things that are easy to read. Also, having headers and sub-headers increases the keyword saturation.  2. Add links to previous content Links to high-quality, reputable websites increases the validity of your own website. The better the links, the higher your page will rank in search results. Also, using credible sources within the body of your text creates trust with your readers. 3. Optimize the length of your article Google gives priority to longer articles, but if it\u2019s too long, you\u2019ll lose readers. Your articles should be a minimum of 300 words.

So, in a 500-word article, you should include 5-10 keywords. 4. Choose your keywords wisely Before you ever sit down to write your article, decide which keywords you want to incorporate. You can either pay a marketing service to do this for you, or you can choose the keywords based on the results of planned keyword searches. If you haven\u2019t done this process just yet, you should start with this guide to keyword research. When you start writing, use the keywords in the title, headers, tags, and main text. 5.

You can optimize the photos by adding keywords to the image files and providing the ALT tags. Make sure to also optimize the size of the photo. Pictures that are too large will slow load time and hurt the SEO. Make the image as small as possible without compromising the visibility or quality. 6.

Write high-quality content This one should be pretty self-evident, but it isn\u2019t always applied. The best way to get people to read and engage with your content is to write content that is useful and entertaining. Search engines reward sites that have high-quality, relevant content.
