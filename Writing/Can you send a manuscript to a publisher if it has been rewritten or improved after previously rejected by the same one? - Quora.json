            "answer_text": "Yes, especially if the prior rejection came with an open-ended invitation to re-submit. Sometimes, editors can see that something has raw potential, but they know they can\u2019t devote the time to developing that manuscript themselves. So they say something like, \u201cWe kind of like it, but give it some more work and we\u2019ll have another look at it.\u201d Sometimes, editors have reasons for rejecting a work unrelated to the manuscript: a glut of accepted manuscripts; a full editorial calendar; special themed issues that don\u2019t fit with the manuscript; budget limitations and downsizing. You could be Neil Gaiman and your story could still be rejected. In these cases, a new look at the revised manuscript might come at a better time for the editor, and be accepted. Of course, if you just piss people off by being hard to work with, it won\u2019t matter how many revisions you do. Until the editors at that market turn over, there\u2019s little chance they\u2019d revisit the revised manuscript of a proven jackass. \u201cDress for the job you want\u201d applies as much to one\u2019s demeanor and attitude as it does to the cut of one\u2019s clothes.

            "answer_text": "My feeling is you only do this if you have been invited to. Like, if someone says \u2018if you fix this thing I would be happy to look at this again\u2019, which to be honest is something that I, as an editor, do very rarely. I don\u2019t really want to get into a kind of treadmill where I reject something and it keeps coming back with incremental changes and I keep rejecting it. If I think that I can back-and-forth a book into being worth publishing, then I will look to acquire rather than reject it. This does mean of course that your book needs to be in the absolute best shape you can get it to the first time round, because you will often get just the one shot at it. ",
