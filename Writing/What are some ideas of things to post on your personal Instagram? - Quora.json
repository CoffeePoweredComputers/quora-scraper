            "answer_text": "Personal Instagram -- For your personal Instagram, the next questions is what interests you, what is your age group, are all your followers to be personal as well? If you are doing personal only with personal friends, then you life is what you would be sharing, people, friends, pets, your hometown area, etc. If you are still in school, then your friends, your school, your interests. If you interest is cars, post cars, if your interest is poetry, post poems. Your instagran is the flavor of you. If food is your life, then post food!  I take pictures, crop them to fit Instagram and post away.  For me pictures from the zoo and pictures of sunsets have been popular.  Create a personal hashtag, and add hashtags to connect with your intended audience.  For me I use #charleytravels for some examples of my take.  There is no wrong answer. Challenge yourself to take and post a picture every day or so and see where it leads you. The world has interesting shots everywhere. ",
