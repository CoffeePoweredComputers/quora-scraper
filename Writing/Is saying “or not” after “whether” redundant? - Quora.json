            "answer_text": "It is often redundant, but not always. The usage of \u201cwhether\u201d inherently implies a binary choice, so \u201cor not\u201d isn\u2019t necessary all the time. When there is an obvious choice, simply using whether is more appropriate. Whether or not it arrives on the 4th doesn\u2019t matter to me.Whether it arrives on the 4th doesn\u2019t matter to me.These two statements mean something slightly different. The first is the binary choice of the 4th being OK for it to arrive. Turns out it doesn\u2019t matter. The second is less of a binary choice and more of a vague condition where any of the parts of the sentence could be different. Whether it or its twin arrives on the 4th doesn\u2019t matter to me.Whether it arrives or departs on the 4th doesn\u2019t matter to me.Whether it arrives on the 4th or the 5th doesn\u2019t matter to me.Another way of using whether is a bit more problematic in terms of redundancy. When you\u2019re talking about a binary choice that might or might not factor in to a larger condition, it can be more confusing not to include the \u201cor not\u201d. I always see myself as ugly, whether I really am.I always see myself as ugly, whether or not I really am.The condition of being ugly is treated as a binary condition, but the usage of whether without the \u201cor not\u201d here doesn\u2019t sound right.

This will seem like an odd introduction, but\u2026 There are times a person will use or abuse a turn of phrase due to their background and community, but it\u2019s condescending to assume that\u2019s the same as being ignorant or \u201cwrong\u201d. A privileged person is insufficiently committed to inclusion and diversity if he allows a turn of phrase like this to distract him from what the writer/speaker has to say. Dropping the \u201cor not\u201d from \u201cwhether or not\u201d subtly communicates that a matter isn\u2019t quite binary, and its most important aspect might not be one of exactly two possible conditions or outcomes. A simple example: Q: Did you follow the instructions? A: I don\u2019t really know whether or not I did but it\u2019s done and it works. Typically it means the person followed the instructions, but some things were unclear and so it\u2019s possible a minor step was done differently than expected. Subtle humility. A: I don\u2019t really know whether I did but it\u2019s done and it works. Typically, the person felt the matter was simple enough that the instructions were infrequently consulted. Subtly cavalier. A person may choose their words more carefully than you (or they) consciously realize. Stop trying to find reasons to tell yourself that you\u2019re smarter than them. ",
