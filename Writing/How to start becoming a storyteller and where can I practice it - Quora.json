            "answer_text": "There are as many ways to be a storyteller as there are ways to tell stories. Each of us have a type of presentation skill or story art that is more related to who we are then who we think we should be. Sometimes as we 1st develop as a storyteller we copy the people who we admire; but they are not always doing story the way we might best do it. Here are a a couple of the ways to develop your ability to tell stories. Find a small child who loves to tell stories and tell them a story every night till they are an adult.Get a dairy and write in it every day. Form a group that reads your best entry out of your dairies on a monthly bases.Draw for one hour a day and after three years try illustrating one of your favorite stories.Volunteer at your local library or school to tell stories to the youngest grade. Next month go back and tell stories to the next grade up. Repeat till you have performed to all grades up to 12th.Form a teacher-less writing class. Each person brings in enough copies of your short stories that everyone else can read it in class and mark it up and give feedback. Take turns presenting and reading portions. Everyone writes that reactions down on your work.Go to open mic events near you and tell stories. Start small and keep going\u2026Make You-tube videos - 1 a day, Repeat\u2026etc\u2026The list is endless because the possibilities are endless and limited only by your ability to imagine your self.

            "answer_text": "Your question\u2026 it is\u2026 sad. Because why do people need to ask such a thing? Why do people need to go on a site just to ask how to become a storyteller? How do you become a storyteller? You tell stories. Tell them to your Grandma. Tell them to your younger sibling. Tell them to your aunt. Tell them to your friends. Tell them to a random person on public transportation. Write them down and post them on websites. Start a blog. Tell your stories until people look at you and say \"Here comes the storyteller\u201d. And, as long as you continu to enjoy it, never stop. ",
