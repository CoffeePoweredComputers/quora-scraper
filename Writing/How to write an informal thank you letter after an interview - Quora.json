            "answer_text": "Hello! I am glad you are asking that question because many candidates are not taking this as an opportunity to separate themselves from the rest of the other candidates. If you follow up with the recruiter as well as the interviewers with a thank you note, you will be already ahead of some of the other candidates. To help you with this, my advice is to first jot down the names of the people who interviewed you and then afterwards, send them a thank you note. You could send them an email or a personalized thank you card. Overall, the objective is to show the interviewer you are interested in the position and appreciate their time. Be genuine about your message as well. Feel free to go here to find out more about this topic: http://www.myinterviewinsider.com/interviewthankyouletter/ Here is an example of a thank you email that you can customize to fit your situation: Thank you (insert interviewer name) for your time and consideration of me for the role of (list job here).
