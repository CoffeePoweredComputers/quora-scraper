            "answer_text": "Well....that depends. First you have to figure out whether you happen to already have a contract that you can use as the basis for your new contract. At law firms, where we frequently write similar contracts for similar situations over and over again, we take a template and adjust it from there. If you are writing a contract from scratch, that is different. You have to go through a process. How long that process is depends on what you want to accomplish and any laws that impact what you want to accomplish. So.  What do you want to accomplish? What are your goals? What are the issues. You figure those things out.What is the law? Aside from offer, acceptance and consideration, what laws might be implicated in the area in which you are contracting. For example, if it is a lease, there are landlord/tenant laws that have specific requirements you must obey.What are the people supplying for each other? I.e. what is the offer, what is the consideration and what is required to get it. You need to know all of the details and expectations. Everything has to be spelled out.Only once you have reviewed these (and other issues) would you actually sit down and start to write. Next, since you don't have a contract already, you ask your lawyer friends if they have any contracts you can begin with. If they don't have any, you look for a book with a form. None of those things? You sigh and start writing.Contracts are generally broken up into numbered paragraphs. So you start by creating an outline of what the contract will address. You keep adding things until you think you have everything. Then you start filling in the language. Then you realize you missed something and add it in. Then you realize, oh that paragraph should go there, let me move it. And then you realize you missed something else, so you put then in. And then you realize something is redundant, so you take that out. And so on. Then, you add a statement that says something like, and if any of this contract should be found invalid, the rest of the contract still works. Then you send the contract to opposing counsel who messes with it a while. Then he sends it back. And you accept some of his changes and you refuse some of them, and you make some more. And then you go back and forth for a while. Then you go to the clients. And they say, uh no, I don't like this. Or I don't like that. So the lawyers look at each other, and they go back to their computers and they make more changes. And they do that for a while.Then people sit down and sign the contract.There you go. Contract. ",
