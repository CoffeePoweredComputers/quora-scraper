            "answer_text": "I\u2019d suggest you probably have two options. The first is to create a character who is - for want of a better term - \u201cauthentically Aboriginal\u201d. This would be pretty much required if you were writing historical fiction anywhere up to about the turn of the last century, and may well make sense even more recently than that. To do that, you\u2019ll need to do a lot of research into what the local indigenous people were in the area you\u2019re setting your story. What did they do? What did they eat? What did they believe? What did they call themselves? What of their language has survived? And so on. It\u2019s very much not the kind of thing you want to get wrong, either, since there\u2019ll be specialists (and, particularly if the indigenous people of the region have survived, everyday people) who\u2019ll waste no time telling you that you\u2019re wrong. The other option is to write a character who is - again, for want of a better term - \u201cincidentally Aboriginal\u201d. Here, you\u2019re writing about someone who is whatever they might be - a teacher, a doctor, a stay-at-home father, you name it - and they just happen to be indigenous into the bargain. If you\u2019ve watched the series Doctor Doctor, think of Miranda Tapsell\u2019s character - she\u2019s the love interest of one of the main characters, but I don\u2019t believe that the fact that she\u2019s indigenous ever comes up in the script. She\u2019s just who she is. Obviously, you could have the character discovering more of his or her indigenous heritage over the course of the story. Depending on how much of that heritage you want them to discover (or even how much of it still exists), that would require more or less research but could be a very effective plot. Otherwise, you could simply have them being whoever they are and doing whatever they do, but just having dark skin, just as much as another character might have red hair or green eyes. ",

            "answer_text": "Best to check what Aboriginal writers have to say about the topic. Check out \u2018Writing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Characters in Fiction, published by the State Library of Queensland. It has a lot of links to articles with Aboriginal perspectives that are important to keep in mind. It is also a good idea to ask an Aboriginal writer read your draft and give you feedback regarding any cultural sensitivities. ",
