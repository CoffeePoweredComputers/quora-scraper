            "answer_text": "It's my first time to hear this word but I googled it up and found that - Article Rewriter is an app that turns existing content into hundreds of unique content. Tsk! I don't know if writers these days would appreciate this. It's just like the case of one who made a template for writing news. Since the creator does not understand reporting, the template he made is of course deficient. It has no place for dates - that is quite important when it comes to news. A group used that template for their reporting on their website. And now all their reports on that website have no dates. The reports keep saying \u201cthis year\u201d and \u201cthis year\u201d every year, but one cannot tell what year. When the people in charge were told about the lack of dates, they reasoned that they were using a template. They also did not mind because they were writing, but were not schooled as journalists. Article Rewriter? Perhaps people who just need to \u201cwrite content\u201d would appreciate this. (Yes, content is what \u201cwriters\u201d call articles and essays). But not those who need to crack their brains to experience writing as an art that one has to growth up with. Writing involves sacrifice. Your writing grows up with you. There are hurdles that you have to tackle along the way. That's the reason writing sticks with you as you stick with it. Writing is not done with just an application. But for those who need it on the fast lane, perhaps an article rewriter would do. That\u2019s why there is an article rewriter because most probably the article belonged to someone and one needed to rewrite the ideas in it in a different way and presto! There\u2019s another \u201cowner.\u201d If the article indeed belonged to you, you wouldn\u2019t need an application to rewrite it. That\u2019s the logic of this thing. If I were a teacher of today, I would be wary of papers turned in, having merely used an article rewriter. There's actually no substantial work involved with an article rewriter. It's just the churning of an application. ",

However, I helped a lot when I didn't know how to write at the beginning and when I was too late to write! For beginners I think this is a very good writing assistant: 1. It has a professional editing interface, no worse than professional typesetting, the most advanced rotating tree function, you can directly segment the article, you can quickly find what you need to edit according to the beginning of the sentence or the sentence you marked Content, avoid using the mouse to slide up and down, and never find what you need! In addition, there are functions such as bold subtitles, capitalized first letters, and word lock protection! 2. Support sentence rewriting, use artificial intelligence and natural language to write clear and smooth sentences, you can choose the degree you need to rewrite, and choose whether it is more readable! 3. In case of emergency, you can upload folders directly and rotate articles in batches! Or in the editing interface, paste the article, the same article can be rewritten into a thousand different articles! In short, writing cannot rely entirely on writing tools, but it is an indispensable writing aid!  ",

Here are samples of the works done by this service: Before -  After -  Using online tools isn\u2019t always helpful too because they are just tools(that usually change words but leave other stuff the same), also after spinning your text you will still need to proofread and edit it in order to avoid common mistakes. That\u2019s why I would also recommend you to invest some time into learning how to paraphrase (at least some basic tips).

People who paraphrase by hand think this the best way to ensure quality. It can be the safest way to rewrite documents, an article or any piece of text; however, it can take several hours or even days to complete depending on the length of the text and the experience of the writer.  On the other hand, there are a lot of people who are lacking the time or good writing skills to paraphrase the content. Most of the people prefer to save their time and find a tool that could do the rewriting job for them. An article rewriter is a tool that helps to rewrite the text for you as it understands the original text the user has inserted. Such a tool can be very useful in the following areas: Time can be very limited. This is one of the major reasons why an article writer can be so efficient and useful. It will help the user save a lot of time.Some people have poor writing skills and to make sure the quality of the job, they decide to use such a tool. Users will only need to fix some minor errors.",

Yes, they can be used when you need to rewrite something urgently. But in any case, you will have to review this content and rewrite it again.  I think the problem is that the article rewriting tool can't make such kind of paper that will be rewritten in such a way so that it will be readable and understandable for the audience. So it is better to rewrite the content manually when you will feel that it is written on the understandable tone and words you have chosen are related to the current field you are writing about. But the rewriting tools have also their benefits. But as I saw it is better to choose the tools provided by the rewriting services. They can check your papers at once. The benefits of manual rewriting: you produce absolutely unique content;your paper will be understandable by the audience;you train your research and writing skills.",

            "answer_text": "Hi, there\u2019s absolutely no tool in existence that can substitute a writer. A lot of people who\u2019re looking for content writing services, believe they can save themselves some money by using a tool to generate content instead of hiring a writer. A tool can only \u2018generate\u2019 content, not write it. It\u2019s not advisable to use it, if your aim is to build an audience and improve SEO. But if you\u2019re trying to hand in a last minute assignment, and think it\u2019s better off scoring 10 than a 0, maybe that\u2019s a situation wherein you can use it. My suggestion: Use Spinner Chief service. It\u2019s a good one. You also get a 3-day trial to test out how it fares. Make sure you cancel before the end of the 3-day period to prevent your credit card from being charged automatically. I\u2019ve also tried WordAi, but I find SC much better and easy to work with. Again, do NOT use spinning tools \u2013 EVER! Use at your own risk! ",

There are 3 reasons as follow: Fast Spinner Chief can spin/rewrite hundreds of new articles in minutes, it even spin/rewrites one article to 10 new articles in seconds. Spinner Chief is faster than Wordai, Spin Rewriter and The Best Spinner after my test on all of them. Unique Spinner Chief can spin/rewrite articles to the most human readable and unique, it has applied the best natural language analysis and artificial intelligence techniques to restructure your articles. Spinner Chief more unique than Spin Rewriter and The Best Spinner. Cheap Spinner Chief just cost $34 for per month, which is cheaper than Wordai $49.95 per month, cheaper than Spin Rewriter $37.00 per month. ",

            "answer_text": "Using article spinner software is considered lazy and downright unethical. And although it may fool plagiarism tools and search engines, the content is low-quality and often unreadable. An article spinning software generates new content by replacing words and phrases with other synonymous words and phrases. But spun articles are hardly readable. If 'unique\" is all you're going for, you can use spinning software. But if you want high-quality content that will engage your readers, I would recommend rewriting the article manually. Here are a few tips to help you along the way. \u2022 Read and understand the content first \u2022 Rewrite paragraph by paragraph \u2022 Rewrite the idea, not the words \u2022 Use a plagiarism checker such as Copyscape or Grammarly tool \u2022 Proofread to correct grammatical errors If rewriting the content is too much work, or if English is not your first language, you can always outsource the work to a professional content rewriter.
