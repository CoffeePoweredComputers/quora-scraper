            "answer_text": "I have read some of Coelho\u2019s work , I like The Alchemist and Manual of Warrior of Light over others. If I have to pick the best it would be \u201cManual of Warrior of Light\u201d The book is about every person who is fighting his share of war , a \u201cWarrior of light\u201d and the book describes him and his conduct. I would copy paste the prologue, just to give you a gist of how extraordinary the work is. I am sure it would be an enlightening journey if you read the book 'Just off the beach to the west of the village lies an island, and on it is a vast temple with many bells,' said the woman. The boy noticed that she was dressed strangely and had a veil covering her head. He had never seen her before. 'Have you ever visited that temple?' she asked. 'Go there and tell me what you think of it?' Seduced by the woman's beauty, the boy went to the place she had indicated. He sat down on the beach and stared out at the horizon, but he saw only what he always saw: blue sky and ocean. Disappointed, he walked to a nearby fishing village and asked if anyone there knew about an island and a temple. 'Oh, that was many years ago, when my great-grandparents were alive,' said an old fisherman. 'There was an earthquake, and the island was swallowed up by the sea. But although we can no longer see the island, we can still hear the temple bells when the ocean sets them swinging down below.' The boy went back to the beach and tried to hear the bells. He spent the whole afternoon there, but all he heard was the noise of the waves and the cries of the seagulls. When night fell, his parents came looking for him. The following morning, he went back to the beach; he could not believe that such a beautiful woman would have lied to him. If she ever returned, he could tell her that, although he had not seen the island, he had heard the temple bells set ringing by the motion of the waves. Many months passed; the woman did not return and the boy forgot all about her; now he was convinced that he needed to discover the riches and treasures in the submerged temple. If he could hear the bells, he would be able to locate it and salvage the treasure hidden below. He lost interest in school and even in his friends. He became the butt of all the other children's jokes. They used to say: 'He's not like us. He prefers to sit looking at the sea because he's afraid of being beaten in our games.' And they all laughed to see the boy sitting on the shore. Although he still could not hear the old temple bells ringing, the boy nevertheless learned about other things. He began to realise that he had grown so used to the sound of the waves that he was no longer distracted by them. Soon after that, he became used to the cries of the seagulls, the buzzing of the bees and the wind blowing amongst the palm trees. Six months after his first conversation with the woman, the boy could sit there oblivious to all other noises, but he still could not hear the bells from the drowned temple. Fishermen came and talked to him, insisting that they had heard the bells. But the boy never did. Some time later, however, the fishermen changed their tune: 'You spend far too much time thinking about the bells beneath the sea. Forget about them and go back to playing with your friends. Perhaps it's only fishermen who can hear them.' After almost a year, the boy thought: 'Perhaps they're right. I would do better to grow up and become a fisherman and come down to this beach every morning,because I've come to love it here.' And he thought too: 'Perhaps it's just another legend and the bells were all shattered during the earthquake and have never rung out since.' That afternoon, he decided to go back home. He walked down to the ocean to say goodbye. He looked once more at the natural world around him and because he was no longer concerned about the bells, he could again smile at the beauty of the seagulls' cries, the roar of the sea and the wind blowing in the palm trees. Far off, he heard the sound of his friends playing and he felt glad to think that he would soon resume his childhood games. The boy was happy and - as only a child can - he felt grateful for being alive. He was sure that he had not wasted his time, for he had learned to contemplate Nature and to respect it. Then, because he was listening to the sea, the seagulls, the wind in the palm trees and the voices of his friends playing, he also heard the first bell. And then another. And another, until, to his great joy, all the bells in the drowned temple were ringing. Years later, when he was a grown man, he returned to the village and to the beach of his childhood. He no longer dreamed of finding treasure at the bottom of the sea; perhaps that had all been a mere product of his imagination, and he had never in fact heard the submerged bells ring out on one lost childhood afternoon. Even so, he decided to walk for a while along the beach, to listen to the noise of the wind and to the cries of the seagulls. Imagine his surprise when, there on the beach, he saw the woman who had first spoken to him about the island and its temple. 'What are you doing here?' he asked. 'I was waiting for you,' she replied. He noticed that, despite the passing years, the woman looked exactly the same; the veil hiding her hair had not faded with time. She handed him a blue notebook full of blank pages. 'Write: a warrior of light values a child's eyes because they are able to look at the world without bitterness. When he wants to find out if the person beside him is worthy of his trust, he tries to see him as a child would.' 'What is a warrior of light?' 'You already know that,' she replied with a smile. 'He is someone capable of understanding the miracle of life, of fighting to the last for something he believes in - and of hearing the bells that the waves sets ringing on the seabed.' He had never thought of himself as a warrior of light. The woman seemed to read his thoughts. 'Everyone is capable of these things. And though no one thinks of themselves as a warrior of light, we all are.' He looked at the blank pages in the notebook. The woman smiled again. 'Write about that warrior,' she said\u201d If you have completed the prologue , I think you would agree with me that it\u2019s worth reading. Now some more inspiration \u201cA warrior of light knows that certain moments repeat themselves. He often finds himself faced by the same problems and situations, and seeing these difficult situations return, he grows depressed, thinking that he is incapable of making any progress in life. 'I've been through all this before,' he says to his heart. 'Yes, you have been through all this before,' replies his heart. 'But you have never been beyond it.' Then the warrior realises that these repeated experiences have but one aim: to teach him what he does not want to learn\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The Alchemist And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.   2.  Veronika Decides to Die The two hardest tests on the spiritual road are the patience to wait for the right moment and the courage not to be disappointed with what we encounter.People never learn anything by being told, they have to find out for themselves.Be crazy! But learn how to be crazy without being the center of attention. Be brave enough to live different.You have two choices, to control your mind or to let your mind control you.   3.  Eleven Minutes  Everything tells me that I am about to make a wrong decision, but making mistakes is just part of life. What does the world want of me? Does it want me to take no risks, to go back to where I came from because I didn't have the courage to say \"yes\" to life?When I had nothing to lose, I had everything. When I stopped being who I am, I found myself.When we meet someone and fall in love, we have a sense that the whole universe is on our side. And yet if something goes wrong, there is nothing left! How is it possible for the beauty that was there only minutes before to vanish so quickly? Life moves very fast. It rushes from heaven to hell in a matter of seconds.Anyone who is in love is making love the whole time, even when they're not. When two bodies meet, it is just the cup overflowing. They can stay together for hours, even days. They begin the dance one day and finish it the next, or--such is the pleasure they experience--they may never finish it. No eleven minutes for them.No one loses anyone, because no one owns anyone. That is the true experience of freedom: having the most important thing in the world without owning it.  4.  By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible. If he has to make a choice, may he make it now. Then I will either wait for him or forget him.But love is always new. Regardless of whether we love once, twice, or a dozen times in our life, we always face a brand-new situation. Love can consign us to hell or to paradise, but it always takes us somewhere. We simply have to accept it, because it is what nourishes our existence. If we reject it, we die of hunger, because we lack the courage to stretch out a hand and pluck the fruit from the branches of the tree of life. We have to take love where we find it, even if that means hours, days, weeks of disappointment and sadness.       The moment we begin to seek love, love begins to seek us. And to save us. In real life, love has to be possible. Even if it is not returned right away, love can only survive when the hope exists that you will be able to win over the person you desire.  5.   Brida When you find your path, you must not be afraid. You need to have sufficient courage to make mistakes. Disappointment, defeat, and despair are the tools God uses to show us the way.Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have Faith.How much I missed, simply because I was afraid of missing it. These were the Paulo Coelho books that I read and fell in love with . Happy reading !  ",
