            "answer_text": "When I was living in China, I just chose a \"fun\" name that was in a form that was easy to remember.  I also wanted a name in the standard 3 character form for most Chinese names, with a common surname. Many Westerners try to choose names that match their given names, but I didn't bother and had no problems remembering my own Chinese name or having people use it to refer to me. My Chinese name is Gao1 Jin1Xiong2: \u9ad8\u91d1\u718a.  It literally means \"Tall Golden Bear\".  I'm not terribly tall, but I'm from California and attended and worked at UC Berkeley (Golden Bears), so the name had useful \"meaning\"... And having people call me \u5c0f\u718a (little bear) was always fun... Edit after question update:  if you're a performer, I'd suggest picking a stage name that reflects something about your act as a brand name.  You can work with a Chinese person in your field to pick a good name. ",

            "answer_text": "A friend of mine recently had a boy and we, a bunch of nearly 10 guys, helped with naming the little baby. We came up with dozens of names, and crossed them one by one off the list for a variety of reasons, mostly for bad possible associative meanings induced by pronunciation, in mandarin and in the dialect.  The names were also evaluated in reversed givenname-surname order, in case unexpected insinuation might arise. A case in point is \u6731\u8427\u6728, which, when written as Xiaomu Zhu, immediately alludes to \u5c0f\u6bcd\u732a (a little sow, or a little female pig). His surname is to blame for causing the trouble, for it rhymes with \u732a (pig). In my friend's case, his surname \u5434, which rhymes with \u65e0 (Wu, meaning no, without, nothing), which turns a beautiful given name into its antonyn. My point is, be careful when giving yourself a surname. Keep away with these trouble makers, like names associated with livestocks. Google the whole name, in Chinese character and in Pinyin, in both givenname-surname and surname-givenname orders, and examine what you will get.  Just as you may find it weird to meet a Chinese guy named Harry Potter or Barrack Obama, a Chinese laughs when you introduce yourself as \u5b59\u609f\u7a7a ( Sun Wukong, the Monkey King), or \u674e\u514b\u5f3a (Li Keqiang, the incumbent premier).  But \u514b\u5f3a is actually a common name for guys. Just pick another surname.  Personally I would not suggest \u9a6c\u6587\u6717: neither \u9a6c nor \u6587\u6717 pleases my ears. Not that it is a terrible name, but I simlly don't like it. Of course the decision is yours to make. It dawned on me that your name might be Marvin, which is why your friend suggested \u9a6c (horse). But \u6587 is also a good surname. It means good (literature) and sounds good.  Picking a name is a lot of work and is never easy. I wish you good luck in finding a good one. ",
