            "answer_text": "So, there are a bunch of different ways to write down or express your gratitude. I want to push the idea that you show your gratitude to the person or people you are thanking\u2014if it is your parents (and hopefully, even though family is complicated, I hope there is some there) write your gratitude into a letter and send it to them, even if you live in the same house. Letters and correspondence, on paper, in an envelope now might seem archaic, but there is a joy that comes from opening a gift. Hand writing something also has the weird power of showing that your actual hand was used to show the gratitude. If your thankfulness is going to someone who is no longer here, I would still hand write the note, then read aloud, usually in a special place. Good luck ",
