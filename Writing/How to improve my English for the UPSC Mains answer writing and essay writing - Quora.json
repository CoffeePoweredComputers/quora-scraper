All I would add is, try to use the posh words correctly and watch the spelling. Your computer should keep you out of trouble, at least where the spelling is concerned. Whether this counts as improving your English, I\u2019m not all that sure. Only you can decide whether you\u2019d benefit from a few classes. ",
