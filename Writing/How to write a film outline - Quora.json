            "answer_text": "I have never done it myself, but I will talk using common sense. When you are talking about the movie in question don't be waaaaay to specific, don't give too much details because when you do so you're telling the whole story, and that's not what you want. The goal si to tell just enough so that the reader gets interested in the movie, so that they have a general idea of what would be about, using certain adjectives that could lead to the genre, or even detailing what parts of the movie make it so great ( the way it tells the story, the way the characters work with each other, the order of events\u2026) That would make it at least a decent.

            "answer_text": " TL; DR: Any way you want. LONG ANSWER: This question was asked at a screenwriting website: Question: What is a treatment vs. an outline? In my experience, the term \u201ctreatment\u201d gets used in many different ways, everything from a 2\u20134 page story overview to a full-blown 40 page (or more) story summary. The latter is more \u2018official.\u2019 In fact, \u201ctreatment\u201d is a designation for an actual deliverable per the WGA Minimum Basic Agreement (you can download a PDF of the 2008 MBA here) with the minimum payment for an \u201coriginal treatment\u201d ranging from $26,495 to $43,875.An outline is different: That a writer does for him/herself. Thus there are no rules, only what the writer finds works for them. As opposed to a treatment, which is coherent and readable, an outline will usually only make sense to the writer because it is a short-hand version of the story, a scene-by-scene breakdown\u200a\u2014\u200afrom the opening scene step by step all the way through to the closing scene.So a treatment is a document that you might sell to a producer; but an outline is like a personal sketch of a story.
