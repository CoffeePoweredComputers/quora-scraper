            "answer_text": "Life. Stuff always interferes with the work of our heart. Blogs are no exception! Fortunately, I do have a (slightly) paying gig. I blog for an online art marketing newsletter, in addition to my own blog. So I have a deadline every week. That makes it easier to prioritize writing when things get hectic! But still, there are times where life does a mega-dump on us. There is simply no way we can move forward until we find our way through. What I\u2019ve found is, after the storm is over, there are plenty of thoughts and insights gained along the way. That\u2019s when I realize writing about them will not only help me get back to my happy place, it will make a great blog post! So the short answer is, if we constantly share our journey as we go, we will never run out of things to write about, as long as we keep looking for the tiny gift even in the middle of despair. ",

            "answer_text": "I think my biggest set back is procrastination. I have several ideas and i fight within myself, first, which would make a better blog, and second, are the ideas good enough. I\u2019ve often written many posts only to delete them at the last minute. I try to to save all my posts now, just in case i change my mind. I find this is where google docs can be very handy. Lack of confidence can also be a big set back, something I\u2019m working on\u2026for 11 years now! I use to introduce blogs on Social media by saying, here is my latest post, so if you are suffering from insomnia, maybe you\u2019d like to give it a read! ",
