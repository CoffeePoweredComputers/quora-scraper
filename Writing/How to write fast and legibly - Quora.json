            "answer_text": "Whether you need to write more quickly while note-taking or you need to hash out that essay before it's due, writing faster isn't very difficult. You can learn a shorthand system for taking notes, or you can learn how to manage your time so that you sit down and write. Make outlines. As long as you know how best you remember things, use keywords instead of trying to write word for word what your professor or interviewee is saying. Use symbols. Make up some symbols for important concepts related to what you're doing. You already probably do this to an extent \u2013 using \"&\" for \"and,\" \"+\" for \"plus,\" &c., &c. Well, don't just stop there! No matter what you're doing, you will end up using some words and nouns much more often than others. Learn a shorthand writing system. This is by far the best way to write faster. Using shorthand, your written speed may be able to, if you work hard at it, reach 200 wpm \u2013 the speed of a court stenographer! ",
