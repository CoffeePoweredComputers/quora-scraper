            "answer_text": "At the time, the stylistic trend in art was turning from Classicism (epic and mythological themes) toward Naturalism and Realism (more accurate depictions of what could actually be seen or experienced). In visual art, this led to more intimate portraiture, painted-on-the-spot landscapes and still life. In literature, the author strove to paint a vivid \"word picture\" that set the scene in such living detail, you could imagine being there.  Whereas these days, writers tend to emphasize actions in order to \"show, don't tell\" (why write out that your character is angry, when you can communicate that by having her slam a door?), but Victorian-era writers wanted to show you BY telling you--every detail about the room's furnishings, sizes, colors and smells; every bit of mental wrangling a conflicted character might go through before choosing his words--it certainly WAS rich, but boy, it could be wordy.
