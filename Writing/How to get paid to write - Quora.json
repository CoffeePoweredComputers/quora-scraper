            "answer_text": "I agree with Daniel. Here is how it works for me as a freelance copywriter... My clients have a message to communicate. One, for example, makes office printers. Essentially, my job is to 'translate' from the voice of the expert to the language of the layman (customer). To do this, I have to ask lots of questions to understand what the benefits of the technology are and why someone would want to buy it.  In other words, I don't need to be an expert in the field, but I do need to be able to empathise with the customer. Clearly, marketing skills and experience are important in my particular job. I have written for companies that design, manufacture or provide: aircraft carriers, radar, missile systems, a children's nursery, an adult escort agency, fire extinguishers, CCTV, TV screens, sonar, flight simulators, Apps, cars, rail signalling systems and loads more. I am not an expert in any of these areas! If you have no marketing skills then you will struggle with copywriting. So you may want to follow the route of Danielle and write user guides and manuals etc. Whichever route you eventually choose, try not to get locked into one subject as an 'expert'. Variety makes the job much more fun. If you don't have a portfolio, try offering to write for free. Or, better yet, write 'on spec' - the client only pays if they decide to use what you have written. In either case you will be able to build a portfolio and it may well lead to paid work very early on. Also, try to master as many styles and media as you can. As a writer, it is best to be versatile rather than over-specialised. I wish you the very best. Writing is a great career! ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you're wanting to earn by doing what you love. Most people who have replied to this questions are all right. But I find a lacunae in touching upon the basics. I am going to assume, though, that you are a beginner in the writing business and my answer will be based on that. Make a portfolio - Sure, they all say that. But what is a portfolio? It is a collection of all things you have written - for yourself and for others. Focus on things you have written for others. The big question. How do you write for others? How do you make a portfolio? I.) Magazines:  Great way to start. Pick up a local magazine of your desired topic from local store. You need not pick up fashion for men if you do not know the F of fashion. Pick up something else. May be cars magazine, may be Lifestyle magazine that has a lot of restaurant reviews.  Research: Try to decipher the tone of articles in that magazine. Can you manage to write like that about something you know? What is the writing audience like? Are they old people? Middle aged women? Middle aged unisex? Before all this, read the names of the authors of every article in the magazine. Are the authors same for many articles? Then chances are that they don't accept articles from freelancers like you. Choose another mag., till you find one that accepts freelance stuff. There are many! Choose your topic: Let's say you chose a magazine and want to write on gardening tips. Now chose a specific topic. Say: Flower cutting tips (this may be a silly example, but the idea is to be specific with your knowledge). Write you \"pitch e-mail\": Pitch your idea to the editor. This will be a summary and outline of your article that you will submit to the magazine.The editor's e-mail is available on the magazine inside front cover, or anywhere within the magazine (sometimes the editorial information page is placed in middle of the mag. randomly. I don't know why magazines do that).Be as clear, professional and direct as you can in your pitch. If editor replies to your pitch with a yes(can take days, sometimes weeks. These guys are really busy), then write the article. Make sure you follow the tone of other articles in the mag. Revise the article for zero grammatical errors and send it soon to the editor. Note: This can be a long process, hence try doing this with multiple editors of different magazines at the same time. One out of 10 generally reply with a yes if your topic(s) are strong enough. Writing 10 pitches won't consume a lot of time. Try doing this for all local mags first so that you can get your name into the print publishing world. Once you publish, you can save those magazines for yourself, and try bigger magazines, professional blogs, and then there are many avenues.  I just told you how to make your portfolio, because I think there are experts who say, \"Hey make a portfolio and a website and then promote it to make good money with your writing.\" That's cool. But if you don't know where to put your first step, you me be stranded in the same block forever. II) Newspapers:  If you have a friend, colleague or someone who can connect you to newspaper editor (alrernatively, you may even e-mail the newspaper editor, but it is little difficult to break into news publication), then you can follow the same steps as you did for the magazine, send the newspaper editors pitches of your article idea and outline, or the whole article, as per their request.  III) Blogs:  No. I am not asking you to make your own blog, though that would be cool at some stage. We're talking about going on other blogs and writing for them. Blog owners are content hungry people, who either pay people to write for them, or give you the freedom to insert a link of your own blog/website into the article that you write for them, so that you get more views towards your website through that link.  Anyhow, focus on the blogs that pay.If they pay peanuts, accept it. You are not Stephen King yet. Always remember your objective: Making a Portfolio. Hence, accept low pay for a blog post if they allow you to write for them and publish your name (as a guest blogger).  The most important thing is to publish your name, which is why I suggest local magazine, e-magazine, and blogs to start with. Once you have a portfolio (which can be displayed in a number of ways, but that is stage 2), you can make quick bucks out of each article you write. It's a cool idea to ask these guys to write a 2 liner review for your article. You can take a screenshot of that, and save all of it in one place on your hard drive. That's a part of your portfolio too. Beware: People'll tell you to go to Elance, iwriter, freelancer.com and many other places to earn quickly with your writing, because there are a bunch of customers waiting for writers to write for them on these websites.However, I strongly suggest not to get into these, because here, you behave as a ghostwriter. I still find people giving advices to fresh writers to get into these places, but honestly it is not worth our time and intellect to be there, unless all other options fail (which I am sure they won't if you are persistent with right kind of efforts.) A ghostwriter is a writer who has no identity; who writes for money, but not for publicity. Your name will not be published; you will not be able to make a portfolio out of that (unless your employee writes a review for you. But honestly, it is better to have your own content than just reviews. The growth is faster that way). Google \"Blogs that pay writers\" or stuff like that to get started with blogs. For magazine research and breaking into print (highly recommend), visit your local store.  Try all options, and don't give up. For a starter, the article / pitch acceptance rate is 1 in 100 applications. But the fruits later are 10000 times sweeter (or whatever flavour you love.) ;-) Cheers. ",
