            "answer_text": "The key element is to bring the separate storylines together in terms of plot or theme or in some other interesting way. I\u2019m reading \u2018The Stand \u2018right now. King weaves dozen of storylines together; because they all concern a deadly virus\u2014there is that overarching theme\u2014it works\u2014at least on a certain level. Make sure the secondary storylines\u2014subplots\u2014are nearly as interesting as the primary storyline. Try to have different voices or style or character types with esch storyline/subplot. This diversity can be helpful. The other option\u2014which I use a lot\u2014is to stick to one storyline. This unified consciousness can allow for more character depth and development. ",

            "answer_text": "Use first person narration and switch narrators. For instance: Chapter one: Leah I ran. I didn\u2019t think. I just ran. Away from everything, away from home. I can\u2019t believe how stupid I was. Chapter two: Matthew Riley was waiting outside my door when I left. We walked to school. I thought I was the luckiest guy ever to have her as my girlfriend. This is not what your book should be exactly, these are just examples. Best of luck! ",
