            "answer_text": "Not with our current freezing method \u2014 with one caveot. In general, we.lack the ability to freeze a body in a way that doesn't cause ice to form in the cells, rupturing those cells, and turning the cadaver into a human soup. Also, freezing slowly the chemical decomposition process but it doesn't halt it entirely. Even if we were to freeze a body there would still be a steady degredation. The brain itself is an incredibly complicated device which may in fact work on the quantum level, which may mean that freezing the body and brain may result in a kind of decoupling of the delicate electrical network that made up the mind, and might create a diffefent person who was originally frozen. Now, there is a caveot to freezing: I have read that in some extreme cases of blood loss doctors have 'frozen\u2019 people by reducing their temperature to a level that ought to kill them, and in doing so it preserves them from dying of exsanguination. This procedure allows the doctors to fix the bleeding and supply the patient with blood and then thaw the patient. However, this procedure is a very short 'freeze\u2019, a highly experimental protocol performed only in certain hospitals, and only done in very specific circumstances when the patient is already in such risk of death that adding one more risk is meaningless.

They all said \u201cI\u2019m taking a rest, I\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d The sherpas would say, \u201cNo. You will die. Keep going, or go back down.\u201d The people would say \u201cIt\u2019s just a break. Go on without me.\u201d You know what happens next. They would \u2018fall asleep\u2019, and never wake up. You die when frozen. Unless scientists figure out how to preserve an unconscious human body while keeping it alive, then no. It is not possible for them to bring you back. That would mean bringing them back to life. You know only Jesus can do that. ",
