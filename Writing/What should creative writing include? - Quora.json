            "answer_text": " \u201c The deepening need for words to express our thoughts and feelings which, we are sure, are all the truth that we shall ever experience \u2026.makes us listen to words when we hear them ,loving them, and feeling them, makes us search the sound of them. Wallace Stevens [ The necessary Angel] . when we read a book a story a newspaper a novel, we want to connect on more than an intellectual or cerebral level. we have a deep human need to be affected by the words of the writer. we pick up a novel or a poem we want to experience what Wallace says is \u201c the sound of them\u201d . We want those words to make us laugh ,cry scream, pray, change something inside of us make us grow from something we resonated with by engaging all of our senses . when it comes to creative writing as Wallace says we want to search the sound of the of the words so they can have the most effective impact and engage a person mentally, emotionally , spiritually , physically, so that they will \u201c love them, and feel them\u201d. The words. Here are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to creating word people will want to keep \u201c hearing , feeling and loving \u201c from you. engage all five senses when it comes to describing things. not that all five senses have to be engaged every scene or sentence you describe . You want it to resonate with the reader .when it comes to describing try to describe something using action words. even when it comes to describing a person\u2019s clothing or physical attributes , do it while the person is engaging in some type of action. place the character in a particular setting where they are always doing something Remember . You are the creator . when it comes to your characters or your emotions about a particular issue . bring the character or issue to life . you as the writer must breath life into the story , the characters , the issues.metaphors and similes are critical to creating imagery for the reader to get your point across . when you read some of the best writers, novelist. they use these tools of communicating their stories very effective especially by placing them appropriately and effectively at the right time in a scene .I can go on and on about what\u2019s included , as can so many other people who may answer this question. a few books I highly recommend .1 Word painting . a guide to writing more descriptively . Rebecca McClanahan. 2 the scene book . a primer for the fiction writer . Sandra Scofield. 3 Make a scene . crafting a powerful story one scene at a time. Jordan E Rosenfeld 4 The portable MFA in creative writing. The New York writers workshop. Something I have personally done as you take note of the picture at the top of the page . I created using one of those 5 subject note books . and each section I developed words for each of our senses a section for seeing, hearing ,touching, smell , taste. and in each section I have been accumulating words that describe these 5 senses like my library of sense description . when I hear a sound or read something in the news paper or anything I read involving a description . I write in my library .. I go online occasionally and look for words ..so I can better describe effectively the sound of a car screeching , the sound of a machine gun, a guitar playing , sounds of war, sounds of animals, sounds of metal . foot steps , sounds of nature. the list can go on . for all five senses. and the different emotions in response to the senses . this is a lifetime endeavor. you never stop reading equals you never stop learning. I will leave you with the thoughts of Joseph Addison .\u201d Words , when well chosen , have so great a force in them , that a description often gives us more lively ideas than the sight of things themselves\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It seems like everyone on this blog is looking for some secret to writing. Did you ever think that perhaps you have nothing to say of value. That people aren't interested in your perceptions. I believe true writers never have a problem finding things to write about, but the fact that everyone thinks they are a writer makes for a smaller audience. If you want to read what a writer does about writing , read James Lee Burke, and his use of the English language. Try a little John Sanford or maybe some Mark Helprin, like \u201c A Soldier of the Great War\u201d The truly wonderful thing about writing is it can be about anything you desire. Tap into your passion. Try brutal honesty. Realize that when belief systems come into contact with reality. Reality wins every time. Now to the point of your question, every idea is a creative idea when its put down on paper, placed on canvass ,or applied to a practical or impractical use. We are all the artists of our own life. We share this great gift of thought. Perhaps, we should use it on occasion. ",
