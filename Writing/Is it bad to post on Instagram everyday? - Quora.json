            "answer_text": "Hi, I published an ebook about Instagram. I can answer your question. I also coach social media marketers. Instagram is a hub. First, it is a social hub. People go to socialize with people in their network. They socialize by chatting on DMs in small groups. You don\u2019t even need to share a photo or video to chat in a DM. Also, like any social media site, people show their latest photos and comment on each other\u2019s people catch up on recent activities this way. Next, Instagram is a financial hub. Marketers use Instagram to sell products and services. They do this through the use of Instagram Stories. The Swipe Up feature takes consumers to where they can purchase. Content marketers can also sponsor content or promotions. Marketers sponsor contests and giveaways on Instagram to add to the hype, the buzz. Sometimes the winner is chosen from people who share the content. Local business people can sponsor posts as well. For example, restaurant owners pay to sponsor promotions seen by people living in the vicinity of the restaurant. In addition, Instagram is a creative hub. People share aesthetically pleasing photos and videos. Users share these with others. Instagram users are mostly millennials. They will get bored if you don\u2019t give them frequent stimulation. It\u2019s like a fix. Instagram is currently trendy, hot, on the rise. There\u2019s a feverish dynamic. If you don\u2019t give Instagram users their \u201cfix,\u201d they\u2019ll get bored and unfollow you since they can only follow 7500. The question is how often do you need to post? Ideally, you should post in Instagram Stories 3 times a day. Don\u2019t post in the feed more than 3 times a day. I realize that\u2019s a lot, but Instagram users are hungry for content. That\u2019s all there is to it; it\u2019s nothing personal.
