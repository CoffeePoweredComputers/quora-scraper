However, once you pop it into a phrase, then it may not necessarily be correct. \u201cThe confirmation is valid,\u201d is valid. \u201cA confirmation is valid,\u201d sounds very odd, is probably not valid, though I suppose it depends on context. \u201cConfirmation is valid,\u201d is an abbreviation, or you can just consider it incorrect, really. You know, I cannot think of one example using \u201cconfirmation\u201d without \u201cthe.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Many nouns are abstract or general in normal usage, and accordingly do not take the definite article when so used. Words like peace, direction, leadership and confirmation fall into this category. That said, there are occasions when we want to specify a particular act: I am grateful for the leadership you showed on this project.The police were called to the tavern to keep the peace.The direction our head office gave us during the product failure averted a crisis.I have just received the confirmation our office had been waiting for.",
