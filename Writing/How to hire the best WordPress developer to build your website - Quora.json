            "answer_text": "Hey there! First things first, let us figure out what exactly you need a developer for. WordPress developers usually work on the following tasks: Convert HTML templates into WordPress themesEstablish the website\u2019s architectureCreate and implement new features and functionality for a websiteOptimize a website\u2019s speed and cachingDesign extensions for WooCommerceWork on testing, support, and troubleshootingHere are the examples of situations when you might want to hire a WordPress developer: You want a blog, a personal website, an online portfolio, an eCommerce platform, a podcast, whatsoeverYou already have a website with a bunch of plugins that are constantly conflicting with each otherYou want to make your website look unique, and need to set up a custom theme for thisYou want your website to have widgets (whatever this means)These tasks require a WordPress developer to possess a set of particular skills. Specifically, they must: Know PHP, MySQL, HTML, JS, jQuery, and GITUnderstand the WordPress code architectureUnderstanding the main principles of OOP (object-oriented programming)Be able to work with namespacesBe knowledgeable about the main principles of REST APIs, how it works, and be able to use the respective documentationKnow what taxonomy, post types, filters, and actions are and how they workUnderstand the architecture of the WordPress plugins and themes;Be able to work with child themes.Now, imagine that you have found a person who meets all the criteria listed above. But how do you know they are the best developer you can hire? Well, there are two ways to find out: Check them as thoroughly and meticulously, as you canLeave it to Coding Ninjas.The first method implies a ton of nerves and ungrateful efforts. First, You must singlehandedly browse through all of the popular job boards and freelance platforms, searching for a candidate whose portfolio, skills, and testimonials look satisfactory to you.Then, you will need to interview the candidate, hand them a test task, and evaluate their professionalism.

            "answer_text": "You are probably looking for a WordPress developer, not a builder. You could try some freelance websites, such as Upwork, the world's largest online workplace or http://freelancer.com but you should know what you are looking for. If you are looking for a WordPress website built using a pre-built multipurpose template, there are thousands of freelancers who could assist with this. It does not require an advanced level of knowledge and therefore you can get a pretty good deal. You could get a website built for less than $1000 maybe. However, if you need a custom theme, which would be built specifically for you, will have a unique design, secure, load quickly you might need an individual with an advanced skillset specific to WordPress development. For example at EveryCode.NET - Best Choice for Web and WordPress Development we are specializing in developing custom WordPress solutions as well as web applications. If you will be looking for a custom solution on a freelance marketplace, make sure you set your budget correctly, because low budget custom work will also have low quality and will be a waste of time and money. Make sure to check previous works and check client recommendations. The best case would be getting a recommendation from someone who has worked with the developer. One more important thing. If you come across a developer you want to hire immediately and want them to work on your project full-time, there\u2019s a big chance that this might not happen. Usually, good developers are hard to find and they already have quite a few clients / usually agencies who book their time. So if a developer proposes to start working on your project in a couple or more weeks, it very well might be worth waiting. ",
