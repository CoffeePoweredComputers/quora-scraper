In other words, reading extensively daily, studying vocabulary, increasing reading speed, learning reading question types and strategies for answering them, and taking TOEFL level reading practice tests will help you to improve your reading comprehension abilities of TOEFL passages. Extensive Reading The most important thing you can do is to start reading newspapers, magazines, and books on topics in which you have an interest. Your goal is to be able to read these passages without distractions for about 45 minutes every day. Keep this up for 3 months, and you will be amazed at how much you will be able to understand! Vocabulary Study [1] Learn 1,700 TOEFL vocabulary words, the link of which I have included at the end of this answer. To learn these words, put one word onto a note-card with a definition and sample sentence on the other side. Study your 1,700 note-cards regularly until you have committed these words into your long-term memory. Increasing Reading Speed It is hard to believe that faster readers have better comprehension than slower readers but it is true\u2014mainly because faster readers have fewer distractions than slower readers. Your goal is to push yourself to read faster than 300 words per minute with 60% to 80% comprehension. Stealth, \u201cThe 7-Step System to Pass the TOEFL iBT[2],\u201d my online TOEFL course, offers a reading speed program if you do not have access to these kinds of materials. Spend 80% of your reading practice extensively reading, building your vocabulary, and increasing your reading speed. Reading Question Types and Strategies Using your TOEFL book or an online TOEFL Course of your choosing, become familiar with the TOEFL reading question types and the strategies for answering them. Whether it is answering main idea detail questions or whether you are completing a schematic table or chart, you should become familiar with each reading question type and the strategies for answering them. TOEFL Level Reading Practice Tests Finally, from time to time, you will want to test your reading comprehension to see how that translates into a TOEFL subtotal score of 0 to 30 points. Therefore, take a TOEFL level reading practice test weekly to measure your progress. Remember to study the test afterward by looking at your incorrect answers so that you can understand why the correct answer is a better choice. I guarantee you that if you follow these five suggestions, you can improve your reading subtotal score by as many as 7 points in two months. May the next TOEFL exam be your last!

After that you may use Princeton Review\u2019s ToEFL books and practice. Don\u2019t cram your study. Go to a library and turn some TOEFL books. Quickly review them. Find a few books that will have interesting content and insights. Quickly narrow down to a few books (2 or 3 and not more) and stick to them Have a study plan (create your own blueprint for your success. Schedule your time. This way you will have a variety of learning and score well. you may practice one reading in morning and one writing in the evening. Both reading and writing are interlinked. Don\u2019t make your study a burden, creatively make it a pleasing thing.) Schedule some time to play (this may sound weird for serious students, but seriousness will make study very stressful and ineffective. A work-play balance, good nutrition, and good rest will make your study less difficult. Practice relentlessly All the best ",
