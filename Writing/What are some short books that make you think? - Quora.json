This book is no exception. However, in this series of essays, she challenges many of the fundamental tenants of morality and ethics professed in Society. Most people will instinctively recoil at her positions, but have a hard time explaining why. Being able to defend and articulate why you support the basis for any philosophy is a skill that isn\u2019t as common as it should be.",

            "answer_text": "If you like this idea of surrealism, in general I would recommend Paul Auster. But even better, is that Paul Auster wrote a FABULOUS short story collection. It is extremely short, but it is moving and deliciously intriguing. That book is The Red Notebook. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It comes in a little longer, but I would also highly recommend The First Bad Man by Miranda July.  A very different approach is One Hand Clapping by Anthony Burgess. This book might shock you with how simple but redefining it is.  A little deeper into sci-fi, you'll find Ursula K. Le Guin's Lathe of Heaven. A great novel.  If you haven't read Murakami's After the Quake, that's a beautiful place to start with him.  For Camus, you can start with the standard--The Stranger--but maybe better would be to start with Exile and the Kingdom. These will keep ya busy. ",
