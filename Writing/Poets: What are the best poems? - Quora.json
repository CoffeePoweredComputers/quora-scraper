            "answer_text": "For the powerful emotional link between imagery and meaning, it\u2019s hard to beat this one: THE LOVE SONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFROCK by T.S. Eliot S\u2019io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse. Ma percioche giammai di questo fondo Non torno vivo alcun, s\u2019i\u2019odo il vero, Senza tema d\u2019infamia ti rispondo.* Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question ... Oh, do not ask, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes, Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d and, \u201cDo I dare?\u201d Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair \u2014 (They will say: \u201cHow his hair is growing thin!\u201d) My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin \u2014 (They will say: \u201cBut how his arms and legs are thin!\u201d) Do I dare Disturb the universe? In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. For I have known them all already, known them all: Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room. So how should I presume? And I have known the eyes already, known them all\u2014 The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? And how should I presume? And I have known the arms already, known them all\u2014 Arms that are braceleted and white and bare (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!) Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume? And how should I begin? Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ... I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas. And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet \u2014 and here\u2019s no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid. And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it towards some overwhelming question, To say: \u201cI am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all\u201d\u2014 If one, settling a pillow by her head Should say: \u201cThat is not what I meant at all; That is not it, at all.\u201d And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor\u2014 And this, and so much more?\u2014 It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: \u201cThat is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all.\u201d No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous\u2014 Almost, at times, the Fool. I grow old ... I grow old ... I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown. *NOTE: The introduction is taken from Dante Alighieri's INFERNO. These words are spoken by Guido da Montefeltro in response to the questions of Dante. Montefeltro\u2019s spirit is imprisoned in a flame, and as he speaks, the flame flickers. Guido is under the impression that Dante is dead (since he is in Hell); Guido will therefore speak the truth - since whatever he says will not damage his reputation in the world of the living. I interpret this reference as indicating the poem is an internal dialogue between two aspects of the narrator which, by definition, goes unheard by the external world. These are Prufrock\u2019s secret thoughts - which he dare not utter in the literary salons he frequents as a fascinated bystander. I translate the passage as follows: \u201cIf I thought that my replyWere to one who might ever return to the worldThis flame would no more flicker. But since never from these depths Do any return alive - if my understanding be true -Then I will answer you without fear of infamy.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I think this one, \"Stop All the Clocks\" by W. H. Auden, is particularly moving.  I would categorize it as \"best\" because it's simple, sincere, and completely devastating.  It's universally accessible and can be understood by anyone who has experienced great loss in their life. Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,Silence the pianos and with muffled drumBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.  Let aeroplanes circle moaning overheadScribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.  He was my North, my South, my East and West,My working week and my Sunday rest,My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.For nothing now can ever come to any good. Marie Howe's \"What the Living Do\" captures the feeling of loss differently, the world keeps spinning but the center has shifted. Please pardon the formatting. What the Living Do Johnny, the kitchen sink has been clogged for days, some utensil probably fell down there. And the Drano won't work but smells dangerous, and the crusty dishes have piled up  waiting for the plumber I still haven't called. This is the everyday we spoke of. It's winter again: the sky's a deep, headstrong blue, and the sunlight pours through  the open living-room windows because the heat's on too high in here and I can't turn it off. For weeks now, driving, or dropping a bag of groceries in the street, the bag breaking,  I've been thinking: This is what the living do. And yesterday, hurrying along those wobbly bricks in the Cambridge sidewalk, spilling my coffee down my wrist and sleeve,  I thought it again, and again later, when buying a hairbrush: This is it. Parking. Slamming the car door shut in the cold. What you called that yearning.  What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss\u2014we want more and more and then more of it.  But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass, say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep  for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless: I am living. I remember you. ",
