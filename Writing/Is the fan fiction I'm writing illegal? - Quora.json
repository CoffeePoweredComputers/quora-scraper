            "answer_text": "It depends. Copyright law is a gray area that keeps plenty of intellectual property lawyers busy. (I am not a lawyer, BTW.) Fan fiction based on works that are in the public domain is legal. In fact, you can publish it and make money off of it. You might even have a best seller, such as The Seven-Percent Solution or Death Comes to Pemberley, not to mention the numerous movies, artwork, etc. based on public-domain work. In the U.S., there is a doctrine called Fair Use of copyrighted material. Fair Use holds that copyrighted works can be used in certain ways without permission or compensation. For example, small portions of a work can be quoted for review or educational purposes. Parodies and satires are permitted. A person can make a copy of a copyrighted work (e.g., a magazine article) for research/educational purposes. \u201cTransformative\u201d works are permitted under Fair Use, and this is generally the justification offered for fan works\u2014that they are transformative. Conflicts arise over the degree of transformation from the original work\u2014how much is enough? Copyright holders have varying attitudes toward fan works, which may include fiction, art, and movies. Some copyright holders object strenuously to fan fiction based on their works and will take legal action against fan authors/artists\u2014or more likely these days, against host sites. (Sites such as FanFiction usually deal with this by refusing to host fan works based on the work of objecting authors.) Some copyright holders actively encourage fan works. Many copyright holders look the other way as long as no one is making money off of the fan works and/or they don\u2019t find it objectionable. Recently, CBS and Paramount Pictures filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the producers of a crowdfunded (to the tune of ~$1 million), feature-length Star Trek fan film called \u201cStar Trek: Axanar\u201d on the basis that it was not an amateur work. They also issued their own guidelines as to what they consider \u201creasonable\u201d fan creativity. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer? It depends. U.S. Copyright law states that the original author of a work technically retains exclusive rights to the story and characters. Under standard law, this extends the life of the author plus 70 years. Now, an author can choose to exercise those rights and in the most ridged sense that could make fanfiction illegal. That being said, most authors don\u2019t fret about fanfiction too much but there are some exceptions. FanFiction.com has a list of authors who have requested no fanfiction. However, there are some technicalities in copywriter law that could protect fanfic writers. This includes fair-use and transformative law. In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress explicitly defined fair use for the first time, stating one factor as \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes\". Basically, if it\u2019s used for educational purposes or there is no monitory gain from it, there\u2019s less of a chance of it being considered illegal. But, there are sometime exceptions to this rule. This was later cited in a Supreme Court case (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.) that stated: \u201cUnder the first of the four 107 factors, \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature ...,\" the inquiry focuses on whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or whether and to what extent it is controversially \"transformative,\" altering the original with new expression, meaning, or message. The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.\u201d Basically, the more transformative a price of work is from the original source material, the less likely it will be considered copywrite infringement, even if you are receiving monetary gain from it. I believe this is what allowed things like 50 Shades of Grey to evolve from Twilight. Had the author left the original names, places, etc in place and tried to publish her (then) Fanfiction, she would have been committing copywrite infringement. Her basic plot was already a significant change from the original story line, so once those other factors were changed, it was practically impossible to identify the source material and there would be no base to sue. TL:DR; Don\u2019t copy the source material word for word, don\u2019t seek any sort of monetary gain, and respect author\u2019s wishes if they ask for there to be no fanfiction to be written about their stories.

            "answer_text": "We think of fan fiction and fan art as a modern creation, but it isn\u2019t. Proust [1]wrote fanfiction, and so did James Joyce and Franz Kafka. Only, they didn\u2019t call it fanfiction. The fancier, more literary term for fanfiction is \u201cpastiche.\u201d A pastiche [2]is a deliberate imitation of the work or style of other artists or writers, and as far as I can tell, is indistinguishable from fanart and fanfic. The only difference is that the pastiche is in the realm of \u201cserious\" mostly male artists/writers, and young women often make fan art/fics. But is it legal? Legally, fanfiction exists in a sort of a gray area. Websites like fanfiction.net, DeviantArt.com, and archiveofourown.org exist to warehouse art and stories derived from copyrighted materials. Millions of users publish work on these websites every year. In the US, fanfic writers usually cite the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine[3] when defending their use of copyrighted characters and material. Fair use dictates that copyrighted works can be used under limited circumstances: The work is used in an educational or non-commercial wayThe work is demonstrably true, (i.e., a fact)The work doesn\u2019t include a substantial percentage of the original (e.g., the free sample chapter you can get of a novel on Amazon)The work doesn\u2019t infringe on the reputation or value of the originalThe work is \u201ctransformative.\u201dThe work is used for critique, parody, or reviewFanmade works hinge on their non-commercial aspect and how they transform the original. Now, I am not a lawyer, and this isn\u2019t legal advice, but I do know that the above criteria are only defenses against a charge of copyright violation. The copyright holder has to first accuse you of stealing and then, you can explain to a judge why it falls under fair use. If you use a copyrighted work, the original creator (or estate) can fine you or (more likely) issue you a cease and desist letter. Arguing \u201cfair use\u201d is like arguing \u201cgoing with the flow of traffic\u201d for a speeding ticket. There\u2019s a slim chance it might work, but you\u2019ll still end up spending your day at the courthouse. But down to brass tacks. If brands and authors can sue fan creators at any given moment, why aren\u2019t they? Why aren\u2019t they knocking on doors and dragging terrified fanfiction.net users out into the street? Suing fan creators would be a PR disaster. It\u2019s not worth it to brands and (most) famous authors to come after a fan who posted a few drawings of a Marvel superhero or wrote fanfics about Harry Potter. They understand that people who take the time to create art or fics are hardcore fans. And angering the online fan community is a dangerous proposition. Fanmade works can also keep a book or series relevant. There can be a lot of time between seasons of some shows (especially if those shows are from the BBC) fanmade creative works keep the hype going strong. Heck, Archive of Our Own just won one of genre literature\u2019s most prestigious honors, a Hugo Award [4]because of the community fostered by its creators. What about selling fan art? This question is less murky. A person shouldn\u2019t profit from the sale of someone else's copyrighted work. In some cases, the art might be \u201ctransformative\u201d enough to stand the fair use test, but the moment money enters the equation, the fight gets dirty. The brand/series/novel now has a financial incentive to stop fan creators. Every shirt, poster, or keychain a fan creator sells is a profit the copyright holder could have made through authentic merchandise. It\u2019s also risky for the rest of the fan creator community. If original creators decide to crackdown on people selling fan art, that that will have a chilling effect on all fanmade work Footnotes[1] What Writers Can Learn from In Search of Lost TIme \u2014 The Narrative ARC[2] Pastiche - Wikipedia[3] Copyright law overview[4] 4.7 million fanfics are now Hugo winners, thanks to the Archive of Our Own",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a bit complicated. Fan fiction is a derivative work. To try to put it simply, this means that because you couldn\u2019t have created the fan fiction without whatever it\u2019s fan fiction of existing, and because its appeal is enhanced by the appeal of the work you\u2019re basing it on, the creator of the work you\u2019re basing it on legally has a copyright interest in it. So, technically speaking, you cannot publish it without permission. However, many authors got their own start writing fan fiction, and so many don\u2019t mind fan fiction being written, and even published, so long as it is only published through free outlets like fanfiction.net, An Archive of Our Own, and so forth. (Remember, the legal definition of \u201cpublish\u201d is essentially \u201cto distribute to the public\u201d, regardless of how.) Copyright law does not require that a copyright owner try to stop every potential infringement \u2014 they can choose to allow some infringements, but to stop others. However, if you allow some people to perform certain types of infringement, that can potentially weaken your case against stopping others from performing them. (It\u2019s complicated, in large part because juries decide what is and isn\u2019t infringement, so appearances matter.) So, technically speaking, it is illegal to publish fan fiction, but most authors tolerate it if it\u2019s only being published in certain accepted ways. They are not legally required to tolerate it, however, and some authors have sued people publishing fan fiction, even when they were only publishing it in such ways. ",

You cannot profit from your work.You should not distribute that work.Basically that is it. The first is obvious \u2014 it is Disney\u2019s IP\u2014 you don\u2019t own it therefor cannot profit from it. The second one is less obvious. The reason you cannot distribute it is because Disney can claim that you are interfering with it\u2019s POTENTIAL to sell other works similar to yours. If your fan fiction is out there for free \u2014 why would anyone buy something similar. Disney has in the past been VERY protective about it\u2019s IP. I remember a case in the 90\u2019s where Disney sent a Cease and Desist letter to a daycare that had painted Mickey Mouse on a window in tempra paint. Generally speaking you are fine however. The worst that will probably happen to you is a Cease and Desist letter from Disney\u2019s Attorney\u2019s \u2014 should you not comply with that they can take you to court for copyright infringement and try to seek damages\u2014 which they have to prove that you contributed to. I am not so sure about what happened after the switch to Disney\u2014 but for a long time Lucasfilm encouraged fan-made works with an annual festival showcasing fan-made films\u2026 and other works.

As such you\u2019re using the characters and storylines established by someone else, as these are copyrighted and you\u2019re not entitled to use them without permission or licensing agreements in place prior to your publishing them. Hard answer- With that being said, there\u2019s a lot of precedences recently with the CBS- Paramount struggles over ownership of the Star Trek franchise and works created by both. Axanar was a fan flick that used recognized characters to produce a movie from it. While it was a fairly large budget item that proved fans could do it just as well as the Hollywood, it also led to a many yearlong court battle over ownership and IP rights that left everyone a loser. Finally, concessions were made with both sides and a very difficult agreement was arrived at. Simply stated the fans can produce a fan flick or other items as long as it IS NOT using recognized characters, IS NOT a series of films/books, and IS NOT using anything that is recognized as canon for either of CBS or Paramounts holdings. while it IS a victory for fan fiction, it also limits what can be done to half an hour, NO fundraising can be done with it, it must be all-volunteer, and NO professionally paid actors are permitted to be involved in it, production or otherwise. Fan-fiction won a small victory for at least one genre and it\u2019s fans to BOLDLY GO where no other fans have gone before! ",

            "answer_text": "The distribution of fanfiction (without permission) is a violation of copyright. That doesn\u2019t make it a crime but does make it something that in theory you can be sued over. But that\u2019s not a concern unless you attempt to sell your fanfiction. You will get sued for that if and when the rights holders notice. Of course some people remove the serial numbers from their fanfiction (changing names and other specific identifiers) and sell it with no problems. For example Solar Pons is a \u201cconsulting detective\u201d who is extremely like Sherlock Holmes, but has a different name. There were enough changes that he could be published before Sherlock Holmes entered the public domain. That being said, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that one can write and sell derivative fiction about works that are in the \u201cpublic domain\u201d with no problem at all. So books about Robin Hood, Ozma of Oz, Captain Freedom, or Jennie Everywhere are usually fair game. These works are like fanfiction but they aren\u2019t fanfiction because they don\u2019t infringe copyright. Long story short, not-for-profit fanfiction is not a crime but isn\u2019t entirely legal either. ",

            "answer_text": "Fanfiction in the USA has not yet been ruled as copyright infringement and many attorneys believe that as Transformative Works, fanfiction falls under Fair Use. You can learn more about that here: Organization for Transformative Works . Laws differ elsewhere. Furthermore, fanfiction is published every single day on the internet to share with fellow fans. And less commonly, compilations of fanfiction are self-published as personal gifts for friends. But one thing you cannot do without risking hearing from the rights-holder of the original material (which might not be the original creator, but a publisher or an estate) is to try to make money off it. Now some people find a way around this by changing names and settings to disguise their story's original roots. It's called \u201cscrubbing off the serial numbers\u201d. You may have heard of Twilight or 50 shades of Grey; they both made a boatload of money for their authors and they both began life as fanfiction. I'm not fond of the method. It requires the writer to also scrub every bit of the fanfic it began as off the internet. This takes the story away from the readers, the fans to whom the story was given, and while not illegal, it does strike me as rude, rather like knitting a scarf as a gift for a friend, and then asking to have it back to sell at a flea market. It also reinforces the ridiculous and false, but widespread, notion that creative writing is not a useful activity unless it is done for grades or money. Just my opinion, and not widely shared, I know. ",

The questions that lawyers recognise are, \u201cis it lawful to do x?\u201d. Assuming that that is what you were intending to ask, the answer is a typical lawyer\u2019s \u201cit depends\u201d. There is nothing inherently unlawful about writing fanfiction, but, as James Boyle points out, publishing a work of fanfiction could land you in trouble. You would more likely than not be in breach of copyright (unless that copyright has expired by effluxion of time) and could easily find yourself facing legal action by the copyright owner. As Mr Boyle says, you would find it very difficult to publish in any event, as no mainstream publisher (guided by its lawyers) would want to take the risk, and if you self-published, the cease and desist letter would arrive very quickly. You could also be facing a claim for substantial damages. The only safe way to publish fanfiction is to get permission from the copyright owner, which may mean giving away a possibly significant share of the royalties. Getting that permission also means that your fanfiction would have to be well-written and fit into the literary conventions established in the original work, which is no easy task. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Fan fiction based on a copyrighted work of fiction is generally a copyright infringement unless the fan fiction author/creator has obtained permission from the copyright holder (often the original author or the author\u2019s heirs). If the work of fiction is in the public domain, fan fiction is legal as far as copyright law goes. For example, if you want to write fan fiction based on Don Quixote or Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, there will be no copyright impediment. See Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States for more on what is in the public domain in the US. Other countries will have other rules. Many authors choose not to sue authors of fan fiction, and there is, in general no enforcement mechanism unless the copyright holder learns of the fan fiction and chooses to sue. However, the copyright holder could choose to sue at any time. If the fan fiction is based on a work owned by a major media company, the chances of suit are much larger. A few authors chose to formally license fan fiction. But these are few indeed. I understand that Kindle has a limited set of worlds that are licensed for anyone to write fiction in. I don\u2019t know just how those work. ",

On the other hand, if you\u2019re asking whether you can publish it for payment, the answer is no. Exception: Not unless you have the written permission of whoever the copyright holder of the original material is. Thus there is technically Star Wars, Star Trek and other tie in material that has been published for profit because the copyright owner has authorized/certified/permitted that the material be published for profit. So, the answer is: sometimes, with permission. However, most of the authors out there are not inclined to grant permission for the use of their characters/universe by other people. Some even try to restrict the free distribution of fan fiction in their universes, which request is generally honored by archive sites. PN Elrod, Anne Rice, to name two authors, do not appreciate or in any way approve of the use of their universes by others. ",

            "answer_text": "Original Question: Why is fanfiction legal? Technically, it\u2019s only legal if it isn\u2019t being distributed without the author\u2019s consent. And so long as the fanfiction writer/artist/etc. isn\u2019t profiting off of that author\u2019s work, again without consent. A lot of authors view fanfiction as a means of advertising their work. The more people who read the fiction, the more interested they might become about the source material, the more likely they are to invest money into said source material. If someone watched the Harry Potter films, read some fanfiction that was more or less based on the books, it might pique their interest enough to pick up Philosopher\u2019s Stone and begin from there, for example. Some authors are flattered that they have fans who are so immersed with their material that they make up stories and scenarios involving the characters. Some author\u2019s like seeing someone\u2019s visual interpretation of a character, or comic strips, or whatever medium they wish to create. Another form of fanfiction is Music Videos, using footage from television or movies to a song. It\u2019s another great way of advertising, since you don\u2019t actually have to be familiar with the source material to enjoy a music video. Parodies are another form of fanfiction. A really famous example would be Dragon Ball Z Abridged by TeamFourStar. Of course there are some authors or creators who do not want their material to be used as the basis of someone else\u2019s creative output. An example of this would be the Attack on Titans Abridged Series TeamFourStar attempted to make. They got a cease and desist letter from the company who created the source material and threatened a lawsuit. Nostalgia Critic got in hot water during his first attempt to review the movie \u2018The Room\u2019 By Tommy Wiseau. Despite a positive review that encouraged people to check out the cult classic, Doug Walker almost got sued for copyright infringement. The lawsuit went nowhere, and the material returned to the internet once again, followed by another video that parodied the lawsuit situation. Doug was protected by the Fair Use Laws, but TeamFourStar was not so fortunate and were thus forced to abandoned the Attack on Titans Abridged (which is a shame, the first episode was hilarious!). To put it simply, Fanfiction is an outlet fans can utilize to fuel their interest in a particular fandom. Some author\u2019s are flattered by this or openly encourage it. Others are less interested. Some of these less interested individuals don\u2019t mind some forms of fanfiction medium, but mind other types. Besides, a vast majority of fanfiction writers are broke (I speak as one). Chances are, even if it was illegal and there were Lawsuits coming after the offenders, the original creators probably would never see a dime. ",

Unless they have especially banned fanfictions made off their work (I know a few writers have, no idea about videogames, maybe check). OOk, I read that your plan is just to type a videogame. I\u2019d suggest to add some of your own ideas. Like, what are the videogames character feeling when they say that? It could be a nice writing exercise! If I was you, I would feel better if it wasn\u2019t literally just a copy-and-paste. ",
