            "answer_text": "Change the way you talk to yourself. Use affirmations to reprogram your inner voice. No more this \u201cI am pissing everyone off\u201d or \u201cscrewing up at my job\u201d. Instead say to yourself \u201cI am making good progress at my job and enjoying the company of my colleagues, we work well as a team and we get our tasks completed on time\u201d! Set \u201csmart\u201d small goals to accomplish by writing them down, have them on your phone, read them each day before you start your day. Work consistently on achieving these small goals. Declutter your physical space at home, especially your bedroom. Throw out everything that you do not need. Have a system where you are able to find things without looking for them too much. This creates clarity which creates less stress. Update your wardrobe. This is essential for your work. What you wear and how you dress says so much about you as a member of staff and colleague. People are very quick to judge others on their appearance and the way they dress. These who dress smart and are presentable gain so much more respect. Learn to build your confidence through your body language. No slouching, hunching, crossing your arms etc etc which shows lack of confidence. Do the plank exercise to strengthen your back and build muscle for your whole body. Exercise daily or as much as you are able to build up your mental power. Next, we are what we eat. Have a good look at your diet. If you are lacking energy to see you through your day at work, you are bound to feel crap. Cut out simple carbs from your diet. No fizzy drinks and limit your caffeine intake if you rely on it to boost your energy levels at work. Drink more water at work as this helps with your concentration. Eat more complex carbs and protein. ",

Second of all I would consider developing healthy relationships with co-workers focusing on teamwork and truly helping each other (Read and study the book: How to Win Friends and Influence People). Next I would get up every morning and do the Create my Day exercise ( Create Your Day Joe Dispenza  Do that for 30 days and see if this makes a difference. ",
