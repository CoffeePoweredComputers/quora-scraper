            "answer_text": "They study the painting\u2026and then they copy it. That's about it, questioner. Several facts about the \u201cart world\u201d: Most people are not experts\u2014 Even people who have studied art, and who perhaps know or knew the artist, cannot identify some or all of their works. The ones who can are rarely the ones that you need to fool.Experts make mistakes \u2014 A lot of mistakes. So many that some will no longer authenticate the works in styles for which they are supposed to be experts.A lot of things in the art world are supposed to be about trust \u2014 Many things cannot be verified as the artist is long dead and most didn't leave the necessary provenance (the bona fides) to make certain that their works can be distinguished from frauds. Much of what occurs is people trusting other people, whether they should or not.Most things are about money \u2014 Wealthy patrons want expensive pieces and they can afford them. Dealers want to make sales. Artists want their work to be seen and to be paid for that privilege. The forger simply fits neatly into the empty slot between all three.More than a few people are \u201cin\u201d on the scam \u2014 Thanks to warfare, pogroms, natural disasters and time, there are only so many Old Masters and pieces from antiquity. Most of them are locked away in museums, vaults and private collections. That should leave a miniscule amount on the open market to be traded and sold. However (oddly) there are always \u201cnew finds\u201d or \u201cprivate collections\u201d that are looking to sell. While there is a slim possibility that this could be true, the skeptical people out there quickly realize that someone is simply creating items to fill a need.So a forger looks at a piece of art and then copies it. He or she studies the process of how the artwork was made and they attempt to duplicate it, if at all possible. They then use various processes to \u201cage\u201d the piece, they find an unscrupulous dealer to market it for them, and they both share in the spoils. There's not much sophisticated about it questioner, beyond the fact that some forgers are excellent copyists. With deference to the other answer given to this question, there is not a great deal of skill required. Most forgers don't have to fool experts; just customers. The few who might try to fool experts are often in luck as many \u201cexperts\u201d either aren't up to the task, or worse, they are in on the scam. They don't need to be great forgers as their skills at forgery will nearly always go unnoticed. ",

            "answer_text": "Art forgery can be extremely difficult to detect and investigate. There may be many forged works of art in museums and galleries around the world, and in private collections. Experts may be unaware if the forgery is accomplished cleverly, of the existence of a forged artwork, or they may be reluctant to admit they have been deceived. A full analysis of a possible forgery, however, must rely on more than the expert opinion of an art historian. A laboratory analysis of the materials used to create the work is required, using techniques such as X-radiography and infrared reflectography. Modern artistic materials, such as paper, inks, and paints are different in composition today from those used hundreds of years ago. A painting is composed of four layers: support, ground layer, paint layer, and varnish. The support is often made of wood or canvas. The analysis of a wood support can be very informative because modern fakes are often painted on older wood panels to make them look authentic. Dendrochronology, the examination of growth ring patterns, can sometimes be used to age the wood itself. X rays will penetrate to the wood layer and reveal the construction of a panel. ",
