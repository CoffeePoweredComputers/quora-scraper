            "answer_text": "I had never heard of PTE until I came across this question on Quora in November 2016. After doing some research, I was convinced that PTE gives a higher score compared to IELTS. My first IELTS test was right after high school, intended for university qualification purposes. English is my first language but I have been speaking Mandarin primarily from 7 to 18 years old. Other than the Harry Potter series and textbooks, I hardly read. Prior to this test, I took a specialised IELTS preparation course that helped me in summary writing, listening, and reading. I could've done much better with online resources. I was really nervous during the speaking test and I thought I would get a 5.0. On the other hand, I thought I did a great job in the writing test as the essay topic was easy. This is how it turned out. December 2007: IELTS (Academic) Listening 8.0Reading 8.5Writing 6.5Speaking 7.0I booked an IELTS test in October 2016 as a Permanent Residency requirement, right before i found out about PTE. The test was in December, 1 week right after I demonstrated my Final Year Project. I was too excited from graduating that I only spent 2 days briefly studying for the writing section. I knew that my writing was relatively poor, especially lacking fancy vocabulary, so I worked hard on it. As for my speaking, I thought after spending about 9 years in Australia, it would've improved a lot. December 2016: IELTS (general) Listening 9.0Reading 9.0Writing 7.0 (Expected 7.5)Speaking 7.5 (Expected 8.0)I did achieve the minimum required score to apply for PR, but it's gonna take a while until I receive an invitation. So I figured I should try my luck and take PTE, and I managed to book a test scheduled on 28 April 2017. I was busy dealing with PR paperwork and applying for jobs, and a reminder appeared on my phone saying \u201cPTE test tomorrow 12.30pm Clifton Sydney\u201d. I have totally forgotten about it and have not even started preparing for it. The next morning, I started looking at the format of the test on the train to Sydney. I had about 2 hours to prepare for it and I had only manage to go through the free offline practice test with sample answers. During the test, I was so nervous I hesitated and stuttered a lot. I wasn't able to finish the summaries in the given 40 seconds. The essay was very similar to the one in IELTS, but you only have 20 minutes. Reading felt harder since there were quite a few words I have seen before but didn't understand. I was just thinking to get this over with as I was going to fail for sure. Here is my score, received 1 day after : April 2017: PTE (Academic): Listening 90Reading 83Writing 90Speaking 90For comparison, PTE 90 = IELTS 9.0PTE 79 = IELTS 8.0PTE 65 = IELTS 7.0PTE 50 = IELTS 6.0Again, I have to emphasise that since I did not study between my 2nd IELTS and PTE, the scores from both tests can be compared without being affected by other variables. Good luck to everyone else who are taking IELTS/PTE! ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends which score you need, your actual level and whether you need a General or Academic certificate. I would suggest to choose IELTS only for General medium scores, up to 6.5 max 7, and go for PTE if you need higher results. You can find online people\u2019s experience about these tests and it looks that scoring high in IELTS is very difficult and not for everyone. Even people who attended years of university and lived in English speaking countries often struggle to achieve the score. If you are ONLY asking which test is easier then the answer is IELTS. But if you want to know which one to choose for an \u2018easy\u2019 high score, the answer is PTE. I say that IELTS is easier because of the lower number of exercises and their lower complexity. Basically in the listening and reading section you are graded for your understanding of articles and audios through simple tasks. In the writing section you are asked to write one letter/email and one essay, and finally the speaking section you talk with someone about general topics. Probably the most difficult part is the writing where most of the people struggle to get an high score. The essay is the toughest part which has to be grammatically correct, make sense and have a flow easy to follow by the person who will score it; plus the time given is not much. PTE is another story. It has 20 different exercises, you talk to a computer and a software will give the score. 20 exercises sounds scary, however, some of them need very little time for practicing. A crucial part is understanding which exercises are the most important and focus on those first. Attached below an essential table to understand the PTE format.  It is the test breakdown with the points carried by each exercise in each section. You can notice that most of them give points in more than one area. For example, the first one, \u2018repeat sentence\u2019 is in the speaking section during the exam, but carries lots of points for the listening too. A good thing about PTE is that you can practice all of them using many different websites ( payments required but worth every $) and have the result in real time. They use the same questions used by Pearson, so you can easily find some of them during exam day. Attached links of the ones I used the most during my preparation. PTEstudy.net Practice | PTE login PTE Plus | World's first PTE automated-scoring practice platform What makes the real difference between the 2 tests is the scoring system. In PTE there is no human checking your answers and people have found ways to approach some exercises according to that. When you write something that is going to be checked by a person, you want to properly connect your ideas and thoughts, you want to express yourself in a clear way and you want to give logic sense at your sentences. Same is for a conversation, we want to be understood, explain our thoughts and be as clear as possible with the other person. when you write or talk to a computer you don\u2019t need all this! Don\u2019t get me wrong, grammar, spelling and staying on topic is always important and you can\u2019t miss that, but a computer cannot understand if your ideas are not well-connected or your explanation makes sense or not. This will save you precious time and energy, plus will give you more possibility for higher scores. For example, when I was learning the test format, exercise like \u2018re-tell lecture\u2019 made me really nervous and I thought it was almost impossible for me to perform well, even in my mother tongue. Repeating in your own words a lecture and talking about it for 30\u201340 seconds with almost no time for preparation was unthinkable. But we said there are strategies we can use, and the easiest way to do that exercise is to have a template. A template is a sequence of 5 to 7 sentences that you can use in any lecture you will hear, and these sentences need to be completed each time with words related to the specific audio you just listened. Using them can feel strange in the beginning as sometime happens that your sentence does not have a real meaning if said to a human, but in PTE we are talking to a computer and (fortunately) it is not able to understand that. Youtube is full of material related to those \u2018tips and tricks\u2019 for PTE and they are very helpful . My suggestion is to choose 2\u20133 channels and stick with them without trying to find extra info from other people as it can get confusing. I put many hours for preparation and I got my score in the second attempt using the techniques and guidelines I found on the web. Although I was prepared and my test were good overall, I was surprised to see the final results because during both occasions I made clear mistakes in very important exercises but got a really high score anyway.   Whichever test you choose it won\u2019t be easy. It is hard time to learn, understand and memorize all the techniques, templates etc. It takes time and effort, but if you do it properly there is going to be some great scores waiting for you :) ! Hopefully this will help you to make your choice, Good Luck!! ",
