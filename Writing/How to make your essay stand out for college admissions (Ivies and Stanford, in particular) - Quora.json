            "answer_text": "When you sit down to write your college essays, I encourage you to imagine your reader reading your essay. Let yourself imagine the admissions officer reading the essay from start to finish, and putting it back on their desk when they are done. At that moment, when they\u2019re done reading your essay, what do you want them to know about you? This answer needs to be succinct. You should have a very specific idea of what you want the admissions officer to know about you in that very moment. Now, use that as your guide to writing a compelling essay. Lead your reader to exactly that point. To me, there are five main factors to focus on when writing a compelling Personal Statement. Respond to the prompt. This one may seem silly, but you\u2019d be surprised how many thousands of applicants get too excited about the story they want to tell and they never tie it back directly to the prompt. It\u2019s imperative to answer the question in a compelling way, and always lead your reader back to what they wanted to know in the first place.Use imagery in storytelling. The best college essays are memorable. No one remembers a story that isn\u2019t told through imagery. Your goal should be to take your reader on a journey. Use imagery to demonstrate mobility and growth. Let the reader into your world, and give them every opportunity to imagine themselves in it.Never underestimate the power of creativity. Admissions officers will likely read thousands of applications. If you have a story to tell, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ve heard it before. (That\u2019s just the unfortunate truth). Take a creative approach to telling a story about yourself. This one is a bit riskier, but typically has a higher reward.Be authentic. Admissions officers want to know about you. What matters to you? What excites you? What challenges you? Truly reflect on those things. Admissions committees read essays to get to know who you are and the essays help them imagine the type of student you would be if you were admitted as part of their freshman class. Don\u2019t let too many eyes see and revise your essay - it\u2019s okay to get coaching on strategy and feedback for edits, but it\u2019s essential that the story remains authentically yours.Focus on the \u201cwhy?\u201d Why should the admissions team care? Why is this important? How does this define you? How does this differentiate you from your peers? How will your experiences help you be a better student? A better peer? A more successful person once you graduate?It should also go without saying that the content should be impeccable when it comes to grammar and spelling! ",

            "answer_text": "You must write a highly personal essay in which you show how an experience in your life affected your world view, your character or your ideas about your future. The essay is a way for you to show who you are, something about your personality, and how you might fit in with the student body on these campuses. Let me also say that you should look very broadly at colleges. The Ivies and Stanford are absolutely not the right schools for everyone. And unless you have spectacular educational credentials you will not be competitive. You can get an excellent education at hundreds of colleges. Do your homework and find the schools that are the best fit for you in terms of location, size and special programs. Don\u2019t choose based on \u201cbrand.\u201d Choose the school that is right for YOU. It is not where you go to school that matters. It is what you do at the school you do attend that will secure your future. Excellent performance at any of hundreds of fine schools will lead to success. ",
