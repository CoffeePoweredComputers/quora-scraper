            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s some tips that will help you write engaging email newsletters: For Best Results, Make Your Important Emails Actionable When you\u2019re busy and scrolling through your inbox, you\u2019re likely not looking for emails to leisure-read \u2014 more often than not, you only have time to engage with messages that seem important, urgent, or have a purpose behind them. If you really want your emails read, Chad Root recommends that you \u201ckeep them directly connected to a contact\u2019s ACTIONS. CTA follow-ups outperform general blog notices and newsletters by three times the engagement.\u201d To encourage engagement, \u201cAlways add a verb in the subject heading to get your subscribers in the mindset of taking ACTION. Also, don\u2019t forget to add the P.S. for skimmers.\u201d \u2014 Maria Lloyd  Maintain a One-to-One Ratio: One Intent for Every Email Too many CTAs in one email can quickly become overwhelming for the reader. Neil Kristianson says a good rule of thumb to follow is \u201cOne email \u2014 one action. You can\u2019t ask someone to do 10 things in an email and expect them to do any of them.\u201d Having one focus per email can also make each message feel more personal to your list. Consultant Ali A. Alqhtani says, \u201cI always tell clients to keep it real. Keep it simple. And really just talk to your list with intent, and make it conversational.\u201d Make the Email Engaging and Readable Have you ever saved a message in your inbox for later because it seemed like too much effort on-the-go? The average office worker receives 121 emails per day. It\u2019s impossible for readers to keep up with every single one, so impersonal emails are the first to be disregarded. A viable approach to email marketing is relating to your audience on a personal level. Charles Musselwhite recommends that you, \u201cStart by pretending you are writing to a good friend, not a list or a business, but a living breathing person that enjoys your company. In other words, don\u2019t just email when you need something or want to make a sale. Be helpful. Be generous. Be friendly. Be like a real friend.\u201d  Make Sure Your Email Fits the Relationship For every email you send, it\u2019s important to write specifically to your intended audience. Charles Musselwhite says, \u201cMarketing is like dating. And just like dating, you shouldn\u2019t ask someone to marry you on a first date. That\u2019s just weird! Therefore you shouldn\u2019t ask your customers to buy your main product the first time they become aware of you, your business and your products and services. It\u2019s important to nurture prospect and customer relationships with your customers according to where you are in the customer lifecycle.\u201d Learn more about getting started with an email newsletter here.

Keep it short: No one likes to scroll down endlessly, keep it concise. It will be more effective. Relevant subjects: If your audience is elderly retired civil servants, it\u2019s probably better not to write about Augmented reailty. Regular: Make a schedule and stick to it.
