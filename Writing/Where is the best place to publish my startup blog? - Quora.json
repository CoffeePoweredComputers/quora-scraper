            "answer_text": "If you are looking to get as many readers as possible, I would suggest writing on a third party platform such as Medium, since you know there are people on those sites that could potentially read your articles. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it will be easier to get more reader than by owning a website/blog. You will probably have to fight to get those readers anywhere you post. Now this is my opinion, but if your goal is to get as many readers as possible and you don\u2019t have any financial interests in what you are going to be publishing, using a platform like medium is probably a better way to build of an audience that will read your articles more regularly, as opposed to a blog where people might have to check in to see if you have any new content. Now of course this doesn\u2019t prevent you from having both. You can always publish both on your website/blog and on medium and link back your views to your website for example and have your blog readers follow you on medium. That is probably the best, but it does mean you need to get a website. And I think that if you have a website, it will be harder to get people to come back and view your latest articles, at least without a weekly newsletter reminding them you have new content. But in that case you need to get their emails, and medium let you do that anyways. ",
