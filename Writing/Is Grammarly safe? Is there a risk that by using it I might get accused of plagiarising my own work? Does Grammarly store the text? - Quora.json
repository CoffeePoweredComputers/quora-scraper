Some of my friends in the medical space cannot use Grammarly because of its lack of data privacy and security (aka it\u2019s not HIPAA compliant).  If you are looking for a HIPAA compliant spelling and grammar corrector, then I recommend checking out Perfect Tense. Their website is www.perfecttense.com.
