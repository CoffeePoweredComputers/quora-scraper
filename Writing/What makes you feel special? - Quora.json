I also forgot my mobile at room. After completing my duty I reached room at 6:20 in morning. Exhausted I jumped on to my bed. Before sleep could take over, as a costumory ritual I took a glimpse of my mobile screen. 20 Missed calls. The text showed \u201cMom\u201d . \u201cFuck. How could I forgot to talk to mom?\u201d I quickly called back. Within two rings mom picked the call. I apologized for my negligence first. \u201cSo, mom you woke up quite early\u201d I asked mischievously. \u201cI didn't slept beta.\u201d \u201cWhy mom?\u201d I bumbled. \u201cHow could I sleep without talking to you\u201d she replied.  What makes me feel special? My mother, every second. Love you Maa.  ASR. ",

She\u2019s the family I\u2019ve chosen and she\u2019s always there to cheer me up and to remind me how unique and amazing I am. Anyone can feel special. Look for the things you like, for the people you love and cherish and who love you as much as you do, for a way to be proud of yourself. Maybe writing down your own story of your life will make you feel special. Because it will be a book only you can write since you\u2019re the only one who have gone through everything you\u2019re writing down. Have a nice day :) ",
