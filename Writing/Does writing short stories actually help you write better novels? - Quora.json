            "answer_text": "The immediacy of the form and sense of accomplishment are two of the most rewarding aspects of short stories, and these aspects help with your confidence as a writer. From a creative perspective, shorter stories can allow you to play with many forms and styles while you work out your strengths and weaknesses, can really help you build your tool chest of ideas, and help define who you are as a writer. Shake off the comparisons to other writers you admire, forge your own path and be you. Short stories are like a sprint, novels are more like a marathon. You can\u2019t run a marathon if you don\u2019t train. If you can\u2019t be bothered to write a polished 2000 word story with a nice arc, narrative and rewarding resolution, you may not have the chops to bite off a novel of say 80\u201390K words. You will see how much effort it can take to hone and polish short stories, and how much more attention to detail you may need. Receiving feedback is a lot easier too. People will be more likely to critique your work if it\u2019s a few pages instead of a long 100K-word slog. Finally, from the perspective of submissions, it\u2019s great to get your head around sending stories off to competitions, possibly getting a few rejections, and maybe even winning a few places or something.

            "answer_text": "In my case, it's a big Yes. Writing short stories is like driving a car from your home to your office which is 10 Kms away. Whereas writing a novel is like driving your car from Kanyakumari, South India to the Himalayas in the North India. Without being expert at driving your car to small distances and narrow roads of your city, it is too difficult for you to drive on the hilly terrains of the Himalayas. Similarly without learning the intricacies of mystery building, character building, dialogue delivery and atmosphere it is difficult to write a complete novel in a first go. But if you are accustomed to writing short stories, it will be less tricky for you to write a lengthy novel. ",

            "answer_text": "Any kind of practice in writing fiction will doubtless help you write better novels. However, IMO the not-uncommon assumption that all writers should start with short stories and work up to novels is invalid. Those forms use different skill sets. A writer can be good at novels but not have a natural talent for short fiction. ",

A short story is shorter than a novel, and as a result it is easier to analyse to see what you are particularly bad or good at, which is good to know as a writer. It can also give you idea\u2019s for your novel (Even if you have already started writing it) Truly, any form of writing is good to do. ",

Any shortcomings with your fiction will be glaringly apparent - more so than in a novel length story.
