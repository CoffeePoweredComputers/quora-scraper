            "answer_text": "Hello , as a non Kanaddiga in Karnataka I will suggest to learn Kannada ( or at least try to learn) as this will really help you to communicate and understand people and culture here. However Kannadigas are always helpful and try to comfort you by switching to your language. Also you will be really appreciated for your efforts to learn Kannada. This is all my experience in Karnataka. What are you doing? In kannada is translated as en madtha idhira?(with respect eg : for elder people) or en madtha idiya ( while talking to younger people or same age). Here en/ enu is What, madtha is for doing ( verb) and idiya/ idhira is helping verb. ",
