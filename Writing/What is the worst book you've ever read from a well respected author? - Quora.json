            "answer_text": " Most of Phillip Roth\u2019s books. He is the most over-rated American writer of the 20th century. So repetitive, so fixated on female anatomy, so narrow in scope. Lop off \u201cGoodbye Columbus,\u201d \u201cPortnoy\u2019s Complaint\u201d (neither of which has aged well) and a few others and what have you got? The same old complaint: He cannot get along with women. That\u2019s half the human race. Does he respect women? No. He always see himself as the victim. I say, \u201che\u201d because every book is about Phillip Roth. Roth\u2019s \u201cThe Dying Animal\u201d is a good example: \u201cIt tells the story of senior literature professor David Kepesh, renowned for his literature-themed radio show. Kepesh is finally destroyed by his inability to comprehend emotional commitment.\u201d Other examples of awful work: The Breast. Protagonist, David Kepesh, becomes a 155-pound breast.My Life as a Man. \u201cRoth introduces his most important character, the Roth-like novelist Nathan Zuckerman -- so central to Roth's vision that he'll show up in nine other books. And it's in \"My Life\" that Roth struggles to make sense of the spectacularly failed relationship that surely helps explain what is often cited as the major flaw in his fiction: his inability to see women whole.\u201dThe Humbling (if only!). \u201cBrief to a fault at 140 generously spaced pages, it can hardly be called a novel at all; it is more an old man's sexual fantasy dressed up in the garb of literature.\u201d",

I was a big fan of Stephen King (maybe I will be again someday), but after he joined Twitter I really started to dislike him. I read all three of these after that, but I have enjoyed other books of his so I don\u2019t think that was the problem with these books: The Regulators (The Regulators (novel) - Wikipedia) Duma Key (Duma Key - Wikipedia) Lisey\u2019s Story (Lisey's Story - Wikipedia) I couldn\u2019t finish any of these three books. Boring, repetitive and annoying. When I\u2019m not enjoying a book I always try and think why the author wrote it; what was the point. As a struggling writer myself, I know that when you sit down to write, especially something as long as a novel, the idea really has to grip you and keep you enthralled yourself. It has to push you forward. For the life of me I can\u2019t see what happened with these three, why he wrote them, or why they were published\u2026 ",

Authors plots,characters also come in it. The book i read is not bad i think. Its more like if you want to chill then you can read it. Twillight saga series is one i don't think why people like so much. Yes its good but some things in it i hate it. Sparkling vampires, When voltera(volturi) is ancient then how come cullen are stronger then them. Different Gifts should be on both side after all. Bella is more like idiot teenager who think she is independent but she seem blindly depend on them. Does not have self respect. Not to mension she just meet jacob and Edward in two years she know edward she want but she did not let go of jacob. she was making it to much complicated then it should have. Everything happens by her wish but she think of herself as damsel in distress. Cullens are old i guess they must have there own lifestyle somehow different from each other(not talking about there diet) like there personalities shows in book. There only some character i like which seems strong on there own Carlisle,Charlie,Rosaline,seth and his sister, emily,. Jacob and edward had very different narure nearly opposite of each othere in book but with bella they rather change their personality too much from their orginal. Edward before meeting bella was some how more independent and out going seems. He love her ok but why he have to change for her that much. Its seem opposite to saying \u201cpeople love you for who you are.\u201d Same goes for jacob and alice. (Guys who like twillight have no right to angry on my view its my personal views of this books everyone has different views after all.) Good Day-N ",

The answer, I am pretty sure, is the second. John Steinbeck\u2019s early novels pretty much suck. I finished To A God Unknown and thought to myself: \u201cHell, even I could write a better book than this.\u201d This is gratifying to me, good news. It means you may start off with weak, flabby muscles but over time you can figure out how to strengthen your weaknesses and find better routes to strength. It means nobody needs to give up cuz their first effort sucks \u2014 or even their second. If Steinbeck had given up after The Long Valley or To A God Unknown the world would literally be a different place. We would have missed out on some of the greatest American fiction ever written.

There's so much wrong with this book- its vast imperfections make it shocking that it's gained a loyal fan base and that it's ranked as second in Toni Morrison's oeuvre only to the vastly superior Beloved. Let me tell you why. It relies on shock factor alone. Many readers take this as a moving testament to the suffering of black people. What they fail to realise is that its only appeal to readers is blinding people of its faults through ceaseless child abuse, rape and murder. It's fine ( in fact, I condone it) to include harsh elements to your writing, but where do you stop?The symbolisis is heavy. Does she presume her readers are idiots? That we can't pick up on imagery unless she spoon-feeds it to us? Her style matured, and her ideas on such topics improved, but, seriously, why doesn't everyone else see this simple fact?Characterisation is banal. Does she Cate if what she writes is vacuous? Perhaps she was impatient, but does that justify it? And to compare that to the baby in Beloved\u2026Be persuaded by this, because it's time critics moved on to praise her other stuff. Why this was ranked above her 2008 masterpiece remains a mystery to me\u2026 ",

To be able to read a lot I read with the 3rs technique. It works that way 1. Rip 30 pages out of the book 2. Replace the pages means fold them and put them into the backpocket of your trousers where the wallet is. 3. Recycling Bin Every page I have read I junk as soon as possible. With this technique I can read every free minute. To keep track with my books I use a virtual bookshelf on 3rs . Visit me and learn more about this great technique and about great books. Of course you can also contact me on great crichton books. But the virtual bookshelf is pretty new so there are none of his books there yet. ",
