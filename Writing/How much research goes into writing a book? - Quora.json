            "answer_text": "Honestly, it depends on what is being written.If it is a historical fiction, writers usually spend more time on research than they do actually writing. They spend months reading up on the time period they are writing about, and keep books beside their computer while they are writing.If it's a modern, realistic fiction, you might be surprised at how little. In the example you gave, it sounded like perhaps the author knew someone in similar circumstances, and possibly built up on a true story he had been told. I'm in the middle of writing a book, myself, that is centered in a summer-long acting class. Though it is not necessarily about the acting class, I have read two short book about acting just so I can have an idea about what the main characters will be taught.If it is science fiction or fantasy that is being written, then there may be a surprising amount, though most writers will not count this as true 'research'. They will read up on similar books of the same genre. For example, if I was writing a book about dragons, I might read the Eragon books, Beowulf (arguably the first place dragons were mentioned) and other well-known books (both modern and classic) where dragons are portrayed, so I will know what the audience expects. I may not stick exactly to expectations, I may do something entirely new and never seen before, but it is still a good idea to be wary of expectations. ",
