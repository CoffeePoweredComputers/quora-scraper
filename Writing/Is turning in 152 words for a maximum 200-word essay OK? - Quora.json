            "answer_text": "Well, I guess it depends on one or more aspects. First of all, I believe that word limits are only put to verify your skill in expressing what you\u2019re asked to write about as precisely and concisely as possible. Secondly, how strict each organization/university is with the word limit depends on the organization/university itself and its standards. Nevertheless, most of the time you should start having concerns when you exceed the limit, not when you write fewer words than the limit. Thirdly, if you believe that you have covered all the aspects of the essay\u2019s topic/question within those 152 words, I believe this won\u2019t cause you any trouble. Lastly, the most important thing is to always ask yourself after finishing every essay whether you have answered the question as fully as possible or not\u2014even if you have written fewer words than are required.

            "answer_text": "The answer is built into your question; if the MAXIMUM is 200 words, and you've written only 152, why the question? You do know that \"maximum\" does not mean \"exactly,\" right?Frankly, 200 words doesn't seem like that much to me. The basic \"template\" for an essay is five paragraphs: 1: Introduction/Exposition, 2, 3, 4: the discussion paragraphs in which you provide support for your premise (discussed in your introduction), then 5: Conclusion.Five paragraphs, 200 words, amounts to 40 words per paragraph, approximately 4 sentences of 10 words each.You'd need a very narrowly defined topic and you'd have to be extremely concise.And you've only written 152 words?
