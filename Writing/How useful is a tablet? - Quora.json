            "answer_text": "I'm assuming you ask about modern tablet computers running a mobile operating system like Android or iOS. Your question is a little bit vague. An object's perceived usefulness depends very much on the person using the object, and what they use it for. Instead, I'll answer a similar question that may help you determine for yourself how useful a tablet can be:  Do the benefits of owning a tablet justify the cost? Short answer: absolutely. (Or just get a big phone...see below) If you have the extra money, the mobility that a tablet offers can be life-changing, even for simple web browsing, messaging, and reading. This comes from a guy who has purchased and returned or given away several tablets (iPad, Transformer, and Kindle Fire) because I didn't perceive them to be useful enough in the past. My experience has changed. However, if you plan to use a tablet only for these simple purposes, I suggest you instead upgrade your phone to a high-end model with a large screen. With today's apps, a tablet can perform most tasks that you can do with a laptop, but three features really make the tablet experience magical:  Size - light and easy to transport. I can even fit mine in my pocket (yes, it looks ridiculous). Battery life - hours upon hours of useInstant on - Though very fast these days, laptops need to turn on and load. Tablets are ready to use immediately.So for about $400, I have a computer (the tablet) around me at all times that stays on forever that I can pick up and use instantly for just about anything. Worth it.  For just about anything?  This is where you really decide how valuable a tablet will be to you.  As with any tool, the value you get from your tablet depends on: How savvy or knowledgeable you are about using itYour willingness to adapt your workflow to include itMany people believe laptops or desktop computers are better for certain tasks than a tablet. They are correct. Tablets are fantastic for casual consumption of information, shopping, and entertainment, and they work pretty well for communication, but more advanced tasks require learning and practice on your part to execute as effectively as you can with a sit-down computer. In return for your efforts, you benefit from the portability of the tablet.  For example, authoring documents, spreadsheets, and presentations can be a little more difficult with a tablet, but if you learn how to use the right apps, you can enjoy doing these tasks while laying back on your couch, standing in line at the store, walking at the gym, or lounging in a hammock at the beach--places where a laptop would be burdensome. A bit of imagination can go a long way. I use my tablet for programming, server administration, monitoring my home, drawing, controlling the TV, making phone calls, and planning trips using digital maps. The products I created with the tablet have paid for the device several times over. Sure, I can do all these things with my computer as well, but I enjoy the freedom of using the tablet anywhere. Tablet vs. Smart Phone Touchscreen phones are just small tablets with radios that connect to wireless cellular telephone networks. Today's best phones have processors that are as fast, if not faster, than most tablets (and even many computers), and they will run almost all the same apps that a tablet will. If you have no need for a bigger screen, choosing a fast, large phone (5- to 6-inches) will eliminate the need to transport two devices, and you get all the same functionality of a tablet in a smaller package.  Drawing, designing, note-taking, and reading/editing documents feels better on a tablet-sized screen. Tablets may also be easier to read for those with trouble seeing.  I returned my first three tablets because my phone was capable of doing everything I wanted at the time from a portable device. The tablets could do everything too, but I didn't want to carry two devices around. I finally kept my latest tablet because I needed a larger screen for programming and for writing school assignments and homework. Not surprisingly, the ability to split the screen in half to use two different apps side-by-side works better on a tablet than on my phone.  Summary Choose a tablet if you can benefit from the larger screen. Otherwise, just upgrade your phone. Be prepared to dedicate time for learning to use your device if you wish to get the most value from it. Plug: This answer submitted from my tablet: http://amzn.com/B00KHA2DQM/  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I\u2019m Siska, business researcher at ArchiSnapper. We provide new articles every week on how you can build and scale your AEC business. That depends on what you use your devices for in your professional/daily life. For a construction worker, for example, a tablet can be super useful and more useful than a smart phone depending on their daily tasks. Here\u2019s a piece of content from our latest article on the differences between tablets and smart phones: TABLETS: pros and cons A tablet is designed to sit on the table or lap, to be carried in a case or briefcase. This means that while they have much bigger screens, they are heavier and less durable. Pros of using a tablet  Better for extended work sessions: Tablets are designed to work for longer hours, which makes them better for extended work sessions than smartphones. When it comes to editing photos and videos of the project, it is a superior tool because the visibility is much better. Many tablets have a longer battery life than most smartphones. Reading and writing: Tablets are easier to read and interact with content. This is especially when it comes to viewing documents, drafts, and drawings. It is also easier to use interactive websites and read large pieces of information on a tablet. Reading and writing content is more comfortable. Video calling: Tablets are easier for video conferencing. Propping your tablet on the table allows you to conference with clients with a professional feel, than holding your smartphone in front of your face. Cons of using a tablet:  No texting: Tablets cannot receive SMS messages or use WhatApp independently. There are some apps which you can use to connect your mobile to your tablet, but as a standalone device, they are less than ideal for communication. Awkward calling: You can make calls through platforms like Skype and Facebook Messenger (among others) but holding your tablet like a phone is clunky and awkward. You can use the handsfree or a headset, but once again, they are less than ideal. Heavy: While a smartphone easily slips into your pocket, you need a case to take your tablet around with you. They are less convenient for moving around, climbing ladders, and trekking around job sites. SMARTPHONE: pros and cons  Handy: A smartphone is designed to be used in the hand and fit comfortably in your pocket or purse. It\u2019s low weight, high durability, small size, long battery life, and with the ability to use voice commands and one-handed usability, it is the ideal device for on the go. Better communication device: If you need to talk on your phone a lot, or if you\u2019re going to be sending a lot of texts and instant messages, then a smartphone is a better tool. Because it is always with you, it is more ideal for communicating effectively. Camera: If you will need to take a lot of photos of your job sites, the camera is easier to point and shoot with a smartphone. Generally, the cameras on smartphones tend to capture higher quality images than tablets, while also being a lot easier to carry around. Cons of using a smartphone  Difficult reading and writing: The small screen of the smartphone makes them more challenging to read on. They are not ideal for viewing documents or drawing. The tiny keyboard is not ideal for writing long pieces of texts. Reading and writing content is less comfortable. While it is possible to review documents and sketches, it is less preferable to a tablet. Hope this helped somehow! ",
