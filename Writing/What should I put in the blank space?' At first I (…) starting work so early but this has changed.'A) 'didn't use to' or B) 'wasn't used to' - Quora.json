            "answer_text": "Your \u201cA\u201d option isn\u2019t correct because you need the infinitive \u201cto start\u201d, not the gerund \u201cstarting\u201d. So the correct sentence would be: \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t use to start work so early, but this has changed.\u201d And it\u2019s just the opposite for your \u201cB: choice. You need the gerund \u201cstarting\u201d not the infinitive \u201cto start\u201d. So the correct sentence would be: \u201cAt first, I wasn\u2019t used to starting work so early, but this has changed.\u201d And there\u2019s a subtle difference in meaning. Your first sentence is describing how your behavior changed, But your second sentence is expressing that starting work so early was very unfamiliar to you. ",
