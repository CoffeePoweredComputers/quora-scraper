            "answer_text": "No not climate. It is weather. You should say \u201cThe weather is very chill and snowy\u201d Why? Because: Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. ",
