            "answer_text": "Yes, there is a difference, and this difference helps understand how rhetorical education has changed over the centuries. Rhetorical terms are simply terms used within the study of rhetoric. They may describe strategies, analytical approaches, theories, devices, or other aspects of rhetoric. People have been studying rhetoric for 2500 years, and in that time, they've come up with at least several hundred terms--possibly thousands. Examples would be rhetor (someone who uses rhetoric); arete (virtue), which is part of ethos (character); consubstantiality, which is part of Kenneth Burke's theories on identification and division; antimetabole; synecdoche; strategic ambiguity, which is a type of polysemy; and nonhuman agency. Again, there are a great many others. Even someone with a PhD in rhetoric would know only a small fraction of them. In years past, most notably in the Renaissance, much of rhetorical education consisted of memorizing rhetorical terms and their definitions. Today, we focus more on strategies and theories, and use the terms necessary to describe these. The terms are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. The difference between rhetorical strategies and rhetorical analysis is based on the difference between rhetorica utens (the use of rhetoric) and rhetorica docens (the study of rhetoric). If you are a rhetor attempting to persuade someone of something, you will (probably unknowingly) use certain strategies. You might, for example, attempt to identify with your audience, showing that your interests are aligned. This strategy makes your audience more likely to listen to you. If they don't do that, you can't persuade them of anything. A rhetorical analysis approaches the situation from the other direction. Instead of deciding how to prepare for an upcoming rhetorical event, you would examine an event that had already taken place. You might then observe that the rhetor was using the rhetorical strategy of identification. You could then also observe the audience reaction and analyze the effectiveness of the strategy. As part of this analysis, you would probably use certain rhetorical terms, but the terms themselves would not be the entire analysis. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a difference but it isn't all that profound. First, rhetoric is speech or writing aimed at presenting an argument or persuading those who hear the speech or read the writing. Rhetorical terms might be called rhetorical devices. They are enhancements sprinkled into speech or writing to emphasize a point, often to the extreme. Here's a list of ones common enough to be studied for AP English classes: AP English Rhetorical Terms - Study Notes. Wikipedia has a comprehensive list of them here. Rhetorical strategies are methods speakers or writers apply in order to persuade their target audience. Where a rhetorical term would apply to a single usage, a rhetorical strategy applies to a complete work. Here is a list of commonly used rhetorical strategies. Rhetorical analysis is the act of recompiling and analyzing the use of rhetorical strategies and rhetorical terms. It's a form of criticism aimed at examining the interactions between spoken or written words and the target audience consuming those words. Is all that clear, or should I throw some amplifying adjectives and adverbs in to drive each point home like a steam hammer driving rail spikes? ",
