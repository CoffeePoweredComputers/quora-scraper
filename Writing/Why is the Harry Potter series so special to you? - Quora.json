            "answer_text": "The series is special because, to me, it\u2019s about growing up. We see Harry, Ron, and Hermione dealing with many of the same issues we all do: we go out into the wider world with preconceptions and ideas about how it all is. But once we get there, we discover the real world is a lot messier and murkier than we thought. What\u2019s more, we NEVER have all the answers or all the info we need to make the best decision. Sure we can ask for advice and learn from others, but we just end up making NEW mistakes instead of old ones. We also have to deal with new and more responsibilities as we grow, and again we don\u2019t always make the right decisions. EVERY character we meet makes mistakes. We also see them deal with those mistakes in various ways, some better than others. But in the end, while every character makes mistakes, suffer setbacks, and even lose loved ones, the good characters NEVER stop pushing forward. They learn to adapt to the world, changing their ideas and beliefs to better fit their environment. The bad or evil characters, on the other hand, NEVER learn or grow, but cling to their old ideas. Some simply stew in their pasts, while others try to force their ideas onto the world, and the people, around them. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of my earliest memories are of my mum reading my sister and I the first two books before bed, a chapter a night. Being a child dealing with trauma, the Harry Potter series was a way for me to escape my harsh reality and fall into a world of magic. I was 12 when the last book was released and 17 when the last movie came out, so it\u2019s been with me since the age of four, all the way through to now. It\u2019s a way for my mum, sister and I to bond and it introduced me to the world of reading and literature. ",
