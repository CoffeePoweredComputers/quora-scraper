            "answer_text": "I don't know who actually typed the information into Quora. I can't imagine it was Clinton herself. I don't know what level of input she personally had.  But I do know that if you read the answers she's provided, they're questions that she's been asked a million times before and answered personally. So even if she doesn't have a direct input in the exact wording of the answer as it appears on the site, she's had a huge amount of input in the content of the answer. It's what she believes and the position she takes to the American voters and she's approved those words appearing under her name. ",

But thereafter the staffers write everything, it gets approved, and posted under her name.) YES, this seems very fraudulent. NO, I don't know why Quora cheapens itself by allowing this. I've already asked them why they allow this, but I can't get an official answer from Quora; they seem to value the publicity over authenticity. ps - anybody from the Clinton campaign - especially Hillary herself - wants to challenge me on this, then I'll be happy to submit a series of questions for you!!!!
