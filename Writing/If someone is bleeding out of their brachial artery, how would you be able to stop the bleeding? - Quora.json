            "answer_text": "Use 1 or 2 layers of gauze, tissue, handkerchief or whatever is available directly over the place where the bleeding comes from. Use 2 fingers and press until bleeding stops - once you hit the right spot you\u2019ll be surprised at how little pressure it takes. You can also grab the upper arm with your other hand; feel gently between the biceps and triceps muscles and you will feel the brachial artery - apply pressure with your thumb and the forward bleeding will stop. This is sometimes the quickest and easiest way to control significant bleeding. It\u2019s quick, easy and it works as a quick tourniquet. This may allow someone in the ER to open the wound a little more and place clamps. I have repaired 25 - 30 of these and all were controlled and repaired without significant difficulty. Occluding the artery with your thumb can sufficiently control the bleeding in 5 seconds or less. Try it on yourself and you\u2019ll see how easy it is! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to stop or slow down and arterial bleed is to use direct pressure over the wound. The use of a tourniquet can be also be utilized. However, is a alternative method when direct pressure does not work. The tourniquet this needs to be placed on the extremity above the area where the bleeding occurs carefully. Twist the tourniquet enough to stop the bleeding. However, you do not want to stop the overall circulation to the rest of the upper extremity for long period of time since doing so can starve the tissues distally of oxygen. This is something to always keep in mind. That said the number one thing to do is stop the arterial bleed, and call 911. ",
