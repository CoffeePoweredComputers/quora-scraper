            "answer_text": "Darkness of sign has two factors: ink type and ink flow rate. Experiment with a darker, better ink. As flow rate is concerned, make sure you clean the pen well. Cycle it for a while with warm water, until the water that comes out of it is crystal clear. If that does not improve things, see next point. Your last resort is to write more slowly; that gives the ink more time to descend along the nib. For title lettering, slowing down is not an option. As smoothness is concerned, every fountain pen has a soul of its own, and not just every model\u2026 every individual specimen. Especially if you purchase used vintage pens, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s a hit or miss, every time. Nib tolerances are micrometric. Personal usage habits and wrist pressure will break in every pen in ways that make it unique. A pen that fell on its nib, even only once, turns into a different pen, permanently. Some pens just write smoothly, every time, since they came from the factory\u2026 and some just don\u2019t. I have a broad nib Sheaffer calligraphic that is a smooth as silk, and another Sheaffer calligraphic, fine nib, that is scratchy and nervous. Go figure. Rotring nibs seem to be more consistent across specimens. Experiment with different brands, models and production years, and with new, used and vintage new stock specimens. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly , clean and maintain your pen every 2 month at least or risk damaging your pen in terms of clogging and staining .After cleaning ,your pen will write lightly as ink mixes with water but after writing sometime, it will come to normal . If it is writing lighter , there might be two problems namely poorly tuned nib and a light ink or not so well saturated ink .Best recommendation is to change your ink to a bottle ink which is well saturated . Don\u2019t use cartridges as there is less ink economy and capacity and they tend to write lighter but , you can put bottled ink into cartridge by using a syringe but make sure to put all the old cartridge ink away . If the line delivery is thin or the pen writes thin, you need to just put a bit of pressure on the nib to slightly (I mean extremely slightly) separate the tines . This will help the nib dispose more ink while writing . If the pen is writing scratchy, put ink into pen and take a paper bag . Draw lines from left to right and right to left . Find when it writes scratchy ,whether from left to right or right to left . Once you find in which direction it writes scratchy , start drawing lines until it smoothens up . You can also draw 8 continuously until it smoothens up . That is how I smoothen my nibs . If still none of the methods work, change the nib of that pen . If it still writes crappy , time to get a new pen. Hope this helps!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "If it is writing very faint. I would pretty much replace it. But if you want to keep it, you will have to press harder to get darker lines but it will make it less smooth. I know many free-flowing and dark pens such as Pilot Hi-Tecpoint V7, Cello Butterflow pens, and Montex Megatop pens. Most rollerballs are smooth and dark so they are a good option. ",
