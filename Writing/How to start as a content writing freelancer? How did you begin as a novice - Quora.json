            "answer_text": "Write, write and writeIt may seem as a very lame suggestion and you may be like, duh I know. But believe me, to become an established freelance writer, the primary thing that you need, is to hone your writing skills. Practice writing as much as you can. 2. Read a lot Your writing skills will improve when you have a kack for reading a lot. It will not only increase your vocabulary but also will help you expand your horizon. 3. Learn new skills As much as quality content is preferred by clients, there are stuffs that you must keep in mind while writing for a them. When you become a freelance writer for a website, your client relies on you to write content that is good in quality and helps in ranking his website. Learn search engine optimization(SEO) basic html and wordpress. If you do not want to learn the languages, atleast learn SEO. After you\u2019ve aquired your skills and have decided that now you CAN write for clients, here\u2019s a list of things you need to do. Make a websiteA writer MUST have a website. If you do not, make one. You do not need to have advanced website making skills or learn a whole set of programming languages. All you need is just go to a free website maker like wix or wordpress and make one. 2. Write blogs Blog writing helps you hone your writing skills. And for your website visitors, this is the place where they\u2019d be entertained and spend the most of their visiting time. This will also become an area where your prospective clients will examine your skills and consider you for their project. But before starting to write blogs, you need to choose a writing niche. 3. Choose a niche A writing niche is a just like genres. There are many writing niches. You may be familiar with few, like, fashion, lifestyle, IT, sports, business, health, entertainment etc. Do not be tempted to say that you can write on virtually any topic because believe me, nobody can. Juggle your options and choose the right one. After you\u2019ve set up your website and have written few blogs, Start with writing internshipsClients will always want an experienced writer. They neither have time nor money to consider an unexperienced one. On the other hand, internships, though low paying, will consider you and give you projects to do. The end result would be an addition to your portfolio. There are many websites like internshala (many others are there, search them) where eminent companies register to offer internships. 2. Pitch on job boards Clients hang out on job boards to hire freelance writers. Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll meet prospective clients and get work. Before doing that, do not forget to add the links of your published works(from the internships)to your portfolio and provide a link to your portfolio and blog on your CV. 3. Register in freelance service providing website They are also a means to gain a clientele. Sites like fiverr, freelancer, truelancer etc provides opportunities for freelancers(not just writers) a platform to showcase their skills and get clients. On the other hand, there are websites like wittypen, iwriter, which are just for freelance writers. They will examine your skills before welcoming you onboard. 4. Make a professional twitter and linedin profile A professional twitter profile is very important. Twitter along with linkedin is a great place to expand your network. Do not just create a profile, add a profile picture and sit back. Follow people and in turn they will follow you back along with people who follow them. Tweet regularly (your can tweet about your work, your current project, about writing or promote your latest blog posts). I hope this answer was able to solve your query. ",
