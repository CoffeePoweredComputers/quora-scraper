            "answer_text": "Firstly, and most importantly, the vast majority of media representations of transgender people that you see are WRONG. Back in the early stages of my own gender transition, one of my acquaintances said to me, \u201cBut you don\u2019t look like Caitlyn Jenner\u201d. Oh, for goodness sake. No, I haven\u2019t had millions on dollars of plastic surgery, and I\u2019m not a celebrity, and I\u2019m not femme, and no I don\u2019t even want these things, either! Secondly, realise that aside from the sub-plot of her gender transition, you can swap most of her personality, temperament and traits with any other woman in the story. Transgender people are incredibly diverse. Most of us don\u2019t fit the stereotypes that people assume. Breaking the stereotypes and media tropes will make your webcomic more realistic, and more interesting. Thirdly, get ready to bin your assumptions about what transgender people are like, why we transition, what gender transition is like. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but if you want a good result, you need to spend a lot of time getting some understanding. If you don\u2019t do this, it would be like writing a story about a trip through India, China, and Japan, without ever having been there! To get past your assumptions, to really take a virtual journey through a life experience you\u2019ve never had, get to know some transgender people, and start to expose yourself to quality resources that describe the real complexity of transgender experience. Most resources about transgender people dumb down this complexity. You\u2019re best to completely ignore those resources. Three simple things you can know up front, which apply to most trans women, and to trans men and non-binary folk, too: We are complex.We are both different to other women, and the same as other women. Those differences and similarities are individual.We are both amazingly strong, and distressingly fragile.Here follows some of the resources that really show this \u2026  Sophie Labelle\u2019s \u201cAssigned Male\u201d webcomic \u25ba https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Labelle\"Labelle has said that while working with transgender children, she \"noticed how negative everything we tell them about their own body is, so I wanted to create a character that could respond to all those horrible things trans kids hear all the time.\" She has made educational guides to go with the comics, to make safer spaces for trans youth.\" The main character here, Steph, has exaggerated traits of boldness, diplomacy and academic capability. Because of the baptism of fire through gender dysphoria and gender transition, we often develop two or three of these traits for our own survival, but nowhere near to this degree. :-) Here\u2019s a good spot to start reading \u2026 keep clicking Next, then at some stage go back to the beginning to get the back story. \u25ba http://assignedmale.tumblr.com/post/124548035422/ikr-mondays-update-is-up-3   Fastest introduction to our diversity and the bizarre things people say to us.  THINGS NOT TO SAY TO A TRANS PERSON | BCC Three (8\u00bd minutes)BBC Free Speech asked Paris Lees, Fox Fisher, Veronica Blades, Adeleh Sasansara, Munroe Bergdorf, Dani Gibbison and Harry Taylor to pick out questions they often hear. We asked, so you don't have to!  Trying to fit in, and eventually figuring out we need to transition. \"Kids are desperate to fit in, so I did everything I could to try to make myself conform to what I hoped were my parents expectations, and I excelled at a lot of guy things. It's not uncommon with trans people to do that, to go to quite extreme lengths, and I ticked every box. I was a military officer, I went to the infantry, which is a combat arm. I played serious sport, I did male things. But the externals didn't change how I felt inside; no amount of external achievement changed my feelings, and at a certain point in your life, I think you either die, or you become yourself.\"\u2014 Cate McGregor  Studio10 - Cate McGregor: Transgender Life (14 minutes)\u00b7 World's highest ranking transgender military official  Common trans life problems and how anxiety provoking they can be. Toilets, change rooms, phone calls, doctors, stares from people and what those stares mean. Even when your transition has progressed past the point where you need to be afraid all the time \u2026 the FEAR is still there, a daily drain on your emotional resources.  Refinery29 UK \u2013 A powerful short film by Jake Graf (4 minutes starting from 9:57), reveals some of the everyday activities that can be difficult when you are trans.  Transgender people are very diverse, more individual than the general population. Laura Jane Grace, front woman for punk rock band Against Me!, is a trans woman, and she put together a documentary which I think is the best portrayal of the incredible diversity of transgender people:  True Trans documentary (episodes 1 to 10) \u2014 Laura Jane Grace  The subject people don\u2019t like to talk about \u2026 \u25ba http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-truth-about-transgend_b_8564834.html The Truth About Transgender Suicide  As a non-binary transwoman, some of my Quora answers might also be a quick way to help you break down the assumptions you have about what it\u2019s like to be trans.

            "answer_text": "Great question! Here's some guidelines. You can break them! But please understand them first. 1. Don't let their first dialogue be about their transness. Sometimes it will be the first thing you notice about them-- \"hey, does that person have tits AND a beard?\"-- and sometimes not; they could look like a typical punk, lumberjack, librarian, athlete, or anything. But even more to the point, they will usually not talk about being trans unless it comes up. Less than a tenth of what they say should be about being trans. The first thing you hear them say could just as easily be \"I fucking hate oranges.\" Maybe the ONLY thing they ever talk about is how much they fucking hate oranges. Give them something to do besides being trans. 2. Don't write an abuse background. Not only is the Tragic Gay stereotype harmful and overdone, there is also a painfully inaccurate idea going around that people become trans due to abuse. This is 100% false and should be treated like the plague. Transness needs no excuse or reason, it's just part of nature, like lefthandedness and dyslexia. Treat their childhood like any childhood. 3. Avoid connection to millennials and/or hipsters. Specifically, millennial personality tropes. There's this idea that millennials \"invented\" or \"discovered\" trans people, when in fact they have been around for a long, long time. Your character can be any age, any personality, and yes, any political ideology. They don't have to be a starbucks sipping technowhiz anarchist. Maybe they are sixty and don't care for music, are racist, spend too much on luxury furniture, and think it's okay to view Hawaii as a summer home. Maybe they are ten and play baseball and beat up nerds and call people \"gay\" for no reason. Trans people are any type of person. Make your character reflect that. 4. Don't be afraid to write real flaws and negative roles. Trans people need more positive media attention, but that doesn't mean putting them on a golden unicorn and kissing their feet, either. Trans people need real, relatable, fleshed out characters. Even villains, antagonists, and antiheroes are fair game. The trick is to humanize them. All good baddies are relatable in some way. Pure evil is not redeemable. Redemption, or even the possibility of redemption, can go a long way towards respectful portrayal of a character. One key thing to think about is: Are they a villain BECAUSE they are trans? Or is it tangental to the problem? If a stereotype is the driving force behind character problems, rethink it a bit. Give them something cis people also have trouble with. Respect them by making them more than just their transness, and make them an entire human being, regardless of role in the story. Hope that helps you! Bonus tip! The audience doesn't need to be informed the character is trans in a timely or direct manner. Let things flow naturally. Sometimes declaring it canon is all you need. Have fun writing :) ",
