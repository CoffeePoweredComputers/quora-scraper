            "answer_text": "They are both correct but are used in different ways, in British English at least. \"In the future\" can be used in the same way that you would use \"in the past\". It refers to an unspecified time still to come. \"In the past, people in different countries could only communicate by letter, if at all; nowadays we use phones or texts or email; in the future, maybe other methods of communication will be invented.\" \"In future\", in British English, means \"from now on\". I might say to my daughter \"When I got home the front door was unlocked. In future, please make sure you lock it when you go out.\" ",

For example: In the future computers will be able to take the place of governments. He will be doing that (building a boat, for example) in the future \u201cIn future\u201d was used to describe things related to other things that had happened before or to things related to general or repetitive actions. For example: In future don't do that (hit your sister like you have before if she eats your candy). There will be less animosity and fewer conflicts in future. The two expressions have been rapidly losing their distinctive shades of meaning in all forms of English and especially in American speech. ",
