            "answer_text": "Curious like a cat. The mind of a child yet the wisdom of someone that has lived 100 years. Thinks like a lightning bolt striking in every different direction. Emotions as deep as the sea. We are very curious about life in general. Why are things the way they are? How can they be better? This is especially true when it comes to people. How can we make the human race better? We have a childlike quality about us but yet can see the world as if we have lived much longer. We understand people and our environment way beyond our years. We still love to be silly and have the innocence of a child. Our thought process may sometimes seem all over the place but in reality it is all connected in the end. We see many different views very quickly and at the same time which can be confusing for us or others when we are speaking. We are basically running through all the ideas that are popping up in our head so it can sometimes not be sequential. This is why I truly love to write because I can take my time and decipher through everything to deliver exactly what I am trying to say. Last but not least is our depth of emotion. We can speak to anyone about anything but conversations that hold meaning in the world are our favorite. Inspiring stories or someone that speaks with passion can move our soul more than anything else. It has to be authentic. We can spot a fake and will run the other way. We can see someone\u2019s intentions when they speak. If it is for self promotion or comes from a deeper place. We are always thinking about ideas and emotions. This can be draining and I think that is why we require so much alone time. Those are some of the metaphors that I believe apply to an ENFP. I am sure there are many more but these are the ones that come to mind the most. ",
