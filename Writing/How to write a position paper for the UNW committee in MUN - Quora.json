            "answer_text": "Model United Nations (MUN) is an extracurricular activity in the form of a conference where students from various schools converge to simulate UN committee meetings. Students represent their countries or are assigned to represent a country in the committees. In the process they learn diplomacy, being delegate, writing and presenting position papers, resolutions etc. They get to also collaborate and meet people. In the MUN, the participants must write two types of main documents: Position Papers and Draft Resolutions. You represent your country as a delegate in MUN. A position paper is a concise account of your countries\u2019 position with regard to a certain topic on the committee\u2019s agenda and resolutions or actions it is willing to support. For each topic on the agenda, you prepare a one or one and half page position paper. The paper should speak in terms of the country not you the delegate (e.g. use \u201cNigeria or My country or Our nation supports efforts to\u2026..\u201d not \u201cI support efforts to\u2026.\u201d). Remember the position paper is detailing the position of the country you represent. The Position Papers must define the topic in the Agenda as your country sees it. It should also show how the topic is of interest to your country. A countries\u2019 delegates at the MUN must be agreed on their countries\u2019 position; you cannot be divided in opinion. Usually the conference will provide background guide to the issue (s) and raise questions in the guide which your position paper must address. Ensure you read the guide carefully and address the questions as it pertains to your country\u2019s position. Broadly, the position paper will have 3 major parts: Introduction: A one-sentence introduction with history of your country\u2019s involvement and/or interest in the topic.Discussion of your country\u2019s current attitudes & policies on the topic.Policy proposals - list potential solutions to the problems posed in the topic area that your country might be willing to support & any previous UN resolutions/actions backing thatMore specifically, the paper should address the following details: A brief introduction to your country and its history concerning the topic and committee;How the issue affects your country;Your country's policies with respect to the issue and your country's justification for these policies;Quotes from your country's leaders about the issue;Statistics to back up your country's position on the issue;Actions taken by your government with regard to the issue;Conventions and resolutions that your country has signed or ratified;UN actions that your country supported or opposed;What your country believes should be done to address the issue;What your country would like to accomplish in the committee's resolution; andHow the positions of other countries affect your country's position.Source: Model UN - UNA-USA Research is important before preparing position papers. Because of the breadth of issues an MUN position paper has to address and the limitation on the size of the content, you have to write concise. Avoid excessive elaboration; state a point clearly and completely then move on to the next. Provide facts and statistics, avoid conjectures.
