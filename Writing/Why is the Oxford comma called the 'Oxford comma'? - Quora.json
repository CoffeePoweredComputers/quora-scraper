            "answer_text": "It has been called the Oxford or Harvard comma because those two organizations famously promoted it at a time when newspapers routinely omitted it to save line space. It is more properly called the serial comma, and most authorities today agree that it should be used in most cases for two very good reasons. A. It often resolves, but never creates, ambiguity, and therefore is sometimes required. B. Consistency promotes readability. If the serial comma is sometimes clearer, then sometimes omitting it is inherently less clear. There is an exception, naturally. Because English is rather stingy with punctuation, it\u2019s relatively easy to produce sentences muddy with excessive commas. For this reason, many authors believe in omitting commas wherever doing so does not introduce ambiguity\u2014and in many cases in practice, even where it does. Personally, I take a middle ground. If I cannot reasonably simplify or rewrite my prose to eliminate the need for commas that seem to appear in excess, I may omit some non-ambiguous commas. I\u2019m disinclined ever to omit the serial comma, though, except in very short sentences. As always in English, the most important consideration is not what some authority mandates, but what is clear to the reader. ",

            "answer_text": "As the name implies, the Oxford comma has its origins in Oxford University. It was traditionally a feature of the house style at Oxford University Press. As for who first began using it or recommending it, I do not know (the following blog post, Origin of the Oxford comma, provides a possible answer, although the author admits at the end that he still doesn\u2019t have a definitive answer). However, anyone who does a good deal of writing knows that the Oxford comma is generally a good idea, especially when the lack of the comma before \u201cand\u201d in a series may cause the reader confusion. Personally, I feel it should be used in all cases, whether the reader might be confused or not. Better to get in the habit of using than not use it when it is necessary. Besides, using it in all cases brings consistency to one\u2019s writing. ",
