            "answer_text": "I been penpalling since 1999. I have 7 of the 9 penpals I made since then and we are good and close. I use InterPals Penpals - 's Profile as of 2007 tho I only met one friend there to last until now. But it is a great site if you look closely and have a good profile. It is not about finding; it is about keeping it up. Actually, my niece, 22 is looking for female letter pals if you are interested by any chance. ",
