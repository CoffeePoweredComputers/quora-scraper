            "answer_text": "If they want to, then yes. I started to drink coffee when I was twelve. My parents wouldn\u2019t let my siblings drink coffee at this young age because I had a reason. I have ADHD. Coffee is a stimulant. My ADHD medication is a stimulant. My parents decided that I could have coffee instead of stronger medication. Now, I just drink coffee because I like it. It doesn\u2019t necessarily help my ADHD anymore (I\u2019m on too much medication to notice anything) but I still drink it. I\u2019ve not even answered the question. I think a teenager SHOULD be allowed to drink coffee if they want to. Not necessarily as young as I was, but at least when they\u2019re fourteen. Do they drink coke? Coke has quite a lot of caffeine in it. It\u2019s basically fizzy, sweet coffee. If the teenager drinks coke they should be allowed to drink coffee. Apart from the fact that coffee is yummy, coffee can also be quite useful. Teens tend to be quite lazy, but coffee can wake them up. Coffee could make them more awake to study a bit more for an upcoming test or examination. I think a teen SHOULD be allowed to drink coffee. I think fourteen is the perfect age to drink coffee. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cShould you drink coffee as a teenager?\u201d When I was younger, people believed that coffee would stunt growth and so kids shouldn\u2019t have it. As with many such vague claims, there\u2019s nothing to support it. And, in fact, it has its origins in old advertising for a coffee alternative. In addition, teenagers tend to have later sleep cycles than adults or younger children - meaning they fall asleep later and prefer to wake up later. Add in that teens need more sleep than average, and you have the stereotype of the lazy, sleepyhead teen who can\u2019t get out of bed and has trouble staying awake or focusing (you\u2019d have a hard time, too, if people insisted you go to bed at 8 pm and get up at 1 am!) Unfortunately, teenagers\u2019 schedules are based largely around the convenience of adults, requiring that they get up early and focus for hours in sometimes dull classes. In such situations, caffeine can be a useful tool. Like many adults, teenagers can use coffee to become \u201cartificial morning people\u201d and enhance their performance. However, as with anyone else, teenagers can become dependent on caffeine. It can take quite a while to clear the body, and the individual can get caught in a cycle where they need ever-increasing doses to simply feel functional. The mismatch between natural sleep cycles and schedules for teenagers can make them particularly vulnerable to this. When I was in high school I saw people who needed a caffeine fix between classes just to stay awake! So, there aren\u2019t any special concerns about teenagers and coffee, but as with anything else they should consume it in moderation. ",
