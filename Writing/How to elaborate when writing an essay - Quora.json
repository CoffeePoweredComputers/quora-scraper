Reasons A, B, C, etc. Why might someone not believe X is true? Reasons L, M, N, etc. OK, now, how to I show you that I both understand L, M and N and that they are not the only way to see X (this may very well mean accepting some portions of these as true in some way) and how do I show you that A, B and C are reasonable? Who is your audience, and how can you show that you respect them? Once you have figured out the individual pieces of the above argument, how can you order them most effectively? ",

            "answer_text": "Elaborate simply means to go into detail. When it comes time to elaborate on a specific point, think about what you're comparing it to and breakdown the differences and similarities between the two points. That should help with elaboration. When elaborating, always remember to take it a step further when presenting a point or argument and explain it to where a five year old can understand it. ",
