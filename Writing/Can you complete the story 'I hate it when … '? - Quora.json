            "answer_text": "I hate it when\u2026 My already miserable and pitiful life takes an enthusiastic plunge for even worse. I sent a transfer request from my current posting, as my required tenure (one year) in this police station was about to conclude and I knew the department will transfer me any day now to a new place\u2026 which may or may not suit me in terms of distance and most importantly nature of work. So I jotted down a request, mentioning a few appointments of my liking. I knew it\u2019s going to work as it is the standard procedure. Soon I was supposed to get transfer orders to any one of those three posts I mentioned in my application. And Voila! I got transferred.  Problem is\u2026 I never mentioned this post where I\u2019m transferred\u2026. a god damned TRAFFIC POST!!! So\u2026 after getting this message and of course a call from headquarters to confirm this\u2026. I just sat down with my head leaned, looking at the floor. Oh my Goodness I\u2019m screwed real good. Next day\u2026 I woke up at 6 in the morning and went to the new office. I kid you not\u2026. It is hectic. It\u2019s something so insanely exhausting that I never have witnessed before in seventeen years of my career. Traffic work is totally different than regular police work. And frankly\u2026 I don\u2019t know diddly about it. I\u2019ve also remained absent from Quora past few weeks and I regret it every single day. I miss being here so much. Anyway\u2026 It is going to be one tough year. But I\u2019ll suck it up and carry on. There is no hardship that can put my fat ass down for good. I will not only make myself compatible with the new environment but I\u2019m also going to enjoy it. I\u2019ll make time and again pick up all my online holy activities and join you to cherish this wonderful community. I will find courage and optimism\u2026 I always do. ",

            "answer_text": " \u201cI hate it when\u2026\u201d Maria began. Marco looked at her, aware of her sudden speech. He waited for her to continue, but Maria just smiled and waved it away, looking at him and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing\u201d before walking away. Marco can only watch her walk alone with a book in her hand. A textbook actually. Unlike the rest in her History class, she actually liked it, and raised her hand so much that Ms. Bhaer began ignoring her in class, searching for another student to have the answers, avoiding Maria\u2019s shine at what she was good at. She was also good at drawing. Marco\u2019s drawings are laughably pitiful at best (a total maestro at stick figures with swollen hands and balloon heads at best and worst), but with Maria, magic and wonder happened immediately from the first line. Out of her ordinary Ticonderoga pencil, flowers bloomed, and people and animals moved\u2014even if stuck in one movement\u2014and everything seemed to breathe and shimmer with wonder. Her art teacher, Mr. Cardinal, never did a class without coming out of his way to praise her, and begged her to show her drawings to an art gallery. At that suggestion, Maria paled and told him she best did not. She feared that people\u2014rich, important people\u2014would come and judge her harshly, and be cruel towards her ability, and say it was \u2018amateur and juvenile\u2019. Her classmates snickered at such a comment of fear of judgement and shyness. \u201cShe\u2019s just looking for attention.\u201d Jane said in a condescending tone, which seemed hypocritical, since everything she has ever done was for the sake of attention. At that moment, she wore too much mascara, and wore a halter dress so revealing that the classmates saw more skin then cloth. Last summer, she got a boob job for the same reason. Nobody could take her eyes off of her, true. But she attracted nobody, which she could not get. Meanwhile, Maria\u2019s quiet nature, and bright intelligence, and beautiful talent attracted many. And she attracted Marco most of all. She had him from the moment she entered the art classroom in early September, with an opening smile and gentle eyes that looked at him for a millisecond before turning to look at the art supplies that lay before her and the pad of open, bare drawing paper. She had him before she even said, \u201chello.\u201d Afterward, he would find it difficult to steer his eyes away from her when she does anything. From drawing her latest art masterpiece, to raising her hand desperately for Ms. Bhaer to call on her, knowing the answers nobody else knew, or cared to know anyway. Within a few weeks since she first came to his life, Maria was the top thing in Marco\u2019s mind. History made him think of her ( I wonder if she can know what year the Vikings started invading England. I like completely forgot). Geometric equations (which was Maria\u2019s least favorite subject\u2014he knew by asking\u2014but his favorite) made him think of her. Even panda bears, who have no connection to Maria whatsoever, made him think of her ( she would love holding these little critters in her hand he thought without knowing for sure if she was an animal person. And she can draw them too. Yeah, she would love doing that!). Whether he was aware of it or not, Marco Dela Calle was in love. Deeply, deeply, deeply so in love with her.  With his feelings for her apparent to everyone but Maria (or so he hoped), he began to imagine the craziest scenarios with him and Maria as the main stars of the show. They would go on adventures together, preferably in the forests and jungles, and slay monsters and have magical powers. He imagined himself to have awesome water powers like Percy Jackson, and amazing strength like Adam from Lab Rats (minus his dumbness, of course). Maria meanwhile would have a boatload of knowledge, sunlight powers, and the ability to read minds, and telepathy, which is often how they communicated in his scenarios. Of course, his imagination ran wild about Maria, as he assumes her life, and why she is the way she is. Maybe her dark, evil grandfather from Europe (he just assumes she has a dark evil grandfather from Europe.) was holding her trapped, but this girl found life anyway, drawing to her heart\u2019s content and being good at history, as well as English, and Earth Science. And she holds a locket made of purest gold that can take her and a certain companion back in time to save the world from enemies who wanted to make it crumble and go down with them. Or, or, or, she has this curse that would strike her dead at 17 (they are in high school), and he and Maria must go to another country of another world of werewolves, witches, and fairies that shift forms between pegasi, birds, and humans. Or she was a lost princess, and he, a lowly peasant, grabs her heart anyway. Sometimes the roles changed and switched between Marco and the Maria of his dreams. But neither of them were unimportant, or ignored in any of these scenarios. These scenarios also have a constant: they always contained romance somewhere in their pages and chapters. Marco and Maria will fall in love, and they would kiss under unusually bright moonlight, or at the front of a background of an explosion or firework display that somehow became too quiet and too diminished in magnitude compared to the explosive feeling of passion and heart\u2019s desire that flowed in his veins every second their lips met and parted. They would be so in love with one another, that he would, in those scenarios, basically walk up on stage, sing a stupid love ballad for her (even as his friends tell him with good intentions that his voice sounded like a cow with an ear infection, but in his imaginative mind, sounded like a dream), or more dramatically, die for her in an extremely epic battle scene that so often happened when some crazy but very powerful enemy came and took over their school. Death was an easier fear to face. Everything was much more easier to face in his life than his biggest fear: to say to Maria exactly how he felt about her. He couldn\u2019t. He just couldn\u2019t. In fact, every time Maria looked at him, he blushed red and turned away, embarassed. It became a habit to do so, which he bemoaned. He liked the safety it brought, but Maria, to his feelings which grew with time, remained oblivious and unbeknownst.  \u201c Forget about her!\u201d Charles said, one of his best friends in high school. \u201cThere are other chicks in the sea!\u201d \u201cFish you mean?\u201d Joe piped up, another one of his best friends. Both are there for him, and they found his new attraction for Maria to be sweet, but completely insane after a while. They were the sole witnesses of his heart\u2019s yearnings and the surreal, neverending tales and scenarios about him and Maria that passed from his heart to his mind through his mouth. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Charles replied, as he put his hand on Marco\u2019s shoulder. Marco could see the worry written all over his eyes for his poor, benign, lovestruck victim of a friend. \u201cYou cannot keep pining after Maria forever, Romeo. You have to find someone else. Who knows, maybe she can be your Rosaline, and your Juliet is just out there, waiting for you.\u201d Not many people knew that behind his charisma, looks, and humor, was a mind that read Shakespeare while the rest of his peers were learning how to tie their shoes\u2014and still does among with other books old and new. Joe was just an average guy, keeping Charles and Marco in the present with the best he could. \u201cYeah,\u201d Joe added, laying his arm on Charles\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou are spending way too much time thinking about her, Marco. I don\u2019t think she is that interested in you. Not as much as you are to her. I think you should let her go. Forget about her.\u201d After that, Charles and Joe brought Marco to a cafe to talk some more and hang out. But Marco could never forget about Maria, anymore than Maria could ever create bad art. At the state he was in of unrequited love, her torn up drafts were like celebrity goods to him! His feelings for her pulsed and continued, with Maria engraved and burned into his heart, basically for perpetuity. So did the fear of telling her about these feelings and the dread that came with the thought of Maria finding out. So he stayed through sophomore year, stuck in fear and a crazy storm of feelings. Till that summer moment, when Maria was standing next to him, and he was looking away as usual, when she said, \u201cI hate it when\u2026\u201d and Marco looked to her\u2014a real dare\u2014to hear what else she was going to say, only for her to walk away. I hate it when\u2026 was a thought that he circled and juggled in his head over and over. What could she mean? What could she be hating? Him looking away. He would stop that in a heartbeat! Jane showing off? He would agree with her too! Ms. Bhaer ignoring her? Mr. Cardinal nagging her to show her artwork to the world? What is it? What? What was it that she wanted to say but did not? Was it to him in the first place? He realized he cannot stand still and quiet about this anymore. So, he decided on the most bravest, most daring thing he has ever done in his life. He looked at where she was sitting, walked over to her, called out her name, looked at her dark brown eyes, and asked her for the rest of her sentence. The one that began with \u201cI hate it when\u2026\u201d The End. ",

            "answer_text": "Her brother finally came home after wrapping up the 3-day conference in his college. \u201cI hate it when all females keep talking about the gender discrimination, assaults, body shaming, etc that keeps happening with them. I have read and heard enough about it, i know there are problems with females but its annoying to hear about it over and over again. As if men don\u2019t have problems at all. You females just talk about it all the time.\u201d her brother said. \u201cSo when mum tells you to clean your room every month do you do it right away? No, it obviously takes her 10\u201320 times of repeating the same thing in different tones when you finally listen to her and after 2 weeks your room is dirty again and you need reminder so the cycle begins again.\u201d she replied while organizing the dinner table. \u201cokay i get your point but at some point the cycle has to stop right ? On every social media page and every article and with most of the women its a problem. What do you think about that then ?\u201d he asked her with an exasperated sigh. \u201cHmm, well it will stop when change comes and stays that way. But with every article/social media post isn\u2019t it good that females finally have new platforms to talk and share about the problems faced ? \u201c she smiled and then served him the food. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll try to be more understanding. Also, I am tired of eating lentils every day can\u2019t you cook something better?\u201d he gave her that irritated look again. \u201cThe kitchen is all yours too. Please feel free to cook whatever you like whenever you like.\u201d and she walked away to catch up the latest episode of her favorite tv show. :) ",

His mother who just went back to kitchen to do the dishes, remained silent. Frustrated even more with his mom's silence the boy threw away his plate and paced angrily towards the door. His mother who was shocked on hearing the noise of plate hitting the ground, shouted \u201cRahul! Where are you going. Please have this for today. Tomorrow, mom will do something different for you \u201d. Rahul, unhindered by his mother's pleading, stormed away from the home. He was walking towards his usual playground. Something made him to stop as near a garbage bin he was able to see the remnants of a thrown away food packet lying on the ground. It looked like as some one had thrown away an opened package that had partially eaten idly\u2019s. Something took his mind to the image back in home, where he had thrown his upma on to the floor. As his mind was lost in thoughts, his eyes saw that an old fragile man probably in his 70\u2019s was picking up the food packet with a glee in eyes. Suddenly his mind was filled with shame and guilt. He realized how fortunate he was to be blessed with something to eat three times a day. He immediately turned back home. His mother was sitting on the Veranda waiting for him. Rahul could see that she was holding his Aluminium plate that had the same upma. But the difference this time was in his face, where there was a glee and guilt instead of the grimace. His mother had carefully collected the Upma that had fell on the floor and saved it for herself, so she could serve the fresh part to her son. ",

I am a 15 years old girl living in Delhi,Rape capital. 2007 I was 6 years old.I was traveling in a bus with my mother. At that time I travelled in bus a lot. So we were going to my nani house.I was sitting on a seat which was beside the window and enjoying. A boy around 16\u2013-18(i guess) came and sat on the seat behind me.Suddenly he started touching my back,my mother was sitting beside me.It shocked me.Being a 6 year old girl,it was very difficult to accept it.Then that boy started touching my hips.I knew that what was happening to me but I was freezed at that time.I remained quite,I thought that if i will tell this to my mother,she will scold me.That was my biggest mistake.Our stop came,I reached my nani house,but this incident really my soft way to see this world.My hands are shivering while writing this. Sorry i didn't mention all the details because it hurts me.I can't recollect those 20 seconds of my life.I still feel afraid But this incident made me strong. 2015 Now Rakshita is different from that Rakshita. I am not afraid of these rubbish guy. My mom and dad made a strong.They taught me how to face these problems.Now I am Dhakkad So.. I was traveling in a E rickshaw. There was a man who was sitting in front of me.He started rubbing his legs with my legs . I thought that may be he did it by mistake.But that was continuously happening.Then he started pushing my legs.He was smiling.I mean there was a cunning smile on his face. I very calmly said,\u201cPlease put your legs there\u201d. He put his legs in another side.But after 5 minutes,he started that again.My mother was also with me.I knew that if i would tell my mother,she will not spare that guy.So what i did? Remained quite\u2026No\u2026 i changed myself Slapped him\u2026No..that situation didn't come Ran away\u2026not Rakshita's thing. I simply started starring his eyes in a very bold and serious way.I started starring him in an angry way.I was not blinking my eyes.He really got afraid.He got down from the Rickshaw in hurry and ran away. So I hate it when somebody touches me inappropriately. Thanks Regards Rakshita Sunita Ram (Dhakkad) ",

She moved a little, still gazing into the distance. \u201cI am sorry, I know this is weird but\u2026\u201d, his voice trailed off as Swaru made an eye contact. \u201cI should have known better, I really didn\u2019t expect this coming, I thought we were good\u2026. Never mind\u201d, she turned around and started walking. His gaze followed her. OMG! Why am I attracted to her like crazy? his emotions weren\u2019t helping him. \u201cSwaru, pls stop! What should I tell him?\u201d She rolled her eyes and placed hands on her hips. \u201cWas she always this cute? Oh god why?\u201d, he murmured under his breath. \u201cListen, if Shiv likes me, he should have expressed his feelings. Not through a mediator. We might be close\u2026..but still!\u201d. She sounded annoyed. \u201cI told him the same thing. But, he said it would be better if I get to know what you actually feel.. and so\u201d, he shook his head in disagreement with his own statement. \u201cAnd, all this while you were aware and yet, you didn\u2019t want to tell me!\u201d She raised her eyebrows. If only I had still seen you as my friend, he thought. Swaru\u2019 s mobile started ringing. She excused herself and picked up the call. His thoughts traveled back to that day. Swaru and Dev were close friends since standard X. He had always seen her as his close buddy until that day when she had fallen sick. Out of nowhere, he suddenly started having feelings of her, and even her sneezing looked attractive and not disgusting. On the same day, his friend Shiv called him to say that he likes Swaru and he wanted to know what she thinks about him. Shiv requested Dev to help him. Dev was confused about his feelings, but Shiv was persistent. As days passed, Dev\u2019s feelings grew stronger. From that fateful day, Dev was trying to fight his emotions. \u201cSir? I had asked you something\u201d, Swaru pat him on his back. \u201cI am sorry\u201d. That was all he could manage to say. He would pull her legs all day when they were friends. He would talk for hours and hours. But now, he could hardly frame sentences. Swaru took out a hairband from the bag and tied her hair into a bun. His heartbeat was raising. He was falling hopelessly for her every minute. Should I tell her, he thought for a second. He was struck between his friendship with Shiv and his love for Swaru. Cons of falling in love with your bestie. Swaru could feel the tension. She didn\u2019t like the idea of Dev being all nervous. She hid a smirk and started walking towards the car. \u201cShall we go to that coffee shop? I am hungry\u201d Swaru declared not waiting for his answer. He followed her helpless. Thousands of emotions rushed as his car engine roared back to life. Swaru sent a text to her friend. \u201cCan't this stupid Dev just say? I don\u2019t want to see him like this. But, I will wait until this dumbo opens his mouth to express his own feelings, and not that of his friends. I am meeting Shiv tomorrow to clear things up\u201d Dev tried to peep into her mobile screen. Swaru hit him playfully thinking how she had fallen for this hopeless idiot. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when people look at me and make weird face like they never saw a human like me before. I was born orphan. Left on the road to survive in this bewildering world. I was tiny and no one was there to take care of me, till I was taken in by a woman. She gave me shelter, food and good clothes and unconditional love. She used to work in an organisation. Like every child, I wanted to go to school and she allowed me without any hesitation. But my mother never came to the school. She used to send a colleague from her work. Once I hit puberty I saw something was changing in me. My nipples started growing with my facial hair. It was shocking for me that my mind can't figure out if I wanted to be a man or a woman. I want to talk and walk like a man, but somewhere I was being suppressed by my own body. The struggle was hard. My hips and chest started moving out with Adam's apple. And for this my friends used to make fun of me. I had my bad days. I used to cry alone and every time my mother consoled me by saying \u201cThis is just a bad phase. It will pass away\u201d. Now I am a fully grown woman, with a corporate job in Berlin. One day I was having a random conversation with my mom. \u201cWhen I asked her why did she pick me?\u201d She gave me a beautiful answer \u201c I am one of those who had struggle to have a respect for my identity. I want other people to respect you too\u200b, for who you want to be. I want you to have an identity. I don't want another kid who is abandon because of their different gender.\u201d At this tears roll down my eyes. I want to hug her really tight. But all I can do is, look at my computer screen and smile with my watery eyes. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when people expect others to read their minds. I've come across many people who often fail to express their current state of mind and blame it on others for not \u201cunderstanding\u201d them. It is usually desired that the other person should know that you're sad/angry/hurt/happy without even you demonstrating the same in any manner. And when others \u201cread their minds\u201d (start assuming) ,it usually turns out to be a wrong guess,which further results into the person stating things like \u201cHow could you simply imagine things about me? I wasn't even sad because of that!\u201d . Even worse in situations like: \u201cDo you have any preferences for your pizza toppings?\u201d \u201cNo. Whatever you like\u201d *Pizza arrives* \u201cI didn't wanted olives on my pizza . I hate the taste of it!\u201d exclaims the person who didn't mention the same earlier. Even I fail to verbalize my thoughts at times, but then I have started considering to not get mad when people don't comprehend my emotions for I, didn't put in any efforts to explain them either.(certainly cannot hope for extra cheese when I didn't even ask for it). Inexpressive behaviour confuses people or as I'd like to say,annoys all. If one cannot voice his/her thoughts,then one shouldn't complain for not being acknowledged. Trust me,if people had the ability to wander inside each other's minds then lives would have been wretched. Be communicative about your thoughts if you want people to know instead of playing the \u201cGuess what?\u201d games.It'll be more effective and less irritating. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when the person who once checked upon me every now and then ,doesn\u2019t even look at me now,even though we are so close,yet are hearts are distance apart.. The person with whom I could talk about anything and everything the whole day says that he can\u2019t think about a topic to talk to me .. The person who once cared too much,knew my darkest secrets,called every now and then, doesn\u2019t even bother to call except birthdays and festivals.. Worry is not about those who leave ,Worry is about those who leave back some memories and leave. He gave me as many excuses as he could,I gave him as many chances as I could,Later I realized that every chance was the food for the next excuse.. And I have learnt a very important lesson of my life,that our happiness shouldn\u2019t depend on people ,People come,People go as new people enter their lives..they start taking you for granted because they know that you are gonna remain on their side forever,to support,to help,to listen to them no matter how much broken or busy you are\u2026 We can\u2019t find our happiness in people or materialistic things,we can find our true happiness only inside ourselves,finding peace of mind inside our soul is better than expectations that we carry in our heart from other people. Yes, losing your heart\u2019s desire is tragic. But gaining your heart\u2019s desire ? That\u2019s all I hope for. This year I wished for self love, to immense myself in no one else but me and make my heart afraid to feel that I am incomplete. My wish was granted. And if having that is tragic, then give me tragedy. Because I wouldn\u2019t give it back for the world. For it is all me that I hold within myself, not the world. All for self and none for someone else ",

You are free to leave the class.\u201d Said the infuriated professor pointing towards her. Moments ago, the whole class bursted into laughter to a joke cracked by someone. The professor specifically pinpointed her from the group. \u201cI am sorry Sir.\u201d She apologised as she stood at her place in regret. \u201cYou are a girl. You should be ashamed. Just get out of this class right now.\u201d The discourteous professor replied back. She was taken aback by the harsh words. Tears started rolling from her eyes as she put her head down, wrapped all her items kept on the table into her bag & went out of the class. \u201cPardon me Sir! But, that is too harsh & disrespectful on your part. She has done nothing as such to be ashamed of. She just had a laugh, as most of us present in the class, at a joke cracked by someone else.\u201d He stood up from his place & advocated as she stepped outside. \u201cWho are you to defend her? Is this the way to talk to your Teacher?\u201d The furious professor questioned. \u201cI am sorry. I\u2019ll leave the class too.\u201d He replied audaciously & started to walk outside as the professor looked in awe. He rushed downstairs in search of her. She was sitting at one corner, with her head down, near the entrance. He went near & sat beside her. Slowly he extended his hand to hold hers. She could easily recognise the familiar touch of his, without looking up. \u201cWhy did u come out of the class?\u201d She asked with a sad tone. \u201cStop crying. Cheer up. The world is full of morons like him.\u201d He consoled. She leaned towards him, slowly moving her head to rest on his shoulder, fingers firmly entwined with his. He used his other hand to wipe away her tears. \u201cYou are the world to me.\u201d She said after a long pause. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when people generalize and try to measure me based on age-old,pre-defined social norms. Recently I was really frustrated and wanted to switch my job as there was no growth for me in that company. I was in a big MNC but I wanted to grow professionally and financially. The reply I received from most of my colleagues and friends is why you want to lose your mental peace over career, anyway you are married,let your husband take care of the finance,and you take care of your home.Earning money is not mandatory for you anyway. Why? Just because I am a wife now. I hate it when people take my career aspirations as a second prioriy based on my marrital status. I had faced several other incidents where people judged me based on my look, gender, choices etc. and everytime it happend I hated it more and more. There is a reason why we all are so different from each other.Every person has their own abilities, disabilities, looks, features, strength and weakness. Isn't being same all the time really boring. Even if we have same background and going through the same phase of our life,we might handle the situations in an entirely different way.Its OK if we have different feelings about a certain thing, The best thing we can do as an evolved species is AGREE to DISAGREE Try to embrace each other's choices as they want it to be.Even a small encouragement from peers and family and can help to grow a person invariably.

Not every one\u2019s cup of tea.

Wait. Take this plate\u201d, Kavita said kept a plate behind Varnan on the table. Varnan still talking, turned to take the plate to be surprised with a bowl of kheer. \u201cKhee\u2026 you already had k\u2026\u201d and without completing his statements, he washed his hands, grabbed a spoon and started munching on the last bowl of the delicacy. \u201cSo, Mr. So-Unhappy hubby!

I am lucky\u2026 after all, I didn\u2019t know I would get so intelligent wife who can cook my favorite dish and even hide extras for me.\u201d, he said, keeping the empty bowl aside and pulling Kavita towards him. \u201cAha! Mister, not just you. Even I learnt how to make Kheer from my roommate for you only, so I can give it when you come to teach me calculations which I already knew how to solve\u2026\u201d, Kavita said giggling.

And I still don't understand why would someone waste resources knowing that there is shortage. People are starving and some are wasting food..... That's crazy..... But even crazier is to know that the wasted food is healthy vegetables.  Nobody wastes junk food. I am not encouraging to waste junk food but I think the healthy food should be respected equally. There are many people who hate the wastage of natural resources... I am on the next level It's difficult for me to tolerate it even on TV show or a movie...(It really freaks me out) And when someone wastes water..... Ooooo that motivates me to haunt people at night... If u waste water... I will see u at midnight.  And there is a higher level in waste water  and this  These types of advertisements in which water is not properly managed\u2026..there are many ads like these(not every advertisement). Children try to copy them and once my little sister did it too\u2026. She ended up wasting a lot of water. It was very difficult to explain her. One more thing to mention here is that I m not saying to not to have fun with water\u2026.that is not waste(obviously this is going to bring a lot of downvotes and negative comments which I have to answer.)\u2026.. having fun with water is good for it(emotto\u2019s experiment has always fascinated me). But useless running of taps is stupidity. ",

I already rushed faster.\u201d Raj answered. \u201cAlright. Now can we please go home?\u201d Meera pleaded. \u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Raj answered. Raj and Meera sat inside the car while Raj drove back to their home from the mall. Around two hours later, the doorbell buzzed. \u201cRaj, open the door.\u201d Meera shouted from the bedroom. \u201cAre you kidding? Virat is on 99.\u201d Raj answered while looking at television in the hall. Meera came out of her bedroom and opened the door. The courier guy handed her the courier which had her name on it. First, she was surprised as she hadn\u2019t ordered anything in those days. But, when she opened it, she found the same designer dress which she was gazing at while sipping her coffee. The smart girl understood everything. She turned back to Raj\u2019s side and asked Raj, \u201cWhy?\u201d Raj, who was already turned towards to the door side answered, \u201cBecause, you liked it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t even tell you. Then, how did you know that I was looking at the dress and I like it?\u201d Raj smiled and answered, \u201cBecause, I was only looking at you.\u201d The century celebration moment happened on both on & off screen.

Serving my fatherland was never a luxury plane trip, the forest where my men and I battle those despised terrorists is filled with the rotting corpses of warriors felled in the by an surprise ambush, a stray bullet in the heat of a skirmish, a slow, tortuous undignified descent into death by decapitation when caught by our foes. The news of our honored dead filters every month on social media hotspots popular to my countrymen. It's doesn't look as good from my view where I always deal with reports of felled colleagues_when I am.not handling their cadavers. I lost dear friends in that dreaded jungle. The idiots don't know the value of combat medics like myself, murdering each and everyone, no consideration, even members during their intra-rivalry fights. Except for girls they use with hopes they'll multiply dwindling numbers. Hauwa fears for me everytime I leave our aisle of love on the streets of Kurmin Mashi. How many shredded tales of love have been buried in the Sambisa forest? My heart trembles as I look hard cold at the serene green before my eyes \u201cwill I cheat death once more this time?\u201d ",

He lifts his head to meet her narrowed eyes and gazes at them for a moment. The same eyes he fell in love with, the eyes with such a depth where he learnt to swim. He breaks the gaze with a sly grin and says, \u201cI know\u201d. \u201cAnd yet you do it. It's been 6 years\u201d, she says and turns away, unable to hide her smile. \u201cTime to stop it you say? Alright! But tell me something else to irritate you with\u201d \u201cI thought you knew everything about me\u201d, she purses her lips together and fakes puppy eyes. He gets up and walks to sit beside her on the sofa. \u201cWell, maybe I don't\u201d. Looking sternly at her, he adds \u201cTell me. What's the thing that makes you fear me the most?\u201d She looks in his eyes and can feel the tension building up on him. \u201cRahul, I was just joking around. You don't have to do this\u201d, she says as she places her hand on his shoulder. \u201cNo. I've always wanted to know. Tell me\u201d he says boring his eyes deeply into hers. She slowly lowers her eyes, away from his gaze, and says, \u201cYour fear\u201d. \u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cYour fear. I've seen you when you face them. I don't know what they are, Rahul. But whenever you fall in the deepest and darkest pit of your life, I fear that I might not be there for you. That I might not hear your cries. I hate to see you so afraid, so helpless. And maybe, maybe I might not understand you then\u201d. As she looks at him, he sees her fear consuming her, her worst nightmare playing with her in front of her own eyes. He takes her another hand into his and asks, \u201cThen what do you hate in me? No, not pet peeves. Something that you legitimately hate about me\u201d. She pauses for a few seconds and says, \u201cIt's when you try to control things beyond your reach. You try to control them when everything's gone haywire, then get frustrated and crack up. It brings out the worst in you\u201d. His smile weakened. His heart sank. Yet he asked, \u201cThen what do you love about me?\u201d \u201cI don't love anything about you\u201d. He smiled as she was joking. But she wasn't. As he stared at her, he understood that she meant every word. He was perplexed. \u201cI love you. I love everything that makes you, you. Every tiny speck of dust that makes the universe inside you, every bit of humanity left inside you, every beat your heart makes to keep you alive, every beat it makes me skip when I see you, every shred of your skin that catches me on fire, every colour that fills your eyes, every emotion that you feel\u2026 you might not be perfect, Rahul. But as long as you complete me and me you, and beyond, I love you. I can't just love something about you! I love everything about you\u201d, she said, her eyes with fire in them. Their love was rekindled once again. They looked at each other in the same way when they had first met. She leaned into him and he whispered, \u201cI love you too Ayesha\u201d. They kissed with passion so fierce that always burned brighter everyday that passed by.  P.S: There are some grammatical errors that I can't spot. Feel free to suggest edits. Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when\u2026 a white person disrespect someone simply because he/she is an African. We Africans have a different view of life (especially those of us found in the Western and Eastern parts). Basically our way of everything is completely different as per se the whites but it is quite normal to be around us. We are a little fascinated about anything that is unique amongst us and so we normally tend to love and receive whites with open arms. It so happens to the extent that even if you find yourself amongst the poor community, the people there are willing to share everything with you just so you don't feel left out. If you decide on leaving, they will gift you a whole lot of locally made items like the most expensive clothes we have and a whole lot. We are always ready to accept you in our homes even when we know our roofs are leaking and you are coming from a well developed country as compared to us. Yet , most white people fail to respect us and treat us like animals whereas in your homes you praise your pets. It so sad, my heart freezes whenever a white person disrespects us. We do not always get the same rights as you in your homelands but here in Africa especially my country which is Ghana, we strictly protect the rights of white people even though we've had a history of 200 years of being slaves to whites. We simply have such a warm nature that goes far as to not sentence a white person to be imprisoned without the knowledge of his President. Once you are found guilty in the eyes of the law, you will be sent back to your country to face the consequence of your actions. I'm not in anyway saying that we are saints but like our elders say \u201cin every house there is a bad child\u201d yet we don't underrate white people as nothing. We also contribute a lot to the development of your countries and we don't ask for anything in return because it's quite normal , then why are most white people against black people??? I'm sorry if you felt awkward or hurt while reading this but but we feel more than what you're feeling ! I have foreign friends here in my country and I love them not because they are gods but simply because they respect us and treat us like we are all whites too. This is how nature should be. And oh, hey, don't complain when a black person treats you bad cause it okay to him since you treat his fellow brother or sister bad, he will also want to give you back the same cup of coffee to drink from\u2026 Love one another cause God created us as different creatures to beautify the earth , so just don't find a reason to be disgusted by the other person's nature , rather when you find something strange about them, ask for explanation. Instead of being rude in all angles . This applies to everyone nobody is an exception both black and white, remember it is just skin colour nothing more than that. Be fair to one another ! Thanks ",

I haven\u2019t been in touch with anyone from the apartment from the time I moved to Banglore. Aunty2: Seems like you've grown taller. Aaah, look at you you've got a small moushtache. Me: *blushing because I had to* *And also because it was the first time someone had noticed* A1: Yea right, he's grown some beard too. Me: *Still blushing* *Same reason* Alright till now. No reason to get pissed right? A1: So, when's your marriage? Me: *What the absolute *#@$ expression* A2: Very soon, he's becoming a man. A1: But I think he won't listen to his parents, he'll bring someone from college or work. Me: *Okay?* A2: No. No. He's a good boy. He won't do all that? Me: Sorry, but I need to go asap, have a bus to catch. I bet they would have talked about me and my future wife for the next 10 minutes. No surprise, if they had named my unborn child too. This is what I hate. I hate it to the core. Why do they have to do this? I could give you a 1000 more stories like this when random people have started discussing my future right in front of me and it's irritating. P:S I was 21 when they were discussing about my future wife and kids. ",

            "answer_text": "1. I HATE IT WHEN someone judge me by my appearance. One day I asked my bestie what's your opinion on me at first sight? Then she started saying that I thought you are just a below average student but you are better than me. One more thing I never think of close bond with you but now without you I can't imagine. After listening to her words, I started thinking that everyone has their own outview for other persons by their looks and by alot of things. Then I started changing my mindset,not to judge a person by their appearance. 2. \u200eI HATE IT WHEN someone commented that I'm fat. I feel god created a large variety of dishes for me to eat. But my mother always stops me to eat my favorite food (-_-) and start taking lectures if you eat that you will become a fasto.  3. \u200eI HATE IT WHEN someone underestimate my strength because I'm a girl. Today my relatives come to home for visiting us, before they leaving they once started staring at me when I'm trying to lift my scooty inside my home and one of my relatives asked me that ' May I help you?'. Then I said no. I successfully parked it in and then stared at them.  These people always wants a reason to insult a girls strength and ability. 4. \u200eI HATE IT WHEN my parents compare me with others even in little issue. I have a friend in my opposite house.During our summer vacation she started going to coaching classes. Daily my day starts with a lecture from my mother just like this look at her, she is planning her career from now only. Try to learn from her how to use time wisely? Then I was like (-_-). Don't compare anyone with others. Everyone is special in their own way and there has their own individuality. Image source : Google. Thanks:) ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when I see some people buying vegetables by putting the car on the road, which creates a possibility of jam on the road, as well as those who come across also face a lot of trouble.  The police do not even say anything to such people because these people immediately start bullying on grounds of their posts and powers. Some of these so called great personalities have their houses nearby but what to do, it's a Status Symbol, cannot walk on foot. There are some people who prefer to go on the even first floor of the apartment by lift, even the children refuse to go up the stairs, what to do it's a Status Symbol. Lest anyone should see them walking up the stairs. I have seen some people leaving the children in the car to the main road to catch the school bus which will be just 70\u201380 meters away. Why? the child will be tired after walking and above all it's a Status Symbol. Now you tell me if these people will not walk, then how and how long they will be able to survive under the trust of the doctor. These are the things (I find inappropriate and hate) I have highlighted here by threading it into words. Thank you. ",

I hate it when the so called government hypes the things its doing for the betterment, in spite of it being nothing more than their absolute job. I hate it when you bring religion into things it has no business in. I hate it how people eat the shit about religion pushed down their throats just because the one who is pushing it is a great man/woman. (We are not sure about that too, someone just told us he/she is great). I hate it when we think of ourselves as perfect society and care for issues which only may be a luxury, but ignore the most ones. I hate it when it does not bother us that some of the finest cities in the world are running out of water. I hate it when, you and i, cannot think past our own futures. Why do you have an abundance of unhealthy duplicate food products. There could be a very big complicated sci-ency answer to that, but one word answer, Population. The demand has exceeded the supply. I hate it when we cant see that simple thing and choose to ignore to do anything about it. Hell, i hate a lot of things, but i am certainly not a hater. Then again, I hate it when, People take themselves more seriously than they actually should!! ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when\u2026. Today's young generation show their impatience in front of elders! Last weekend, I was at one of the barbecue nation in Pune. I was waiting in a queue to get the deserts and there were many people near the ice cream section.. Now I had 2 young guys may be in their 20\u2019s in front of me in the queue and there was an elderly couple ahead of them taking the ice cream. They were trying to get the ice cream using the scoop but uncle was not able to fetch it\u2026. He tried to scoop it thrice and he could get a little quantity out in his bowl\u2026 Now the 2 lads in front of me were pissed off\u2026 One of them cut the queue and went to uncle and told him\u2026 AAP Hume Lene do AAP Baad mein Lelo\u2026 aapki vajah se time waste ho Raha hai.. The moment he said that, uncle stepped aside with a smile and showed his patience \u2026 those guys had 3 bowls each in their plate and the first guy filled those 3 bowls and this whole time I was staring at them and at their bowls\u2026 the second guy might have felt bad and kept the other two bowls empty, just filled one and escaped from there\u2026. I told aunty to take her time and get the ice cream after those guys were finished filling their bowls with ice cream! That couple took the ice cream and then looked at the other counter where there were pastries but didn't go there may be because they felt they would be laughed at by few more guys if they are slow or take time\u2026 not sure though! But that day I realised, how our young generation is living a life that is so fast that sometimes we do not realise our impatience could hurt people\u2026 No matter what, just be patient around kids and elders because some day, you would be in your 60\u2019s and who knows\u2026.. you might see a young lad mocking you for your slowness!!

When I hear tiny birds chirping around, building nests and watch little kids swipe their fingers across shiny desolated ipad screens. When people don't understand that they can make eye contact with someone and still completely ignore them. When the roads just refuse to throw the goddamn traffic off for once and mute the torturous honking sounds. When the frozen river starts tearing up and my sweaters have to say goodbye to the winters. When all I can see around is this concrete, bricked up world. No signs of wilderness except for this fucking spider on my wall. ",

It is Before 2 years , Back then I was studying in 11th,,, I don't know the reason but I used behave so strangely that if my friend moves close with anyone, my tears started to roll down. This made her so embarrassing still no use,I am such a stubborn girl back then (even now). I used to cry, sulk, go away from her, and do all stupid things that might irritate anyone to the core. At times, I used to feel so jealous that I mess up things and create a scene, if my friend laughs and spend time with others. I always thought she should be with me . poor friendaaa, she underwent all my stupid and ultra crazy activities. Now If I think of those days, everything seems to be so silly, in fact I laugh at those silly moments. However, fact to be said, My best friend taught me a lot of things, she helped me a lot in ignoring such silly things and concentrating on my life. Thank my dear friends for helping me becoming a better person everyday !! Love u all Facts:- I am still stubborn and the egoist me arouses even now but a little lesser then before. I still cry if my friend moves with others. I still worry a lot and literally cries a lot if my friend stops talking to me. I still overthink for things of no use. Finally, the cute little jealous kid in me is still alive to find fault with my crazy friends. Love you guys, but beware !! The moment you try to move away, you have to face me harder !!!!;))))) With love, Mahi!! ",

The mid aged looking lady pretended not to hear it. As her love for her daughter had made her deaf \u201cOkay okay now come and have your breakfast. Look what I have made for you? Cmon, are you not hungry?\u201d the mid aged woman asked her little girl who is no more a little girl now. \u201cI don't want to eat anything touched by you\u201d shouted Zara while crying and tears were rolling down her cheeks. Something is wrong with Zara today and her mother had sensed this. \u201cWhat happened beta?\u201d asked her mother while walking towards her. \u201cYou don't dare to come near me\u201d said Zara wiping her tears. \u201cI can't understand anything. Tell me clearly what happened. I don't have much time as I have to go office\u201d said her mother. \u201cOffice? Which office? Why didn't you tell us where you go in the name of office? Why didn't you tell us that you're a nude model? I am feeling disgusting to have a mother liikkee\u2026. and suddenly her mother slapped her hard. And while gaining consciousness that mid aged lady felt it is already morning. \u201cThank God it was just a dream\u201d said the lady while yawning. She ran to Zara's room. \u201cIt's not the perfect time to tell you my reality beta as you're not mentally ready for it. It wouldn't have happened if your father didn't divorce me for giving birth to you\u201d thought the lady while looking at her innocent daughter sleeping. Some secrets should remain secret until it's the perfect time. ",

For our spoken exam she set a particularly interesting yet challenging exam. She pulled out or English textbook and flipped to a random page and recited the first line of that page which went something like, \u201cI hate it when I get surprises.\u201d And she said, \u201cTime to put your thinking caps on. I\u2019ll give you 10 minutes. Let\u2019s see who can come up with an interesting short story which either begins or ends with this line. After that each of you will come up to the front and read out your story.\u201d To give you some background on the short story that I wrote, I had just started watching football so I decided to start writing a story along those lines. My story went something like this. Sitting in the VIP box, X was feeling particularly pleased with himself as the home side were leading by 3 goals within the first 30 minutes. X was a bookie. He had made a fortune betting on football games and today was another normal day business done right. By the end of the first half, he was satisfied with the way the home team was performing was assured of a huge payout at the end of this game. But, little did he know what fortune had in store for him. With the advent of the second half, the away team played like a team on a mission. Within the first 10 minutes of the second half, seeing the way the away team was playing, a twinge of doubt entered X\u2019s mind but he brushed it away thinking scoring 3 goals would be next to impossible. But the away team\u2019s captain had other plans. Within the next 15 minutes, to shock of the home fans and X, he not only set up 2 goals but also scored 2, leading the away side to victory. Flabbergasted and annoyed at what had just transpired, X looked around to see if he was the only one in a state of shock. The person sitting next to him had gone pale and all the color had drained from his face. As they made eye contact, X said \u201cThere goes my money down the drain. I hate it when I get surprises.\u201d Needless to say, my teacher was extremely happy and \u201csurprised\u201d that I had come up with such an interesting story in such a short time. To nobody\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d I was among those who ended up receiving the highest marks on that spoken exam. ",

I hate it when people tell me my dream ain\u2019t worth protecting, just because I, a woman, had it. I take pride in what I do, and am not afraid to break any such stereotypes. In fact I pity these people, because a job is just a job for them. It is just a means to earn money, so that they could get married at a certain age, get a house and have kids at a certain age, and stick to doing other things which the crowd gives them an approval for. A job should mean so much more. It should facilitate us to dream bigger, work on our personality and ultimately devise ways to benefit others from it. It should nudge us to move on from being just a worker to becoming someone who can relate to the company\u2019s vision and make it their own. Or else, move on from being a job seeker to a job creator, and inspire others with a vision of their own. I\u2019ve got a dream, I will protect it. Haters gonna hate. ",

I hate it when I see a gang of women fighting for women's rights and reservation in front of parliament. I feel, this fight should start from our home when we are discriminated or prohibited for education rights and many more in family. We have not been given right to choose even our career. I hate it when I hear that for women the most suitable job is teaching as they can manage their family as well, as if their capability is only measured when they are able to manage family. As if their men are handicapped to participate in household chores. I hate it when women are called ITEM, MAAL, HOT or SEXY. We are human beings - Neither a product nor temperature. I hate to have sympathy for women as they are the biggest enemy of their own. They love to live life like a parasite and whine when they are not treated well by their men. First they themselves hand over the remote control of their life to their men and later make a fuss. The policy of master and slave will never change. I hate it when women are called whore, keep, slut etc, because there is no such word to be used for men doing the same activity. As if men are born with all the privileges. Thank you for reading.

            "answer_text": "I hate it when someone tries to dominate oneself over other. We are living in the era where a man can cook and women can fly. Still, something is wrong with the mentality of our orthodox society. People try to dominate to prove their pride and ego in front of others. That's the biggest point. People try to dominate only in front of others to brag about their importance and value in the society of fake people. They don't want to face the reality of life and even don't know the consequences to be made. No one going to help you down at the time you need them. Only your own-one will stand at the time of any sticky situations. Be with them.  I hate it when I encounter that the child labor is still the reality of India. India is well profound in child-labor. I understand the compulsion of their job for their family benefits but doesn't mean to disrespect and treat them like a beggar or any animal. They are human beings too. Don't have you any morals or values to treat them like whatever they stand for? Go and take their place for a while. I'm sure, you wouldn't able to stand for even an hour.  I hate it when someone chooses your failures over your achievements. We can only achieve something only after a failure. It is for our betterment. Don't disgrace it. It is just a delay in your success. \u201cFailure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is a delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.\u201d - Denis Waitley  I hate it when someone try to take advantage of someone for being innocent and bully them down. God gives us the same opportunities to live life on different scales. Only the measurements matters. But remember there will be an ending for sure. Better to show your worth which can motivate others to live a life like you rather than to put someone down to show your pride. That would consider as an ego rather than pride. I hate it when someone goes offline without my consent. At least tell it once so the person at another end don\u2019t wait for your reply. It wouldn't take more than five seconds to type \"Will ping you later\".  Thanks! (Suggestions and edits are appreciated :) ",

It\u2019s a petty hate and it\u2019s self-directed. Why can\u2019t I do this? I have two hands and a memory that won\u2019t accommodate more than two objects. I\u2019m spacy. I can\u2019t juggle. I seem to need to make several trips. I walk out confident and I return flustered, and then I return again even more flustered. The people at work make bets on how many times I\u2019ll come back for my stuff. I chant this incantation every time I leave. Phone, purse, money, glasses, keys. I won\u2019t ever grow another arm, I can\u2019t seem to force my self into mindfulness. It\u2019s embarrassing. I lost a Christmas present this year because I can\u2019t keep track of more than two packages. Why? I\u2019m not stupid. I can be extremely organized. I have a fantastic memory for everything else. My kid has this expectation that I can keep track of her stuff. I can\u2019t. I just chant another litany. Backpack, lunch, chapstick,hoodie, water bottle, library book. Similar to being unable to keep track of more than two things in public, I lose my keys, my ATM card, my glasses (I need them to drive) and my phone at home. I hate it when that happens too. ",

One day, my parents decide to search a good boy for me. They thought as it is difficult for them to search a good boy and a good family as I have complexion on my face. And everyone wants a fair girl so that it was not an easy task. In my own brother\u2019s wedding I met a lady. It was month of June, it was too hot and everyone got sweat on his/her face. And I am a complexed girl I was also not in a good situation. I didn't do any makeup as I don't like to do so. She called me and made me sit beside her. She was so rude she starts judging me first on my accessories,on my ear rings and asking me about make-up why I not did any make-up. She was making me feel embarras. I know what the result was of that meeting. But after wedding my parents asked them about me. The answer was very clear they rejected me because of my complexion and my parents was very sad. They are still in worry as I am still unmarried because of my complexion but they are not losing their hope and finding a well educated boy because they are giving me a well education and making meself-dependent. My parents says that \u201ceveryone is beautiful in his/ her own way\u201d this thought make me inspiring.. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI hate it when they volley a string of irksome questions under the pretence of enquiry as soon as I enter the hall? grrr!\u201d Aarohi complained to Shambavi under her breath staring on to her eyes angrily. Shambavi stood with pale face and stammeringly opens her mouth to utter something to assuage angry Aarohi, which is interrupted by Aarohi as she pulls Shambavi clutching her hands into one of the rooms nearby. \u201cMom!! This is why I don't feel comfortable in marriage gatherings or the like and do you get that now at least?!\u201d asked Aarohi vexedly heading close to Shambavi\u2019s ears. \u201cNo dear, listen to me\u201d uttered Shambavi as she closed her eyes and ears due to Aarohi's loud voice. \u201cAre you happy now for having spoiling my long waited weekend mood! Yes???!! My strict hostel warden and mess are far better to these bugs here is all I feel!\u201d Yelled Aarohi interrupting Shambavi and sat on the metal cot banging it with her fists. \u201cAarohi!!! Language!\u201d warned Shambavi and sat beside her. Shambavi comforted Aarohi holding her hands. \u201cYou promised me you won't react so much my dear! Calm down my sweetpie. It is very common to put such questions to youngsters like you!\u201d said Shambavi. \u201cAhh! You only know to say this! You know every single being attending this marriage will ask, how is hostel, how's studies, marks, when is your marriage, blah blah blah and should I answer it faking a smile till my jaw slips down!? And know what Sunitha maami asked me! She wrongly related me with my bestie Atul as his girlfriend. Effect of my recent Instagram post on his birthday!!\u201d retorted Aarohi. \u201cAnd more than that you know what Venkat mama said? Your police brother!! This generation is like that only. They do everything but call it friendship. He said it with a smirk. And said, our Aarohi is not like that anyways, in a taunting tone and gave a shrug!\u201d said Aarohi Shambavi chuckled. \u201cDear I know about you and Atul too\u2026 Do you think I need that explanation! Sunitha bhabhi is old and she might have asked it out of care beta. As far as I know, she is not a gossip type and Venkat is little conservative and much worried as he sees so many such cases these days at police station\u201d, replied Shambavi. \u201cI called you to accompany me at this wedding of my favorite cousin's close relative. That's it. I can't go alone always. Neither your Navy officer dad nor you could know that feel of a homealone mother! Why do you bother to answer every question they put to you!?\u201d asked shambavi \u201cNot all are bad! And some purposely kindle your anger by weird enquiries. I know it. Ignore it! But Venkat is really concerned about you beta! He is not a third person to you! Reply him in a polite way instead why do you stress your pump so much and spoil your peace!? Sweetpie, calm down!\u201d added Shambavi. Aarohi sighed. \u201cEnough mom. I can't take it anymore. Let me catch the noon train and get back to my hostel all alive before my nerves puff up here! When on the holy earth would these people change!? These folk will never change! Neither you mom.\u201d said Aarohi. Shambavi chuckled. \u201cYeah you are right. People nowadays never change only wonders why others don't!\u201d said Shambavi with a smuggish smile. Aarohi caught her pun and stared at Shambavi. \u201cYou know something, if they don't question you at all, it means they are least bothered about you! Venkat has done so many things to me when I had a tough time when you were born and Raju was three year old kid while your father was on offshore duty! Its Venkat and Sunitha bhabi who helped me a lot.Venkat never made me think about my mom anytime.\u201d, explained Shambavi \u201cMom! Mom! Mom! Enough. I don't want to hear this 20 years story again and again!\u201d uttered Aarohi reluctantly. \u201cOnce if you had thought about it, there wouldn't have been a need for me to tell it so many times! When your father is away, he subconsciously thinks it his responsibility to care his sister\u2019s children and he is good friend of your dad too. He may sound rude but he loves you so much.\u201d Said Shambavi. \u201cOh! Really mom??! You know the way he spoke and you call it a reflection of care? Wow!\u201d Aarohi tried to utter somemore but remained calm seeing Shambavi stare at her! \u201cIf you keep ignoring our own people for petty things like this, you will end up lonely one day and yearn for someone to speak with. And when you realise it you will be in even bigger mess. No matter how ever dear, friends cannot fill a relative\u2019s place. This attitude of yours will affect your children as well. Remember my words!!\u201d said Shambavi. Shambavi walks out of the room irked before Aarohi tries to retort! After this, Aarohi some how made excuses and stopped visiting native place and marriage gathering from that day. Upon completing her graduation, she got an decent Job as IT professional with an attractive salary abroad. People out there don't bother nor question about others personal much like in own country was her original complacence. Then after getting married, she settled in US as how she wished for longtime! When her son Aadesh grew up there and he had difficulties in gelling with his own grandparents. He was overtly influenced by that culture which was not his fault definitely. When Aarohi tried to make him understand that she got same strings of questions from her son! She became thoughtful and started missing her mom. And understands what her mother said turned true and was worried about her future with her son! \u201cI thought my own uncle as third person. My son who is not even 16 thinks his own grandparents are third persons and what will be my place in few more years??!\u201d said Aarohi to herself. She calls up her mom teary eyed to pour out her gushing emotions!  Story inspiration: my mother's general advices!

            "answer_text": "-I hate it when you do that! -Do what? -When you let a bunch of your hair loose like that. -And why is that, may I ask? -This fringe (points with his forefinger) makes you look irresistibly hot. -Being hot is my right. And privilege\u2014I presume... Oh, does someone feel overly possessive when their wife looks so \u2018attractive\u2019? (raises her brows) -Oh no no no no. I just feel like taking your hair like this (holds the hair bunch between his thumb and forefinger) and pushing it behind your ear (tucks the fringe). Ah, now that's more relaxing. (Heaves a sigh of relief.) (She pulls the frill back to the side of her temple.) -O dear wifey. Why do you tempt me? Might I remind you that there are at least half a dozen minors in this hall right now? And one of them is a teenage girl who, for the last five minutes, is concentrating more on us than on the food in her plate. (Points to the nosy teenager with his eyes.) So. Put. That. Hair. Back! -No. -No? -No. -Why, oh why? -Because I'm a feminist. And the first rule of feminism is: don't listen to your husband! My body. My hair. My wish. -(Raises brows.) You'll regret this. (Calls the waiter and places the order.) -I don't think I will regret anything. -Oh, you will. (Five minutes pass. They are half way through the dinner.) -So hubby, how was your day? -It was alright. (He looks at her. Rolls his head as though intoxicated.) Ah. (Holds the menu card as an opaque barrier between his face and hers.) Got to hear a few, \u201cHappy Wedding Anniversary\u201d wishes in the office. The rest of the day was just fine. How was yours? -About the same. Other than, \u201cHappy Wedding Anniversary Smitha!,\u201d \u201cWhere is Akash taking you to tonight?\u201d the day was mediocre. (They proceed to the main course.) -Akash! Why are you holding the menu card like that?! (Pushes the card down.) -I can't keep looking at that dangling frill and not do something about it! (Holds the menu card back up.) -You are being ridiculous. -No. I am being cautious. -Cautious of what? -My temptation. -You are not a teenager anymore to say that dude! (Takes the menu card and keeps it on a neighbouring table.) Look at me. -Oh darling, let\u2019s not do this. Please. -Don\u2019t be so childish Akash. -Hmm. (They move to dessert.) -So my dear hubby, do I get an anniversary gift? -I thought I wouldn\u2019t. But that hair frill right there is tempting me to gift you one. -And what gift would that be? (He stands up, leans forward. Gives a look at the nosy teenage girl\u2014her spoon has stopped midway between her plate and mouth. He leans further. Smitha is too shocked to react. Akash is so close to her face now. He blows the fringe away to the back. Smitha looks at him without daring to bat an eyelid. He inhales the fragrance of her body, and gives a gentle heave. She is still too awestruck to respond. With one quick motion, he touches her lips with his. It lasted for less than a second. She was not even sure it happened. The prying teenage girl drops her spoon in shock. She gives a sudden gasp, and shuts her mouth with her palms. Before her parents could see what had shocked their daughter, Akash had sat down.) -Huh. How was the gift? (with an evil smile.) -?! -Not like it? -(in whispering tone) What were you even thinking?! Finish the dessert. Quick. Let\u2019s leave. -I warned you that you would regret this. -Eat. Quick. -Okay dear, okay\u2026 Chill\u2026 (Ten minutes later, they are walking down the road. There is gentle breeze.) -Someone is still mad at me. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -That\u2026 That was so\u2026 so\u2026 huh, nothing. Drop it\u2026 -Okay. (Five minutes later, they are close to home.) -Akash, why are you looking down? -Wondering if my surprise was instead a shock to you. -Look at me. -No. -Look at me you idiot. (Akash looks up at his wife walking beside him. She had pulled the frill back to the front again. There was an evil smile on her lips.) -My God! I hate it when you do that! ",

If someone keeps on telling me that I can't do something, I will literally decide not to meet that person till my end! I hate that attitude of threatening someone that something can't be done just because the person giving such advice couldn't do! See! Everyone at some point of time will feel low and inferior in life and will bounce back in due course. This is natural! But deliberately discouraging someone just because that person does something which you don't like or you didn't have an opportunity to do, is like back stabbing the person who respects your advice or suggestion\u2026.! I have no room for negative people in my life and for those who picturise future as something that's not worthy enough to work hard for and dream about! I strongly believe that I am capable of reaching great heights and when someone tells something contrary to that I can't tolerate that! Only for people who don't actually have vision about their future or those who want to settle easily in other's hardwork, my dreams and visions would seem to be a day dream! And I am sure those stalwarts have got nothing to do with my life\u2026..! My wings are ready for partnership only with those who dream and think high just like me (and I have got an awesome partner who flies with me and reaches heights with me with the same passion as I have) and work towards the same and definitely not for those who threaten and try to pull me back!

And a smile emanated from her face as soon as he turned back. He couldn't hold back. He sprinted the distance and he was infront of her in no time. And without second thought he hugged her.

Outer soul replied,\u201dI can\u2019t , If I propose her at a time like this she may stop talking to me\u201d. Then comes a beautiful girl with her hair flowing along the air current. Her eyes are soulful enough to stare her lifetime . Her voice is as sweet as Cuckoo\u2019s sound sweet enough to melt a rock. She is an Goddess of Beauty.Her Charming, her smile, her lips, her face, her dimples everything seems to be calling me close enough to kiss her. The aroma which she emits gives me an refreshing feeling. And then she comes closer and Says \u201cHie\u201d and I\u2019m still staring at her glamourous beauty even the words can\u2019t describe. She: Hellooooooooooooooooooooo Me: Still glaring at her closly observing eaving the world apart. She: \u201cClaps infront of my face\u201d Me: Heyyy She : What are you looking at? Me: \u201cThinking How the God created such a beauty!!\u201d Nothing just about the new earpiece you wore. It is beautiful. She: Thank You Me: I love You. My heart started beating faster, her reaction seemed to be dulled and after thinking about 4 mins.she replied. She: I love you toooo.. I thought I\u2019m the happiest and the most luckiest person on the earth.And after seeing her we are about to come closer and kiss, Then I hear my Sister\u2019s voice saying that \u201cMommmm, again brother is making some weird faces in the sleep\u201d. Then I woke up to realise that I\u2019m in sleep and realise that I have forgotten the face of the Beautiful Girl with whom I was about to kiss. and I felt \u201cOh! God\u201d. I have to wake up and just follow the daily routine of my Single, Routine and Boring Life\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.

            "answer_text": "I hate it when Civilized people act like uncivilized or even worse than them. Today , I am going back to my college via train. Indian railways usually get late during winters because of fog and many other conditions. As a consequence of fog, Our train is also running approximately 20:35 hours late. So in this train almost 70 % of the co passengers are very well educated as far as I think but according to me there is no benefit of your knowledge if you don't know how to behave properly. Case 1: So I am travelling via Duranto Express and in this train they serve both Lunch as well as Dinner but because of some unknown reasons, yesterday passengers were given only Dinner. Since the train has more than 1000 people waiting for dinner and staff is lesser as compared. So the train staff was making their best efforts to not let anyone die of hunger and they served dinner at around 7 pm. This is quite early for a North Indian but since none of the passengers have eaten a full meal since last 12 hours so we all were hungry. But what I listened after two minutes shook my mind.One of my co passengers ,lets call him X. He got angry on Railway staff and he shouted on them. Mr. X said \u201cAee khana leke aa jaldi bhukhe hai\u201d. (Bring the food fast we are hungry). His voice was of commanding nature as if the whole railway staff was his slave. I had no grudges till now but I did not like the way he talked. After getting his dinner, He started finding mistakes in it like chawal garam nhi hai (Rice is not served hot) and all types of mistakes. He compared the dinner with those of local trains. He even indulged in a word fight with railway staff when one of the staff member told them their conditions Case 2: Almost each and every Indian know our so called Swachh Bharat Abhiyan but still have a look in Indian Railways. What we do and then we complain Indian Trains are not clean as compared to other nations. We will have to work for our country. No one else will do. These are the packets of Chips and other eatables. Can't the passengers put these empty wrappers into their bags and make trains much cleaner. India is Great and Indians are greatest. Peace  P.S. I loved the food because I have not eaten anything since last 18 hours or even more. ",

It's okay not to be okay with yourself, When your body aches and ravages, And your soul gets emptied and frozen. Silent screams when touch the scars, Will it bleed? Or will it get healed? I stand still in front of the mirror, To hide my imperfections and flaws. When I wash my face, tears roll down... And when I throw off water on the mirror, That face with bruises From outside, I live with a smile, Yet the inside of me is  full of despair. From outside, I live with the eyes full of joy, Yet the inside of me hides tears of sadness. From outside, I live with a smile that brightens surroundings, Yet the inside of me screams aloud with anger. From outside, I live a life that everyone envies, Yet the inside of me resides with insecurities. From outside, I live a life of courage, Yet the inside of me carries fears and wants to die. When I speak, silence takes over it, I cry out with the notion that no one will hear. I always remain unseen, I have pain carved inside of me, Please let me be free... :) ",

We are living in the 21st century, but our minds are still stuck in the same orthodox society which was once patronized by Aurangzeb. 1: X was eating a plate of chowmein along with her friend circle, some of them were boys. The aunties of our colony saw this and started this usual rant: X is shameless. 2: Y use to love a guy, who dumped her. She is heartbroken, there is no one who can understand her feeling. All she needs is a support from her loved ones. But our stereotype aunties bash their parents, saying your daughter is a s**t, she is characterless. Y unable to bear all those insults, commits suicide. 3. (Inspired by one of my favourite Quoran's work) In India, we don't see the qualities that a girl possess with her. We care about : can she cook, was she having a boyfriend before this proposal?? And most important: about her \u201ccharacter certificate\u201d i.e is she virgin?? On the first day of arrival of a bride, our neighborhood aunties ask the brides to sing. WTF is this? They think they are Anu Malik and brides have come for audition of Indian Idol. 4. We take pride in saying that the lowest divorce rate is ours, but we don't notice the amount of domestic violence that women face in their marriage. We fail to see the other side and then expect brides to adjust. This needs to change. I'm sick of this mindset of ours. We might achieve Clean India, but will we ever ever Clean Indian Mindset?? Think\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "I was 10 or 12 years old. He used to come to my house once or twice a year. Sometimes he even stays for a few days. One time he came and he told my mom that he is tired and his legs are paining. My mom told me to go and give him a leg massage. It was around 11 in the night, my parents were sleeping in a different room. I was giving him a leg message for almost 30 minutes, then he asked me to give a thigh massage. I started doing the thigh massage. After some 10\u201315 minutes he took my hands and kept in his inner wears. I was shocked I didn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. Before I could think about it, he held my face and kissed me on my lips. I was shivering, he came up and he held my penis tightly. I was breathing heavily and I was sweating. I was not getting what\u2019s happening with me but I understood that whatever is happening, is not correct. Somehow I dragged myself in one corner and I told him that I need to go to the washroom. He asked me to go and come back soon. I ran towards my parents but I didn\u2019t have the understanding to explain the same to my parents. I kept quiet and slept in the hall. Next morning he was staring at me and he was smiling. I thought to tell all this to my parents but I didn\u2019t know how to explain them. He was a very reputed man. My parents literally use to worship him and his thoughts. I too use to respect him a lot. Not even in my wildest dreams, I have imagined him like this. I was numb, I was sad. I use to feel lonely. I use to cry whenever I find myself alone. One day I decided to tell this to my sister. I took her to the roof and I told her everything. After hearing my story she believed me but she told me to not tell this to anyone. I lost my confidence and after that, I never told this to anyone. First Few months were difficult but slowly I forgot everything and I started living a normal life. A few years later I saw one episode of Satyamev Jayate (TV Series 2012\u2013 ) on Child abuse. That day I understood what happened to me, I was crying like a baby until the end of the episode. I thought to tell everything to my mom but I felt now it is too late. He still used to come to my home but I started avoiding him. Somehow I always escaped from him and he never gets a chance to touch me again. A few days back he was at home and the same incident happened with my cousin. I was at home and when I saw my cousin I observed that he is not feeling comfortable. I took him in a corner and asked the reason. Firstly, he was not telling anything but later after forcing a bit, he told me the same story which I told my sister a few years back. After hearing all this again, I got so angry. Somehow I got that lost courage, I took my cousin with me and I told everything to my mom. I know that if my cousin will tell this to her, she will believe me too. I told her what happened to me a few years back. She was not able to digest this fact but she believed. I am relieved that now I have told everything to my parents. But I am not happy because my parents didn\u2019t take any action. They just stopped talking to him and they asked me to do the same. Now, I hope he won\u2019t come to my house but what if he will do the same with other children. Neither my cousin\u2019s parents nor mine is in favour of FIR. But wherever I go in a family relation or family function I share this with my other cousins and alert them about that animal. I wish one day I will see more courageous and aware society. So, people like me can come out and at least do the FIR. My parents didn\u2019t support me but I wish you guys will listen to your children. I hate it when I see news about child abuse. I hate it when I see a child in depression due to abuse. I hate it when a child kills himself due to depression. We have to take this issue seriously and enforce strict rules. Childhood memories are unforgettable but we don\u2019t want our children to have such memories. Think about it. Thank You for Reading Guys. I can\u2019t share his name but still, I am feeling more relieved. I want you guys to promise yourself that you will educate your child about child abuse and you will always listen to your child. Cheers for Children and Childhood. If you too had such bitter experiences and you need someone to share. Feel free to share with me. Just don\u2019t keep this negativity within you. It will destroy you. Don\u2019t Kill yourself, Kill the Depression. Keep reading and Keep Learning. Thank you so much for your time. See you soon.

If I praise my country, it won\u2019t be enough from my writing. But I hate it when people go for a candle march when a girl is raped. Because they think it will bring some change in our people, system and law. I hated it when people joined from far corners of India, so that they will fight against rape. Is something wrong with me? Maybe, because I don\u2019t see results. 2 days back I read a news that an 8 month old infant was raped by some drunkard. Where is the candle march? What happened to our unity against rape? Everything gets faded, because we have short term memory.  I hate it, when people do drama about their supreme caste and fight for something which happened thousands of years ago. They fight for their pride, they fight to satisfy their ego. Maybe they are right and I fail to understand their fight. But I hate it, when they leave people on the road dying. I hate it, when they are not bothered to give food to poor people even when they belong to their caste. But they fight.  I hate it when people are involved in spreading hatred. I hate myself that I am watching everything, but refuse to take any action. Because maybe I am waiting for something bad to happen to me, and then I will take the pain of moving my ass. Because, responsibility comes from each individual. If I don\u2019t take responsibility, then I have no right to expect from anyone. #I Hate It. ",

It's been almost two years that I've worked with my current company. The workplace and atmosphere are absolutely phenomenal, and everything is good. Indeed it\u2019s a dream company !! So far I had given three IJP's in last 12 months, and each day the competition was getting so tough. Being a commerce student I'm always weak at logical reasoning and aptitude tests. I had failed in all those first three attempts. Later, I decided that I would struggle a lot and it's now \u201cDo or die\u201d situation for me. Because I knew this is gonna be the last IJP for next 10 months, and I'll have to clear this at any cost. Struggled a lot and spent extra hours at the office almost for two months. Day arrived for IJP test. Did my best and was confident enough that this time I would bring my name in the list. A few days later,  I was so happy reading this. I told my mom that soon I'll be flying, and I'll make them all proud once I'm done with this assignment. Three months later one of my colleagues, Raj, called me to check whether I'm coming for the project, because they had already gone, and I didn't even know. I told him that I know nothing about this, and I would talk to our boss. I went to our boss and asked the reason for not informing me. He said he didn't know anything because it was senior's decision to not to send me. I was crying from inside. I didn't utter a word and laughed at myself for being such an honest employee. Moral : I know I don't deserve this. I have taken this incident as a good lesson, because I know soon something great is coming towards me that I deserve !! Pic source : My gallery Peace !! ",

I miss the steel azure that shrouds it. I long to discover stunning castles in the puffs of cottony clouds floating carelessly. I have believed for a long, long time that there's a bewitching fountain in the sky and we call it rain. I'm amazed by the delicacy with which the raindrops hit the parched ground. I am enchanted by the burnt orange in the evening sky. I find solace in the creamy vanilla hue of the twilight, and a streak of agony in the soft purple of the arriving dusk. The bright yellow yarn stitched against the sky in a beautiful circle tells me the stories of the endless space. The sky has so much color in it. Enough to create a parallel world filled with magic and color. If only skies could talk, I would ask its rainbows the place from where they borrow their arresting hues. I hate it when I fail to find colors. I hate it when the skies fail to bewitch me. ",

Till this part of story; it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t have any problem with that. It is his life. But, the moment his show off habit turns into the habit belittling others or pulling others down. The moment he tries to make realize other people that, only he is the one. The Superior. The invincible. The greatest. Few days back my eyes saw similar kind of guy trying to belittle a poor-old man, only because he wanted to satisfy his own ego in-front of his so-called hot girlfriend. And his girlfriend was also enjoying that. I Hate it. When someone tries to bring others\u2019 self respect down, only because he has something which others\u2019 don\u2019t have. They forget the humanity. I hate it. The minute you think you have the right to belittle othersbecause you think you\u2019re better than them is the sameminute you\u2019ve proven you\u2019re worse. - Joanne Crisner ",

Does it still feel the pain?\u201d Ashrey enquired in a concerned tone. \u201cIts all right now. It was just a small accident.\u201d Stuti spoke gently. \u201cYou call it a small accident! That truck would have left you all shattered.\u201d Ashrey spoke with a heavy griefey tone. \u201cWill you relax now. Chalo sing my favourite song now. I want to listen.\u201d Blushed Stuti. \u201cNow? Are you kidding me Stuti!\u201d What if someone comes inside this room?\u201d \u201cThen they will get to know how superb you sing.\u201d Stuti blushes again. \u201cYou will never change know. Okey, here it goes.\u201d \u2018Zehnaseeb, zehnaseeb, tujhe chahu beintehasah.. zehnaseeb'.. \u201cSing my favourite line know, don't skip the song now.\u201d Stuti poked Ashrey. \u201cWill you ever listen to me? Okey, but just once huh.\u201d Spoke Ashrey in a hurry. \u2018Hua amir, dil gareeb, tujhe chahu beintehasha zehnaseeb'\u2026 \u201cWow, now I am feeling a bit better.\u201d Stuti had a mile long smile on her gentle face. \u201cNow come close to me, will you?\u201d Said Stuti with a concerned look on her face. Listening this sentence, Ashrey got goosebumps as there was no assurance who will come inside the ward room. However, seeing Stuti lying in front of him as a helpless girl with a fractured leg was enough to ignite his deep passionate emotions for her. They both held each others hand and kept staring at each other like they are meeting for the last time in this life. Tears rolled down from Stuti's eyes like two pearls shining, coming out of a silent blue sea. Ashrey felt the same intense love for his bedridden beloved but kept his emotions hidden in his heart. Forgetting the whole world around, they lost in each others eyes, never to return back again. \u201cWho is your friend beta?\u201d A voice came from behind which shattered their fantasy world in seconds. It was none other than Stuti's mum. \u201cHe is my friend mumma. Meet Ashrey. He came to see me.\u201d Stuti spoke half shivering. \u201cOh is it. Nice to see you beta.\u201d Stuti's mum spoke in a humble way. However, she had understood the intense chemistry between both of them. \u201cI should leave now. Good day aunty.\u201d Ashrey spoke hiding his emotions and saw Stuti's saddened face which was clearly stating the pain of a temporary separation. Nevertheless, he spoke his heart out in his mind. \u201cGet well soon Stuti. You dont know this but I have lost my sleep just thinking about you the whole night. You and only you I see, none other. Though, I can't be with you always but just remember one thing, whenever you close your eyes, you will see me standing in front of you, smiling. Hence remember, I am here only.\u201d Ashrey ",

Then he seed the wheat in his fields. Every day he used to came to his fields to see his hardwork. After few months, his hardwork pay off and he see that golden colour which he wants to see. Now, why he did all these? just for two meals of a day? Yes,but more than that. It was those wheat, which we see in our plates as chapatti. I just wanted to say that it takes a lot of effort to before the food reach in our plate. And what we do? Just throw in dustbin? I hate it. I hate it when you don't realise someones effort .I hate it when you waste food.I hate it when you take someone's life by wasting your food.Think 100 times before doing this   925,000,000 Million people are hungry, 1,300,000,000 Billion tons of food is wasted.  3 Easy ways to kill a child: Take more than you can eat.Eat till you are full.Throw away the rest. In every 3.6 seconds, a child dies because of hunger. I don't like to waste anything. If any food left over from night, I used to consume them in morning. Even if i have any such kind of thoughts in my mind, my mom sense it and throws a \u201cflying chappal\u201d on me. Bottom line Love food, food are meant to be sharing, not for wasting. You waste life when you waste food. Thank you. -Uddhav yadav \u2764\ufe0f ",

But the thing is when we love the things more, no person comes to you. But when you love the people, everything comes to you. We are in a society where, we can sell our kidney to buy an I phone, but we can\u2019t donate that kidney for the needed. We waste the food in a rich restaurant but we can\u2019t feed a child who is hungry on the roadside, we pay many dollars without bargaining in a shopping mall but we bargain for vegetables in the street. We apply loans for cars and houses but we will think when it comes to education of a girl. Seriously we are living in a society where we pay tax for sanitary pads but not for condoms. The world may invent new technology but it's still lagging in human relations. When we are going to die we only remember the people who are with us and the people who you loved but not what you earned and all the things in your house or anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "I hate it when I look at that particular Family photo of ours and not find myself in it!It is a damn sad situation. My papa,My role model,stands there,smiling.I know he wanted to stand next to ma,but that drama queen,my sister,desperately wanted to stand between them.Huh!!So much for ruining their simple pleasures.Still,his smile has a tinch of affection in it,which I've never seen leaving those lips. He is the best dad in the world,no matter what. I can't forget the day,when I returned home messing up my pre-models.I deserved a flogging,or atleast a huge scolding.But my papa,did neither.He just looked at me,and said that I could do better.I could see the hope in his eyes,and that single spark had me working hard to the pride of the school topper. \u201cLet us give it for Kriti Bharadwaj,the School topper,and the best outgoing student for the year 2017\u201318!\u201d The moment I heard the announcement,I felt a huge relief.I had not let my papa down.I looked at him,and there he was,beaming at me,urging me to go to the stage.His eyes reflected pride for his daughter. When I think of papa,I think of God.He never scolded me,never pressurised me,and never did he say a no.Maybe that was why we,I and my sister,grew up into very fine social beings. And,in the photo,there was my ma. My super cute and super sweet ma.The one who could never see me in pain,and the one who could hear each of my heartbeats.The one who could tell in a second if I am sad,and the one who was there with me in each and every walk of life. She wasn't much educated,but she was the coolest ma anyone could have.She knew what \u201813 Reasons why' was,as much as she knew about all of those crap saas-bahu soaps.She knew what the current fashion trend was,and we never had to worry about the outfits for every occasion.She taught us that god was a single force,and there was nothing that matters in religions and castes.And,God!How could I forget about her culinary skills?She was a GREAT cook!And a great dancer,a singer,and artist. And then comes that little miss perfect of mine.The great Shruti Bharadwaj,my sister.She came into our lives a lot late,I was so glad to know about her arrival when I was studying in class 8th.After her birth,she managed to charm each and everyone of us,and became our first priority.She\u2019s a lot melodramatic.She wants the exact bag that her Didi has,and the exact sandals.She wants the TV remote for 24 hours of the day,and sleeps hugging her Didi like a bear.She wants that diary milk silk her Didi had got as a birthday gift,and wants that adorable doll or keychain,which she finds in a matter of seconds in that shop. Even though I'm not there,that family photo is my all-time favourite.But those heartless people,took it at the time when I was busy preparing for my JEE at Kota. I smile a little. Then,I move forward to adjust the garland on that photo and Light an incense stick in front of it. Why did you guys go leaving this girl behind?Papa,You never did anything without letting me know.Then,why did you decide to go without telling me,huh? Ma,I'm your baby na?Why didn't you tell me before deciding to go? Chhotti?Why did you go without giving Didi a kiss,baby?See,Didi had a large Chocolate in her bag to give to you.You could've atleast waited to devour it,na? I had planned to surprise you with my visit,so did you guys.You were coming to see me. To surprise me.Only that you didn't reach here,but the surprise did!It had such a great momentum,that I fainted at the very moment of receiving it. Was my life worthier than yours?Why did you have to go leaving me behind?What will my life become without your presence?Did you guys think about it before pranking me?I'm a total zero now.Zero emotions,Zero goals. I hate it when I look at that photo!How I wish I was in it!But you left without telling me na? Cheatercocks.. I hate it when all of your dear ones leave you in that one damned second! I hate being alone\u2026 ",

The creature looked like this:-  He was the most experienced driver of Halley\u2019s Comet. So, the Holy Duty of passing by the GOD\u2019s planet was always awarded to him. He took off from his planet with several other companions. As they were about to reach the GOD\u2019s planet, one of the companions asked, \u201cIs it true that GOD lives here?\u201d The Driver replied, \u201cI believe so.\u201d The Companion politely asked, \u201cHas someone saw HIM? What does he look like?\u201d The Driver was asked this question every time he was on this Holy Duty. And he knew the answer - \u201cAs quoted by the religious book of Halley, only a pure soul can enter the GOD\u2019s planet and experience the almighty HEAVEN.\u201d He continued, \u201cTill then, we can just offer him our gratitude.\u201d As the comet entered the GOD\u2019s planet which looked like this -  All the companions on Halley\u2019s Comet had the power to emit light from their heads. And that\u2019s how they expressed their Gratitude.  One event - Two creatures - One had a scientific reason - One had a religious belief And the word \u201cTRUTH\u201d just lost its purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cI hate it when you treat me like this. What do you think I am? A piece of shit?\u201d Azeem didn\u2019t respond. He stood there paralyzed, wondering why Pratima was losing her mind over something that\u2019s not in her control. \u201cI\u2019m talking to you! Can\u2019t you just respond?\u201d, shouted Pratima. She was mad at him and he, obviously, was taking things lightly. Why can\u2019t he understand, she thought. Well, she had to admit that this trait of his was what made her fall in love with him - he was carefree, easy-going and loved to live in the present. He would often mimic Shah Rukh Khan, enacting his dialogue, \u201cJiyo! Khush raho! Muskurao! Kya pata kal ho na ho\u201d. She almost smiled as she remembered this but then quickly tried to shoo the thought away. It was different when they met years ago but he knows that she doesn\u2019t like it anymore. We\u2019ve got to think about the future. Why can\u2019t he just\u2026 \u201cJiyo! Khush Raho!\u201d, started Azeem, interrupting her thoughts. \u201cMuskura..\u201d \u201cPlease\u201d, Pratima clenched her fists, raised it to her shoulders and slammed it on the table in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t start this again\u201d, she mouthed. \u201cAzeem, please! Can you ever be serious in life? You know I love you. Don\u2019t you want to marry me?\u201d She took a deep long breath and continued, \u201cBaby, my parents will never let this happen until we think of something.\u201d For the first time, Azeem looked straight into her eyes and started walking towards her. He said, \u201cRati baby, don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll take care of this. Trust me, hon.\u201d He pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cI promise, tonight will be just fine. Go home and I\u2019ll think of something.\u201d Pratima rested her head on his broad chest and sighed. He let her relax, before he continued, \u201cWe will make this happen. Our parents know that our love for each other is bigger than their hatred for each other\u2019s religion. They love their children, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cI am scared, Azeem. I don\u2019t want to lose you\u201d \u201cYou will not\u201d, he said but he wasn\u2019t sure himself. He had invited them all over for dinner. His parents and her parents, together! A muslim family and a hindu family. Under one roof. He hadn\u2019t taken it lightly. Not even once. He wanted to marry her. And for that, he was ready to do just about anything. And he had done precisely that. \u201cRati, let\u2019s just go home and get ourselves ready for the evening.\u201d He smiled as they parted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to wear that orange silk saree, okay?\u201d She smiled and nodded. With that, Pratima turned and left. As he saw her walk away, Azeem twisted his lips and smirked. Pratima was definitely in for a surprise tonight. Fingers crossed. Pratima had no idea that Azeem had been meeting her parents without her knowledge. They had had endless discussions, after they had finally agreed. So had his parents. He had walked this slippery slope and had triumphantly reached the top. \u201cSometimes, it is okay to lie\u201d, he said it out aloud. \u201cDon\u2019t I love her?\u201d And tonight is going to be the perfect. His plan worked! They were, after all, going to be engaged tonight! Surprise, Rati! ",

            "answer_text": "\"I- I HATE IT WHEN YOU EAT MY UNDERWEAR AND MY TOYS, AND YOU EAT ALL MY FOOD! I HATE YOU!\" The boy stomped for extra effect, making the 4 month old puppy shake and whimper at his humans anger. The boy ran to his room, crying and yelling as he kicked his bed and threw his stuffed animals at the wall. With every throw and kick he thought of the bad things puppy did. Like how she ate his ham sandwich yesterday, making the boy get grumpy at school and have a talk with the principal. Or last week, when the puppy ate 5 of his underwear making mommy and daddy yell for a long time about money. Even the first week the puppy came, she ate his special teddy bear when he let her borrow it. Tired, the boy plopped on his bed. She was a really bad puppy, maybe he did hate her. But then he thought about when she snuggled him during that thunderstorm. Or when puppy bit the boys big sister for trying to beat him up. Or how every time mommy and daddy fought, puppy would lick the boy and make him feel happy again. Tears streamed down the boys face, he was so mean to his puppy, and she was only a baby! What if she now hates him for saying that he hates her? The boy swung open his door to see puppy sitting there, tailing wagging and a big smile on her face. \"I'm so sorry puppy, I don't hate you. I love you so so much!\" He squeezed the puppy tightly in a hug as puppy tried her best to lick his tears away. \"I love you puppy\" And in that moment, the boy knew that his puppy loved him too. ",

Red is too hot, too angry for me. I prefer a calm, chilled blue. \"Sorry,\" you say. \"This club is only for kids who believe in dragons and unicorns.\" I see these majestic, elegant creatures etched into my picture book. I know they are not real. \"Sorry,\" you say. \"This club is only for kids who got a perfect score on the spelling test.\" I spelled three words wrong. I can read. I can write. I can't spell. \"Sorry,\" you say. \"This club is only for kids who are the captain of a sports team.\" I defend the soccer ball from the goal and boot it far away anytime it nears me. I jump higher than anyone to retrieve the rebounds. I listen. I take orders. \"Mom, they wouldn't let me join their clubs at school,\" I said, over my afternoon snack of peanut butter cookies, green apples, and creamy milk. \"It's okay,\" she told me. \"It will be better as you get older.\" \"Will it?\" I asked. \"Will it?\" ",

I just don't get it\u2026I hate it, when some boys play arround and fool girls like they are not humans or they don't feel anything\u2026or when some girls use boys for their selfish reasons only. Grow up guys!I hate it, when i look at a newspaper and my eyes catch articles of torturing girls,rape cases, child abuse and murder more than any usual news topic like sports,politics, health etc.And I hate it, when i see any poor kid begging for money in the age when they need to study and enjoy their beautiful childhood.",

I am tired of you treating me like a doormat. We are done. *Maira leaves the room*  Scrolling down his Instagram feed, he saw her picture. His heart skipped a beat. She looked beautiful in her engagement gown. Gulping the rest of scotch, he wondered whether things would have been different if he had done those dishes that day. ",

They lived at the same place. They studied together in the same school. He was her only best friend. He could recognise her mood in just one glance. He never failed to get her favourite candy every day they met. She never opened up to others. There were no secrets between them. They studied in different colleges, yet they helped each other in studies. Who else can understand better how it feels to be an orphan than an orphan? That moment she realised, after all, people aren't same even if they have similar face cuts and share same birth date. Only she knew how badly she needed a friend after her best friend Advait's demise. After that day, she never saw Advait in Anand. ",

I hate it when kind people are ill treated even after seeking their help. I hate it when rich people waste money on flamboyant parties and events. I hate it when people believe in fake spiritual leaders. I hate it when we speak about democracy, but also take money to vote. I hate it when we don't tolerate corruption but we often bribe when we have situations to face. I hate it when good people are silent where their voice is needed. I hate it when the weather isn't good. I hate it when the food isn't tatsty. I hate it when my mother puts me on a job. I hate it when parents compare children with others. I hate it when I have to wait. I hate it when if I have low battery in my mobile. I hate it when the data speed is low. I hate it when people hurt me. I hate it when some people don't understand me. I hate, I hate , I hate \u2026 The list is endless. It is easy to hate something or someone, but it takes much more to love someone or accept something. There will be a number of reasons to hate. Inspite of all that, we still have a small portion that is very vulnerable to love and kindness. It is only with the heart one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye. ",

Neither of his parents showed up. \u2018I hate it when you prioritize work over me\u2019. He shouted at them that day. His parents ignored him. Age: 13 \u2018Your son is misbehaving again\u2019. His teacher called up the parents. \u2018Is that so? Why?\u2019 Asked the father. \u2018I hate it when you\u2019re not there for me when I need you.\u2019 They went home silently, with mixed emotions. Age: 16. \u2018I hate it when my parents ignore me all the time.\u2019 His suicide note read. This time his parents didn\u2019t. But he was no longer alive to see them wailing beside his coffin. ",

I\u2019ll try again and I know secretly she loves this morning exercise between her and me.There I see her moving and lifting the edge of her blanket to just peep and see where I am, and I jump at this opportunity and grab the blanket and pull it so tight and win this tug of war.Finally she is up and movesr hands in her hair to tie them up now she looks at me intently and hold me tight and then the best part ..she holds me tight and says, \u201cGood Morning BO\u201d lets fix up breakfast for you and I jump to the thought of it and say, \u201cWuff Wuff\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026..A morning in a dogs life :) ",

Two messages were from her best friends but the other 12 were from him. Oh him. When she opened the messages, her eyes got wider and her smile brighter than ever. 'How can someone be so sweet and write all these things right after waking up?\u2019 she wondered. A bus could hit her that day but the smile wouldn't leave her lips. 5 years later\u2026 She wakes up and doesn't even check her phone anymore. She knows it's only going to hurt her more. They both are together and still not together. They both have changed and evolved but there's a difference between them: She's still madly in love and he's not. . . . A change is not worth it if it's only going to kill everything around. ",

When I go to my uncle\u2019s pool my uncle used to bring in my cousin Andi to pee first. She was like 2. I was 7.  Because, I changed her diapers and she was naked 2/3 of the time anyway. Fast forward 4 years. Andi Is 6 now.  6 is not 2 or 3 or 4. 6 is aware of stuff and curious. Not sexual. But curious. She just waltzes in whenever, but I always seemed to be either showering or changing. Everyone thought Andi was just their little baby but when she\u2019d come in and I was alone she CLEARLY came right over to look at my penis (only has baby sister). Unashamed, 2 feet away, staring. I am almost 12. Just barely changing. Last week I was just pre-showering and in walks Andi, pulls her bottoms down to pee, then walks over to me, looks for a bit, then informs me my penis is still small. Her dad\u2019s is a lot bigger. Is it ever going to grow? And she walks out. Thanks Andi. That\u2019s the last time you\u2019ll be seeing it btw. You can ask any questions to me personally. ",

She was diagnosed cancer on the last stage she hardly had few hours. She was in hospital for more than a week now . She knew he can not live alone he is so careless so she wanted him to be with someone before she closes her eyes . Whereas he just wanted her together and forever but now this was not possible . She had to leave , he had to live . She again started \u201c say na , you use to watch every girl here and there . Now you don\u2019t have any to be with you . Idiot I don\u2019t have much time .\u201d He pressed her lips with his hand and hugged her crying like a baby \u201c You promised to be there no matter what .\u201d She rubbed his back and said ,\u201c I m sorry I m breaking the promise . Come on now ..\u201d she closed her eyes , her hand went down . Yes she left . That was the last day he saw or smiled at a girl . After that he never raised his head for any girl . He never smiled at any girl in fact not at anyone . She just not broke the promises rather took his heart away too . Now he hated it when any girl passed by smiled at him . Thanks for giving your precious time to read my words . ",

(This discussion is limited to attitude and behaviour of people).  Place, Time, Date, Person, doesn\u2019t really matter to them in order to execute this Jumping Syndrome. We indeed find them Everywhere! Everywhere! The door next petty shop, you will go to buy milk. Cashier is busy taking money from another customer. Here comes this Jumping Syndromist literally jumping on you, to pay for that Parle- G biscuit he bought.You stood there for an hour waiting for \u201cDarshana\u201d in that new temple. He is exactly next to you wanna go faster than you and earn some trophy.No, No, they don\u2019t fail to jump in local transportation while you getting-down and getting-in.You have gone to buy veggies, there they are! List just goes On and On.In a nation of a billion people, there is no escaping queues. We find ourselves in one every day - whether to board the flight or if we are less fortunate to fetch water from a municipal tap. In fact, I have seen folks appeared to be well-educated doing this. There are variety of \u201cline cutters\u201d some comes with good reasons and others without. Come on its time to reduce it at least. ",

It\u2019s just so depressing, what\u2019s happening out in the world, I know we can\u2019t stop all of that at once but we can at least stop victim blaming.If anyone out in this world is to blame for the rapes is the person who rapes, the rapists and not the victim. We should stop victim blaming. Why?Because it kills the person suffering from the pain. Because it punctures the hopes of ever getting justice for themselves. Because it is never their fault!  2. \u201c Is desh ka kuch nhi ho sakta \u201d (\u201cNothing good can happen in this country\u201d) the man said , spitting on the road. \u201d ye neta log apna pet bharna kam kare , tab kuch ho na \u201c (these curropt politicians should stop filling their stomach with money), another man said , while taking bribe. \u201d Desh ka bhavishya khatre mei dikhae de rha\u201d (The future of this country is in danger), said the third one while smoking in a public area. I hate it when such incredible people say such ironic things As Gandhiji said, Be the change you want to see in this world. :)  3.

Its not that no one asked me\u2018 how are you \u2018 ,Its just that no one really wanted to know \u2026 Its not like no one said\u201d I miss you \u201d ,Its just that no one had time to do \u2026 Its not that no one praised my looks\u201d you are beautiful\u201d they said ,Its just they laughed when I turned my back\u2026 Its not that no one took stand for me\u201d hey , I trust you \u201d ,Its just that no one actually did\u2026 Its not that no one pleaded me\u201c don\u2019t leave , I need you \u201d ,Its just that no one wanted me to stay\u2026 Its not that no one confessed\u201d I love you \u201dIts just that it was not \u2018love\u2019 & I was not the \u2018you\u2019 Its not that no one really said\u201d Don\u2019t worry , I\u2019m here with you \u201d ,But its just that when in need no one held my back.. I hate it when people don\u2019t mean what they say, when their actions defers from what they say!  P.S : All of these, were posted here on my blog : Stories from my diary \u2764  Love!-Unnati :) ",

            "answer_text": "I am a Teacher. I teach Physics to JEE and NEET aspirants. Whenever someone comes to me for counseling or asking about my education, there is a moment of pity which always comes up. I hate it when they ask me about my degree college and make grief-stricken faces at my answer. 3 years ago, I had this conversation with a student. Them - Sir, you are a great teacher. You have taught a lot to our child. He always praises you and tells us that you are his role model. Me - (humbly accepting the fact) There is nothing like that. It is your ward's hard work and dedication. We just show the path. Them - That's so nice of you. BTW sir, from which IIT did you say you have a degree from? We will send him to the same one. Me - (realizing what is going to happen next) I am not an IITian. I am from GEC, Ajmer. I hope he gets into the best of the IITs according to exam performance.  ( I could notice their face growing pale) Them - (astonished like hell) Oh! We thought you are an IITian. How can you so teach so well when you are not one of them? (the student knew this fact about me but parents were dumbstruck) Me - (I could somehow notice the respect fading) Well, I hope he gets through the best college of the world so that he or she doesn't get to face this moment. (a moment of introspection and pride or a moment of grief, I decide) Last year the same student\u2019s father visited me for the admission of his second child. I greeted him as I usually do and asked about his elder son\u2019s college performance and well being. He told me that he couldn't get into any IIT, NIT or even a government college. He is in a private college near their home. He also told me that he wants to get into teaching field after he finishes his course and that I am the one who he looks after for any help. See, I really hate all this. I really do. But I offered a helping hand and told him to wait for 2 more years. He might get into an IIT via GATE. He can join coaching later on when he becomes an IITian. His father literally broke and was sorry about his behavior in the past. I wasn't feeling proud of this. I was sad. I hate it when someone breaks down bad like this in front of me. His younger son will appear for JEE this year. I hope he gets through so that he doesn't face the same situation. Maybe his father must have felt the same. Maybe. Maybe. P.S. I still face this. But I am a pro now. I face it with utmost humility and I have better answers. ",

I hate it when you had a heart to heart conversation with me and I vent in front of you about my childhood memories, my love for stars and moon, my vulnerabilities only to allow you to mock at me. Maybe, the conversations you had with others were too interesting to forget and now you're comparing ours with those. I hate it when you want to see my magazine-like beauty when I feel amazing draped in my unconventional beauty. Maybe, the lights out there are too bright for your eyes to look at the real me. I hate it when you call me up instantly on any misfortune happening, or when sadness wraps you, and then you forget my presence in your most delighted days. Maybe, the smiles and best wishes of those around you are too warm to neglect and look for me, for once. I hate it when. . . Who cares? ",

Do you even know what I just said?\u201d She exploded, stomping her foot in petulance. \u201cDoes it really matter?\u201d Hart said nonchalantly, puffing the smoke from his lips and putting the cigarette out with his thumb. \u201cI'm leaving. I can't do this anymore.\u201d Annemarie picked up a bag with food and clothing. Hart just watched. \u201cYou'll be back!\u201d Hart called, and the small apartment vibrated as Annemarie slammed the door.  She was back in a few hours, dropping the bad by the door. She crawling back into the bed and wrapped her arms around Hart's waist, all with silent tears making their way down her face. She would always come back, at least until she didn't have the strength left to leave. ",

Not a word did he speak and curled under the other blanket lying next to her, but, without facing her. \u201cI told him innumerable times, I hate to sleep over fights or arguments, yet he turns deaf ear towards my emotions\u201d, she thought to herself, pulling the blanket over her face and rubbing her red cheeks off her dripping tears. Not a movement from him, he seemed to be unwavered with all happening around. Unable to sleep and withheld the erupting emotions inside her, she turned to left only to find the space beside her empty. \u201cMust have gone to other room to sleep, why so furious?\u201d she wept, her heart filled with agony. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love me anymore\u201d, she cried to herself shutting her eyes close and tight. After ten minutes, she felt fingers running through her hair and a warm hand holding her hand. She is half way into opening her eyes when he placed a gentle kiss on her forehead. This time, her cheeks turned red but not because of tears. \u201cYou always make me cry\u201d, she said, innocence engulfing all over her face. \u201cYou need energy to cry and fight with me, so have some food at first\u201d, he quipped taking the morsel of food into his hands to feed her. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating\u201d, she brushed aside his hand turning her head side wards in sulky manner. \u201cIf only you eat, will I eat too,\u201d he responded moving nearer to her. \u201cYou had a party with your friends in the evening, right? Didn\u2019t you eat and come home?\u201d she questioned in amusement. \u201cNo, I wanted to have dinner with you, so I came home early.\u201d he replied, running his hands gently through her hair. She melted at his response and couldn\u2019t hold her tears. But then she continued\u2026.. No more talking he uttered, grabbing her neck and kissed her hard on lips choking her words. As he with drew back, she blushed in happiness , together, they enjoyed food, amidst silly jokes and giggles. \u201cI promise to never allow you to sleep with disturbance,\u201d he smiled taking her into his arms and kissed on her cheeks. Hugging each other tight, they snuggled under a blanket and slept in peace the whole night, cuddling one another. ",

As the supermarket is on other side of main road and we had to wait patiently after seeing Red signal. Soon we were joined by other padestrians waiting for the green signal ,so that we can carefully walk through the zebra crossings . But in no time we noticed that two persons went crossing the road without caring traffic signal and trying to manage busy traffic putting them and speeding vehicles in danger. After waiting for couple of minutes as green signal was given ,all of us could safely cross the road. Raj turned to me and said \u201cI hate it when people break the traffic rules, as a result putting them and others in great trouble\u201d I replied \u201c Yeah , I agree with you,be happy that at least we were following traffic rules\u201d. Thank you. S P Reddy ",

You are already hurt and in pain, as adamant as you can be. You have decided to stay and not go back home. Now atleast listen to me and have food. She: I don't want to go, we are meeting after such a long time. It was just an accident, it doesn't pain that much. Please I want to be with you. He: (teary eyed and trying to be strong) Don't say a word about pain. Look at you, your leg is bleeding, hands are bruised and swollen and you even knocked your head. You should stop driving you know for a while. I can't see you getting hurt almost every month. She: ( Adamant as she can ever be just to spend time with him and challenging her driving skills) You know this was not my fault. I know how you feel about these series of accidents. I will try to be more careful from now onwards. Besides we have also been to the hospital now. The doctor has treated my wounds and also examined me for any serious injuries. I am fine. I will take rest don't worry. Please stay with me for now. It has been two months already since we met. (Puppy eyes and a cute face always works) He: ( hiding the pain and giving up) I know this was not your fault, it was an accident. You have to be careful though. Stop making these puppy faces. I love you. All this just to be with me. This is the last time I am listening to you. We are having food and then heading straight to your home. I will drive you home and drop your scooty in sometime. No more arguments.( Firmly holding hands) She: ( Grinning from ear to ear. Forgot about the pain while in his company, thinking how lucky she is to have him by her side. She hates to see him upset because of her but his presence is magical.) He: Hey! You zoned out? Stop smiling like an idiot and tell me what will you eat? She: Oh! Whatever you order. I am fine. I love you. He: I know :) ( The food arrives after a while till then both of them sitting silently not wanting to let go of each other and the little time they get to spend.) She: I can't eat. My hands are paining. He: I know. I'll help you. ( He fed her with his hands thinking how she behaves like a child, even though she is in pain but won't say a word just to have this little time with him. ) She: I'm done. Thank you. ( They keep staring each other saying not a word but feeling the happiest.) He: ( Breaking the silence) Let's go. I know you can spend all day with me. You need rest now. I promise to see you soon. She: Very soon. ( and she leans her head on his shoulders holding him tightly from behind on his bike and he safely drops her home). ",

Neha stood on her balcony, adjusting herself on the railing she watched the birds flying back to their nest. Her brown eyes were now shimmering. Not because of the sun rays, but because the waters in her eyes reflected the light. Her conscience was fighting a raging war between optimism and pessimism. \u2018Maybe he\u2019s really busy\u2026. Or maybe he\u2019s intentionally avoiding me\u2026\u2026\u2019 Now, tears refrained from remaining in her eyes and rolled down her cheeks. She had no other option but to force herself to stop crying and get back to work. She completed household chores with a smile on her face but the pale face told an opposite story. Before going to bed she tried again to contact him. But again\u2026 \u2018Hey there, this is Aryan, please leave a message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you\u2019 Later that night her sleep was interrupted by two pings on her phone. First message: AM-XYZ bank \u2018dear customer, 500 Canadian dollars are deposited in your account\u2019 Second message: Hii Mumma, sending some portion of my first salary as a birthday gift to you. Yes, how can I forget the birthday of my creator, love of my life. I am sorry I couldn\u2019t contact you lately. There\u2019s a shitload of work piled upon me. I hope you understand and please enjoy the lavish dinner at your favorite restaurant and the bills are on me :) Tons of love, Aryan.  To all those parents whose children are abroad. love Kintu. ",

Directions in aisles should have sides. And if you need something across the aisle, park your cart to the side, and walk across to get what you need. Don\u2019t just nosedive your cart into the counter traffic, like a savage. If you need to pass a slow bastard, you should look for incoming traffic before passing. Instead of inserting yourself in the middle like you can defy all properties of matter and just walk through people, wait for a logical opening. For crying out loud. Abruptly stopping is also completely ridiculous. Best see if there is anyone behind you before doing that, no? If you see a friend, park your carts and go to the side. Have your chit-chat there. You wouldn\u2019t stop traffic for a chat on the road, so don\u2019t do it in a store. And, my favorite: if they are giving out little freebies at Costco, and you abruptly stop, leave your cart sideways, to all hell with people\u2014 I want my free cracker\u2014you are a son of a bitch and you deserve to die. Okay maybe not that bad, but that is a pretty up there in slow-witted-dummy-sees-shiny-thing terms. That\u2019s like ditching your car in the middle of the intersection and running out because you just saw that McDonalds is having a free coffee day, and your brain got so excited it forgot basic logic. Park your damned cart and go get your little crackers like a decent human, you bastard. *shakes fist at skies* ",

But mostly I hate how each and every time you failed to do what I said, forcing me to hurt once more by having to repeat it. I hate how you\u2019re making your way in and out of my life like it\u2019s your home. But mostly I hate that I wanted it to be your home. I hate how you made everything remind me of you like you\u2019re the only person in this world. But mostly I hate that you were the only one in my world. I hate when you say there\u2019s no one like me because there are plenty like me who you have not yet hurt. But mostly I hate that I needed to be like no one else for you. I hate when you say I am the one you love the most. There\u2019s no reason for that one. I just hate to hear you using that word like you know what it means. I hate that you so stubbornly want to share everything with me like what I think matters. But mostly I hate that I can\u2019t stop caring. I hate that I hate everything about you. But mostly I hate that I can\u2019t hate you. P.S I love you ",

Like an alternate reality of us- where she belongs to me and only me. I hate it when i am teaching a bunch of some 16 year olds and suddenly i get reminded of the time when I was sixteen. And she too. How I was too shy to even talk to her. How I found her the cutest of all beings on earth. Her hairs. Her dimples. Even her notebook. It was something divine. I hate it when even after losing her, I keep writing about her. I hate it when even after knowing that it is hurting, I smile like an idiot. She, my friends, was a magic. ",

When I was small he said he will give me loads of chocolates if I play his favourite game with him. I was innocent, it was disgusting but I played. I think in my moments of solitude, is this what a family is meant to be. Are blood relations these close. Aren't there any limit or borders.  I hate it when he waits for me as I pass through the road. He asks me to befriend him. He give me roses, he has given me innumerable names like pataka, item and maal. I hear these names often through random peoples too. He goes with me, side by side to my tutions, my music classes and back to home. It feels filthy, I don't like it, but this man doesn't stop. Even if he stops, some other one will start it again.  ",

While strolling past a tea-stand a voice said - \u201cBabuji (sir), tea?\u201d \u201cNo, my son is waiting for me.\u201d Mr. Mehta said as his pace quickened. He came outside the station. His son was nowhere to be seen. Silently he sat on the bench and took out his tiffin from his disheveled bag. He looked at the wristwatch again - 8:25 AM exact. He looked up at the sky and smiled. \u201cRamesh loved rains so much. He never knew rains would play with our lives.\u201d Mr. Mehta sighed. He solemnly ate the meal in complete silence.

I hate it when things go south even after putting so much effort into something. I hate it when I see someone crying and unable to help. I hate it when people treat with partiality even after putting them in priority. I hate it when I try to remain positive but filled with negative environment / circumstances. Everything that I hate has taught me a lot more in life in order to grow as a person! :) ",

            "answer_text": "\u201c I hated it when I saw those tears in her eyes.\u201d She was sitting at a corner of the bench. She was my friend and hostel mate. Today , in the morning I had seen her going hurriedly to meet her boyfriend. She was ecstatic and beaming with joy. I had known her since the day I put my foot on the hostel dormitory. Our first day as new juniors was quite happening. Terror of seniors made us close irrespective of our differences. She had told me about her new phone friend. She was good in studies too and even scolded me for my lack of interest in the course books. She gradually became engrossed in her new found love with whom she started her dream life in virtuality. I used to try to talk to her but she had no time for us. She was totally all by herself and her phone. That day she told me she is going to meet her online virtual love and they had planned their entire day. I was happy for her yet I was scared if her expectations were high. I didn't discourage her seeing her child like excitement. I wished her luck and told her to give me full on report of how it went. I had the plan of visiting the Gurudwara in the evening. I loved the lake side on the other side of Gurudwara. One can see people walking , sitting in groups and children just roaming here and there. I loved the serenity it provided . I loved there sitting alone and thinking. I as usual went there scanning a perfect spot to contemplate my boring life, I saw my friend sitting alone crying silently. I went to her, I sat beside her. She suddenly realized this presence and composed her. I asked her \u201c Deepu what are you doing here?\u201d She replied with a sad smile \u201c nothing yaar,I am missing him\u201d. I knew then and there , she was lying. Later I got to know from her roommate , she was dumped by his so called boyfriend for not being allowing him to get physical with her. I hate it when the immature boys tend to misuse the name of love to fulfill their lust. I hate it when they don't even think of the consequences it will have on the other person's life. I hate it when this totally makes the definition of love skewed. I hate it when due to this type of incidents , the person who was full of love feels nothing. ",

It's just pathetic.I hope no one gets a boss like him.People don't value people who work below them. Saying these words Rahul finally settled on his chair. He called the peon for a cup of tea.The old man couldn't hear at once. This angered Rahul and he shouted at the top of his voice and the old man was there at once. Rahul: where were you dying? Old man: Sorry Sir Rahul: I asked you for a cup of tea Old man: I didn't hear sir.I will bring it for you Rahul: This old man is good for nothing.Now go fast and don't irritate me more by making such gloomy face. And the old man left and returned with a cup of tea. As Rahul was sipping tea the statement said by him \"People don't value people who work below them\" stood vindicated And he was still wondering why??? ",

Once some of my cousins were sitting and talking about one of our distant cousin who lost eyesight in his left eye due to an injury sustained in an accident. Despite his disability, he aced one of the most difficult entrance examination (CAT-Common Admission Test) which is required for the admissions to elite business colleges in India (IIM\u2019s). We were praising him as how he never got demoralized and toiled to achieve his goal. To which our haughty cousin said \u201c Abay, itna zaheen toh nahin hai woh, usey handicapped quota se admission mila hoga, tumhein kya pata!\u201d. Translation: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t smart for most of his life, he might have got the admission via handicapped quota\u201d. Instead of feeling completely shocked at his comment like my other cousins, I felt pity for my haughty cousin since at the age of 32, he hadn't developed the wisdom to make a good judgement. Glossary Handicapped quota: Reservation of a percentage of total seats for differently-abled and disabled candidates in educational institutes in India. ",

I hate it when I talk to you and you gaze into the distance, lost in thought. I hate it when I lovingly caress your hand at night but you hurriedly slip your arm away. I hate it when I wrap my arms around you in front of the mirror, basking in the moment\u2019s happiness, and you pretend to be blissfully unaware. But most of all, I hate it when you ignore my screams in the middle of the night, begging you to free me from my coffin. ",

Those terrible days I hate it when the bloody days of horror come up in my mind; When the Nazis locked us up in concentration camps of all sorts-Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen, And killed millions of us amidst extreme pain and torture. The holocaust of those cursed days,those terrible moments made us bleed; Where I ended up losing my family and my neighbours, The long continuous struggle to live and tell our painful story, Resisting the whip of an untamed unpredictable future\u2026 I say that I hate those scary days of my life.

Her mom had worked hard to give her the best of education, the best of manners and the best of love. She literally worshipped her mom. She studied hard to give every little happiness to her mom. She stood first in every examination. Won every scholarship she could to relieve the monetary burden on her family. Today morning,Natasha recieved the news that she had cleared her UPSC civil exams with flying colours. She was hopeful of becoming an IAS now. She looked sternly at her mother, \u201cWhy did you have to call him, Maa?\u201d Her mother took a deep breath and responded, \u201cYears back your father had mocked us and asked what could have I done.\u201d \u201cI had called him to let him know that I raised my daughter to be an IAS.\u201d ",

Throughout the world, bollywood is reduced to song and dance and bollywood zumba classes. Though its silly to say now, since this word has been listed in oxford dictionary long back but it still lacks intensity. According to Merriam-Webster's etymology, the word -- which means \"Bombay (Mumbai), traditional centre of the Indian film industry + Hollywood\" -- first found a mention in 1976. Many veteran actors are not to happy with this pop term. Naseeruddin Shah, who hates being referred to as a \"Bollywood actor\", said at the function: \"The term Bollywood was used to mock us by the western press. And it's just an indication of our own idiocy that we still use it.\" The late actor Om Puri in an interview with DNA had said, \u201cBollywood - whenever western people refer to it -- they mean Hindi films. They say 'Oh those song and dance films.' So it is a derogatory term. These terms are created by the media.\" We ourselves somewhere physchologically get surprised that bollywood can make good movies too. I feel its this term that takes away credit and seriousness of Indian films. Also, actors like Mr Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai, Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra have expressed their disapproval to this coinage. ",

They not only block the entry and exit, but also cause a great hindrance to allow the other passengers waiting on platform to ride next train in peak office hours. There may be some space near seats, but you won't see anyone leaving the area between two gates. They enjoy troubling others. For such people, When it is over crowded, and you see lack of sufficient space availability, why do you pull your smartphone out and consume more space than you should use? There is no emergency or you won't stop breathing if you don't use your smartphone for 10 15 minutes, but no, they can't understand basic human values. ",

And whenever I say nothing special just the usual cores, they give me a look as if I don't belong to this planet or perhaps I don't belong to this Mumbai city. Not sure if this is every mumbaikar's mindset that you can't just stay at home or relax at home with your novel or cook something delicious (atleast attempt to make it delicious ) on weekends. But every friday I get to hear this question what's the plan for the weekend? Sir/Ma'am, First thing is that I am not compelled to always have some plan for weekend. Second it is who I am, how I live, you have no right to judge me. And if you judge then please keep that judgement to yourself and no need to show it on my face. Because I am happy the way I am. ",

I was travelling in sleeper class When I asked them to vacate then they started arguing. Later on I discovered that they had not taken General tickets also After the huge argument when they left the place I found that they occupied some one else's seat After half an hour Travelling Ticket examiner came and they were fined. Being a responsible citizen, It is our prime duty to book the tickets while travelling in a Train To Make Indian Railways better Institution ",

A:She is a maid at my boss home ,very nice girl. B:Maid!!You are getting married to a maid.(laughs) A:Yes,I am also a mere driver and I like her .I think that\u2019s important. B: Ok,so when is your marriage? whats your budget for marriage? A:Possibly next month will have court marriage and a small party Total budget including her ornaments and all is about Rs 80,000. B:Laughs again shamelessly (Itna toh meri shaadi mein cards ka budget tha).This was my budget for only cards in my marriage. So this is when i hate when someone brags about his/her wealth and make others feel small for satisfaction of their ego. This is the lowest form of cheapness witnessed by me.
