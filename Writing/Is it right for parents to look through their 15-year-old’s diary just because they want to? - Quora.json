            "answer_text": "I am a 15 year old girl, and I write diaries. I write it on an app in my phone. So recently, my mum wanted to read my diary. \u201dNo,\u201d I said. \u201dWhy not? I\u2019m your mother.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s private. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to read my diary. It isn\u2019t anything personal to you, but I just feel this way.\u201d She kept on insisting. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you tell me everything? What are you hiding from me? What do you do behind my back?\u201d Oh, nothing much. Just surf the web for porn, read erotic novels, have sex with my 22 year old boyfriend. My diary\u2019s full of my wild adventures to Neverland. \u201cI don\u2019t do anything behind your back. It\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s just private.\u201d It\u2019s me. It\u2019s my life. I know you gave birth to me, but I would like to be the owner of my soul. And the thing where I express it. She wouldn\u2019t give it up. Eventually, she told me that if I didn\u2019t let her read my diary, then she wouldn\u2019t read anything written by me. I said \u201cAlright,\u201d without thinking anything of it. For the past few months, I wrote novels and short stories that got me a lot of praise from my internet readers and friends and relatives. I entered a contest and got a medal for the best essay. Everyone told me I would be a great writer someday. And my mum didn\u2019t read any of it. Now, this was really hurtful for me. If you\u2019re a writer, imagine one of your most loved person and biggest cheerleader just refusing to acknowledge a story you\u2019ve written with hardship, just turning her face away from the manuscript. It hurts a lot. Especially, when people would ask her about my writings, she would say it out loud, \u201coh, she doesn\u2019t let me read all her works, so I don\u2019t read anything at all.\u201d ouch. Eventually, I confronted her about it. I shouldn\u2019t have, maybe, because then she told me she would take away my phone and not let me continue my diary at all. I told her I would let her read one entry, if that would make her happy. She said, OK, but she would get to choose which one. I said, no. She persisted on her previous threat. Then I told her, \u201cI would rather delete my works than let you read it.\u201d She told me, \u201cBe my guest.\u201d The next day I deleted my Diary account. Then I cried for hours. Let me tell you this: it\u2019s not like I had any inappropriate things in my diary. I hadn\u2019t done any things I wrote above in italic. There were things I wouldn\u2019t want my mother to read, but they were little things like me knowing the passcode to her phone or going over to my friend\u2019s house to surf on the web when I\u2019m not supposed to (I have got serious curfews regarding the web in my house. I can\u2019t use net in my own phone without permission). But overall, I was just shy about all the feelings and dream I recorded there. And I knew my mother. I knew when she would read what I wrote about feeling depressed and wishing things were different sometimes, she would just scoff out loud, telling me I had a better life than a lot of people. I didn\u2019t want to hear those words. I didn\u2019t want her judgement. And she also has the habit of talking around. Not with random people, but with relatives. I didn\u2019t want their judgement either. I didn\u2019t want them to think I was whiney girl. Because I wasn\u2019t. During the particular day, I was just feeling whiney. And I deleted the account fearing she would find a way to read it somehow. Because she did it once, when I wrote in a notebook, which forced me to move over to one of those secret diary apps with passcode. I really didn\u2019t want it to be deja vu. Maybe you\u2019re not like my mother. Maybe you won\u2019t scoff or talk around. Maybe you won\u2019t stop reading your child\u2019s novels and short stories. But if he doesn\u2019t want you to read the journal, please don\u2019t read it. Will you want someone to be in your head, reading all your thoughts? Maybe you\u2019re not thinking anything harmful or inappropriate, but still, would you want it? Don\u2019t you feel uncomfortable when the coppers in airports or secure places check your body for anything suspicious despite the fact you\u2019re not carrying any explosives? Diary\u2019s like someone\u2019s thoughts on paper. So if he doesn\u2019t want you to read it, don\u2019t read it. Certainly, don\u2019t go snooping around, because that will ruin his trust on you. I don\u2019t trust my mother anymore. I hide a lot of things from her, things I don\u2019t really need to hide from her. But I still hide them. You don\u2019t want your fifteen year old to become like that, trust me. Edit: Many people are accusing my mother of being a terrible person. I just want to say even though what she did was bad, my mum isn't awful. I wouldn\u2019t trade her for anyone else. She's always been supportive and my biggest cheerleader. She's taught me to think and grow the willpower to do what I want. I love my mum and I know she loves me as well. However, no one is a perfect parent. My mum has always wanted me to be open with her - so I suppose she was hurt when I refused to show her my diary. She also grew up in a household where she had no privacy. Therefore, she never understood the need of it and I think she can't believe anyone else could feel different. Like I said, no-one's perfect, so she took the situation way too far and this is what happened. I don't hold it against her anymore, I've forgiven her; but some damage was done. We've always had trust issues and I don't feel the thrill of showing my writings to her anymore. I wrote this answer with a view to make sure no mother had to face this situation with her child again. Another thing: when I said I had sex with my 22 year old boyfriend, I WAS BEING SARCASTIC. I've received a few comments telling me this was rape and I should check myself out blah blah blah. While I appreciate your concern, I'm also a little annoyed that you didn't read my answer properly. I had mentioned in my answer that I hadn\u2019t done any of the stuff written in italics. If you don't believe me\u2026 seriously, think about it. You already know what sort of control freak my mother is. Do you really I could do a thing like that behind her back? Also, thanks to everyone for all the upvotes and comments. Edit 2: Some of you wanted to read my short stories. I posted them at the comment, but thought it better to post them here later on. There is one I wrote as a Quora answer: Nazaha Izdihar's answer to Can you share with us a short story written by you? You can read another one. This is in Doc file. Nazaha's elegant egypt work - Nazaha Amatullah I wrote this at 13, so it\u2019s not really my best work. But this was my first hit short story in English! ",

            "answer_text": "No, It\u2019s never right and it\u2019s never okay. i read it as someone asking \u201chey, can parents invades their child\u2019s privacy just because?\u201d no. absolutely not. Read this as you want because I\u2019m 15 too but if your parents cannot trust you even though you haven\u2019t done anything to set off any kind of alarm it\u2019s\u2026 disturbing. i have a diary and i am very fortunate to have parents that see it as that. A diary. A very private space of my thoughts, feelings and emotions. you might role your eyes at this but honestly, teenagers hides a storm in their calm outsides. They might have partner that they don\u2019t want you to know about (and if that partner is an adult, honestly, it\u2019s a concern), they might be apart of the LGBTQ+ community but didn\u2019t want to tell you just yet, they might be struggling in school, they might be bullied. there are so many \u201cmight\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d but honestly, it\u2019s not worth losing trust with your kid. even if you are just trying to \u201chelp\u201d, if this is your definition of \u201chelping\u201d, get ready to be cut off from their life by the time they become an adult or by the time they got married. By then you have nothing to blame but yourself ad your past actions. your kids always remembers and will always remember your biggest mistakes, reading something very personal and PRIVATE can be one of them. My advice / thought is: if you are the parentDON\u2019T. honestly. it\u2019s not worth it, losing the trust of your kid is not worth it. if you are concern about their mental health, the way they are treated at school or if they are being different recently, you can talk to them but never raise your voice. put them in a space where it is okay to express their feelings, thoughts and emotionsDON\u2019T. if you want to snoop in \u201cjust because you want to\u201d, think as if it you are on their shoes. if you can\u2019t do that, think of it like.. if your kid go through your phone and look up every single one of your text, your emails, etc. how would you feel?If you think of it just as \u201cthey are my kids, i should be allowed to do that.\u201d GET YOUR NARCISSISTIC, HELICOPTER PARENT ASS AWAY FROM EVERYONE. you disgust me. who do you think you are? their god? they have rights too you idiot. they have their own thoughts and feelings and shit to deal with. stop seeing them just as an extension from yourself and stop being narcissistic. parents like you ruin your kid CONFIDENCE, MENTAL HEALTH and STUMP THEIR GROWTH AS AN OVERALL CAPABLE HUMAN BEING.built a trusting relationship with your kid. show them that you are WORTHY of their trust. (that include not snooping around at their things)if you are the teenI'm very sorry, my best advice to talk to your parents and tell them why it\u2019s not okay, sometimes our parents needs a wakeup call and you need to tell them that you have rights too, you are a human too and you are valid.talk to them about your concerns and feelings, if they are the type to overreact, tell them that. tell them about your concerns and built a trust with them.if they are the helicopter style parent.. honestly.. cut them off as soon as you can, they are stunting your growth as a capable adult. if you want, you can read about articles surrounding helicopter parenting and TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT. again, parents are complicated, especially parents like this. if they are still being a narcissistic ass bitch\u2026 cut them off as soon as you can.best wishes to you, i hope your family is doing well <3 ",
