            "answer_text": "Thats a good question, and it all depends! Some may day after 3 and others after 17. Elderly people with arrythmia will definitely expire much faster than a young adult with a high mass. If you are an average build person, i would highly recommend to not consume more than 40mg at a single time up to three times a day, although you will probably be okay with up to three, but I would definitely not risk it! So to answer your question, 120mg is unsafe as a stat dosage and I would say anything north of that is toxic. 10 tablets are most likely lethal and will simply stop your heart. ",
