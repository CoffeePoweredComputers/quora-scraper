            "answer_text": "What does your question mean? The first part is straightforward enough \u201cHow can I write a formal email\u201d,but what does \u201cfor a document\u201d mean? The phrase makes no sense and needs clarifying. The simple answer to \u201cHow can I write a formal email\u201d is simple. An email is an electronic letter, so it should follow the rules of any physical letter: apart from the address header of a physical letter the rules are the same. The main rule is to write in full sentences, not in note form or text-speak- if you use either of these in your email your reader will think you can't be bothered to write properly. The Subject line of the email must be in complete words, no abbreviations, with the exception of the \u201cRe:\u201d at the beginning ( which means regarding or about). Start your email \u201cDear Sir\u201d or \u201cDear Madam\u201d, if you don't know the person you are writing to, but know they are male or female. \u201cDear Sir/Madam\u201d if you are writing to a company and don't know who will read your email. If you know the person you are writing to but are writing to them formally do not use their first name even if you call them Dave every day of the week: use their surname and title- \u201cDear Mr Jones\u201d, \u201cDear Dr Jones\u201d\u2026. Write your letter avoiding any inflammatory terms and any comments you might regret if - oops- this suddenly got sent to everyone if you, or the recipient, pressed the wrong button. In fact that's a good rule of thumb for all emails , whether formal or not, especially if you are using a company email. (NB: choose your email account: a formal email from \u201cnumbnuts82@wombat\u2026.\u201d also doesn't set the right tone). Remember: if you\u2019ve anything really important or sensitive to discuss with someone, it's best only to alert them to that in an email, then meet face to face. You can't do everything online! End with \u201cYours faithfully\u201d if you don't know the person \u201cYours sincerely\u201d if you do: no \u201cRegards\u201d or \u201cKind Regards\u201d here, and definitely no \u201cKRs\u201d ever, which means that you can't be bothered to write the term in full because you're too busy and don't mean it anyway. Now, just get the spelling and punctuation right- read before you send and spell check carefully- and you are done. ",

            "answer_text": "My understanding is that you should not use email for formal communication without the consent of the addressee. For example, I have had phone conversations with candidates\u2019 potential employers. I normally would mail a letter of recommendation, but in a couple of cases, apparently to speed up their paperwork, I\u2019ve been asked to fax or email my correspondence. To the best of my ability I try to set up the email exactly as I would a formal letter, but given the peculiarities of margins and spacing, I use the left margin for return address, inside address and closing, referred to in letter writing as a \u201cblock style.\u201d If given a choice for \u201cformal correspondence,\u201d I prefer mail first, fax second, email third.
