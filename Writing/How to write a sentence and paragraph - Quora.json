            "answer_text": "A good paragraph: Consists of one or more sentences. A paragraph can be long or short \u2013 there are no fixed rules about thisContains a single idea or topic \u2013 if you start a new topic, start a new paragraph.Contains a topic sentence which usually starts the paragraph (but not always). The rest of the paragraph tells the reader more about the topic, i.e. develops the idea by adding information, explanations, and/or examples.Builds on the previous paragraph and leads on to the next paragraph (if relevant).Is clear, logical and easy to understand. This means it is: - well organised with each sentence linked to what went before and leading to the next sentence/idea.- flows: you can achieve flow by organising your thoughts and using transitions. - starts on a new line, with an open line between paragraphs.There are three different kinds of paragraphs in an essay:  an introductory paragrapha number of body paragraphs, anda concluding paragraph.The one thing all good paragraphs have in common is a topic sentence. And the key to writing a good paragraph is to write a good topic sentence which  tells the reader what the paragraph's about (i.e. the main idea or topic)helps to answer the assignment question by referring either directly or indirectly to the question. This focusses the essay and keeps it on track.",
