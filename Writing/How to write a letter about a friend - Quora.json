            "answer_text": "About a friend or to a friend? I'm guessing to. Grab a pen and paper start writing as you think. Start with, I'm writing to you via pen and paper as it's a much more personal approach and your a dear friend. I hope this letter receives you well. You could then start talking why you are writing and not talking in person. Remember what you first write does not have to be the final letter you send. Just write down what comes to mind and then 're write the letter again. See If you change it, restructure it or if there's something missing. You can write bullet point reminders on a piece of paper to remind yourself what you wanted to talk about so you get everything out you want. Ask questions too, make them want to write back. If your feeling stuck start writing what you've been up to since you last spoke with them, highlight good things that's happened. Things you've learnt. Imagine while you write that they are so happy to get your letter and are reading it with full interest. If you still get a mind block, stand and stretch, go out and breathe some fresh air for 10 minutes and return refreshed. If you do that, add it to the letter, tell them what your doing, where your sitting, let their mind picture you writing to them. I hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f ",
