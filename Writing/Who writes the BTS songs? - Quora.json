Especially the rapper line, Suga and RM the most out of them, but out of those two, it\u2019s hard to know for sure, but (don\u2019t quote me on this) I think RM has written the most lyrics. They can all write if they want to. They all have the chance to produce, too. (You are really luck right now, bc I\u2019m lazy, and about to go to bed bc it\u2019s after 1 A.M., but I\u2019m listening to their music right now, it\u2019s a chill playlist, and I really want to tell you all of them, or at least most of them. Most of this is research, so you are extra lucky. I have already done many answers, and I really don\u2019t like answering so many with so much in a few hours, even in a day. Consider yourself the luckiest persons on the planet right now) They have 73 songs in writing credit and 12 in producing. Writing credit (And this is all hand-typed by me, lots of work.

He wrote 51 songs and produced 1 song\u2026 So, as you can tell, the rapper line pretty much did the same songs. And they all produced Miss Right.

I can\u2019t write, but, then again, the only inspiration is my life\u2026 I\u2019ll just let that one sink in a little\u2026 C Ya down at the bottom While ur still thinking\u2026 (This is not mine, but it\u2019s true) Theh have the least especially Ma Jimin   but they helped a lot too. V wrote 5 songs and Jimin, 2 songs. They didn\u2019t produce any songs but they worked hard in dancing \u314b\u314b\u314b. I just want to say that BTS (especially the rapper line. Appreciation for them pleaseu) is so freakin talented for writing 73 songs and producing 12 songs. They will be soon called \"LEGENDS\" and I cant wait for that  I love these boys so much. (Although, I did have to do a few corrections and \u201cAdd to Dictionary\u201ds Like that.) THANKS FOR READING! *flying kiss of Jin* As always, thanks for asking and I look forward to answering your questions in the future. And all the BTS ARMYs out there, Keep supporting our boys!!! ",
