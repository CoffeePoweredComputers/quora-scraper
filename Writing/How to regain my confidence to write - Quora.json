            "answer_text": "The trick is to write down the ideas while your mind is swimming in them. Write them down randomly, without judgement, and in their pure, raw, haphazard form.  Then, once your mind settles down after this spur of passion, sit down with a book and pen, or with your laptop, and this random ideas filled paper. Read them slowly, word by word, and start writing your first draft, equally haphazardly. Don't think about editing yet.  Once the first draft is done, leave is aside for 3 days or more. Then, come back to it, and start editing or rewriting. Make your ideas stronger, cut out words you don't need, fix the grammar and punctuations. Leave it aside for 2 days, and come back and edit it more. Editing is all about critical reading - staying in tune with those reader feelings that tell you 'This needs more..', 'This line is too long and complicated', 'Ah! This line is so funky, but it doesn't belong here. Let me keep it aside and use it elsewhere.  The way to regain confidence is to keep writing, even when your mind draws a blank. Write about something other than what you wanted to. Write without letting the judgements stop you. Write for ten minutes or more. If your mind is blank, start with the sentence, 'My mind is blank' and keep writing. The only rule is to not stop the pen from moving.  Writing is a pursuit that we will never feel confident about. Even the most accomplished, hardworking writers struggle immensely with self-doubt, and despair even. Don't let a lack of confidence stop you from writing. Keep writing. Pay attention to how you feel when you no longer write. That feeling and its knowledge will make you come back to it, always. ",

            "answer_text": "For starters, stop undermining yourself. You do not need academic qualifications to be a writer. There are many great writers who did not study literature as a subject yet went on to become successful authors. But let's focus on you now.I would suggest that you write for yourself, at least initially. Then you wouldn't have to worry about your qualifications for writing. As long as you're the only one who's reading your work, and you like it, who cares, right?So get down to work and start writing. Coming to your second point that you go blank when you actually sit down to write.Try this method, write down the bullet points that you had in mind. The random words, phrases, and ideas that had you excited, and propelled you to write in the first place. Jot them down even when they don't make sense. This way you're saving all your ideas so that you don't lose them later, and also, putting them down on paper will help you visualize your thoughts. once you see them on paper you'll be better able to string them together and come up with a coherent piece of article. Now think of the points. Find an opening and an ending. Decide which point goes where. Work them together and create a first draft. It doesn't have to be perfect, but hey, as long as you're the only one reading it, it doesn't matter!Finally, remember that like everything, writing also requires patience and hardwork. Many hours of editing and re-writing goes into what is claimed as a flawless article. Don't lose patience. Just keep writing!Hope this helps:) Thanks for the A2A ",
