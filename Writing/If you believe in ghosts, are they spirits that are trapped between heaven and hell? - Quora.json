            "answer_text": "No they are not. You can\u2019t actually be trapped between heaven and hell as these two realms are integrated and you can walk from one to the other but it only changes slowly because everything is finely graduated. Ghosts consist of two different types. A discarded astral shell that still has energy and has no soul and no sentience. Like a lizards tail. The others are what we call \u201cearth bound\u201d spirits who for a variety of reasons run away from other spirits that would assist them to pass over to the spirit world where the classic hells and heavens are. Most frequently this is fear of the dead, ironically. But others don\u2019t want to leave the earth plane as we call it. Those dedicated Christians who assert the dead \u201cknow nothing \u201c are in this category of folks \u201cdead scared\u201d of the dead. They think what they see are demons coming for them and the fact that they recognise deceased family does not change their views on this. It\u2019s very very sad. So they get left maybe for a few hundred years. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, aren't we all spirits trapped between heaven and hell. Each day we make choices that bring either closer to heaven or closer to hell. More importantly each day unleash a little bit of heaven or a little bit of hell upon the earth. The consequences of our actions can move the earth in either direction. By making an effort spread loving kindness to all living creatures on the earth we can usher in the kingdom of heaven on earth now. ",
