            "answer_text": "There are a numer of places online that you can write for free. You could start a blog on WordPress, Blogger, Wix, or write articles on a platform such as HubPages. While these are free platforms to write on, you can make money on all of them if you put in the effort and time. However this is up to you if you want to make money. If you are just looking to write for fun or for practice, you can do that as well. If you have experience as a writer and are confident in your writing skills, you could search out magazines and blogs that accept guest posts and pitch them. This is usually free, but it can be tough to get accepted. You\u2019re question was \u201cwhere can I write articles for free\u201d. But, if you are planning on becoming a known and respected writer, whether it be a blogger, journalist, novelist, or poet, I do suggest looking into getting your own website. It\u2019s very affordable through some web hosts. You can get hosting as low as $2.75 per month. And if you go with a Wordpress site, you can use themes and don\u2019t have to know coding or any tech savvy stuff. There are a lot of free themes out there. And eventually you may choose to invest in web design or a paid theme if your website takes off. Again, I know you asked about writing for free, but definitely consider the option of self-hosting. It was the best step I ever made as a blogger. ",
