            "answer_text": "First off, I\u2019m a bit confused about the question itself. Do you mean that you are: A fresher and want to build a resume to get freelance assignments? ORA freelancer and want to now get employed someplace as a fresher?Well, to win yourself a job (Case 1) or a job interview (Case 2) , my best advice is that you build a skill-based on Functional Resume. Case 1: Showcase your education, your extracurricular activities in school/college, volunteer work, internships, part-time jobs. Highlight the skills that you acquired through those experiences.If you have done any special courses apart from school/college such as Programming or Animation or Culinary, or anything at all, list them all out.End with a brief note about yourself as an individual.Create a LinkedIn profile and paint a good descriptive picture about yourself and tell the world you are looking for freelance assignments.Add your LinkedIn URL to your resume. Make sure to personalize the URL first because LinkedIn, by default, allots a string of alphanumerics to your Profile Page URL.Case 2: (Two additional points compared to Case 1) Showcase your education, your extracurricular activities in school/college, volunteer work, internships, part-time jobs. Highlight the skills that you acquired through those experiences.If you have done any special courses apart from school/college such as Programming or Animation or Culinary, or anything at all, list them all out.List out the independent assignments you have worked on in descending order, that is from the most recent to the first. Name the client, the from and to dates when you worked on the assignment, and main details of the jobb.If you have worked on 10 assignments or more, it is better to categorize them. For example: Photography, Content Development, YouTube Video Editing, etc. And then just mention the jobs you did in each category.End with a brief note about yourself as an individual.Create a LinkedIn profile and paint a good descriptive picture about yourself and tell the world you are looking for freelance assignments.Add your LinkedIn URL to your resume. Make sure to personalize the URL first because LinkedIn, by default, allots a string of alphanumerics to your Profile Page URL.Hope this helps!
