            "answer_text": "How was the first straight line drawn? No straight line has ever been drawn. A straight line is a conceptual mathematical thing, not a real world thing. In the real world one can draw an approximate line segment, but it is neither infinitely long, nor zero width, nor completely straight. It is just an approximate physical representation of the real thing. That said, one can imagine in pre-historic times, many thousands of years ago, some person dragging their toe in the sand while walking on the beach. Maybe that person was first, and if he or she walked fairly straight maybe that is how the \u201cfirst straight line\u201d was drawn. ",
