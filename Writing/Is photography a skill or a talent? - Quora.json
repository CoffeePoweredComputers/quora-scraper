            "answer_text": "Photography is both skill and talent. A skill, in my opinion, is something that is acquired from practice. A talent on the other hand is a naturally gifted ability to preform some sort of action. In other words, what distinguishes the two from each other is the placement of where this so called \u201cability\u201d resonates from \u2014 from practice or from natural disposition. A proficient photographer might have accrued their ability by having a natural eye for composition or light. On the other side of this, some photographers might have developed a skill set that allows them utilize his or hers camera to it\u2019s fullest potential. I do believe however that a strong line exists between artistic talent and technical skill when it comes to photography. When we discuss skill, we generally are speaking of the ability to control the aperture, shutter speed, ISO, white balance, etc. of a camera.Indeed, the ability and knowledge of how to manipulate a cameras function is very important to good photography. But the usefulness of this ability is sometimes not paired correctly with the drive to correctly utilize those skills. You could know as much as you want about how beneficial it is to have a half-pressed remote shutter focus analyzer but if you have no artistic talent, creativity, or appreciation for light and it\u2019s bewildering properties, then it is difficult to become a great photographer. So to answer your question more directly, photography an art form is the ability to hedge both artistic talent and technical skill \u2014 it is not one or the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Photography is an art. Technically, it's a little bit of both. Even a gifted person needs to hone his skills with practice and dedication. Just like how talented writers know how to weave a story through their imagination and life experiences, photography weaves a lieu of words portrayed in a single picture. Being able to narrate a voiceless story from your picture is a result of skill and dedication. It's a story, imagined to deliver a message in any language. This story might be evocative, compelling and at the same time open to various interpretations. I was fortunate enough to meet some eminent photographers, and the only thing they primarily focused on was vision! It's all about activating the mind's camera imagining a perfect scenario from any normal activity. Imagination is inborn talent. That can't be inculcated or rehearsed. When you have it, you can't just take a picture just for the sake of it. Different perspectives will engage you into a different kind of story. Like Albert Einstein had said, \u201cImagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.\u201d Skills are an indispensable part of artistic talent. Visual art (photos) without imagination is just optical-mechanical contraption to document reality lacking creative expression. Thanks for reading! Cheers! ",
