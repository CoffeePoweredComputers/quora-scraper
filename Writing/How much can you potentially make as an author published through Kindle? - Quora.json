            "answer_text": "If your Kindle book is priced $0.99\u2013$2.99 or $9.99\u2013$200, then you get 35% of that per sale. (The minimum is $0.99 and the max is $200.) Between $2.99 and $9.99, you get 70% of the price per sale \u2014 an incentive to keep the price at what customers are most willing to pay. Longstanding research shows that the sweet spot, depending on genre, is $2.99-$3.99 (optimal intersection of royalty per sale and number of sales). The above are all in US dollars. That said, it\u2019s all a bit more complicated in some cases (and internationally). You can find more details here and here. Also, you can enroll your book in the Kindle Unlimited program, which is essentially a library in which people pay monthly to be able to \u201cborrow\u201d Kindle books (up to 10 at a time, I believe). Amazon KDP piles all of the subscription earnings into a fund that is then disbursed to participating authors proportionately based on how much of your books Kindle Unlimited members have read. Note: This is not sales (because the books are borrowed), so the pay is based on actual reading of your books. The entire fund amounts to several million dollars per month. By the way, all of the above only relates to self-publishing on Kindle. The numbers will be different if you have a publisher, based on whatever your contract defines them to be. Larger publishers have different arrangements with Amazon than individual authors and indie publishers do. If you were wondering how much authors make on a larger basis (like monthly or annually), that\u2019s widely variable. There are Kindle authors who make nothing (their books don\u2019t sell), and there are a small percentage of Kindle authors who make millions of dollars from their books. It\u2019s a longtime adage that a typical self-published book sells about 100 copies. At a Kindle royalty of $2.00 each ($2.99 x 70%), that would obviously equal $200. But my experience and observation, having been connected to many authors, is that this 100 number is what you get without really trying \u2014 in other words, it\u2019s your friends, family, and connections. If you\u2019ve written a useful or entertaining book, and you make a sincere and sustained effort to promote it, you will likely sell more than 100 copies. But most authors prefer to write than market, and many hope or believe the book will magically sell on its own. For a detailed case study in what you can earn on Kindle, read this guy\u2019s article on his own experience. [Answered: How much do authors make on Kindle?] ",

            "answer_text": "I know of cases ranging from $0 to solid fulltime incomes. Now, many people on the upper end of the scale, especially in 6 figures, will be vague about their earnings, due to getting harassed by saboteurs. (Seriously, if you earn a good amount and admit it in detail in public online, a swarm of bad reviews will occur promptly thereafter. I\u2019ve seen this happen to multiple people.) The main factors involved seem to be how well you reach your target readers + how frequently you publish. ",
