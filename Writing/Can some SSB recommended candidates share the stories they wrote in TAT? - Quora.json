            "answer_text": "Nobody needs to copy recommended candidates story because it is a personality test. Try to understand logic behind the test.The picture story test as it is commonly called is termed as (PPDT) \u201cPicture perception and description test\u201d during screening. The same test little modified is called (TAT) \u201cthematic apperception test\u201d during psychology day. Why? There is a difference between perception & apperception. In simple worlds perception is how you see the world and apperception is how you make meaning of people's expectations, motives, behaviours around you. So, TAT is an interpersonal test. The cards are scientifically prepared to prompt your behaviour and feeling toward others- Picture of boy and girl (same age)- your views towards opposite gender.Picture of boy and elderly woman/man- your views towards elders (mostly your parents)Picture of lonely person standing near window or on bridge or near a tree (lonely setting)- very important in finding out if the person finds positivity or has suicidal/depressed feelings.Picture of many boys/girls- your views towards your friends or at work place or social gathering.Picture of accident, death- your views on bad life affecting event.Now, how the stories are scored is a controversial, difficult and unknown topic. It totally depends on the psychologist. But, if done a research on net, one can find one of the ways for scoring is \u201cSocial Cognition & Object Relation Scale- General rating\u201d (SCORS-G). In this the stories are scored on 8 parameters (not necessary all parameters are included in one story)- Complexity of representation of people (insight into self and others)- In psychology complexity means when you take not only your own view but others view also in consideration.Affect-tone of relationship schema- affect-tone are of two types negative and positive. How is relation with other negative or positive? Is it one-sided or mutual.Emotional investment in relationship- how is the relationship with others at emotional level.Emotional investment in values and moral standards- does the character have values and moral standards.understanding of social causality- this is important and complex topic. Have to Google yourself to understand.Experience and management of aggressive impulse- shows aggression or puts his point firmly in proper non-aggressive manner.self-esteemIdentity and coherence of self- long term goals and ambitions.",

Try practicing more and let your inner imagination come out because at that moment you would not be having the watch definitely but your heart beat will let you remind the every passing time and so you come up with only those ideas that come to you as your first thought . Try improving your language, as to make the stories more short and crisp so that you cover almost everything in the given time . but yes preparation is more important let me share you a book that you can download for free and believe me if you follow the book you will land up with very good ideas and stories . I did the same and so every time (3 SSB\u2019s yet) I appeared for the SSB, I was the one with whom every other candidates agreed while discussion and everytime I gave the common story and got selected too .

It is some thing that shows the hidden talent, which is not acquired from guides and books. Now asking some one to share their TAT experience per se speaks of ones psychology - not sure of him / her self and low confidence level. Secondly, you going anonymous itself indicated your lack of courage to face a situation and worried about others opinion of you. Be bold and your original self at SSB to be successful, otherwise you will only repent. ",

Write what humans can easily do, either alone or with the help of others. No superman, batman stuff please. The problem statement in your story may not always be a murder, floods. Earthquake etc, electricity not being there on an exam night is also a problem on which you can write a good story. Every story need not finish with rewards/awards. Sometimes you solve problems as a part of your daily routine. The length of the story doesnt matter, its the content which does. All the best. ",
