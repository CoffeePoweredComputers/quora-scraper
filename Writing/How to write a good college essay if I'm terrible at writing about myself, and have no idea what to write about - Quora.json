            "answer_text": "No one is good at that or has practice on it as it isn\u2019t normal part of school work. You come up with ideas by sitting down and putting pen to paper on a few different occasions. Do the work, in other words. Essays don\u2019t write themselves in your head any more than math problems solve themselves. Give yourself lots of time for learning and practice. Especially when it comes time to write it. Start in spring of Junior year. Do some brainstorming exercises. Think of some anecdotes that illustrate what you want to show people about yourself. Find some essay prompts and practice a few mini essays, or first paragraph to see what ideas come up. In late summer or fall, start your essays. Do some first drafts for a few different prompts. If one seems like it has promise to develop into something go with that. Expect to spend 3 to 5 drafts, say. This site has a great blog with an enormous amount of tips. But my best tip is that you sit down an actually write something, anything. It can start off crappy. The beauty is that you just rewrite it into something good. It\u2019s all in the rewrite and editing. https://www.essayhell.com/blog/ ",

            "answer_text": "An essay is a short piece that usually gives the author\u2019s opinion about something. The writer has a single point or statement to make, not necessarily about himself or herself per se, but also about how they see people or the world. Start by making a few short lists of three or four things that answer these questions: What three things do you passionately hate or love? For example, I hate Brussel sprouts, current politics, loud places.What three things do you value in another human being? Example: trust, loyalty, creativity.What three things make you feel angry or happy? Example: I feel happy when I pet my dog, play a game, visit friends.Pick one of these things and consider what you want to say about the idea. What is the main point? In other words, what is the theme or topic you want to write about. For example; A dog can make someone better understand how to love. To get started, try to prove your point. In what ways has the dog helped you feel more connected to yourself and the world. How does the dog act? What actions make you feel the snimal\u2019s closeness? Playing with a ball, snuggling, seeing the dog is protecting you? Conclude with a point that illustrates your love for your pet. The essay doesn\u2019t have to be about a dog, but about something important to you. Writing starts with thinking and observing. I bet you can do that! Authorlink Please follow me on Quora.

In other words, LEARN how to write a good essay and more importantly learn how to write a good essay on any topic your teacher might toss at you. Telling your professor that you are not too good at the assignment will not get you a sympathy grade. Not at this level. Read essays. Practice writing them and have someone read them who is not your mother. Develop the skills you will need to pass COLLEGE level courses. That is what education is all about. Good luck. ",
