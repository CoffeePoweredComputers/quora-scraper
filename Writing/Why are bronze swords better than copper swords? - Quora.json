            "answer_text": "Oh God. Researching the answer took a long time. Thank God for Google. Ok. The tensile strength of plain copper is 200 Mega Pascals. What the heck is Mega Pascal? Let's convert it to Freedom Units. 29,000 pounds per square inch. That's more like it. Now. The low-end bronze alloys have a tensile strength of 310 Mega Pascals or 35,000 pounds per square inch. That's why the Phoenicians took the trouble to sail to Wales and Cornwall from Lebanon to trade for tin before the Iron Age.  Pure iron has the tensile strength of 275MPa or 40k psi. Not much of an advantage. But when the Celts invented case hardening (carburizing the surface layer of an iron object), then heat treatment (quenching and tempering) and then spread it around Europe during their invasions c.400 B.C. It went up to 490 MPa or 71k psi. They also invented jointless iron wheel rims, soap, wooden barrels, gladius hispaniensis, pilum javelins & chainmail armor.  Case-hardening - Wikipedia Copper, Brass & Bronze are work hardened. That means hammering them. Heating and cooling them is to anneal them. Making the metal pliable again. I don't think these metals trap carbon atoms like iron, tungsten or titanium does. Update: Recently I read an archaeological article where they catalogued Egyptian & Hittite iron artifacts in museums & collections. It turned out that the Hittites who were believed to be pioneers in iron making, weren't in reality. There were as many Egyptian iron artifacts as Hittite ones. They were all made of meteoric iron. The first culture to mass produce iron by smelting ores were the Etruscans. They left so much iron slag, Mussolini processed them into steel.

            "answer_text": "question was : Why are bronze sword better than a copper sword? I assume that an historical explanation has to be given. Pure copper ores do not exist or in other words you do not find 100% pure copper in nature. Bronze does not mean a certain copper alloy but there are many copper containing minerals. (it might be better to speak of bronzes) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_element_minerals  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral Most copper minerals or ores contained various degrees of arsenic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic I doubt that people were aware of it but they surely noticed that the impure copper they used was of varying degrees of hardness. They might have noticed the poisonous smell and all the effects from arsenic vapor though. It might even happened in ancient times that natural aluminium was found and later alloyed. I think bronze age starts when metallurgy advanced and people were aware of the impurities in the ores and when they discovered how to make alloys. Tin copper alloys or bronzes might be the most practical and would avoid the toxic site effects.  Although in ancient times they might not be aware of arsenic as an element they somehow discovered how to color \u201ccopper\u201d with arsenic compounds. The knives in the picture are from different copper alloys and the left one is so highly arsenic that it lost the typical copper color. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenical_bronze ",
