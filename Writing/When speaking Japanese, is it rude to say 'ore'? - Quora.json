It\u2019s used with people you might know well, people you have grown up with, and few foreigners in Japan have friends they went to high school with. If you use \u201core\u201d you probably use \u201comae\u201d (you) which would be being rude as you are using a sense of familiarity you are not entitled to. ",

Essentially, it tends to carry a nuance of \u2018strength\u2019, \u2018maturity\u2019, and \u2018confidence\u2019, so if the person who uses this term does not have these qualities, it rings false.
