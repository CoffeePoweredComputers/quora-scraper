            "answer_text": "A debate article is something like a debate speech note. The first catchy point is its headlines. Many a time, the headlines are enough to persuade or convince the reader. It can be in the form of a question or a statement. Note this sample headlines - What is the school teaching your child- Sex Education or Sexy Education?Will you be voting for Trump again?There is a growing opinion throughout the globe that the medical industry is getting more notorious and greedyPresentations should not be hammered upon every studentMake a list of all the questions that can be asked to you by someone who does not agree with you- See the demo on the topic - Presentations should not be hammered upon every student Why should you stop a student from exiting his shy shell?Just like sports and drawing, a little of presentation is essential to learn. Would it not be useful to the students in their professional lives?Initially, the students may be reluctant but then was not every swimmer and car driver reluctant in the beginning?There are many other subjects that a student may not like, e.g maths, literature etc, will you be advocating against each?Many people who have been shy and introverts have grown up into top speakers teaching people various skills- Was it not because someone taught them?Now draft your answers in favour or refutation of each question and add subtitles to it. Your article is ready. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I write a debate? Oral debates between people are different from debating on paper and writing a good debate essay. The ability to defend one\u2019s position verbally is usually easy; defending it on paper is a bit more difficult. Two sources are given here: One, to give principles in writing a debate, and another, to give guidelines. Principles in writing a debate [standoutessays] Principle 1: Know the features of a good debate.A winning debate has several characteristics:Uses logic.Presents a certain position on an issue.Gives roofs and evidences.Refutes arguments.Principle 2: Choose debate essay topics wisely.Principle 3: Investigate background of the problem.Principle 4: Collect arguments and counterarguments.For the guideline - A debate, more than any other kind of writing, has two clearly defined sides. In a formal debate, the issue is stated as a resolution. For example - \u201cResolved: The world should ship all its garbage to Mars.\u201d Sides then argue affirmatively or negatively. Arguments follow a very rigid structure. Each side is given an opportunity to present its points and refute its opponents. Each segment is timed. Latest by categoryHere\u2019s a guideline.[http://howtowritewhatever.com] Define your terms.State your position.Give enough background on the issue.Show that you strongly believe in your side of the issue. Make firm statements that make your stand clear. Add your own insights to the understanding of the issue.Focus on two or three and cover them thoroughly. You may even decide to pick only one main argument and go into more depth.Refute.You must respond to your opponent\u2019s points. This is called a rebuttal speech. Judges in a debate consider the effectiveness of this step when choosing a winner.It is important to choose the most compelling argument or arguments from the other side. You will represent yourself as a fair and impartial commentator on the issue.Be objective\u2014most of the time.Be kind.Refrain from attacks on people. This tactic is known as an ad hominem device and will diminish your credibility. Name calling has the same effect. Avoid using words with negative connotations to make your points. Use a reasoned approach instead.Provide support.Choose support that is relevant. You may have a dramatic illustration or narrative, but don\u2019t use it unless it drives your argument forward. Stay on topic throughout the paper.Summarize.End with a strong recap of the points you have proven.And the winner is . . .(Your reader makes the decision).",
