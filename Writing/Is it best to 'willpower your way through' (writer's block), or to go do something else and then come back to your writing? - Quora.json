            "answer_text": "Neither. Go back to the point in your writing when you were writing freely, just before the \u201cblock.\u201d Now ask yourself what you wrote after that that went wrong? Were you forcing the story down a path that is not implied from the previous prose, and makes no sense in light of what you\u2019ve just written? Are you trying to force a character to do something out of character with no explanation? Are you just writing filler that brings nothing to the story? You\u2019re doing something wrong at that point, and your subconscious is pointing that out by refusing to cooperate with your \u201cplans,\u201d if indeed you had any. Take a deep breath and ditch those plans. Ask yourself \u201cWhat else could happen here?\u201d You\u2019ll know you\u2019ve found the right answer when you find yourself writing freely again. ",

            "answer_text": "Some authors believe the latter. They believe that writer\u2019s block doesn\u2019t really exist, that it\u2019s just a matter of not believing in yourself. I believe that there are many reasons for writer\u2019s block, and you first need to understand what is going on. Is it a matter of too many things going on in your life? Declutter your life before going on. Is it because you don\u2019t understand the story? Take time to sort it out. Is it because you are stressed about something? Figure out what it is that is bothering you and work it out. One time I took a week off from work to write on my novel. The first day I sat down at my desk and had a bad case of writer\u2019s block. I struggled for a couple of hours, and ended up going to the mall and watching two movies. Giving myself permission to lighten up was the right thing to do. The next day I wrote fourteen pages. Most importantly, you need to understand yourself as a writer. What works for you as motivation, and what is simply copping out? ",
