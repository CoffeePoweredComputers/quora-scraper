            "answer_text": "A candidate for excellent opportunities should have demonstrated great leadership in extracurricular activities. Think of a reviewer of your application. He or she is no fool. If you join 15 clubs in your final year, that reviewer will see through that. Join a few activities in your first year, rise to the top of one or two of them.

Time management and collaboration are also useful skills for scholarship recipients. Lastly, discipline is a very necessary skill for a scholarship recipient in order to maintain the requirements for the scholarship. I hope this helps. Dr. Burl ",
