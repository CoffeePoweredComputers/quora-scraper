            "answer_text": "I'm in my late teens. Let me tell you this briefly...In my early teens- I felt like I really know what true love is like \"being with each other all the time and not only sexual but also mental, to find happiness in their laughs but never let them go for a little while. Hardly I knew what \"I want some space\" would mean.In my middle teens- I realised that I made some mistakes and I appreciate myself as I learnt many valuable things from them. I realised that true love would be there on a person even being away from them and the distance does only makes us remind how much we love them. I realised what giving space to our loved one would be. I realised that true love could be on that person even if they don't want to be with us. That shows how respectful we're to them and to our love on them. I realised that true love can happen not only on our lover but on a friend and on our family.And now in my late teens-I realized that we make mistakes which teach us a bigger lesson than anything. I realised that true love can happen on more than one person as a lover simultaneously but what we choose will be one sided, what they choose, if syncs with ours we can do what we want to do. I realised that in extreme situations we should make choices which don't ruine other's lives than to think about ourselves. I realised that true lover is not someone who says that they love us unconditionally but one who assures us that we fall to rise again and we love to beloved. The one who fights besides us than opposite to us. I realised that I've got everything from everyone but I should strive more to make them better as they deserve so. I realized that I found a true lover for being a true lover... Which makes me think like kissing them in their happiness and hugging them in their desperation. Yes I know what true love is..! ",

People tried to convince me I did not and was too young to understand love, but they were wrong. Time has told me that.  We broke up years ago because of distance, incompatible views, and because our lives were taking us in different directions. Now he is married to someone who is a lot more compatible with him than I would have been. I am truly happy for him. I will always remember him fondly, because he is who taught me what love is in a relationship by example. ",
