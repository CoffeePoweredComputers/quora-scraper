            "answer_text": "Question: Do you agree that blackwashing fictional characters after decades of being white is not profounding to anyone? Isn't it easier to simply write new characters who happens to be black? Answer: Comics, Marvel universes, and indeed Star Trek universes etc. really aren\u2019t my thing. Reality is stranger than fiction and quite sufficiently entertaining for me. However, your question includes important sociological implications which do interest me. In principle I agree with you - completely and without reservation. I\u2019m not quite sure whether Blackwashing is insulting, or at least shows someone is trying. In practice, real life is rather more complex than fictional universes. It isn\u2019t so easy to establish new characters, new brand names, new images and to obtain new followings for them. Marvel / DC Comics etc, pays millions to acquire the rights to a whole host of characters. Why do they pay that sort of money if they could just create new characters from scratch? Because it really isn\u2019t easy to just create new characters from scratch. It\u2019s often better to buy an established character with a proven following and readership base, and then tweak them. Tweak them a lot in some cases. There\u2019s also a thing called brand coverage. You want to make sure that all possible reader interest groups are covered. Some readers want one thing, and some want another. You want to make sure you have a range of suitable comics and characters to suit everyone. That means you have to shift some characters whose appeal overlaps and tweak them. Maybe you can introduce a new character to do the job. But you need to be careful; you don\u2019t want them competing with a readership group who are already satisfied with another superhero, else you are competing with yourself and cutting your own profits. There\u2019s no proven foolproof recipe, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s an art not a science. So -in principle I don\u2019t like blackwashing. In practice it\u2019s possible that DC Comics / Marvel know their industry and made a tough decision that was the lesser of two evils. After all, every time you write off a character and try and replace him / her with another one, you are also writing off everything you spent acquiring that character and building up his name recognition and following. That\u2019s not something you want to do too often if you can avoid it. Why do you think James Bond has been going for 50 years, and has only recently been rebooted with Casino Royal? Why does Dr Who keep regenerating? Because the brand name is valuable. Sure you can come up with Triple X instead, but \u2026 Easier to come up with a blond James Bond than start from scratch. And easier to blackwash an existing character than start from scratch. Reality is a lot more complex that Marvel Universes. Hope these thoughts help. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok here\u2019s the gist of it. While having a black character in a series or movie is fine, I don\u2019t believe that you should take a perfectly fine white character and then, because you \u2018need\u2019 a black character, sub in a black when they were always white. Why? Simply this. You might imagine it is simpler to make up a completely original black character than piggyback off an existing white character, but here\u2019s the real truth - the white character is there and all you have to do is throw in a black equal, which in some minds is easier. Yes, it would be logical and more fun to invent your own character, but I honestly think some directors, writers, or even producers are kinda lazy or they want to \u2018revolutionize\u2019 the way blacks are, even though there are an equal amount of black characters already in existence. A good example is \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019. Meg Murry has always been white and it is wrong to blackwash her like that and have her be a black \u2018revolutionist\u2019. She was always white in the novels and always should be. In some ways, this could be insulting to both black and white people. White people are offended because the white character is now black. Black people might be put off because their black \u2018hero\u2019 is just a white hero in disguise and they don\u2019t have that feeling of a true invented black character. I don\u2019t mean to sound racist. I am not racist, but I don\u2019t like it when a perfectly fine character is blackwashed \u2018just because\u2019. There are some amazing black characters out there, so it seems logical to use the ones you already have and be inventive, not turn white characters into black ones. ",

They only do it to minor characters usually so it\u2019s kind of like they\u2019re saying \u201cwho\u2019s the least important character we could make black so that it wouldn\u2019t anger people? Uh, how about Jimmy Olsen? Perfect!\u201d (BTW They might as well have just given that Jimmy Olsen an entirely new name because he looks and acts nothing like JImmy. Never realized how important it was to me that a character looks a certain way until it\u2019s changed. It\u2019s not easy to create new characters who happen to be black, but you know what is? Painting over an old franchise/property with a new coat of paint, and then trying to sell it off as something new and revolutionary. That\u2019s always easier than creating something from the ground up. Stan Lee said something regarding this. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, if Peter Parker had originally been black, a Latino, an Indian or anything else, that he stay that way,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we originally made him white. I don\u2019t see any reason to change that. It has nothing to do with being anti-gay, or anti-black, or anti-Latino, or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cLatino characters should stay Latino. The Black Panther should certainly not be Swiss. I just see no reason to change that which has already been established when it\u2019s so easy to add new characters. I say create new characters the way you want to. Hell, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d People need to look to this statement the next time they think of changing how a character looks just cause. ",

            "answer_text": "Making a character black who has an established history of being white is going to be a radical departure for that character. If Daniel Craig was replaced by Idris Elba or any actor who cannot pass as the son of Scottish nobility, they would have to provide Bond with a totally new back story. At some point, perhaps Eon will want to do that with a future reboot. But prior to Casino Royale, each new actor took his predecessors\u2019 past with him. It was George Lazenby who lost his wife to Blofeld, but Moore, Dalton, and Brosnan all mourned her too. I imagine they are planning to do the same with Craig\u2019s replacement. Bond will regenerate like the Doctor, but they will not start over from scratch while the movies continue to do well at the box office. Why kill the golden goose with a premature reboot? Other characters, on the other hand, do not have a definite ethnicity. Making James Olsen black on Supergirl was no big deal. I do not know that his ethnicity was ever even specified in the comic books. Similarly for Mordo in the MCU. But when Fox made Johnny Storm black while keeping his sister white, that caused major problems. ",

However, if nothing in the story dictates or precludes a member of any race or nationality, then deviating from the historical depictions is not an issue. Just because XYZ has always been a particular race, doesn\u2019t mean they have to be. If there are little sticking points\u2014like black brother and white sister\u2014small non-contradicting edits or inserts could be made\u2014like adoption or blended family. I put this on par with forcing actors from a different country to mimic, often horribly, the accents of the characters they\u2019re portraying. If the story is engaging and the performance excellent, \u201csounding\u201d right is pointless\u2026 just like \u201clooking\u201d right is. How many times have producers cast someone who didn\u2019t fit the description in the book, but their portrayal was good anyway? Hmmm\u2026 Gary Sinise as Stu Redman in The Stand comes to mind.

Just look at the reaction when Obama became president. There were protests all over, because presidents are traditionally white and blacks don\u2019t have the intellectual maturity to handle the job. That said, Some roles would be drastically changed of a person of color were to play them. Tom Sawyer or Huckleberry Finn would be a whole new story if the characters were black. And what if Superman became a Muslim terrorist from a distant galaxy. Probably, some things are best left alone. And others innocuous. ",

My favorite example is when someone concludes that since Cleopatra reigned over a country in Africa, she must have been Black. Even a rudimentary study of Egyptian history will reveal that Cleopatra was a descendant of Ptolemy, a Greek, whose presence in Egypt was a consequence of some guy called Alexander the Great. Cleopatra\u2019s ethnicity was in no way Black African. She probably didn\u2019t even speak any African language. As depicted in tomb paintings, the Egyptians knew the difference between themselves and Nubians, and none of the Ptolemaic Dynasty are depicted as Nubians. Same applies to depiction of Jesus as Black. Jews were ethnically homogeneous at that time, and there is no reference to Jesus being Black. To change this requires abandonment of the belief that Jesus was a historical person. Anybody who wants to convince believers of this could warm up by trying to tell Muslims that Mohammed was a gay female cross-dresser. ",

If the character\u2019s race isn\u2019t specified, I couldn\u2019t care less what race the actor is. If the gender isn\u2019t important to the role, I don\u2019t care what gender. I love Egyptian mythology, but didn\u2019t watch \u201cGods of Egypt,\u201d because the actors were pretty much all European or American. I can suspend my disbelief only so far. Scarlett Johansson playing an Asian is ridiculous. I\u2019m still weirded out that every actor who ever played Charlie Chan was non-Asian. ",

The Seven Basic Plots - Wikipedia and https://tvtropes.org/ The key to \u201chow good a story is\u201d is not what race it\u2019s \u201ctraditionally\u201d been. It\u2019s in how good the writing is. If the ethnicity of a character is critical to the particular plot, then the new \u201cblack\u201d version shouldn\u2019t be the exact same story, and should inherently suffer from the awkward fit. To answer your question, nothing is profound. ",
