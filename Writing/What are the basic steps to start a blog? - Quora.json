Start small, be consistent and grow big - that\u2019s the key to long term blogging success. There are no shortcuts. That said, blogging has its own benefits including; Improve your writing skillsImprove your networking skillsBuild connections with other influencers in your nicheHelps you earn moneyHelps you increase your trafficHelps you with more conversions, salesAnd the list goes onAbove all, if done right, blogging can help you earn passive income. Don\u2019t believe me? I earned over $200,000 selling one affiliate product from my blog.  So yes, blogging helps you earn passive income. But here\u2019s the thing to remember: blogging is not a get rich quick scheme. You have to work hard, consistently put efforts, learn new things, deal with all the Google updates, traffic drops etc and still be consistent. That\u2019s how you earn money from blogging. So definitely blogging is NOT so easy as most people say. But yes, it gives you excellent chances to earn more, build a network, find more opportunities and so on. That being said, here\u2019s what you need to start your own blog in 2020. First things first. Start your blog on WordPress as it offers you a ton of useful features like SEO benefits, plugins usage, easy customizations and so on. To start a WordPress blog, you need two basic things. DomainWeb hostLet\u2019s briefly talk about them now. A domain If you want to start a blog, do it professionally from day 1. Don\u2019t go for free domain extensions. Get a .com domain as it won\u2019t cost you more than $10 to $20 a year. Make sure your domain is easy to remember and try domain name generators like Domainr to find whether a domain is available or not. Try to get expired domains with good domain authority and trust value if you can shell out a few hundred bucks and looking for some SEO value from domains. A web host You need a web host to host your domain and blog. I\u2019ve been using Bluehost for a long time and extremely happy with it. It costs you just under $3/mon and offers you a ton of features including; Unlimited site hostingFree domain (yes you get a free domain for 1 year)Unlimited emails, databases etcFree SSLAnd the list goes onAn appealing design First impression matters. You need a good looking theme for your WordPress sites. You can go for Elegant themes where you can get access to over 80 themes at just $80. That means you'll be getting 1 theme at $1 which is an incredible deal. Make sure to read our in-depth tutorial on how to start a blog and make $10k per month from it where you can find a lot more details. So there you go. Make sure to find a narrow niche where you can offer excellent value to your users. Find a monetization strategy that helps you earn money in the long run. Have any questions? Let me know in the comments. To your success, Anil Agarwal ",

            "answer_text": "First, decide why you want to blog. Are you blogging for its own sake? Or are you blogging to build a platform and make money? Both are legitimate paths, but if you\u2019ll have better results if you choose one or the other. Blogging for yourself: Pick a free platform like wordpress, blogger, medium and setup an account.Write everyday, or every Tuesday, or whenever the muse strikes.Play around and try writing different styles, different topics, whatever strikes your fancy.Have fun! Blogging is a rewarding activity in and of itself.Blogging to build a platform / make money: First, there are quicker ways to get rich than blogging. Building a platform by blogging will take a long time and a lot of consistent effort. You will have to learn and apply skills that have nothing to do with writing. You must provide value to the reader. Don\u2019t just copy what other bloggers are doing. Figure out what unique value you bring to the table. If your readers can find the same content on 10 other blogs, they won\u2019t visit yours.Write write write. Write everyday with the aim of improving your writing skill. You don\u2019t have to post everyday, but you must practice everyday.Build an email list. You want to know who your readers are. Build a relationship with your readers. Ask them what kind of content they want to see.Publish consistently. If I know my favorite blogger posts every Thursday I\u2019m going to check her site every Thursday.Learn basic SEO, but don\u2019t become a boring content mill.Think about monetization after your blog has found its niche, and after you\u2019ve grown a sizable audience. You\u2019ll have a better idea of what kind of product to offer, and you\u2019ll have a better return on things like affiliate marketing/ads. Don\u2019t be obnoxious with ads.Have fun! Along the way you\u2019re going to hit roadblocks and get frustrated with lack of progress. Progress will come if you put in the work.Good luck! ",
