            "answer_text": "One of the most powerful ways to do this is to just install the CAPTCHA plugin. You can integrate it with your WordPress blog so that people have to solve the CAPTCHA to leave a comment. The great thing about this way of blocking comment spam is that it basically weeds out around 90% to 95% of all the spam out there. The truth is, most spam is automated. Flesh and blood human beings would not put in the time, effort, and energy to manually spam your blog. After all, your blog may be new, or people haven\u2019t really heard of it, so it\u2019s not really worth their time that the return on investment is not there. So they use all this sophisticated software, but you can stop those types of software in their tracks by installing spam comment CAPTCHA plugins. So go to Blog Tool, Publishing Platform, and CMS - WordPress, look up their CAPTCHA plugins, and you should be good to go. ",
