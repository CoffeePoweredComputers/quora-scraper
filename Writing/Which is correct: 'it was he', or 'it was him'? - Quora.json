Herefore, If one desires to speak the phrase \u201cit is he\u201d, there is no need to transform the \u201che\u201d into \u201chim\u201d. As a summarizing statement of what has been spoken, the phrase *\u201cit was him\u201d is incorrect, and instead one must employ the phrase \u201cit was he\u201d. To speak otherwise would be undoubtedly, unambiguously, wrong. This occurs as well in the Latin language: for example, direct your attention to this phrase, taken from Comment\u0101ri\u012b d\u0113 Bell\u014d Gallic\u014d, Ea r\u0113s est Helv\u0113ti\u012bs per indicium \u0113n\u016bnti\u0101ta, translated as \u201cThe affair was disclosed to the Helvetians through a notice\u201d. The participle \u0113n\u016bnti\u0101ta describes the noun r\u0113s, \u201caffair\u201d, and thus matches its gender and number. However, it is still in the nominative case, even though it follows the verb est \u201cto be\u201d. Here is another example, from the Aeneid: huic coni\u016bnx Sychaeus erat, meaning \u201cSychaeus was her spouse\u201d. It is plain to see that the subject Sychaeus and the \u201cobject\u201d of the verb erat (\u201c(he) used to be\u201d), coni\u016bnx are both nominative. It here follows that, as in the majority of spoken tongues, the case of the \u201cobject\u201d of the verb \u201cto be\u201d does not take the accusative case. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIt was him\u201d is clearly what any native speaker would say if they hadn\u2019t been scared by made-up rules invented by people who think language ought to be logical. In your sentence, \u201chim\u201d is what\u2019s called the complement of the verb to be. In languages that have proper case systems, the complement in such a sentence is in the nominative case, that is, the case of the subject. English has for the most part lost its case system, but fossils survive in the personal pronouns and the relative. So we have he nominative, him accusative, and his possessive (genitive in many languages). Who is nominative, whom is accusative, whose possessive. So people who think the grammar of English ought to work according to the rules of Latin (Ancient Greek is actually too loose to serve as a model for excessive precision) therefore say that your sentence ought to be \u201cIt was he.\u201d What this ignores is that the forms are also governed by other rules besides case\u2014 in particular, when a personal pronoun is the complement of the verb to be. Anybody who answers the question \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d with \u201cIt is I\u201d is either making a joke, or is too hung-up to be worth bothering with. If you just consider French for a moment: \u201cQui l\u00e0?\u201d; no one would dream of telling a French person that \u201cC\u2019est moi\u201d is not correct and they ought to say, \u201cC\u2019est je.\u201d French isn\u2019t English, of course, but English isn\u2019t Latin either, and this is an example of the sort of rule that applies in real English, only it\u2019s paralleled in another language where no one is in denial. As it happens, over about the last ten years what\u2019s left of a case system in English has gone into rapid and terminal decline. You\u2019ll have noticed the people who think that \u201cwhom\u201d is a fancy form of \u201cwho\u201d, and use it where it\u2019s not at all appropriate by any kind of grammatical analysis. More recently the personal pronouns are going. When I was in Primary School (or perhaps even earlier, when I was a Mixed Infant) we were taught that it was BAD to begin a sentence with \u201cI\u201d. So if you wanted to say you\u2019d gone to a rave with a friend, you said \u201cShe and I went to the club.\u201d The \u201crule\u201d still seems to be around, but instead of changing the order to avoid the dreaded I-at-the-beginning-of-a-sentence, people now say and write \u201cMe\u201d: so we get \u201cMe and her went to the club.\u201d Of course, my teeth itch when I hear or see this, but it\u2019s clearly the way English is going, and it\u2019s to be found in quite educated users. And I rather fancy that in slack moments, I might do it myself. Since the case system of English has been hanging on by its fingertips since the fourteenth century, it\u2019s not surprising it\u2019s finally going. Language changes all the time. The only problem for you is that in some possible extensions of your sentence, \u201chim\u201d would not be elegant. \u201cIt was him\u201d is clearly right in answer to a question: \u201cWho did it?\u201d \u201cIt was him\u201d (indicating the guilty party); \u201cWas it George who did it?\u201d \u201cIt was him.\u201d But suppose you\u2019re not answering a question, and you want to specify what was done: \u201cGeorge did it. It was him who put the Darjeeling in the Assam container.\u201d Some people might object to that, and I might, too, in some moods\u2014I think you\u2019d need to put a lot of stress on \u201chim\u201d with a pause after it. On the other hand, \u201cIt was he who put the Darjeeling in the wrong container\u201d will make you look as though you\u2019ve spent too long in an expensive language school that wasn\u2019t worth the money. I would work my way round it one way or another. \u201cIt was George who put the Darjeeling in the wrong container.\u201d \u201cGeorge did it. He was the infernal blighter who mixed up the teas.\u201d But if in doubt, I\u2019d say \u201cIt was him who did it\u201d with a look in my eyes that would say \u201cI have a First in English from Oxford, and a PhD in Medieval Literature, so what are you going to do about it?\u201d ",
