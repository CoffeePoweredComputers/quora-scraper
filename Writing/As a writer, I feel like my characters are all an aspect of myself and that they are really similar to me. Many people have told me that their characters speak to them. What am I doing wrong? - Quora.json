            "answer_text": "You must write the characters personality based on how he/she is presented in the story. It is fine to use some of your very own personality traits, But you must look outside of the box! Look around at people, friends, family write some of their attributes. In writing, Authors must display their talent, and no reader wishes to read a novel that they can not distinguish one character from the other. In writing, each and every character that you are introducing, if possible no similarities.. Example: Mark was a very thrifty man, he worked hard, bought a new car every 2 years, Bought a home at age 28, saved his money so that he could be afforded living the good life.. Sam, barely kept a job, and when he did it lasted only about 3 months! He envied Mark for being able to hold a steady job with a great income. Mark lived a much better life than he.. When the two of them would encounter people that they both knew, they would always remark. You two are so different, and to think that you are brothers.. Your characters must be different in every aspect in order to capture the readers, and not have the same personality traits.. Hope This Helps, Regards, DIA ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Most writers early in their practice have the same sort of characters \u2026 OK, there are a few that don\u2019t, but most of us use the closest template we have: ourselves. So don\u2019t really worry about that. Some writers do have characters that speak to them. I do. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the only way to do it. I\u2019ve noticed that more \u201cby the seat of their pants\u201d writers do the character speaking to them things than those that plot things out, which includes the characters and their talents/personalities, etc. If you\u2019re not getting that feeling of them talking to you, it\u2019s probably because you already know where you\u2019re going. So, keep up the good work! Best of luck to you! ",

The way he has been brought up in life largerly influences his perception, attitude and outlook in general. This naturally tends to get reflected in his writings or of evolving a character and situational plot in his storyline, unless he is conscious enough to write beyond what he believes in. ",
