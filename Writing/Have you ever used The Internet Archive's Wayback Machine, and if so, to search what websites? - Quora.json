            "answer_text": "I routinely use the Wayback Machine to research what sites looked like, typically for those clients that want a new website, but their old one is no longer online. Why are those sites no longer online? Could be any number of reasons. They were past due on payments to their web hosting provider and that provider cancelled their account (and they had no backups)They no longer wanted the website because they switched careers, lost interest or any number of similar reasons.Their domain name expired and was eventually purchased by someone else.Change of business ownership - new management decided to go down a different path.Old website got hacked and there were no backups.Always, always backup your website.
