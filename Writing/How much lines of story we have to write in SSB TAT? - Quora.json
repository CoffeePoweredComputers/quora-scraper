            "answer_text": "The best stories are written with introduction of problem, the resources at hand and how \u201cthe hero\u201d utilise them to overcome the problem. The propensity of a candidate is to waste precious time and words in explaining the characters of stories. Instead straight away start by introducing the hero with name. For example- A picture portraying accident; one can start with- \u201cRam was returning home when he saw an accident on the way.\u201d Next, instead of describing resources, straightaway write how hero utilised them. For example- the first aid kit in a car or may be the people from crowd. Always make sure to conclude with solution and may be aftermath. Say, the victim was rushed to hospital where doctors operated on him and he was out of danger. This way, you concentrate on how you are able to perceive and overcome a problem and able to present it to the psychologist. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some points to make your TAT impressive : You should always try to identify a main character in the picyure and make a story around that character. Try to write the story in 3 different parts, consisting of : \"What led to the situation(2-3 lines)\" , \"What is happening at the moment(8-10 lines)\" , What is the final outcome of the story (2-3 lines). Points to keep in mind while writing story Identify the picture through scanning (divide the picture into six parts , E to W and N to W) .Identify the number of characters in the picture .Pick one of the character as your lead character.Write a simple , natural and positive story with happy ending.The story should be covered under the following:Background/Introduction : 2 to 4 linesBody of the story : 8 to 10 linesHappy ending : 1 to 2 linesTry to cover the story in between 11 to 14 lines. Hope it helps. :) ",
