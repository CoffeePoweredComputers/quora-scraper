Alternatively, you could get an advanced degree in some subject that entitles you to teach that subject in a university, write a book on that subject, and then assign that book to your class (this has the slight added benefit of adding some change to your wallet\u2014and it would in an academic press be measured in pennies). And I am actually not kidding about that last part, because I\u2019ve seen it done, often enough to know it happens more often than I know about. So maybe you need to ask yourself: Is doing what you\u2019re asking really a good goal for an aspiring writer? ",
