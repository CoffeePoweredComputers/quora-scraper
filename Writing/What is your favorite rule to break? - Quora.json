            "answer_text": "Probably the same one I've been breaking for years, smoking weed in public. I'm in a legal state so it's not as severe a thing anymore, but public usage is still forbidden. Much like the proverbial falling tree with no witnesses to observe it, if nobody sees me, they don't know in a factual way. Do I do this to be 'cool\u2019 or something? Nah. I'm just in a LOT of pain every single day. It's my most effective pain medicine. Opiates barely work on me and supress my respiration in a scary way. I once literally asked an ER nurse when they were going to add the Dilaudid to the IV. She looked at me and realized that I honestly didn't know they already gave me some because it wasn't doing anything compared to the pain at the time. When the choice is be miserable or totally stop giving a single shit about what others think about me smelling like weed, and be happy... I know what to choose these days. (Note: I always make sure there are no children around, I'm not going to be that guy.) ",

            "answer_text": "Rules can be in the form of laws, workplace or school policies, home disciplines etc. We should follow the rules all the time, otherwise we cannot live and work consistently and harmoniously in this society. Rules restrict our behaviours and govern people's moral standards. For me, the rule I often broke is the traffic rule. In the past, I always did Jay walking unlawfully because I didn't have that patience to wait for the red-green light. I just wanted to cross the street as fast as possible although I actually had nothing important to do. I only had a \u201cpatience\u201d problem, not a \u201cprivilege\u201d expectations. Traffic rule was my favorite rule to break, but not anymore. I would say everyone would break some rule(s), sometimes somewhere in their life. There are some rules that people should not break no matter how, such as marriage rules or laws, rules of not affecting other people, company policies, etc. Breaking these rules will have serious effects. Did I answer this question? If I said something not proper, please forgive me and let me know. Thanks for reading. ",
