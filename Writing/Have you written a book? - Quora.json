            "answer_text": "I have written a book. I\u2019ve written a few, but this is the one I\u2019ve been working on for most of 2018. It was edited and published on Kindle just a day or two before it would have been ineligible for entering in The Thurber Prize for American Humor contest in 2019. Books that are entered in The Thurber contest have to be published traditionally, or in an \u201ce\u201d version, between January 01 and December 31st of the previous year. THURBER PRIZE FOR AMERICAN HUMOR SUBMISSIONS Awarded annually, the Thurber Prize for American Humor is the highest recognition of the art of humor writing in the United States. A panel of national judges selects three finalists from seven or eight semi-finalists. The winner receives $5,000 and a commemorative plaque. Previously held in New York City, the Thurber Prize returned to its hometown roots\u2014Columbus, Ohio\u2014in 2018. The three finalists are required to attend the awards ceremony in Columbus, Ohio. Guests are entertained during a spectacular evening of humor culminating with the announcement of the winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor. A commemorative plaque! Shoot, if I don\u2019t win, I\u2019ll just order one up from Office Depot and hang it next to my Pulitzer. The contest was what motivated me to start and then finish the book. When I have a target and a deadline, I work harder. I don\u2019t mind if I lose, well, not much, but the fact that I finished something for a specific purpose is satisfying. Skewing everyone\u2019s favorite proverbs was also part of the fun. And going to a \u201cspectacular evening of humor\u201d would be the bomb. Last year, the books submitted to the Thurber contest were from authors like Dave Barry, Paula Poundstone, and in previous years, Jon Stewart and David Sedaris. But they didn\u2019t win the 2018 prize; that was won by an unknown. At least she is to me. If the judges like to see submissions from bottom writers, there is hope for me yet. I can\u2019t do a free promotion as I\u2019d like without enrolling the book in KDP Select, which I don\u2019t want to do. So, I\u2019ve priced it very reasonably at $3.99. If you do buy my book and read it and feel so inclined, please leave me a review. Amazon won\u2019t let people leave reviews who haven\u2019t spent $50 on the site, just to give you a head\u2019s up.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082KRKLDW Thurber House \u2014 ABOUT JAMES THURBER \u2014 Literary Center and James Thurber Museum And since this one was published, I wrote a fourth:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X3QSB6L Dang, these images come out big.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written a few books, and am in the process of writing a lot more. Here is the quick list with links if you\u2019d like to check them out: FICTION: 1. The Manifest  Years after a mysterious plane crash, a woman feared dead is spotted at an anti-war rally. A private investigator named Edgar Willis is hired onto the case, however, he must abandon his virtues after learning of the real destiny of the airplane. As Edgar realizes a conspiracy in the crash, life and the world as he knows it takes an unexpected turn. 2. Completing The List  Lizzy Sheppard loses her husband too soon and one day finds something that helps the grieving process: his bucket list. 30 things her husband wanted to do before he died. Eager to do something for her departed beloved, Lizzy sets off to complete the list in the hopes that she will learn more about the man who was the love of her life. 3. The Cure  Dr. Xavier Carter has been on the run for almost three years. He's wanted by police for crimes he didn't commit and hunted by private mercenaries. These killers want to eliminate him because Dr. Carter made the medical discovery of the century. He managed to create the one thing that everyone in his industry thinks will be bad for business: a cure. 4. Rock My World  Usually when family comes to visit, it's a pretty normal occurrence. Yet Jenny's father isn't a normal person, he's Dick Mitchell. To millions of loyal fans he's 'Evel Dick'; lead guitarist of The Horsemen, one of the most popular metal bands on the planet. So when rock royalty invades her small rural town to visit his only daughter, things will never be the same for anyone. 5. The Summer Home  Peter loves taking his family up to the cottage by the beach every summer but with stressing deadlines and an even bigger twist that forces him to take in his son from a previous marriage, things are off center and chaotic. 6. Lunar One  Dr. Morgan Taylor is living out his childhood dream. He's going to become an astronaut and spend six months on Earth's first lunar base. He's excited about the mission until he learns that things are not what they seem on Lunar One. 7. The Official Douche Bag Travel Guide of Chad Barrington  After having a tantrum in court that lands him in contempt, Chad Barrington is forced to seek counseling and take two months off. Unable to work, this top notch lawyer decides to go on vacation and sooth his battered ego. He quickly learns that it's possible to be a total Douche in paradise as well... NON-FICTION: 1. Outspoken: Confessions Of A Devout Atheist  A collection of essays and rants, inspired and taken from a series that I have been writing for several years concerning this subject. A stirring account of how certain issues are poisoned by organized religions and why we as a society would be much better off without them. 2. The Atheist Under Your Bed  In my second atheist book, I tackle some new issues and go back to a few old ones just to reemphasize their importance. Another collection of topics and rants that will, regardless if you agree with me or not, should provoke a little thinking and debate. POETRY: 1. Recurring Dream  2. 100 Sonnets  3. Po\u00e8mes du coeur  4. Blood and Ink  So those are the books I\u2019ve written that are currently for sale online. I have a lot of projects that area in the process of being written, and I actually plan to release at least two more before the end of the year. Not bad since I\u2019ve already released two of them this year already. This doesn\u2019t even include the 75+ comic books I\u2019ve written over the last three years as well. If you\u2019d like to buy any of these titles (some are free) I\u2019d appreciate any business you could afford to offer, but if you\u2019d like a preview to see if you\u2019d even dig my kind of writing, you can do so over on my Wattpad account, where there are samples of all these books plus chapters to new books I haven\u2019t even released yet: P.J. Lowry (@PJLowry) - Wattpad So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve written, and there\u2019s a lot more where that came from! Cheers, PJ ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't, but I'm working on one. It all started because I was tired of books which have a tonne of romance. (I'm not a great fan of romance.) I wanted something with interesting characters that weren't romantically involved. That had some internal conflict, in a little mysterious world. I always had some rough, random scenes playing in my mind. (Maladaptive fantasy\u2026) One day, I was feeling angry, and to diffuse the feeling, I wrote a scene. A random scene, where a girl faced a creature she had never seen before. I ended up writing a full action scene. By the end, I had already thought of what the creature would be like, where it came from, and what the secret behind it all was. I\u2019d come up with my idea. Then I thought of who the girl would be. I wanted to give her some of my characteristics, but also other very different qualities that set her apart as a character of her own. She'd be the fantasy character I always wanted to read about. (An xNTx type of a character). I\u2019ve two other different main characters planned, too. It's going to be epic fantasy. I've made some notes about what kind of a planet it is, where my story is set. I have researched a little bit of the science behind it, because since the world is different, the weather patterns, the life, all will be different. I need to have some logical, plausible reasoning for all that. (I have a thing for logic.) Besides, it only makes sense. Ever wondered what kind of plants would grow on a world like that? What the economy runs on? Those things matter to me. That's the world building I'm working on. So yeah, I\u2019ve created a mental outline of the plot, and actually have an idea how my story is going to end. Thinking is easy though. I'm facing trouble with filling it up. It's hard to put the scenes to paper (type it, actually). And it's hard to write believable, natural dialogue, while simultaneously developing the world in the story. It shouldn't seem pretentious, and come off smoothly. But to answer your question, I've written a few scenes and started working on who my characters are, and where they're going to end. ",

CIA Makes Science Fiction Unexciting: Dark Deeds & Derring-Do is a tragicomedy about the things that seemed like a good idea to the gummint at the time, I guess:  I am probably the youngest Lee Harvey Oswald biographer:  Lacking an encyclopedia of gendered behaviors that are rewarded by all people trying to get a leg up on others in life, we defined and illustrated them in Manspressions: Decoding Men\u2019s Behavior!  Beyond the Music: How Punks are Saving the World with DIY Ethics, Skills, & Values\u2019s first publisher went bankrupt just as I finished it. The second publisher turned out to be swindlers and so it sat for several years in hibernation. It finally came together at a time when I was pretty severely overwhelmed and struggling. I believe in it for what it is but would have put in the effort to make the message clearer, really wish it had a better cover, and would have dared to speak for people more than letting them speak for themselves.  I started receiving letters from Joey Torrey in prison in 2006 during a particularly low point in my own life. We created Bamboozled: An Incarcerated Boxer Goes Undercover for John McCain\u2019s Boxing Bill together in 2013 after I spent years of my life researching his life and understanding his crimes. I now see the book as a parable about a man who received an infinite number of chances in life and proceeded to screw them all up, including his relationship with me! He has apparently bamboozled even the state of California, got out of prison, and is now a free man!  And now I\u2019m hard at work on volumes on grassroots activism, autism pride, and so much more!

Plus, none of those posts actually got many views compared to my usual ones, so I\u2019m hoping this will inform some people who are actually interested but haven\u2019t seen those posts. It\u2019s the culmination of almost two years of work (on-and-off, but mostly on since this coronavirus business), starting when I wrote some silly Quora answers about hypothetical animal combat, and they actually went down quite well. Several people have mentioned that I haven\u2019t been writing those kinds of answers as much recently, and a big part of that is that I was writing new material for the book and wanted to keep it a surprise/not post on Quora. Some of the match-ups were inspired by Quora, but they\u2019re a lot different in the book, having been reworded, extended and reformatted. About 2/3 of the battles are completely new. All contain ample alliteration, painful puns, and anthropomorphised animals questioning whether they\u2019ve been anthropomorphised or not. There are new segments, and there may or may not be an interview with a coconut. It\u2019s been a learning experience, and I won\u2019t say I didn\u2019t question why I was spending so much time on a fairly weird topic, but I put a lot of work into it and, in my humble opinion, it\u2019s pretty funny and pretty informative. (You might start to hate me if you read the same jokes 15,000 times like I did, but it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll be that committed.) If you like my animal answers on Quora, I think you\u2019ll enjoy it. It\u2019s more of the same, but (imo) a higher standard, more detailed, and something I took way more seriously. If people are paying money, I feel accountable for making sure it\u2019s worth it. I really tried to give it the structure and feel of a \u201creal\u201d book. I learned that you should not start writing a manuscript on Google docs. I learned that you should not write a manuscript on Word without formatting it properly. I learned that Kindle Create software\u2014while mostly pretty handy\u2014will sometimes attempt to bend you over and penetrate you from behind. Do not talk to me about pictures. (If there\u2019s a next time, maybe I should just write a traditional novel with words. Sweet words, and no pictures to format and compress and resize.) At least I can say I am now an author, albeit a self-published one. Thanks to everyone who had nice things to say about my answers; thanks to everyone who suggested I compile them/reacted positively when I suggested it, and thanks to everyone who believed some silly myths about animals that I felt compelled to dispel. Thanks in advance to anyone who does buy a copy (or even reads it on Kindle unlimited). I really appreciate you guys giving me a platform to talk nonsense about animals. Now I need a lie down. And a drink. Edit \u2014 it hasn\u2019t taken that many sales to make it there, but it\u2019s reached the Number 1 \u201cHot New Release\u201d in a couple of categories on the US site:  Thanks to those who have bought it, and I hope you enjoy it.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Two. :) Dissecting Antismokers' Brains and TobakkoNacht - The Antismoking Endgame DAB was published in 2003, and TN in 2013. As you can guess from the titles, they\u2019re both in the same subject area, and if you click on the tabs on their sites you can find extensive excerpts for reading (particularly for TN under the front cover image\u2019s \u201cBook Selections\u201d tabs). Both were difficult to write because of the amount of research needed for parts of them dealing with health and science, and the knowledge that even a single small error or inadvertent distortion in either could be blown up to discredit the entire book. Together they come to about 850 pages and 275,000 words with over a thousand citations and references. Heh, writing fiction is MUCH easier (TN actually does have 60 pages or so of fiction in the form of \u201cbookend\u201d opening and closing short stories.) Unfortunately, despite being a very devoted fiction reader of probably 10,000 or so novels in my life, I\u2019ve never had any real talent for writing it. The two pieces in TobakkoNacht were politically inspired oddities that just sort of popped out unexpectedly, and my lack of skill in the area is shown by the fact that I worked out formats for both stories that allowed me to avoid any need for dialogue. Here\u2019s the shorty closing bookend (650 words) from my Blog here on Quora if you like: Michael\u2019s Breathers . (Breathers is particularly appropriate today, two years after I wrote and posted the rest of this answer: we are heading straight there now, courtesy of the COVID-19 virus.) I chose to self-publish because the subject matter for DAB was both very unique (heh, as opposed to only somewhat unique? :> ) and very sensitive politically. Giving it to the wrong publisher in 2003 could have resulted in it being bottled up for years \u2014 at a time period when it seemed quite important to get it into circulation quickly. Self-publishing also gave me ready access to relatively cheap copies that I could simply give to bar-owners and such who needed to read it but who would have been too sceptical to lay out money for it. Self-pubbing is NOT easy however\u2026 just in case you\u2019re thinking of doing it. There\u2019s a LOT of work involved to do it right, and a LOT of pitfalls along the way that can screw things up. Check and join the yahoo POD_Publishers group and read through the thousands of messages there for a lot of good background info. I\u2019m sure there are other good sources as well, including several books and free resources by Aaron Shepard (See *Self Publishing* AARON SHEPARD'S PUBLISHING PAGE *POD Publishing with Lightning Source and CreateSpace, Ebook Publishing on Kindle, Online Book Marketing on Amazon, DIY Book Design* ) who has helped hundreds of aspiring self-publishers over the years through the aforementioned yahoo group! Soooo\u2026. that\u2019s about it for my \u201cHave I written a book?\u201d Dunno if there\u2019ll be another anytime soon. As noted, it IS a lot of work. MJM, who\u2019d write a book titled \u201cHow To Care For Your Cactus\u201d except for the fact that mine died due to lack of care\u2026",

Amateur, a book of short stories.  A Spectacular Catastrophe and Other Things I Recommend, a book about how to survive adversity and suffer less.  I\u2019m currently working on three more: One which I hope to publish this November (2017) which is another short story book. I am not certain about the title but I\u2019m getting pretty close. One that I\u2019m working on with Franklin Veaux for publication some time next year, which is a collection of things we wish someone had taught us in school. (If you have an idea for a title, bring it!) Another book that focuses only on career related essays: things I learned at work that made my life easier that I look forward to sharing. Maybe this one will be ready early 2019, maybe before that. What I\u2019ve learned about writing books is that you just have to write them. Writing is more about discipline than anything else. Sit down in front of your computer and write. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve published seven volumes of translations, mostly Old Norse sagas and similar texts, although one volume is translated Old English poetry. Possibly the best known is The Sagas of Ragnar Lodbrok, because the Vikings series is loosely based on it. (My translation came out in 2009. I don\u2019t know whether anyone connected with the TV show ever read my work. Still, it\u2019s been gratifying to watch the stories and characters that I grappled with turn into pop-culture icons.) The most recent saga anthology, quite a bit bigger than Ragnar\u2019s book, was Six Sagas of Adventure; the characters are less famous than Ragnar & Co., but there\u2019s plenty of fierce battles and wild escapes and beautiful monsters and savage princesses and all that good clean Viking fun. Aside from sagas, I\u2019ve done a translation of a medieval medical manuscript (Norse Magical and Herbal Healing), and also a stab at Old English poetry (Say What I Am: A Book of Old English Riddles). All of these are available on Amazon. My latest assaults on literature are two small, slim, pocket-sized editions of Old Norse poems: H\u00e1vam\u00e1l: A New Translation and R\u00edgsthula: A New Translation. The humble yet proud polytheistic religious organization to which I belong, which you\u2019ve probably never heard of, is donating copies of these to prison and military outreach\u2014one donated copy for every purchased copy. So there\u2019s that. These should be up on Amazon in a week or so. (Lyonel Perabo, I\u2019ll be sending you copies once I get some extras.) There\u2019s a much larger anthology of sagas that is currently in the final stages of preparation, coming out in October 2017 if all goes well, which I\u2019m rather excited about. ",

Ellyne: Kindle Store I have written the Fair and Fey series of epic fantasy novels, following the history of the development of Elves \u2014 their rise and fall in our world. The series begins with the book Maginaugh set in a time 9,000 years ago in a location now known as Macinac Island, Upper Michigan. It\u2019s the story of an alien girl from a distant planet falling in love with a native girl of the Pewa (pre-Chippewa) tribe. They struggle against the disapproval of the alien girl\u2019s mother and constant attacks waged against Maginaugh by primitive savages.  Amazon.com: Maahilund, Book II of The Fair and Fey (Volume 2) (9781542374866): J. Ellyne: Books In the second book, Maahilund, the alien girl and her mother, brother and close friends (minus her Pewa lover who decides to stay with her male mate) travel in a small wooden boat across the Atlantic Ocean, settling in a northern land now called Finland. One hundred and fifty years later, the alien protagonist meets a local wizard known as Vainamoinen who transforms her and her family and friends into Elves. The protagonist meets a local Elven girl who lives in the secret underground Elven city of Maahilund. There is an attraction based on the protagonist\u2019s feeling that this Elven girl is her former lover reincarnated. It\u2019s unrequited however and they remain simply friends, although they share the love of a male Elf. Orcs and Demons attack Maahilund and our protagonist is given a magic flaming sword, capable of killing Demons, so that she can lead the Maahilund Elves into battle.  Amazon.com: The Elves of Arthannegh (The Fair and Fey Book 3) eBook: J. Ellyne: Kindle Store In the third book, The Elves of Arthannegh, the protagonist is reincarnated 8,000 years later as a Nymph of Pan in northern Britannia during the Dark Ages. Vainamoinen meets her there again but this time he is going by the name Merlin. She meets another Nymph and they fall in love, or lust \u2014 it\u2019s hard to tell the difference when it comes to Nymphs. Merlin tells them of their past, that the protagonist is actually the alien girl reincarnated and the other Nymph is her old lover, reincarnated now as a Nymph. He tells her of her destiny to obtain her sword once more and help the local Elves and British combat Orcs, Demons, and Roman soldiers. They are sent to the King of the Elves of Arthannegh to get the sword from him and to have him transform them both back into Elves. They meet Uther Pendragon during a solstice celebration in a magical circle of standing stones and our protagonist fulfills the first part of her destiny by helping him battle the Romans to win independence for Britannia. In return he helps her fight the Demons and Orcs of Arthannegh.  The Elves of Avalon (The Fair and Fey Book 4) - Kindle edition by J. Ellyne. Literature & Fiction Kindle eBooks @ Amazon.com. In the fourth book, The Elves of Avalon, our protagonist and her lover have left our world to live in Avalon where Uther\u2019s son and daughter, Arthur and Anna Pendragon, have been taken to keep them safe from the invasion of Anglo Saxons and the continual onslaught of Orcs and Demons. Arthur and his sister fall in love. The Elven protagonist gives him her sword because Merlin says he will need it in order to fight the Demons, Orcs and Anglo-Saxons overrunning Britannia. She and her Elven lover go back to our world where Arthur recruits a small band of knights with the help of Merlin. The book follows the well documented twelve battles for British victory over the Anglo-Saxons and adds the Elves getting Arthur\u2019s help to battle the Orcs and Demons. This book has a happier ending than the first two but Anna, now going by the name Morganna Le Fey, has a son by Arthur whom they name Merdraud (aka Mordred). A fey outcome of this union is foretold by Merlin.  The first four books are currently for sale on Amazon, Smashwords, Barnes & Noble, Apple, Kobo, and all other web sales sites world wide. They all received excellent reviews. My fifth book, Two Worlds Changed, has been completely written and is in the final stages of editing. It will be for sale on Amazon later this month (March). The Elves have returned to Avalon while Arthur stayed in Britannia, growing bored during the reign of peace ensuing after his final victory over the Anglo -Saxons at Badon Hill. The Demons won\u2019t leave our protagonist alone. They attack the Elves on Avalon in Otherworld. Meanwhile Arthur goes off on a continental battle campaign in our world. His is forever a warrior. While he\u2019s away, his son, Merdraud, steals his wife, Guinevere, causing a civil war to erupt in Brittannia. Arthur has to return to regain his kingdom and thus fulfills his fey destiny to do battle with his own son. This is the final book of the Fair and Fey series and you must read it to find out how everything turns out. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven't, but I'm working on one. It all started because I was tired of books which have a tonne of romance. (I'm not a great fan of romance.) I wanted something with interesting characters that weren't romantically involved. That had some internal conflict, in a little mysterious world. I always had some rough, random scenes playing in my mind. (Maladaptive fantasy\u2026) One day, I was feeling angry, and to diffuse the feeling, I wrote a scene. A random scene, where a girl faced a creature she had never seen before. I ended up writing a full action scene. By the end, I had already thought of what the creature would be like, where it came from, and what the secret behind it all was. I\u2019d come up with my idea. Then I thought of who the girl would be. I wanted to give her some of my characteristics, but also other very different qualities that set her apart as a character of her own. She'd be the fantasy character I always wanted to read about. (An xNTx type of a character). I\u2019ve two other different main characters planned, too. It's going to be epic fantasy. I've made some notes about what kind of a planet it is, where my story is set. I have researched a little bit of the science behind it, because since the world is different, the weather patterns, the life, all will be different. I must have some reasonable, possible reasoning for many that. (I have anything for reasoning.) Besides, it just is sensible. Previously wondered what sort of flowers would develop on some sort of like that? Just what the economic climate runs on? Those activities matter for me. That's the world building I'm taking care of. So yeah, I\u2019ve produced a mental outline associated with plot, and in actual fact have an idea exactly how my story will probably end. Thinking is straightforward however. I'm facing difficulty with completing it up. It is difficult to place the scenes to report (type it, in fact). And it's really hard to write believable, all-natural dialogue, while at the same time building the entire world in story. It shouldn't seem pretentious, and come-off efficiently. But to answer your question, I've written some moments and began taking care of who my characters tend to be, and where they are going to end. ",

Summary of the Book Songs of a Ruin is an anthology of poems that attempts to open our eyes to things we don\u2019t pay heed to. It mocks the robots that we have become, and endeavours to pull us toward the sentient light. These poems appreciate the rarity of an actual emotion. Songs of a Ruin relates profusely with visionaries and builds rivers of hope. Maybe we still have a shot. Maybe everything\u2019s not lost. Life isn\u2019t order. So you don\u2019t often find one pressed against the book\u2019s poetic lines. It is the turmoil that struggles in its alluring pages that sets its rhymes apart. Songs of a Ruin is written in pain, with it, and by it. It is an epitome of a ruin\u2019s rediscovery in an ugly world of decadence. It screams for your slightest nod. Come, fall in love with the fallen. About the Author Prashant Singh, who goes by the pseudonym Scottshak, is a poet, author, blogger, movie-buff, freelancer and a software engineer, all in that order. Currently based in Pune, he likes to be called a dreamer who can\u2019t be tacked into just one profession. Writing is his primal passion. He owns three blogging websites that skim eclectic genres. Songs of a Ruin is his debut poetry book which intends to launch him as a fully-fledged author to help him identify with the world. He relishes and relates with dark gloomy creations easily. He also enjoys learning new things, often goes philosophical, becomes a misanthrope at times, questions the meaning of our existence, and then on some days, loves to surround himself with family and\tfriends.

            "answer_text": "Answer is Yes, I start writing when I am 15 years old and at that time I am in the standard 10th . And after 10th vacation I started writing my own book but unfortunately, I give up and switch on other hobbies. I write around 60-70 pages. After I completed my 11 and 12 and our education system don\u2019t allow or encourage extracurricular activity like writing, drawing etc. So, when I become 17 after my 12th holiday is started and once again I come to my passion and that is writing something my own! But here main question is that what topic I started writing, then gradually I come up with that previously written 60-70 pages book and started writing but after writing 10 more pages I am stopped because I don\u2019t know what to write, because of lack of so much experience of outside the world.(Note: I am writing on the topic of Success!). Then I finally decided to write a one book on business in my mother tongue (Gujarati)! I choose to writing on business because of I am also really passionate about startups, entrepreneur and building businesses. So, I started writing when I am at the end of my 18 and I write more than 270 hand written pages and now I am turn 19. But after writing 270 pages book on business (Title of that book is: Fundamentals of Business), I don\u2019t know where and how to publish. After researching few months how can I publish my book then I knew that it cost around 40 to 50 thousand for complete publishing and lots of obstacles come in my path so I give up. But here one main thing I am not dissatisfy with this because I never right to show others but it is my passion and that drives me further and it gives me so much energy and motivation! But for a writer it\u2019s easy to keep everything in my mind but I want to show the whole world about my thought. So, one fine day I decided to write eBook in English and once again topic is little different from previous one, I choose to write on Startup so I come up with a name of Startup to Scaleup: What not to Do! And in end of 2019 I completed my eBook and publish on amazon kindle and google playbook, my eBook is become live 2nd and 6th January 2020 and I also turn 20!

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m writing one right now! I\u2019m writing a book about economics and wealth redistribution. In the book, I am going to present the different stances on taxation, minimum wage, and wealth inequality throughout history, how they have affected society, and how we can make society better by decreasing wealth inequality. Writing the book requires a lot of research. I need to gather as much information about economic theories as possible so I can explain them neatly and simply. I would also need to gather accurate historical data to drive my points with historical evidence and anecdotes. Along with that, I need to read a lot about the topic to understand all stances, each party\u2019s arguments, and their pros and cons. Overall, it\u2019s a very laborious activity. And in return, I am hoping it to be a fruitful one as well. The book will undoubtedly be intellectually fruitful. By the time I finish writing it, I will surely have learned a lot more about economics, the history of the US, among lots of other things. However, I also want the book to have a large reach. I want more people to read it, and I want to impact more people with the result of my hard work. And in order to reach more people, I need to advertise. The only problem is that advertising costs money. I am going to put in my own money to advertise the book, but I would be very happy if you helped me too. And that is why I\u2019ve made a Patreon page for you to be able to support me if you believe in the cause I am writing for. Here is the link: Mehran Jalali is creating a book  You can help me get closer to my dream of impacting more people with my writings, and I would be delightful if you did. I would be more than glad if you helped \u2014 and if you choose to do so, you\u2019ll see the result in around 9 months. Let\u2019s see how it goes! ",

            "answer_text": "My first historical fantasy describes a modern woman who becomes a house slave in Pompeii (she\u2019s a stranded time traveler). She becomes a storyteller. The title is A. D. 62: Pompeii, and I used the pen name Rebecca East. Descriptions of faces, houses, street scenes and artifact were inspired by images from ancient art; many of these are posted on my author web page Historical Fantasy This web site also describes a novel in progress (about a soul summoning spell in 13th century Occitania). It includes a blog about artifacts from that period that enter the story (a metal heart shaped box that contains an embalmed heart brought back from the crusades; and a sword of Chinese design similar to one shown on a tomb effigy of a noble from 13th century France). I read about the embalmed heart during my initial background research \u2014 I had to include that in the story! I imagined a Chinese sword, and later discovered evidence that there really is a sword that appears to be of Chinese design on a tomb effigy at the Cloisters Museum in NYC. So my imagination was validated. The blog also comments on common misconceptions about the middle ages (people did not come up with the idea that bathing was dangerous to health until the mid 1400s). I also have two statistics books: Warner, R.M. (1998). Spectral analysis of time series-data. Guilford. Warner, R. M. (2012). Applied statistics: From bivariate to multivariate techniques, 2nd ed. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, Inc. All three of my published books are available through Amazon and other on line book sellers (my novel and the Applied Statistics book are available as Kindle as well as hard copy). In response to a related question: How does it feel to be a published author? I talked about my experience with these books. Rebecca Warner's answer to What is the reality of being a published writer? They won\u2019t make me rich or famous but they give me a sense of accomplishment, and the feeling that I have touched the lives of many people in small ways. ",

It is a supernatural drama about Indigo People. They are teenagers just like any other, but with psychic abilities, and a tendency to have purple eyes. Exactly why these people are being born, more and more every year, is unknown. There are four secret societies each with their own agenda, each with their own theories about what they are and what to do with them. The four secret societies are associated with the four suits of the Tarot, which represent the four ways people hold power over others. Swords represents military power. They are a secret military brotherhood ruled by ancient alien hybrids, who believe these indigo people are manifesting alien DNA. Cups represents religion. They are an order within the Catholic Church who believe they are Nephilim and Cambions, and must be exterminated. Wands represents knowledge. They are the Illuminati, and their University of Magic. They are associated with Faye folk from another reality. Finally Coins are money. They don't care where they came from, they just want to exploit their abilities, and try to reproduce them. My protagonist is a major Crimes Inspector from Sonoma California who gradually learns about the Order of the Chalice in book one, and then the Illuminati in book two, and becomes a double agent working for both. None of the societies know of the existence of the others, at first, even though they are all thousands of years old. ",

            "answer_text": "Amazon.com: Normandy: A Father's Ship and a Son's Curiosity (9780692086919): Cary, David: Books  Yes, I have written a book. It is available on Amazon now. This book began out of a request I received from my father in law, who was at Omaha Beach, to find out what happened to his ship. I wound up speaking with crew members and their families to get the personal sense. This book is all based on researched fact. The more I researched, the more I realized that if I did not write this book, the story of his ship and its crew would be lost forever. I felt a responsibility. Here are my observations: My background was Vietnam Era infantry. I know jungle warfare. The difference between my experience and that of a US Navy World War II sailor is so great, we might as well have been in different universes. We are now as far removed from them, as they were from the American Civil War.The United States, even though it started with a very small military, had one of the most sophisticated supply chain and economic systems in the world. Its economy was based on mass producing to fickle consumers. This meant it could turn on a dime and produce weapons over night, and it did. The US basically supplied all the allies.In two years, the US went from a very small military, particularly as it relates to ground forces, to 16.1 million people in uniform, superbly equipped and trained.No one doubted the Japanese would lose, not even the Japanese! They got caught up in an internal political dispute. How insane?Writing and research takes time and discipline.Stories about people are everything to have an interesting book.When one is steeped in the knowledge of a subject, it is easy to forget that not everyone knows what you know. An editor, an independent pair of eyes, is critical to produce a readable book.What is common knowledge about WWII for my generation, is not common knowledge for following generations. I wound up having to give a tight summary of WWII so readers could understand how the ship fit into the grand scheme of things.The book is now being incorporated into a movie. I am glad I did this but my next book will be about growing a successful technology company. ",

            "answer_text": "It is finally finished: A Deconstruction of the Left.  I wrote it for two reasons. 1. Because I have no choice. Social media doesn\u2019t allow the free exchange of ideas anymore. 2. Because there is a lack of ideological material for my politics. There\u2019s a lot of complaining but little in terms of alternatives. In 350 pages, 13 chapters, some 100 000 words and more than 600 footnotes I intended to do just that. The chapters are: Power structures. Here I make use of Michel Foucault. Initially I believed that Foucault said there are no truths and I wanted to show the fallacies of that (Jordan Peterson and Lindsey Graham and many others make that claim), but as I got into him, I could not find any evidence that this was Foucault\u2019s intention. Instead, I made use of his ideas of power structures to show how the liberal left ideas are part of every aspect of society, including the justice system and the media.On truths. The scientific model as expressed by David Hume, but also how we can never be sure that the scientific model is correct (know as the problem of induction). I mention such thing as Plato\u2019s noble myth.Academia. Various direct and indirect ways that academia is controlled by those in government.Schools. While schools are not directly controlled in its politics, it is being controlled by how the education is seeped in tolerance, human rights and anti-racism.Liberalism. A pretty heavy chapter where I look various claims of individualism, and related terms such as human rights. Many references to John Stuart Mill.What is the left-wing? - Another heavy chapter largely focused on Social Democracy in Sweden and its connection to socialism.A deconstruction of left-wing terminology. Including such phrases as what equality refers to, and who \u201cthe people\u201d refers to. Inspired by Derrida, of course (another one of them postmodernists that Peterson and others despise).Freedom of speech. Initially intended as a defense of free speech but I came to the conclusion that every society needs to restrict freedom of speech, and that freedom of speech is mainly about power structures.Public Service (radio and TV) How Public Service is having a left-wing bias without being overtly left-wing.Feminism. Here I show its many fallacies and how it is connected with socialism.Anti-racism. Same as above.Social liberalism. How the left-wing and liberalism blended together. Looking into and countering arguments from such people as John Rawls and Thomas Piketty.The future.I printed 100 copies of which 70 are for sale (plus an e-book). It was self-published and cost around $1000 which included help with the design and typesetting and everything else to get it listed in bookstores, such as having an ISBN number. I don\u2019t expect to sell many copies at all \u2014 in fact no one I sent the manuscript to for feedback even got back to me even if they initially said they would. Maybe they found it too hard to digest, maybe they disagreed with it, maybe they found it boring or maybe they found it badly written. I have no way of knowing, but with such little interest among those who got it for free I don\u2019t expect hardly anyone to pay for it. I suspect that most right-wingers want to read a book that details how bad postmodernism is and how it is ruining society, and here I am making use of postmodernist terms. It might be too intellectual for most. In fact I don\u2019t know who would want to read the book \u2014 it certainly won\u2019t be the left-wingers or classical liberals, and I don\u2019t have to credentials to interest the academics. Anyways, now I have a book published and they can\u2019t take that away from me, unlike on social media where one can get cancelled and have their content removed any day without appeal. It was a mental strain but I wouldn\u2019t say it was a struggle to fill the pages \u2014 in fact, I cut away some 100 000 words that will be discarded or appear in my next book.  It\u2019s a nice feeling. My girlfriend is impressed that I was able to complete it. Writing a book like this is unlikely to make anyone wealthy, but I think the main advantage is that one learns so many new things. Writing on social media tends to become repetitive, as in \u201csocialism is bad, look at Venezuela and Soviet\u201d. Writing a book requires one to get involved in many new ideas and people I had never heard about, such as the German anti-liberal philosopher Carl Schmitt who has become one of the most quoted German thinkers and yet is surprisingly unknown among right-wingers. Or Lee Jussim, a social psychologist who for decades has shown how biased academia is. Will it get translated into English? Not by me, and I doubt anyone else would want to either. But maybe some day. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I have written two nonfiction books and and am currently working on five more books. I've also self-published erotica under a pseudonym. My first non-fiction book is More Than Two, a book about ethical non-monogamy co-written with my partner Eve Rickert. It was published in 2014.  My second non-fiction book is my memoir, The Game Changer, about my 18-year marriage to my first wife who identified as monogamous, and the changes that led me to believe the compromises in that relationship were not ethical.  I'm currently working on a follow up to More Than Two with Eve, tentatively titled Love More, Be Awesome. Eve and I have written a novel called Black Iron, a loopy, humorous story set in an alternate history London in 1855 in a world quite different from ours. It is currently in substantive editing and should be in shelves next year. We\u2019re working on two more books in the series, Gold Gold Gold! (currently scheduled for publication in 2019) and an as-yet-unnamed third book. I\u2019m also working on a nonfiction book I'm very excited about with Dushka Zapata. It's a series of essays about all the things we need to learn to become healthy, fully functional adults but don't learn in school. And finally, I write erotica under the name William Vitelli. The most recent of these books, and the one I'm most proud of, is Nineteen Weeks.  Nineteen Weeks is kind of an inverted romance novel. I took every cliched trope from classic trashy romance novels, inverted them, and built what I think is a thoughtful, introspective story filled with lots of kinky sex out of the inversions. ",

There are five books total, but the first that I wrote, and the one that is my \u2018baby\u2019, is No Good Deed. You need to suspend disbelief a bit to buy into the psychic twist, but otherwise, it was as real as I could make it. Mark Taylor is accused of terrorism but he\u2019s innocent. It was his psychic ability and desire to stop the terrorist act that gets him in trouble. He ends up being detained as an American enemy combatant. I read up on the three real American enemy combatants, as well as learned about those in Gitmo. It was pretty intense research. I ended up doing a two book spin-off of that series called CJ Sheridan Thrillers. And I have a post apocalyptic trilogy, Sympatico Syndrome, with two complete, the third being written. There\u2019s a virulent virus that wipes out more than 90% of the population. Fun times! :D I also wrote a stand alone romantic suspense, and a short story collection. ",

The first one is only my second attempt (do not ask me about my 1st attempt) at a novel and its called Venturing Hearts: First Year. It is a romance novel that mainly focuses on the real life struggle of real world love but showing the fun and joy in it. I would describe it as a realistic romance but written in the style of \u201cThe Notebook\u201d. I have asked people to test read it and they described it as \u201cvery optimistic yet realistic\u201d or \u201cit has incredibly lovable characters\u201d or \u201cit has realistic personalities of people we can relate to\u201d My latest one is another romance novel that is inspired by my crush who I shall call Audrey. This one contrast from Venturing hearts as it shows the pain and suff of love. So far its only one chapter and its already getting positive feed back. I call it Broken in 2 Places. Another one I\u2019m proud of is called In The Sky. Its a historical fiction novel surrounding the pilots of world war 2. So far its been praised for its seemingly cinematic writing style. I just have too many books to write about so I\u2019ll leave it there for now. Edit 1 08/09/18: okay\u2026 it went from 25 down to 19, I decided it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea to have that much works all at the same time. ",

Here is one of the reviews of \u201cThe Newsmonger\u2019s Apprentice\u201d:   BOOK REVIEW: The Newsmonger\u2019s Apprentice: The Life and Adventures of a Ghanaian Journalist By Alexander Shapiro From the author\u2019s childhood in rural Northern Ghana through adolescence and young adulthood to his adult working life as a journalist for several decades, his eventual retirement from the Daily Graphic and his unexpected return to robust journalism, The Newsmonger\u2019s Apprentice\u2026The life and Adventures of a Ghanaian Journalist is a tightly-written and fast-paced autobiography narrated in lively, jumpy and delightful prose. George Sydney Abugri is best known as much for his award-grabbing journalism spanning several decades as for the sarcastic wit of his popular satirical column, \u201cLetter to Jomo\u201d, which ran in the Daily Graphic for more than two-and-a-half decades. The Newsmonger\u2019s Apprentice is probably one of the most hilarious autobiographies ever written by an African journalist in recent decades, but it is also a story punctuated with sad narratives that could move you to tears and that threaten albeit unsuccessfully, to subvert the humour in this story of rare courage, perseverance and sheer tenacity of purpose. George Sydney Abugri was born Akudbila Abugri at the village of Zawse near Bawku in Ghana\u2019s Upper East Region. \u201cEveryone walked barefoot and clothes were sometimes washed without soap! Many young adults walked around with phalluses dangling between the thighs, like Adam taking a jog in Eden. Bare breasted women covered the nudity of the lower regions of the anatomy with primitive \u201cthongs\u201d fashioned from plant leaves\u201d, the author recalls of his childhood. It was a childhood that also showed signs of an inquisitive mind as captured in a conversation with his Uncle Akudugu: \u201cUncle\u2026\u201d \u201cYes..?\u201d \u201cIs it true about the ghost? \u201cWhat ghost\u201d \u201cThe ghost which sits under the baobab tree. They say you fought the ghost\u201d \u201cWho told you?\u201d \u201cApisiga and Awini\u201d \u201cSure, I did\u201d \u201cWas the ghost a man or woman?\u201d \u201cA man.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cHe was a man\u201d \u201cWas he a white man?\u2019 \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThey say all ghosts are white\u201d \u201cPale, not white\u2026\u201d Having abandoned his teaching position in the naive hope of finding a job as a reporter once he arrived in Accra, Abugri was sorely disappointed to find on arrival in the capital, that finding a job as a reporter was easier said than done: \u201cI woke early every morning and walked miles around Accra, combing newspaper houses looking for a job as a news reporter. People who travelled to Accra from the north of the country and happened to meet me whispered that I was crazy and I came close to believing it myself, for how could a professionally trained teacher suddenly abandon a fairly well-paying job and live like a tramp in the city, claiming to be hunting for a job as a reporter?\u201d The author devotes a good part of the narrative to subsequent adventures in journalism and takes us through long as well as brief stops at The Rural Observer, The Palaver, The Echo, The Punch, the Daily Graphic and The General Telegraph. The author recounts how he was eventually recruited to work on the investigative weekly, The Punch, as its Northern Ghana correspondent. The author who subsequently moved to the Daily Graphic, also recalls the atmosphere at the Graphic on any given day in the early 1980s: \u201cIn the newsroom of the editorial department, hard-bitten editors and sub-editors of the old school took \u201cwicked\u201d pens to frightened reporters\u2019 hand-written copies with merciless abandon and screamed at erring reporters who had problems getting beyond the lead paragraphs of stories and making any sense. Newsroom tension always peaked as bedtime for the next day\u2019s issue approached, and the closer the time to the afternoon editorial conference, the louder and more menacing the screams, as everyone scurried frantically about like headless chickens trying to beat production deadlines. At any given time, some members of the editorial board tended to be sympathetic to the ruling political party and others to the political opposition. Each side tried to influence the selection of stories in such a way that projected the government and its appointees prominently and positively. There were often very heated arguments over the placement of stories. Physical confrontations at afternoon editorial conferences were not uncommon and occasionally, fists were let fly.\u201d Some of the best chapters of the book include: \u201cI stumble upon the Bone Setters\u201d, \u201cUp close with President Kwame Nkrumah\u201d, \u201cThe arrest of Sidiki Diallo\u201d, \u201cHobnobbing with Uncle Akudugu\u201d, \u201cA Monster Welcomes me to School\u201d, \u201cFrom Punch Weekly to the Daily Graphic\u201d, \u201cThe Palaver and the Echo\u201d, \u201cMeeting President Rawlings\u201d, \u201cComing to Cardiff University\u201d, \u201cA farewell to the Daily Graphic\u201d and \u201cMr. X and the Telegraph newspaper.\u201d The Newsmonger\u2019s Apprentice is a great read. Some chapters of the book contain errors which escaped the notice of proofreaders and which hopefully, will be corrected in future editions. ",

I worked on many in preproduction, production and post production. They were a combination of what you would find on Seinfield, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Catch 22. Never made a lot of money, but got to work in places like Montana, Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and even Florida. I made lifelong friends and a wealth of experience. A present, I am writing, My Life in Low Budget Features: My Experiences Working for Charlie Pierce and Others.

The ideas in my mind are so flesh but the words on laptop are so dumb. Since I write for interest, it is really a torture for me. I hope I can tell you I finally overcome but I don\u2019t.

One of my sons created a website for me and the other helped with book design, photography and marketing. Being a family venture it was fun and saved a lot of money in creation! The books were an overflow of my growing success on Instagram and Facebook. Humour is an interesting niche to be honest. Books like self-development and work are very popular. Humour is less mainstream, surprisingly. When you write a book it\u2019s good to see what your contribution is- most people have said or done something similar before. I wanted to create clean humour where the book is safe to leave in the bathroom- and children won\u2019t see something they have to ask mummy to explain! I recorded a musical album using computer software. That was a fulfilled ambition. Now book writing is similar for me. I\u2019d wanted to create a book called \u2018The Science of Humour\u2019 since I was young. Ask yourself a question: Do I have a book to write, a story to tell, a contribution to make? Do I want to challenge, inform or entertain? My books came out of my beginning to dream again. Perhaps it is time for you to dream too - and who knows what the outcome will be. Anything from a no. 1 bestseller to a legacy for future generations of your family! Best wishes. John ",

Then it was back to writing, revising, deleting, adding content, getting feedback from my content editor, incorporating more feedback and revising some more, then working with a copy editor to make sure the book looked like it was written by an adult human being. I learned a lot through the process. Writing is hard. Writing is daunting, especially when you know that it\u2019s going in a book. I can sit down and pen answers on all manner of topics here, but the minute you know you\u2019re writing a book, you become self-critical. You start doubting yourself. Every sentence you write feels like it could be better. But stressful as the process is, it\u2019s also very rewarding.  The book is coming out on April 10th. It\u2019s my story, the story of the Muslim and illegal immigrant that I was, of the people who lent me a hand along the way, of the atheist and physician that I became, and of a culture and sense of identity lost and found. In short, it\u2019s the story of how I became, more than anything else, an American. Enjoy! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I don't want to bore you telling the long story of how it all started but then I just couldn't help myself. So it all started one fine day. Just like any Indian engineering student, I had a lot of free time which of course I could've used to get good grades but yeah I chose writing partly because I simply loved writing and partly because I could see no point in the former. I took my pen and a notebook\u2026 oops sorry\u2026 I took my laptop and opened word. Now I suddenly realised that I never had a story in the first place. \u2018I need an inspiration\u2019, I thought. Basically I was a lover of suspense and I sadly didn't have the patience to write romance or emotion. I chose Suspense ( NOT horror) . And I thought okay, adults like books but children adore books. So I made up my mind to write the book in such a way that it attracts the young readers too. And then came the part of naming the lead character. Now this is all thanks to my sister who was reading the theory of evolution with full concentration for her Biology exam. Thus Darwin became my lead character. I wanted to make each page create a suspense among the readers. Unfortunately, I realised midway that I'm not good at elaborating things being a first time writer and sadly, my editor was preparing for a tough exam. The novel which was planned became a novella. Nevertheless, the fast pace became a plus point. Now for around 8000 words, my novella named \u201c THE CALL TO RECALL : Memories Matter \u201d is finally published and is available in Amazon Kindle. It's totally free in Amazon Unlimited and a first time writer, I'm totally happy to see it published. The description for the book : As a common man, Darwin had nothing much to say about his life. Having no idea about the past and no goal for the future, he was just like many other people we meet on our way. But then something happened... Was it an accident? Was it unfortunate? But one thing was sure. He found a purpose in his memories and the forgotten past started writing his present for him. The link to get the book : memories matter eBook: K Pavi: Amazon.in: Kindle Store No fake promises. But I'm sure you'll love the book. It's not big but it's simple and elegant in its own style. In case you're starting to become a reader, this book will be really engaging and encourage you to read even more. Try it out friends and don't forget to give it a review. And I'll be thankful all the same for any ideas on how to market the book. And yeah just one more tiny thing, press the upvote button if you liked my answer Happy reading :) -K.Pavi ",

The focus of it is to explore mental illness and drug abuse and the stigma that surrounds them through my poetry. Although the collection is well put together, I\u2019m not entirely happy with it. My second book, The Torturous Tome, is a collection of horror stories. It\u2019s truly my baby; despite some issues, it is the work I am most proud of. I have toiled over it for years, and even though it has sold a pitiful amount of copies, I am so happy that it\u2019s even out in the world. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m actually proud of and that I don\u2019t mind sharing with the world. And I hope it scares your pants off. The book I am currently devoting myself to is a collection of essays. It is a nonfiction book, but not quite a memoir. This has been one of the hardest projects I\u2019ve undertaken because it is so close to my heart\u2014 but I\u2019m still writing. ",

The first novel, \u201cStar Colony: Red Star/White Star\u201d took me a long time and unfortunately being somewhat topical in the science fiction & politics vein managed to be dated before I published on Amazon KDP. (Hillary failed to get elected.) The Novella/short story was submitted to the Writers of the Future contest under the title \u201cTilt!\u201d and received an honorable mention, but was not chosen for publication. It is available on Amazon under the title \u201cPurple Adaromskov\u201d. My second novel was \u201cThe Future Rhymes\u201d, also published on Amazon KDP and is also available in paperback. It came together nicely and is the first of three books in my projected \u201cJayn Galt Saga\u201d series. I am currently about half finished with Book 2: \u201cThe Emperor of Mars\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Most of us face confusions in life. There are some critical questions which no one answers. No textbook resolves these queries. Why is life unfair? Why only me? How to find my passion? Why do I feel jealous of others? Love or career? What to do when I feel low? How to develop habits? Should I work hard or smart? How to deal with unemployment? How to stay calm in tough circumstances? And the endless list continues.  The book \u2018Big Doubts Simple Solutions\u2019 which is my third book, is an answer to many such queries. It brings clarity on these issues with the help of interesting analogies, anecdotes, stories, experiences, and thoughts. The aim is to bring more clarity in life, facilitate decision making and help people in finding happiness and simultaneously to keep the readers engaged. The concept of this book is a suggestion from many of my readers who messaged me that they want a book which can answer their critical queries in life, with the simplest of stories.  I would also like to add that in no way I want to persuade people to buy my book, I only wrote it because many people motivate me to write books and I enjoy writing, you can avoid the book and keep reading my answers, I would be happier. (This goes for my other books as well) Front page of the book-  Index-   For those who have been asking, this is an E-book. The paperback will be published after the lockdown is over. Thanks for reading. Edit- Writing again as the previous answer was deleted. Image source- My phone. ",

The other is based on my TEDx talk and made it to #1 spot on the Amazon India\u2019s \u2018Hottest new releases\u2019 and #35 on the best seller list in \u2018personal development\u2019 category. Both books are kept lesser than 100 pages so that the focus is less on reading, and more on doing! :) STOP LYING START MOVING: How to stop lying to yourself and start fulfilling your dreams  This book is based on my first TEDx talk. It is based on the premise that most of us have already read a lot of books, motivational articles and quotes - but still cannot get around to doing anything significant. Somewhere we are lying to ourselves and are not aware of it. So rather than more steps, strategies and techniques - the book focuses on asking ourselves questions, increasing our self awareness and revealing these lies. Once the lies are exposed, moving forward becomes inevitable.  PUBLIC SPEAKING BOOT CAMP: A practical guide to delivering talks with substance, clarity & confidence  This was written long ago and then I decided to publish it as an ebook. While most public speaking book are 200+ pages long and focus more on style, anecdotes, jokes, charisma, humor, practice, stage presence - this book focuses on one and one thing only: AUTHENTICITY. I really believe that if we authentically want to share something worth while with our audience - connection follows. With or without jokes, charisma, fluent english or the best accent. And connection is 90% of the aim. Enough for our usual scenarios like classrooms, business presentations etc. So the aim is to keep it simple and limited to the bare minimum rather than overwhelming the reader with hundreds of things that he really does not need.

The subpar (by my own standards anyway) quality of the writing actually serves a purpose in terms of capturing the feeling of humanity which quickly gets discarded. I have written a sequel which I am in the process of editing and I\u2019m working on a third volume which I am on the first chapter of. The third volume is where the main story beat actually kicks in, so I\u2019m excited for it. In the unlikely event that anyone is interested, drop a comment. I can put a sale on the first volume for a short period of time. I wanted to make it free, but Amazon is mean and won\u2019t let me. ",

It wouldn\u2019t appeal to everyone as it\u2019s about a WW2 RAF crew who were killed on their last raid in 1945 and are reincarnated in the present day to fight the resurgent Nazis one last time. I\u2019ve also written a couple of detective type thrillers. I was put off writing for years by the thought of spending hours sitting down writing but eventually evolved a method that seems very easy. I never intend spending long at any one time actually writing. Twenty minutes and sometimes a lot less is the aim and sometimes I only do a couple of sentences but it must be done every single day. This is not difficult and the session often morphs into a longer period as you get into the flow. Also, the simple act of writing every day keeps the book fresh in your mind and then you\u2019re thinking about the plot etc quite a lot, while walking, driving etc. It\u2019s surprising how much this \u2018little and often\u2019 approach can achieve.

Historic fiction with elements of magical realism, book four of seven, Sword of the Taka Samurai series, Yamabuki and Tomoe. Historic manuscripts says they were at least friends, if not more. They are about a woman samurai, Yamabuki, who is recorded in ancient Japanese annals. She appears in historic Noh drama, woodblock sketches, and in modern film as a character. I have cast her as the only surviving child of a warlord from the southernmost province of the the southernmost of the four great Japanese Isles who at 17 years of age rides out, solo, on what in the West is called knight errantry. Some want to see her rise to be the next warlord. Other see such a path as Quixotic folly and urge she be married off to forge an alliance of royal houses and there are arguments for both of these views. The books pay homage to chanbara and are classified as jidaigeki\u2014the historic costume drama\u2014the best know director of these is Kurosawa with films like Seven Samurai. The books are historically researched with elements of magical realism with a glossary and maps. The books page link appears below: Books by Katherine M. Lawrence ",

Writing a book is no easy task, there are a 1000 and one things you need to address apart from the actual writing, all of which take a lot of time, effort and money. I would go as far as to say if you write a book for purely monetary gain it is a very poor return on investment. Would I recommend it, yes I would, as long as you know what you are letting yourself in for. I have considering writing another book about depression. Not a book that tells someone how to deal with it, rather something that they can give to family and friends that don\u2019t believe they have it (or worse, faking it) to clear up misunderstanding around this distressing issue.
