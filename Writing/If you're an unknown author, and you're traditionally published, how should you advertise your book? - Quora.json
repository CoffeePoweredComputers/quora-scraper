            "answer_text": "You should advertise in any way that gets the word out about your book. You are the primary in promoting your book. You are the head elf. There is nothing wrong with you going to independent bookstores, introducing yourself, and ask of they are carrying your book. If not, would they? There is no shame in this. This is exactly what sales and marketing people do. And the fact that you are a local author, the independents might be ever more interested because that\u2019s good PR for them to have a local author have a signing event. Libraries are also very good to hit! They love local authors. They also love having local authors come in to do a reading and signing event. Yes, you are allowed to sell books at these events. Unless the library has rules against it. Then there is nothing wrong with you having a box of books in the back of your car and selling them there. Talk to your local paper. They might like to put a local interest story about the local author who has been published. You will get a bunch of sales out of that because locals will want to read your book. Any burst in sales, no matter how small, will increase the visibility of your book on the sales rankings list and pushes your book ever closer to the bestsellers lists. When you are out in the public as \u201cThe Author,\u201d be the best possible, most gracious, and humble version of yourself. When talking with a fan, you give them your full attention. Remember that this person is the most important person in the world to you. It is the people who buy your book that are important, because they are the ones who give you money. It is each reader who has bought your book that is the one that bumps up your book in the sales rankings. Not the publisher. For a fan, the opportunity to meet you might be a once-in-a-lifetime event. Don\u2019t f\u2022\u2022k it up for them. ",

            "answer_text": "It was a long time ago, but I WAS an unknown author who was traditionally published. What that bought you was a place in the publisher\u2019s catalog that got sent to retailers. (This was before e-formats.) Whether the representative who might or might call at some big accounts would even know about your book, much less mention it, was unlikely unless you were a celebrity or a Blockbuster. MAYBE you got a PR kit and some free copies to send for reviews in your local weekly neighborhood throw-away. Pretty much, unless your publishing house was totally behind you and willing to spend a lot of money on advertising, tours, and really PUSH you (see: celebrity; Blockbuster) you were on your own. Just like now, except if you are mid-list \u2014 which used to be their bread and butter \u2014 or new, right now you\u2019re not going to get \u201ctraditionally published\u201d at all. Mystery and SF/Fantasy had magazines that you could try to work with short stories, novelettes and novellas, but I don\u2019t recall publishers helping with that. ",
