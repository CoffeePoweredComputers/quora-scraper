            "answer_text": "There are a lot of things that do so, but let\u2019s look at some: Write what you love. When I read a fanfiction, I want the passion the writer has for her fandom, the love he has for the characters and their world. If that shines through I can forgive a lot of flaws in the writing.Know the canon. If you are not familiar with the original source material, then you need to make yourself familiar with it before you write it. If the summary tells me the writer has never read/watched/listened to the source, I won\u2019t bother with it.Do not make your characters OOC (Out-of-character) unless there is a very good reason for it, preferably one that fits the canon. (For example, there is a reason that \u201clove spores\u201d are popular in Star Trek fanfiction\u2014they existed in the original source.) Otherwise, you should make your character fit as closely into canon as possible.I will not say \u201cdon\u2019t write about original characters\u201d. I will say that you should make your original characters in character for the world you have put them in. If you should choose to feature OCs from a world other than the setting, they have to learn to adapt. A character should have a reason for existing in the story.Pay attention to the technical things. Run your work through the spellchecker. Check the grammar and punctuation. Pay attention to things like line breaks, so the reader isn\u2019t looking at a \u201cwall of text\u201d. Some readers are less patient than others with flaws in these things.Consider the readers you are hoping to attract. If you write M or X rated stories, you have a good idea of what they want. There are people who only want to read family-friendly fluff, and if those are the readers you want, it is likely that\u2019s the sort of fic you like, so go for it. Maybe your favorite sub-genre of fanfic is hurt/comfort; it\u2019s also the favorite of many others. I have found that if you have a friend in the fandom who likes many of the same tropes you do, write a gift fic for that friend and it is likely to become one of your most popular stories.Get a beta. Seriously, it\u2019s the best thing to do. A friend can do it, but only if it is the type of friend who has the knowledge to find the flaws in your work and will be brutally honest when necessary. If all your friends do is to squee at everything you write, and tell you it\u2019s perfect, then check and see if the archive where you post has a list of betas.Don\u2019t be afraid to do the research. The internet makes it possible for you to check out a story\u2019s details. You can easily find out the distance between Point A and Point B, or what kind of clothes were worn or what tech was used back in whatever year it is set in. Not doing it will make people call you out in reviews.Always be open to new ideas. If you can, take part in challenges and prompt-fests. Sometimes my best and most popular stories have been because a prompt pushed me to stretch my boundaries beyond my usual comforts zone.Once more, love your stories. Re-read them. Read the comments about them, and take constructive criticism in mind. You don\u2019t really need to ret-con a story, but use it to make your next story better.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve just started reading fan fiction on Wattpad, (until now I\u2019ve only used Ao3 because I just love it so much), and I noticed how most of the fics I have read so far have the same or similar mistakes. There are fics like that on Ao3, but not nearly this many. Anyway, I decided to answer this question by addressing those issues. (I don\u2019t read fics with OCs as main characters. I\u2019m reading fan fiction, not a book. I want the characters I already love. Nothing against people who write it well or like it, I just don\u2019t.) This is more like a list of things to remember when you\u2019re writing fan fiction but whatever. It\u2019s okay to just use the character\u2019s name or pronoun, don\u2019t constantly go into that whole, \u201cthe younger man,\u201d or, \u201cthe taller boy,\u201d business. It gets really annoying. There\u2019s nothing wrong with repeating he, she, they, or just their name. I know it may feel repetitive when you\u2019re writing it, (it has for me), but in the long run, it will be much better. Only use descriptions when they fit into the story, don\u2019t just randomly throw them in when you think you\u2019ve used names or pronouns too many times.Show don\u2019t tell. I hate to say it, because it makes me feel like an annoying English teacher, but it\u2019s actually really important. Rather than saying something like, \u201cshe was angry,\u201d describe her body language, anger: clenched fists, grinding teeth, white knuckles, red face, etc. It makes the story much more compelling and overall just a better read.Space out your writing. No one wants to read a 20-line-long block of writing, you have to separate your writing so it doesn\u2019t look like terms and conditions and then people will have a much easier time reading it.Start a new line or paragraph after dialogue. Please do not ever put the dialogue of multiple characters into the same paragraph. The only time when this could be okay is if they were twins or something and they finished each other\u2019s sentences, but otherwise just don\u2019t.Keep the characters in character. I hate reading a fan fic when the author just decided to change a character completely. If you\u2019re writing about a character who never cries or shows emotion in canon, please don\u2019t have them bawling their eyes out and screaming every gosh darn second. It\u2019s okay if there\u2019s a specific reason for it (eg: trauma, Stockholm syndrome, something normal, etc.) But otherwise don\u2019t.Edit and proof read. I\u2019m obsessed with words, I\u2019m obsessed with grammar and spelling and I do make mistakes sometimes, but that\u2019s because my brain edits the words I see, so sometimes I don\u2019t even notice when I\u2019ve accidentally missed a letter, but, no matter what, I always try. There\u2019s nothing worse for me then reading a fic that changes tense or uses the wrong, \u201cyour.\u201d If you have trouble with this, read your work out loud to yourself and it'll be much easier to notice. (I select the text and use the speak feature, because it\u2019s easier for me that way.)Stay consistent. I never want to read something like, \u201cI always wanted a sister,\u201d only to see, \u201cthis is my little sister,\u201d a few paragraphs later. I also hate it when someone suddenly changes their opinion or feelings on something with no apparent reason.Stop random overreactions. I read a fic that about once every paragraph there was a \u201che screamed,\u201d or a, \u201che cried,\u201d when nothing at all warranted any of this.If you\u2019re using a thesaurus, don\u2019t make it obvious. Okay, there\u2019s no shame in using a thesaurus, I love a good word, and if you need a thesaurus to find one, that\u2019s great because you\u2019re just adding to your vocabulary. But I don\u2019t want to be able to see it. Particularly if you\u2019re looking for different words for \u201csaid.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be seeing any, \u201che vocalised,\u201d or, \u201cthey defended,\u201d or, \u201cshe interjected,\u201d because, honestly, that sounds incredibly stupid.Don\u2019t phonetically write out dialogue. I will not read, \u201cey dere \u2018Arry what\u2019re ya doin\u2019 terday?\u201d Just spell it properly and trust me to do the accent in my head. Writing like that makes it extremely annoying to read.Other tips: Please have some kind of substance in your work.There has to be some kind of problem or conflict. I know some people are just writing smut or whatever, but there should still be a climax, (pun intended.) I read a fic the other day that had no conflict, no problem, no climax, and literally nothing happened and I just felt disappointed that I ever read it. Use language features.Use similes, metaphors, personification, etc. I know it\u2019s not a book, but it\u2019s nice when people put in the effort. Keep your emotions at a realistic pace.I really hate it when a character is immediately obsessed and in love with another character after just, like, seeing them across the hallway. Please do not do this. This is part of the overreacting I was talking about. Get the historical or cultural feel right.If you\u2019re story is based in 1957 and the main characters are gay or something, it wouldn\u2019t be okay with everyone, it would probably be awkward, and there would probably be a lot of internal, or external, homophobia from one of the gay characters or something like that. That\u2019s just an example but it\u2019s the same for how POC or women were treated before. The same goes for location, if you\u2019re American and your writing a Harry Potter fic, I don\u2019t want to see any \u201ctrash cans,\u201d or \u201cmoms,\u201d when there should be, \u201crubbish bins,\u201d and \u201cmums,\u201d because it\u2019s really annoying. Keep your dialogue natural.Don\u2019t repeat names all the time, this looks gross: \u201cHey Carol, what do you think of this?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great, Deborah.\u201d \u201cThanks, Carol.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s alright, Deborah.\u201d Also remember that people interrupt each other, and make mistakes, and no one talks perfectly. People say stuff, \u201cyou know,\u201d and, \u201clike,\u201d quite a lot. People also say stuff like, \u201cme and James,\u201d instead of, \u201cJames and I,\u201d or use \u201cwho,\u201d when they should use \u201cwhom,\u201d or say, \u201cI feel bad,\u201d when it should be, \u201cI feel badly,\u201d but just make sure it fits the character. And if you\u2019re having trouble with the word \u201csaid,\u201d (which is a very common problem), just get rid of it all together. You just need the first one and then you can just structure the conversation in single lines dialogue, as long as it\u2019s clear who is speaking. Like this excellent example: \u201cHey Sam, I am now speaking to you,\u201d said Steve. \u201cYes, you are speaking to me.\u201d See, no need for any he replied or he exclaimed. It\u2019s all good. Dont put random shit in places it doesn\u2019t belong.I was reading a fic the other day about the Beatles playing truth or dare. George, Paul and Ringo went into a different room and came back with, a wedding dress, a diamond necklace and high heels. Does this make any sense? No. Was this ever explained at all? No. Don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s terrible. Do some research.If theres a topic topic in your fic that you don\u2019t know much, or anything, about, either avoid it or find out more so it can be accurate. It\u2019s not hard to just type a few words into google and read and read a few articles. You\u2019re already on the internet. If someone in a fic says something like, \u201chis leg smells like grapes, that means it\u2019s infected,\u201d that better be true because if I ever get burnt and it starts smelling like grapes I will know it\u2019s infected.  Edit: another one I recently thought of: Stress the right words.I recently read a Frostiron fic and it was very good other than the fact that the author stressed the wrong words. Stressing means using italics on a certain word so we know to pronounce it more loudly, clearly and slowly. It makes the point of the sentence clear. For example: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Shows that the most important thing is that this particular person is here. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Shows that the most important thing is that they\u2019re in this particular place. So if you want to get a specific point across you need to make sure you stress the right word. Obviously, most sentences don\u2019t have any stressed words, but when you do use them, make sure you do it right. (Another Edit: Apparently I forgot the word \u201cemphasis\u201d when I wrote that.)
