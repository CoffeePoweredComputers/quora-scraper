Your greeting sets the tone for your letter or email message. Try not to be tempted to begin your professional letter with informal salutations like \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGreetings,\u201d \u201cHi There,\u201d or \u201cGood Morning\u201d if you don\u2019t know the name of your contact person. While those informal styles of greeting are fine for casual emails to friends or even for more formal emails you might send out to groups of people, in a professional letter you\u2019ll need to use a personal salutation, one with either a first and/or last name (\u201cDear Mr. Doe\u201d) or a job title (\u201cDear Hiring Manager\u201d).
