            "answer_text": "I think the only way to avoid having it dry up is to use it frequently. They are pretty much like regular inkjet printers in that sense. Ink tanks may be a bit less expensive than ink cartridge printers, but I will take a laser printer any day. I have never had toner \u201cgo bad\u201d on me. Other than very special high end art printers, and photo printing, I don\u2019t see why inkjet printers are in use AT ALL anymore. Producing the ink is a great money maker for the companies, but laser printing is cheaper in the long run for consumers. (I guess that is the real answer. Most people don\u2019t think more than 2 weeks out.) ",

If you do use your printer but the tank cap/seal is damaged or not seated well, it can also dry up over time. i am dealing with this issue right now, and it\u2019s not a fun clean up. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, definitely. They will dry for sure over time. But this driying time is much more slower tgan a normal traditional inkjet cartridges due to the amount of ink present in the tank. So, it is always advisable to keep the tank as air tight as possible when not in use to avoid drying up. ",
