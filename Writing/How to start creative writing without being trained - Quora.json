            "answer_text": "Buy some Nikis and Just Do It. Write. Writing takes practice. Write every day. Even if you can only write for 10 minutes, write every day. Read. Read different authors. Notice different styles of writing. Determine what you like that you\u2019d like to incorporate into your writing. Join. Look for writing groups to join. Do this before you try to publish. (You will be glad you did.) A writing group will give you outside perspective and support and provide accountability if you need it. They are available online. Three free ones you might try are: Absolute Water Cooler, Agent Query Connect, and Critique Circle. Look for mentors. You might find them in your writing community or at a conference. Writers tend to be generous in helping others. Ask for help. Don\u2019t give up. The road to publishing (if you don\u2019t self-publish) can be a long one. But, you can learn a lot along it. But, most importantly: Write\u2026just do it! I hope this helps. ~ Kay ",

            "answer_text": "Creative writing is a flair - it is partly inherent. You build your writing skill upon your base writing style, then begin to modify, re-phrase, start swapping vocabulary, words, phrases etc. As you feel more confident, you begin to experiment with different starting sentences, and get bolder and feel inspired as you continue to write. Soon, you will build a flow. The more you write, the more confident you get, and the more imaginative you become. You begin to want to describe a certain thing, event or scenario in a more artistic and fluid manner. You begin to be more expressive and start searching for the right words to describe those feelings. You begin to want your reader to feel you through the power of your words. It helps to read a lot - anything decent - novels, photo-journals, glam and lifestyle magazines, so long as they are properly edited publications. Visualise the scene, then start writing! Self-help books or tutorials offer you broad-based guidelines and tips, but you\u2019ve got to grow your own style. Only after that can you begin to emulate other writers\u2019 approach. Your style may appear similar to some other\u2019s, but it is still your DNA. ",

            "answer_text": "Just begin looking up short writing prompts and start writing! Once you get used to writing with prompts, start formulating your own prompts or full plots. The great thing about creative writing is that there isn\u2019t a whole lot of rules behind it, other than grammatical if you\u2019re wanting to get published one day. if you\u2019re wanting to write a novel, there\u2019s no one telling you that you have to start at the beginning or you have to include certain things. Personally, I like writing the ending of my story first, then writing the rest. You don\u2019t need training to be a successful creative writer! You just need your ideas and a writing tool. ",
