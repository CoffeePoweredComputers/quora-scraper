It\u2019s great when writing a letter, you can centralise the written content, position the address content left or right. I bet you\u2019re thinking what is he talking about I know it\u2019s late and he\u2019s probably drinking some booze when writing this. Well Microsoft\u2019s WORD practically fixes most all you need to optimise your HTML, CSS and JavaScripts, something I thought up, simple.

Whenever it sees an empty space on your HTML page it stops looking at it and sees nothing, carries on and sees more white space and keeps stopping. \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udfff  Once white space has been removed, Optimise all and I mean all your images then test your scoring.
