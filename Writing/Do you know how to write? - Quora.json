Writing is where I find that the right type of words can really grab the writer attention I strongly believe that the right type of words or writing it should flow, or have flow a person should be able to visualize without struggle a sheep in the pasture sure it works fine, but What about A blood thirsty coyote stealthily watches the sheep as it lazily grazes unaware of it natural habitat uncaring of what watches a few meters away\u2026. another thing about writing is punctuation and spelling nothing can hurt a person more then checking basic grammar and spelling commas and periods. where the should be and capitalization when to capitalize for example bridge is bridge but The Brooklyn Bridge well that is all I know about writing ha ha and writing is art!

Illiterate people can write. And so on. But to be more specific, yes, I can write. As a lawyer I've had to churn out countless pages of work. Further, as a freelance writer, I've had to work on business articles, fiction, alongside other type of writing for clients. So, yes, I can write.
