            "answer_text": "Some poetry is a high art but a lot is not; just because someone writes a poem doesn\u2019t make it high art, it\u2019s the same in all art. The poetry that is considered high art is considered so because it can convey an interweaving of complex concepts and feelings and internal images with a supreme economy of words. Unlike prose, poetry is an attempt to convey the most meaning with the least amount of words! This takes a lot of skill just like any high art forms. Poets know the power of words and play with the interactions of words, their sounds, their possible multiple meanings, associations and images in our minds. Poetry is mainly to be spoken, to be heard and the human mind finds pleasure in this interweaving and the flow of sounds, words and images that are triggers to insights and catharsis in the mind/body of the listener. Good poetry is very pleasurable for intelligent people! johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com ",

            "answer_text": "I agree with John\u2019s answer to a great degree. In the cases that poetry is high art, it is because of its concision and the precision of its words. However, it is also due to the fact that poetry, like metaphor, uses the linear form of words to give us image - and not only image, but music. When we hear a good poem read aloud, we not only envision something, we hear the musical sounded-out rhythmical combination of the words. It is not-quite-music, but verges on that experience, and in some instances, indeed becomes it. Good poetry is a sensual pleasure, and for those of us who love it, very close to the experience of eating chocolate truffles\u2026\u2026 slowly. Thanks Edward, for the compliment of the A2A. ",
