            "answer_text": "WHEN AND WHEN NOT TO APOLOGIZE? Sometimes apologies are appropriate. Sometimes an apology must be followed by some form of compensation and/or a promise not to do something again, especially if there is physical damage or you have done something very bad or very wrong. You should apologize IF\u2013 you make an unintentional mistake, behave badly, offend someone who unintentionally made a mistake or did something wrong, offend someone with harsh criticism, insults, put downs, name calling, humiliation, or ridicule, don\u2019t fulfill a promise, don't fulfill a responsibility, are late for an appointment, damage someone\u2019s personal property, miss a deadline, provide incorrect or incomplete information, unintentionally bump into someone, show up in casual attire to a formal occasion, miss an appointment, and fail to include someone or inform them. There are many other situations where you may feel like apologizing but it is really not necessary. You don\u2019t have to apologize IF- You are promoting yourself in some project and need support from others whom you have to ask for minimal help. Someone is physically in your way and you have to ask them to move. You are doing your job or asking others to do theirs. You have different opinions and beliefs than others. You are dressed casually and look casual for ordinary events. You cancel plans with proper notice. You are appropriately emotional and not too emotional for a given situation or circumstance. You nag since what has to be done is not getting done and force and reasoning is not an option. You interrupt or try to change the subject during a monopolizing or very trivial meeting or conversation. You don\u2019t promptly respond to mundane communications because you are busy or have more important things to do. You ask someone to stop doing something incredibly annoying. You are asking for help or a small favor. You are asking for a raise. You are asking questions which are not very personal to acquaintances. You are not perfect since no one is. Your lifestyle is different from the norm. ",

            "answer_text": "DISCLAIMER: This is just my opinion based on what I\u2019ve learned about human behavior & interacting with people. What I am stating in my post may have been said in other answers already. I think people should apologize for the following: Whether the individual in question realizes they hurt another individual (i.e., physically, emotionally, mentally) upon accident.Apologizing for something that is misunderstood by another party, whether that be a general statement or comment said to another individual.What one should NOT apologize for: Apologizing for something clearly not done wrong and is obvious to all parties (i.e., apologizing when there is nothing apologize for, apologizing for intentional silences in a conversation)Apologizing for an action clearly done by another individual meant to cause harm, whether that is emotional, physical, or mental.I may not have covered everything in my post, but these are just a few reasons why apologizing is and isn't appropriate. In the end, it is very dependent on the individual\u2019s upbringing and current personality, as well as situational what an individual or individuals in question would be apologizing for. Therefore, it is dependent on one's culture, emotional maturity and other factors. ",
