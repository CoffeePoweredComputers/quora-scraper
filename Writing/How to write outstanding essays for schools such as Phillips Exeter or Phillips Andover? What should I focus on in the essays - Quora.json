We see something demonstrated before us, we see how to do it and try it for ourselves. With this in mind, if you want to learn how to write excellent essays, then you should read some excellent essays. Then, you have to practice writing essays. It is going to take a few before you begin to create essays that are up to snuff and reflect something of your own style. And keep in mind, anything you write will need to be edited. Don\u2019t just hand in the first thing that you write. Read it over and try to find any mistakes. Hand it to a teacher at school and ask if they would check it for you. Once you have found those mistakes, fix them. ",

My personal view is: Tell them who you are.Tell them what you've done.Then tell them what you hope to accomplish with your life.Tell them what you believe you have to offer them.Keep it simple, honest and personal.  Honesty trumps most of the attempts to be \"outstanding.\" Simplicity stands out in this age of overload. ",
