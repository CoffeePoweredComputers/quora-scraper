            "answer_text": "First and foremost cooking is a skill. Cooking can be equated with artisanal craftworks like carpentering, wood carving, blacksmithing, sculpting. Like all of these things mentioned you do not need an extraordinary amount of talent to make a half decent chair, a sharp knife or even grill a steak to the perfect doneness. But a skill can be elevated to the level of art and expertise by talented artisans. The most expensive woodworks are done my master wood workers or the sculptures carved by Michelangelo, Donatello or Berini surpass all other lesser known Renaissance sculptors because their skill has transcended the ordinary and their talent has elevated their skill to the level of genius. In similar fashion cooking is a skill that can be learned by most people, but talented cooks can transcend the normal and elevate cooking to a level where you pay the price for the a creation of a memory, a memory you can always harken back to whenever you think of it. Talented cooks create memories for the guest. ",

They\u2019re the ones that\u2019s fine-tuning the recipes, making new creation; getting high of the pleasure the consumers get from their dining, for family or business). American society tries to force you to be talent for holidays such as Thanksgiving, and I'm sure most have tasted, the talentless it is very difficult to fake good cooking because of the palette, unique and some better than others. with no talent one would you'd have to have the most precise recipe and hope for the best (think something like Blue Apron) ",
