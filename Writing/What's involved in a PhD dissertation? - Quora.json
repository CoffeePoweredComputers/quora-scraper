            "answer_text": "The PhD dissertation is the culmination of an academic journey; it needs to reflect this. The school will have a guide to be followed, but basically you will select a topic, and get it approved. The methods used will need to be approved by your institution\u2019s review board (IRB). In most schools, you will do a one page informal paper that reflects your idea, get the idea as a whole approved, and then write maybe a five page prospectus. Once it is approved the proposal is made, which consists of the first chapter of the thesis itself, the literature review, and the methodology. These are written in the future tense. Once this is approved (and you\u2019ll probably have several edits first), you begin the \u2018real\u2019 work. You do the actual research, then write the results, findings, discussion, and conclusions (a total of 3\u20134 more chapters depending on the university). Expect multiple reviews and edits \u2014 some schools now want a chapter at a time, that must be approved before going on. Finally it is all approved, published, and done! ",
