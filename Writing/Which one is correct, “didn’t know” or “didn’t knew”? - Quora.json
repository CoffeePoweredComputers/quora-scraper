            "answer_text": "Didn't know = did not know Didn\u2019t know is the right and proper form. This is equivalent to knew not.In contrast - Didn't knew = did not knew (This is double past)It is an incorrect form. Did already makes the verb past, so it is not necessary to change the form of know.Additionally - What is the function of \u201cdid\u201d here? Why not just say know or knew without the \u201cdid\u201d? Use of \u201cdid\u201d is expressing a feeling of extreme bitterness, sadness, strong emphasis, or other emotion.It is not so well marked when used in the negative, however.Examples: (Positive). Take note that \u201cdid\u201d provides some emphasis. Oh, I did know, but thanks to that accident, it's all forgotten now.Yes, I did know that you called me, but after all that you had done to me, I decided not to call you back.I did know! I swear to you, I did! I sent you a note afterwards!Examples: (Negative). The emphasis is not so well-marked. Oh, I didn\u2019t know, but thanks to that accident just the same, it's all forgotten now.No, I didn\u2019t know that you called me, but after all that you had done to me, I might decide not to call you back.I didn\u2019t know! I swear to you, I didn't! If I did, I could have sent you a note afterwards!",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDidn\u2019t know\u201d is correct because \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d already makes the verb in the past, so there is no point in making the statement a double verb. Since both \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d and \u201cknew\u201d are both past, it\u2019s incorrect. So, that means that the correct answer is \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d. You clicked this question because you probably didn\u2019t know that, so do me a favor and give me an upvote :) ",
