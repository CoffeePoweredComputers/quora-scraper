            "answer_text": "Don't go about it trying to make yourself sound totally awesome. Hopefully that'll just happen. Write about things that you have actually done. Have you done any volunteering? Write about that.You don't have to make youself sound like a saint but just write about what you did. When they ask questions like \"explain a time where you had to resolve a problem\", it does not have to have been an amazingly hard thing you concurred. Even if it's just a way you had to reframe the problem, it's a good thing to write about. I'm not sure how helpful that was but just take it each question at a time. If you're not the kind of person to make a big deal about yourself then just look at each question as a separate question about something you have done or accomplished, not necessarily about how great you are.  Goodluck!!! ",
