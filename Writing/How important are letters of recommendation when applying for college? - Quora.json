            "answer_text": "As a high school student seeking admission to an undergraduate program, the letter of recommendation helps the admission staff in the context of classroom. How exactly did you get that A? Are you always prepared for class? Do you contribute meaningful comments and questions during group discussion? Do you work well as a team member or do you do everything on your own?  How do you compare with other students that the teacher has taught? How do you react to challenges? Are there any other  factors that affected your performance in the classroom?  The teacher's recommendation gives the college/ university information as to the type of student you are and can help set you apart from the hundreds of other applicants with similar GPA's and extracurriculars. Ideally , it reinforces the strength of the rest of your application and tips it in your favor.  I' ve read hundreds of recommendations written by teachers for students and the best, by far, do exactly that. The worst ones only reiterate things that can be found in the rest of the application without elaborating. A good letter of recommendation can only help make your case for admission.  ",

            "answer_text": "Usually between important and very important.  In the game of Loretta B DeLoggio's post in Your Academic Evidence, recommendations are used in the discretionary range, but that can be a lot of files. As Yale Law School indicates in this article on law school admissions, Serendipity! on Law School Admissions, about 50 files are presumptive admits, while 1,000 are discretionary.  (Depending on the year, 2,000 to 4,000 are presumptive denies.)  For those lucky thousand, of whom about 200 will be offered seats, an awesome recommendation can overcome the less-than-perfect numbers that made this applicant \"discretionary\" in the first place, and damning with faint praise can get you eliminated. This is law school data, but Yale is Yale, MIT is MIT, and the  process will be just as competitive at any school that receives 20 applications for every seat. ",
