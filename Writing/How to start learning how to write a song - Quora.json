            "answer_text": "I like to have students try this excersise. It will always sound good, to some degree anyway. Some knowledge of harmony is usually helpful, but I'll explain in a way where a total beginner can hopefully do it too. I will describe it from a guitarists perspective. Choose a key (tonic, tonal center). If your unfamiliar with these terms, just choose your favorite chord to start and end on. The most common chord progression ever is I-IV-V-vi. Most songs use these chords in various orders, that is, if you put the letters in order from your tonic, the first, fourth, fifth and sixth chords will be used. For example, if I pick the key of G, I order them like: G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The first, fourth and fifth are G, C, D and they will all be major, the sixth is E, the sixth will be minor. (Knowing key signatures is helpful to understand this, but for now take my word for it.) once you have your pallet of chords, decide how many measures you want to work with. Usually symmetrical or even numbers is best, choose 16 bars over 13, or even work with 4 at a time. Draw out your empty measures. Next choose a time signature. Do you want : 3 beats in a measure, or 4? If you're just starting out, go with 4/4, the most common and simple. Now write the name of the tonic chord (the first one you chose) in the first and last measure. All you must do now is fill in the blanks. Choose a chord for each measure. Don't overthink it- this is just a way to get the thinking juices flowing, you can always adjust later if you don't like something. Choose a chord from your palette of 4 for each measure. This can be done without even holding an instrument! Any order you make of the I, IV, V and vi chords will sound good, and will sound like every song ever! Once you've filled in a chord to each measure, choose a rhythm that will serve as a strum pattern. You can change it from measure to measure, or keep it the same throughout. You can use any rhythm that will fill up a whole 4 beats. (A whole note, two halves, 4 quarters, 8 eighths, or some combination of values). now you've just gotta play what you wrote! Grab your guitar and play your progression and strum. You just made a song! Now as for lyrics, keep a notebook close to you and jot down anything that crosses your mind. Something will come. Even write down words in a stream of consciousness way, you may create a clever nugget in there! Play your chord progression many times, see if it reminds you of anything- a feeling, memory, person, place etc. it may help you think of what the song could be about, and get some lyrics. Two ways to create melodies: pay the song a bunch and see if a melody writes itself. Hum with it, see what sounds good.2. Record yourself playing the chords, and try to use a corresponding scale to write a solo or melody. If you chose key of G, use a G scale and mix up the notes a bit until you've created a riff or hook of some sort.(I don't know how to stop the numbers from the list from popping up! Technology is not my strength)I hope this helps give you some ideas, have fun!",

            "answer_text": "Is there any particular kind of song you\u2019re wanting to write genre wise? Do you want to write the whole song or just lyrics, or just the music? Those would be some good questions to ask yourself when looking for direction. Something else would be to listen! and I mean listen closely. The music you gravitate toward, what is it that draws you to it? What really stands out in your favorite songs? is it the beat? is it the lyrics? is it the music? is there a feeling or a vibe generated by this music or song? How do you emulate it? If you\u2019re after lyrics, then put yourself in the shoes of a given situation. Life is all around you, and shitty situations are at your fingertips with aid of a computer or remote control. With a good imagination and some information you can be anyone from a migrant worker to a homeless kid living under the subways of NYC. You can be an underdog quarterback heading to his first Super bowl, you can be a veteran quarterback playing in his last. Lyrically your imagination is the factor. Musically 3 chords and the truth is sometimes all you need, I would suggest a good moving beat to enhance it. You can write a song about nothing, but if you can get people to move to it, then you\u2019ve accomplished something! Good Luck! Robert ",
