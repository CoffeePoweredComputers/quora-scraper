            "answer_text": " Children of men. It's plot is in a near future, in London, and tells a story of a world were, for an unknown reason, people can't breed anymore. It's fiction, but it strikes a chord in me because it looks very real and close to reality for several reasons. The movie shows the deep depression caused by the fact that in a few years, we will all be old people that will be dying slowly, leaving nobody to take our place. It shows people trying to live a normal life, but a meaningless life because anything we do in life will be lost and forgotten for ever. Under this scenario, nothing makes sense. There are quotidian scenes like men with suitcases staring at trains and throwing themselves to the rails, and all this look like normal things that happen all the time. Besides, the world's societies have collapsed and anarchy is breaking havoc everywhere except in the UK, that manages somehow to stablish peace and some security to its citizens. However, this is what makes it the promised land for hundreds of thousands of refugees that flee their collapsed societies (sounds familiar?). There are serious problems however, like terrorism, represented with raw realism. The main character is seen in a a scene walking down a street where a store suddenly explodes leaving death and wounded people and, after the shock, he keeps walking away, as though it happened everyday. I see it as a story that, under a fictional circumstance, represents a world that looks strikingly similar to the one we're living in today. Now, I may be crazy and probably my vision is quite a stretch, but living in South America, when I visit Europe I can't help remembering this movie all the time. All the elements are there: People no longer breeding.Aging population.Constant influx of immigrants and refugees.A welfare state that feels doomed.An increasingly militarized society, with fear.The director has done an impressive job capturing the deep sadness of a society without future. I highly recommend it. ",

            "answer_text": "This one :  This is not just another love story where the hero dies , it\u2019s a story of two young poeple who both lived through the experience of losing a beloved one . When you lose someone , and especially when you are older enough to realize what that means , life kind of loses its meaning. Nothing scares you anymore, even death. You have nothing to lose. So you live a life with no rules , with no respect for society. You begin to hate people because you see that everyone tries to believe a lie (life). Because they want happiness, they try to avoid everything that can destroy it . But for you , happiness is never going to come again because losing that person makes you believe that life is meant to be sad . So you no longer pretend , you live life as you want and you no longer give a shit . The hero of the movie , lived like that for a period of time , but he met the love of his life , then things began to change, and happiness seems possible again. But on the day he started to smile again , something unexpected happened, he happened to be in the World Trade Center , and it is 11/9/2001 . And now his best friend is living through the same experiece . What you learn from this movie is that sadness teaches you more than happiness does. At the beginning of the movie the hero says : \u201cGandhi once said that everything you do in your life will be insignificant , but it\u2019s very important that you do it , I tend to agree with the first part\u201d , and at the end he says : \u201ceverything you do in your life will be insignificant ,but it\u2019s very important that you do it , because no body else will\u201d. Thanks for reading . Edit : thank you Nanditha Pari for editing this answer . ",
