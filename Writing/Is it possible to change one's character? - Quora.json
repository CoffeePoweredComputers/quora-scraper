            "answer_text": "Here's an excerpt from Eckhart Tolle's book, A New Earth: Your personality is a manifestation of your ego, and once you understand this the change has already begun.   Here's an excerpt from Eckhart Tolle's book, A New Earth:  Note from Veydom:  I took the liberty of \"bolding\" many of the ideas that I find most intriguing, and |\"thought\u201d provoking.  Of  course, my ego may not agree \u2013 but I\u2019m the one in charge, after all.  I  also couldn\u2019t resist implementing the grammar changes with Google  readily suggested!Your personality is a manifestation of your ego, and once you understand this the change has already begun.  \"Most people are so completely identified with the voice in the head\u2014the incessant stream  of involuntary and compulsive thinking and the emotions that accompany it\u2014 we may consider them as being possessed by their mind. As long as you are completely unaware of this, you take the thinker to be who you are. This is the egoic mind. We call it egoic because there is a sense of self, of I (ego), in every thought, every memory, every interpretation, opinion, viewpoint, reaction, emotion. This is unconsciousness, spiritually speaking. Your thinking, the content of your mind, is of course conditioned by the past: your upbringing, culture, family background, and so on. The central core of all your mind activity consists of certain repetitive and persistent thoughts, emotions, and reactive patterns that you identify with most strongly. This entity is the egoitself. In most cases, when you say \"I,\" it is the ego speaking, not you. It consists of thought and   emotion, of a bundle of memories you identify with as \"me and my story,\" of habitual roles you play without knowing it, of collective identifications such as: nationality, religion, race, social class, or political allegiance.  It also contains personal identification, not only with possessions, but also with... opinions, external appearance, long-standing resentments, or concepts of yourself as better than or not as good as others, as a success or failure. The content of the ego varies from person to person, but in every ego the same structure operates. In other words: Egos only differ on the surface. Deep down                              they are all the same. In what way are they the same?  They live on identification and separation. When you live through the mind-made self comprised of thought and emotion that is the ego, the basis for your identity  is precarious because thought and emotion are by their  very nature ephemeral, fleeting. So every ego is continuously struggling for survival, trying to protect and enlarge itself. To uphold the I-thought, it needs the opposite thought of \"the other.\" The conceptual \"I\" cannot survive without the conceptual \"other.\"  The others are most other when I sees them as \"enemies.\"                              Complaining At one end of the scale of this unconscious egoic pattern lays the egoic compulsive habit of faultfinding and complaining about others. Jesus referred to it when he said, \"Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?\" At the other end of the scale, there is physical violence between individuals and warfare between nations.Whether you complain aloud or only in thought makes no difference.  Some egos that perhaps don't have much else to identify with easily survive on complaining alone. When you are in the grip of such an ego, complaining, especially about other people, is habitual and, of course, unconscious, which means you don't know what you are doing.  Applying negative mental labels to people, either to their face or more commonly when you speak about them to others or even just think about them, is often of this pattern. Name-calling is the crudest form of such labeling and of the ego's need to be right and triumph over others: \"jerk, bastard, bitch\u201d\u2014all definitive pronouncements that you can't argue with.  On the next level down on the scale of unconsciousness, you have shouting and screaming, and not much below that, physical violence. Resentment Resentment is the emotion that goes with complaining and the mental labeling of people and adds even more energy to the ego. Resentment means to feel bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. You resent other people's greed, their dishonesty, their lack of integrity, what they are doing, what they did in the past, what they said, what they failed to do, what they should or shouldn't have done.  The ego loves it. Instead of overlooking unconsciousness in others, you make it into their identity. Who is doing that? The unconsciousness in you, the ego. Sometimes the \"fault\" that you perceive in another isn't even there. It is a total misinterpretation,  a projection by a mind conditioned to see enemies and to make itself right or superior.  At other times, the fault may be there, but by focusing on it, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else, you amplify it.  And what you react to in another, you strengthen in yourself. Non-reaction   Non-reaction to the ego in others is one of the most effective ways not only of going beyond ego in yourself but also of dissolving the collective human ego. But you can only be in a state of non-reaction if you can recognize someone's behavior as coming from the ego, as being an expression of the collective human dysfunction. When you realize it's not personal, there is no longer a compulsion to react as if it were. By not reacting to the ego, you will often be able to bring out the sanity in others, which is the unconditioned consciousness as opposed to the conditioned.  At times you may have to take practical steps to yourself from deeply unconscious people. This you can do without making them enemies. Your greatest protection, however, is being conscious. Somebody becomes an enemy if you personalize the unconsciousness that is the ego.  Non-reaction is not weakness but strength. Another word for non-reaction is forgiveness. To forgive is to overlook, or rather to look through. You look through the ego to the sanity that is in every human being as his or her essence. The ego loves to complain and feel resentful not only about other people but also about situations. What you can do to a person, you can also do to a situation: make it into an enemy. The implication is always...              This should not be happening; I don't want to be here; I don't want to be doing this; I'm being treated unfairly.  And the ego's greatest enemy of all is, of course, the present moment, which is to say, life itself.         Complaining is not to be confused with informing someone of a mistake or deficiency so that it can be put right.  And to refrain from complaining doesn't necessarily mean putting up with bad quality or behavior. There is no ego in telling the waiter that your soup is cold and needs to be heated up\u2014if you stick to the facts, which are always neutral. \"How dare you serve me cold soup...\" That's complaining.   There is a \"me\" here that loves to feel personally offended by the cold soup and is going to make the most of it, a \"me\" that enjoys making someone wrong. The complaining we are talking about is in the service of the ego, not of change.                              Ego Identifies with the Body Apart from objects, another basic form of identification is with \"my\" body. Firstly, the body is male or female, and so the sense of being a man or woman takes up a significant part of most people's sense of self. Gender becomes identity. Identification with gender is encouraged at an early age, and it forces you into a role, into conditioned patterns of behavior that affect all aspects of your life, not just sexuality. It is a role many people become completely trapped in, even more so in some of the traditional societies than in Western culture identification with gender is beginning to lessen somewhat. In some traditional cultures, the worst fate a woman can have is to be unwed or barren, and for a man to lack sexual potency and not be able to produce children. Life's fulfillment is perceived to be fulfillment of one's gender identity. In the West, it is the physical appearance of the body that contributes greatly to the sense of who you think you are: its strength or weakness, its perceived beauty or ugliness relative to others. For many people, their sense of self-worth is intimately bound up with their physical strength, good looks, fitness, and external appearance. Many feel a diminished sense of self-worth because they perceive their body as ugly or imperfect.  In some cases, the mental image or concept of \"my body\" is a complete distortion of reality. A young woman may think of herself as overweight and therefore starve herself when in fact she is quite thin. She cannot see her body anymore. All she \"sees\" is the mental concept of her body, which says \"I am fat\" or \"I will become fat.\"    At the root of this condition lies identification with the mind. As people have become more and more mind-identified, which is the intensification of egoic dysfunction; there has also been a dramatic increase in the incidence of anorexia in recent decades. If the sufferer could look at her body without the interfering judgments of her mindor even recognize these judgments for what they are instead of believing in them, this would initiate her healing. Those who are identified with their good looks, physical strength, or abilities experience suffering when those attributes begin to fade and disappear, as of course they will. Their very identity that was based on them is then threatened with collapse. In either case, ugly or beautiful, people derive a significant part of their identity, be it negative or positive, from their body. To be more precise, they derive their identity from the I-thoughtthat they erroneously attach to the mental image or concept of their body, which after all is no more than a physical form that shares the destiny of all forms\u2014 impermanence and ultimately decay. Equating the physical sense-perceived body that is destined to grow old, wither, and die with \"I\" always leads to suffering sooner or later. To refrain from identifying with the body doesn't mean that you neglect, despise, or no longer care for it. If it is strong, beautiful, or vigorous, you can enjoy and appreciate those attributes while they last. You can also improve the body's condition through right nutrition and exercise. If you don't equate the body with who you are, when beauty fades, vigor diminishes,  or the body becomes incapacitated, this will not affect your sense of worth or identity in any way. In fact, asthe body begins to weaken, the formless dimension,  the light of consciousness, can shine more easily through the fading form. It is not just people with good or near-perfect bodies who are likely to equate it with who they are. You can just as easily identify with a \"problematic\" body and make the body's imperfection, illness, or disability into your identity. You may then think and speak of yourself as a \"sufferer\" of this or that chronic illness or disability. You receive a great deal of attention from doctors and others who constantly confirm to you your conceptual identity as a sufferer or a patient. You then cling to the illness because it has become the important part of who you perceive yourself to be.  It has become another thought form with which the ego can identify. Once the ego has found an identity, it does not want to let go. Amazingly but not infrequently, the ego in search of a stronger identity can and does create illnesses in order to strengthen itself through them.                              The Collective Ego How hard it is to live with yourself! One of the ways in which the ego attempts to escape the unsatisfactoriness of personal selfhood is to enlarge and strengthen  its sense of self by identifying with a group\u2014 a nation, political party, corporation, institution, sect, religion, club, gang, football team.  In some cases the personal ego seems to dissolve as someone dedicates his or her life to working selflessly for the greater good of the collective without demanding personal rewards, recognition, or aggrandizement.                              What  a relief to be freed of the dreadful burden of a personal self. The members of the collective feel happy and fulfilled, no matter how hard they work, how many sacrifices they make. They appear to have gone beyond ego. The question is: Have they truly become free, or has the ego simply shifted from the personal to the collective? A collective ego manifests the same characteristics as the personal ego, such as... the need for conflict and enemies, the need for more, the need to be right against others who are wrong, and so on. Sooner or later, the collective will come into conflict with other collectives, because it unconsciously seeks conflict and it needs opposition to define its boundary and thus its identity. Its members will then experience the suffering that inevitably comes in the wake of any ego-motivated action. At that point, they may wake up and realize that their collective has a strong element of insanity. It can be painful at first to suddenly wake up and realize that the collective you had identified with and worked for is actually insane. Some people at that point become cynical or bitter and henceforth deny all values, all worth. This means                              that they quickly adopted another belief system the previous one was recognized as illusory and therefore collapsed. They didn't face the death of their ego but ran away and reincarnated into a new one.  A collective ego is usually more unconscious than the individuals that make up that ego. For example, crowds (which are temporary collective egoic entities) are capable of committing atrocities that the individual away from the crowd would not be. Nations not infrequently engage in behavior that would be immediately recognizable as psychopathic in an individual. Grievances There are many people who are always waiting for the next thing to react against, to feel annoyed or disturbed about, and it never takes long before they find it. \"This is an outrage,\" they say. \"How dare you ...\" \"I resent this.\" They are addicted to upset and anger as others are to a drug. Through reacting against this or that they assert and strengthen their feeling of self. A long-standing resentment is called a grievance.  To carry grievances is to be in a permanent state of \"against,\" and that is why grievances constitute a significant part of many people's ego. Collective grievances can survive for centuries in the psyche of a nation or a tribe and fuel a never-ending cycle of violence. A grievance is a strong negative emotion connected to an event in the sometimes distant past that is being kept alive by compulsive thinking, by retelling the story in the head or out loud of \"what someone did to me\" or \"what someone did to us.\"                              A grievance will also contaminate other areas of your life. For example, while you think about and feel your grievance, its negative emotional energy can distort your perception of an event that is happening in the present or influence the way in which you speak or behave toward someone in the present. One strong grievance is enough to contaminate large areas of your life and keep you in the grip of the ego. It requires honesty to see whether you still harbor grievances, whether there is someone in your life you have not completely forgiven, an \"enemy.\" If you do, become aware of the grievance both on the level of thought as well as emotion, that is to say, be aware of the thoughts that keep it alive, and feel the emotion that is the body's response to those thoughts. Don't  try to let go of the grievance. Trying to let go, to forgive, does not work. Forgiveness happens naturally, when you see that it has no purpose other than to strengthen a false sense of self, to keep the in place. The seeing is freeing. Jesus' teaching to \"Forgive your enemies\" is about the undoing of one of the main egoic structures in the human mind. The past has no power to stop you from being present now. Only your grievance about the past can do that. And what is a grievance? The baggage of old thought and emotion. The seeing is freeing. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. The human personality is fluid, not fixed. Unfortunately, we allow our thoughts and feelings to influence our actions. Here\u2019s how to get in front of it: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the saying, \u201cControl what you can control.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the prayer, \u201cLord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d Both sound well and good in theory, but what is there left to do when things are spiraling outside of your grasp? What\u2019s beneath the problems we deal with is uncertainty. We don\u2019t know how things will pan out. We\u2019re not sure how we\u2019re going to make it. We\u2019re scared about what\u2019s going to happen. It all arises from uncertainty. In the information age, we\u2019re spoiled. We decipher we don\u2019t know something, plug the question into Google and within seconds, multiple answers are presented. So it\u2019s only natural that when we cannot locate a clear answer to our problem, we fall apart. This then creates a ripple effect, where our emotional state is so violently impacted that it sets other negative outcomes into motion as a result. This continues until we arrive at a point where we put a stop to it all. It may come from inspiration. It may come from desperation. But sooner or later, something gives. Here\u2019s how to expedite it. Stop Focusing On Outcomes One of the quickest ways to get yourself out of a funk is to understand and become aware of what\u2019s happening inside your head. What\u2019s constantly at play is a \u201cvicious circle\u201d of neurological happenings that can inhibit you from creating positive change.  The \u201cVicious Circle\u201d The current outcome we are experiencing produces various thoughts about what\u2019s going on, what it all means, and the like. We go into prediction mode with our thinking and experience a cascade of emotions (often unnecessary ones) to cope with the magnitude of the situation. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with this process, it does keep us from handling the problem directly. As you can see in the illustration above, the ONLY thing that produces outcomes is action. Thoughts and feelings eventually lead to actions, but the actions themselves are solely responsible for every outcome. The way we get in front of this is by shifting our focus from the thoughts and feelings about what\u2019s happening to instead focusing solely on the actions that will lead us to a better outcome, shown below.  \u201cRecovery Mode\u201d I call this \u201crecovery mode\u201d. Here, we go into the proverbial mechanic\u2019s shop and make the necessary repairs on the outcomes we\u2019re currently experiencing. I will note this isn\u2019t meant to last forever. Thoughts and feelings can be incredibly moving and inspiring experiences for human beings. We just want to shelve them temporarily so as to keep them under manageable control. After all, all we need is a little bit of progress to ensue and all of a sudden, change is enacted. Put Yourself In An Ideal State Through that little bit of progress, we experience a change in our state. The small amount of momentum rolling towards a better outcome begins to cause a shift in the way we experience life. As human beings, we have a fundamental need for progress. As long as progress is being made, we\u2019re making (albeit small, but still) deposits into our self-worth\u2019s bank account. And as our self-worth grows, our state changes. Every person\u2019s ultimate goal in life can be defined by a particular \u201cstate\u201d. Love, freedom, power, appreciation, joy and vitality are all various states of being. While external concepts certainly help create these states with greater ease, all of these are created from within. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes all it takes is slowing down and truly appreciating what you have in front of you. Conclusion How are the thoughts and feelings about a particular outcome keeping you from taking action to create change? What can you now see is possible for you by focusing ONLY on the actions that produce the outcomes you want instead of the thoughts or feelings? Think about your most audacious stretch goal associated with an area in which you\u2019re experiencing a breakdown. Visualize yourself accomplishing this goal. What state are you experiencing by achieving this goal? How can you create that state right now? ",

            "answer_text": "Trust me, you will regret it. It's possible, I did it, but more like I was forced to change, and not on my own free will. I was originally a kind hearted, content, happy, introverted individual, I met up with a narcissistic, self entitled, bragging, goldigging girl. After getting acquainted for only 2 weeks, I just felt this intense infatuation towards her, like I just wanted to be her. (Note that I never liked this girl, not stunning at all, your typical female version of a nice guy). Partially why I started to believe in things like curses, black magick etc. Because this girl actually controlled my free will. (she did mention of a wrist band from a witch doctor during our time of being acquainted). Many things pointed to the possibility of having a hex put on me, from having my photo, to getting my birthdate, to feeding me her \u2018homemade cookies, basically anything that characterized me, she got a hold of. But at the time, I already had a gf I loved very much, we were even about to get married, no way could I have wanted to be with her. Fast forward few years later, after actually getting better (her black magick put me into depression), this girl decides to unblock me on fb, then disappears, unblocked in October 2019, hasnt been on since. So, she obviously was aware of the valid date of her \u2018hex\u2019, I was getting myself back, she was getting \u2018her\u2019 self back, so better to slip away before anything happens. It's good to be myself, and you should be proud of being yourself too. Unless you are as unfortunate as me, to meet up with \u2018trash\u2019 like this, be content with what you have, especially your personality. Your personality is probably better than alot of other people ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Fundamentally character is a function of the blending dynamics of 1) our biology. Which we usually have no control over, but which applies in basic and generalised ways such as instinct, feelings of attraction and some preferencing behaviours. Of course if the biology is not functioning normally this can lead to divergent character outcomes that the individual has little to no control over, such as what happens with stunted brain development or damage triggering criminal or destructive behaviours. 2) our education. Which affects us in various ways and from various sources. We know for example that homicide and assault rates and even general political views can be estimated fairly accurately from both formal education qualifications. The reason for this is not just the impact of knowledge. But also the willingness to critically assess information, and what we believe we are entitled to and what our obligations to others are or not. This also includes informal education such as from our parents and the culture and beliefs of any groups we belong to. 3) decisions we make in regards to our relationship to ourselves, others, and the world. Sometimes called our world view. Often this is influenced by culture and education, but it goes much deeper. If you decide you are a bad person or that something is innately wrong, it is hard for anything else to counter that. This is easily the most important aspect controlling the development of character. This takes having realistic compassion for our own humanity and taking the time and effort to identify why we do what we do, how we view things, and what other ways are available to view the same thing. This is a critical step very few people consciously take, which is why most of the time we wait until we have a painful experience that gives us a reason to view things differently. So apart from those bits we cannot control the rest is a matter of introspection and training. That means we can definitely fundamentally change our characters. But the first step is the hardest because we have to accept that our character needs changing and be willing to stop being right or defensive in our opinion of ourselves. This is where role playing games and storytelling regardless of the media used can come in handy. If we can see enough of ourselves in the characters we can develop a desire to be more like them and develop empathy for how hard it is to change. If the game or story reveals a set of actions and consequences the characters went through to become the way they are it it reveals an action plan for those engrossed in the story. As our feelings for the various characters strengthen we start to take on and reject their world views. This grants people permission to give up their own world view and seek a fundamentally different path. In many ways this is much the same way education works. Remembering that here education includes influence from others, the culture and practices in the groups we are a part of. Role playing games in particular, because they have rules and characters develop on a moderated way that needs to be believable if not realistic grant the opportunity to ask how the character became this way. As players develop believable backstories and reasons for progression that forwards a story outcome the player wants to explore they get to think deeply about all this stuff. And it has a measurable influence on how players view their world and others. The single most notable trait of long term role players who practice these storytelling aspects of RPG games is compassion. While power gamers often exhibit similar traits to many violent criminals. Notably arrogance, callousness and selfishness. This is because their progression is linked directly to overwhelming their enemy with no attempt to discover why they would want to do that. In many ways storytelling works the same way. How the story is told impacts how the world being described influences the viewer. Concider the different experience had when watching movies that had little story with the hero solving their problems with overwhelming violence and those with deep descriptions of the world the hero lives in where they develop and rely on others. If all you watch is one of these two types your world view is influenced more heavily by it. Watch both and you tend to be influenced by both. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people say that no, it doesn\u2019t change and we are born with our personalities. However, we can develop some traits that we are \u2018lacking\u2019 if we find the need to do so. This \u2018glitch\u2019 actually bothers me, as it seems to be an extension of being \u2018pretentious\u2019 for the sake of self-gain. I like it to be called \u2018adapting\u2019 to the situations. From personal experience, I tend to adopt personalities that I like from people and I also find people getting influenced by some of my quirks. I know people who behave differently depending on their environment, but are overall consistent in their different personalities to be considered as \u2018pretending.\u2019 Some of friends from my younger years have \u2018changed\u2019 and others didn\u2019t. Some stories about past classmates now sound so different from how I knew them but when we meet again I see no difference. I think it really depends on the people they interact with \u2014 my boyfriend is very aloof when with other people, but is extremely sweet when he\u2019s with me. When I had my Philosophy subject in college, several topics fascinated me which made me change most of my stand point in life and I believe those realizations changed me. I used to be tactless and crass regarding my beliefs but when I realized I\u2019ve unintentionally hurt a friend, I started to be careful with my words. I think that our ability to feel and think makes us capable of changing. ",

            "answer_text": "It's very difficult to change your personality on your own. For me, when my personality changed last year, it was when I was going through a very painful state of my life. At that time, my classmates mocked me, gossiped about me, spread rumours about me. My good friends had their new friends and they didn't really talked to me anymore. At home, i would quarrel with my family. I felt very depressed and upset, soon I started telling myself to shut up. I kept quiet in school at home and everywhere I go. I start to get afraid of getting out of home, and also started to feel like my home was a prison. I then started to blame myself for talking too much, being annoying, extra, stupid, mean, ugly, selfish and many more. These causes my thoughts to change\u2026 and soon I changed too. It's how we react to difficulties in life. I believed I have failed terribly in reacting correctly to those irrelevant things. When people ask me this question, I will always answer that Pain and Difficulties shape you. It has definitely shaped me, in the toughest way. However, to change your personality\u2026 is like changing a gift God gave you. It's difficult to change something into another thing. Everyone is beautiful the way they are, at the finest, I am sure. It's not easy changing who you are, cause I'm sure you're already great the way you are! :) So to end this off, if you want a change in you. You gotta pay a huge price to make yourself better or\u2026 for the worse. If for the better, you will face a very very, and i mean EXTREMELY, painful ride. Once you've reached this point, please, have in mind that there'll always be people by your side. Always. Stay strong! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but not in the way \u201cchange\u201d is formally defined. People tend to think about change structurally. For example: \u201cchanging\u201d your physical hands into oven mitts. It\u2019s the physical change from hand-to-mitt that someone would be able to say, \u201cAh, yes, it has changed.\u201d But change can also mean varying degrees of the same core structure. Take a pianists hands. He or she plays a piece, and the first time it is played very aggressively. Their hands are firm, every note is loud, and the piece comes off as brash. The second time they play the piece, he or she plays with a different level of expression. The notes are soft and then loud, loud and then soft. Their hands are effortless. The piece sounds like a story. Their hands did not \u201cchange\u201d structurally, but they did \u201cchange\u201d expressively. The same can be said about someone\u2019s personality. \u201cChange\u201d in the structural sense\u2014hands to oven mitts\u2014no. You will always be \u201cyou.\u201d But \u201cchange\u201d in the expressive sense? Absolutely. Impatient people can learn patience. Depressive people can find joy. Nervous people can become calm. Mean people can turn nice. Just like a piano player can play a song a hundred different ways, we too can express ourselves a hundred different ways. The notes on the page, however, remain the same.

            "answer_text": "NO , it can't be changed. But it can be controlled. I will elucidate with an example. Let A be a person with a personal trait of short temper. Let B be a friend of A. B is a person who loves fight and argument with others. B usually targets A for his pranks as he is easy to be angered. Like B wanted , every time A would fall for the trick. Every time C used to observe all these commotion . One day A asked C for advice. C said when an appropriate situation presents before you ,you get angered easily. You can't prevent the anger from being generated. But you have an option to allow that anger to dictate your actions. Again the next day B provoked A. A' s breathing deepened. His heart beat raised. But he didn't utter a word. He knew that he couldn't afford to be a puppet in the hands of his sadistic friend B. Every personality trait is like this. We may not be able to eliminate it but we can control it and direct it as we wish. ",

            "answer_text": "I just have responded almost the same question in What do you do when you think your personality doesn't fit the ambition stereotype and you think the only way to succeed is to try really hard to change your personality? but I will extend and develop the main points here because I think the answer is: not, you can not, you should not and when you read why and what other strategies are available you will want not. In short, based on Jungian Psychology Type Theory, you could fake your personality up to certain extent but it is really, really hard and improbable to change your inborn psychological type which is responsible of your unconscious, daily and long-term behaviour.  Only long-term stress, heavy psychological trauma o slow (ill-related) physiological changes could do it to some extent, but not merely willpower. If you fake it (for example wearing a workplace \"surviving mask\") soon or later, when your guard is down and stress arises, your \"shadow\" -id est. your underlying less developed real traits- will suddenly erupt, messing up your whole behaviour. That said I don't think that trying to change your personality could be advisable, desirable, even less feasible. At least this is not the best strategy to cope with the most probable underlying problem: you are not happy with yourself. As a first, more feasible strategy, you shoud try to reframe your \"ambition stereotype\". (And if it is not truly yours, why should you bend yourself to comply with another else ambition stereotype?) To be independent enough to work and reframe your ambition stereotype is an order of magnitude easier than trying to change your inborn personality. Reframing your ambition stereotype and your own life expectations and goals could be a first (and very needed) approach to partially solve the problem. Here it is a more long-term, sustainable and achievable strategy: There is a better long-term approach (long-term in both investment and benefits): Type Development. Type development as Psychological Type Theory defines it, begins with understanding really who you are, what are your natural resources, what are your strong and weak points. And then to develop your type upon it. This is where learning Jung-Myers-Briggs Type Theory could help you a lot. There are other personality theories and instruments, but this is good, easy to grasp, but deep and powerful enough. The most interesting point is that an adult with their inborn personality well developed through the years (Carl Jung named it \"individuation\" process) seems as if he/she have changed their personality compared to their  \"chaotic\", \"defective\" or \"incomplete\" young self. In fact he/she have upraised their good traits and \"domesticated\" the bad ones, but he/she is the same type as when young. Just better. Better developed. Sadly the opposite could be true: it is possible trhough abandonment, bad life guidance, continuous stress, drugs and alcohol self-destruction, etc, to worsen your personality, id. est to develop your worst traits and screw up your good ones. If you are old enough you can recall some \"wasted\" lives around you. Their inborn personality haven't changed, but deteriorated. The main reason to try to develop your inborn personality versus trying to change it is that the former requires a lot of vital resources but have a chance of success but the later requires an order of magnitude more resources (you are fighting yourself all the time) and even that does not guaranteed any success, but when you gave up you will find yourself with wasted years, a lot less energy and almost all confidence lost in the process. Just the same resources you should have used into develop your inborn personality. The main point is that before trying to change anything so delicate as your own personality you should try to understand it very well -this alone is hard- and when done, it is a lot easier to develop your inborn strong points than trying to match other's type.  Do not envy other's types. Every type could excel naturally in a variety of endeavours and believe me: the world is big enough to have space for whatever good your Type has to bring. A brief look to \"famous\" people in each of the 16 different MBTI personality types will show you that it is possible to be brilliant, to accomplish big achievements and to have interesting lives no matter what your personality type is. So live and develop your life and get the good from your personality. It is waaaay easy than trying to change what it is wired into your brain. ",

            "answer_text": "Your personality, like your language range, is involuntarily as well as voluntarily altered by close & continued proximity to others who aren\u2019t exactly like you.

When you are motivated and enthusiastic to achieve an ambition you will readily adopt a new personality which is required eg. for you to increase Sales you might dress differently and learn to be more extrovert & outgoing when you\u2019re naturally a bit quiet & shy. I think by practising being different, we become different. ",

            "answer_text": "We cannot change anyone according to our will. Max to max what we can do is influence and inspire a person , which may make us see some temporary changes in their behaviour. But the basic nature of a person remains same no one can change it but the person himself/ herself can make it happen.  You can see temporary changes in a person if you put endless efforts , but inside the person is same. It's not their fault nor yours. Why? Because every person is uniquely designed. They have a set of sanskar, they got it since birth. It's in the cells, no one can change it. It can only be modified or improved or faded only if that person wants to do so on his/her own will.  We should respect the uniqueness of a person and cherish it. If you want to bring about positive changes in a person you should make them understand it's necessity and inspire them from within. Never make the mistake of giving orders to someone and expect that it will make them change, instead they will start disliking you or fake themselves to satisfy you. With love your journey may become a bit easier. Because of this there are certain thing's like- adjustment, acceptance, appreciation , respect. Thanks !!! ",

I had no close friends, or friends of any kind, and was constantly sullen and gloomy. How I changed was that I watched people around me who did have friends. How they interacted, what people stuck together, how they treated outsiders, etc. I learned how to make friends with different people by learning what they looked for in a companion. Then, once I knew how to do this, I surrounded myself with people who I actually liked being around. I got my own friends. I made sure they were positive forces on my life- people who would support me when I was feeling down, not shun me. They became the most uplifting thing in my life. I felt comfortable around them. I never had a concept of \u201cbeing myself\u201d- frankly, I think that is total horseshit. What I did was I molded my behavior to best suit the preferences of people that I liked. And over time, that behavior became ingrained in me. It makes my personality what it is today (7 years later). Yes, I believe so. Maybe you cannot do it the same way I did it, but I think it is possible. ",

I\u2019m 71 and have that same lighthearted joy in me (like I was a curious pre-puberty 10 year old seeing exciting possibilities and opportunities almost everywhere). If that happened to me, and it did, I can say that major changes are possible with a major belief/outlook change. But can I follow a list of do this, then this, then that, to make that change\u2026.no. Because it is a relatively traumatic type change. Like my thoughts of suicide, sometimes it take a very serious \u201chit the bottom or hit a wall\u201d to wake us up to how a significant change is needed (not just mildly desired, like \u201cmake my latte vanilla this time\u201d). But I also remember being frustrate by my mild fear and prejudice moving to the \u201cbig city\u201d from a very small town. So I deliberately walked the streets of the urban inner city each Saturday for a few hours and I eventually lost all my earlier prejudice. Two of my children are mixed white (me) and Cameroonian. Maybe that too is an example of a fearful personality becoming a welcoming one. Hope that helps. ",

Generally when considering personality within the realm of psychology you consider the Big 5 trait theory, as this is the most popular theory and it\u2019s very simple. There are 5 components to this expression of personality. I will talk about how you would change one, Extroversion/Introversion. Your technique would depend on where they were and where you wanted to put them. If you wanted to influence an introvert into being more extroverted you could simple engage them in more social situations and conversation. You would have to be careful though, the person being influenced might be comfortable being an introvert and may not want to change. ",

Temperment characteristics (degree of introversion or extroversion, more verbal or quiet, being more driven or laid back) remain with us. But the definition of personality is the sum of our temperament plus our total life experience. So if you consciously choose different experiences, you will change the math of your personality. But if you tend towards introversion you\u2019ll still need quiet to recharge. And if you\u2019re naturally laid back, you\u2019ll never become a naturally driven individual. So define the kind of personality you desire then map out life experiences that move you in that direction. ",

They are either dominant and assertive or passive to one extent or the other. By the age of six or seven, they are mostly honest or dishonest. These basic patterns can be changed only if the child sees a benefit for behaving in a certain way. Your question leaves out the age range, environment and many other variables. As a bail bondsman I can state that TRUE character change is damned near impossible after age eighteen or nineteen. Either you are a basically straight up and honest person or you are not. The only instance I have seen (other than actors) of people truly changing was after the death of a very close friend or family member. I bonded 1267 people out of jail, 49 people ran and we have rearrested 47. One died and the other got deported. Hope that helps brother/sister! ",

Personality traits are the assignment of characteristics to the actions a person has already made. These can be positive, neutral, and negative. Personality is a way to predict how someone may act in a situation based on how they have acted in the past. So for someone to change their personality they will need to have more actions towards their desired personality that not. This is hard for some adults because tolerance of other adults can be less, but most adults give tolerance to other adults when they at least try to have more normal behavior. In this case they may have less regression tolerance. Adolescents get all the tolerance, because of their life experience is so little. The best thing children can do is to try to achieve normal behavior as best as they can so that it is intuitive by the time they are an adult. Simplifying this whole thing. Make best decisions, try to be positive, and obtain normal behavior when you can do this without thinking about doing it; intuitive. ",

Once it\u2019s built it\u2019s hard to make large structural changes but you can still redecorate individual rooms.

            "answer_text": "A2A No, since personality is to a large extent genetically determined and traits are heritable. One can develop one\u2019s traits or try to modify their expression, however. You could force yourself to be more accommodating to others for example, even if it makes you squirm. You could develop your altruism due to your innate tendency to hold liberal principles, and become a philanthropist rather than spend your money on yourself, even if your innate altruism isn\u2019t high and it\u2019s only because you\u2019ve made significant amounts of money that disposing of it has become an issue. So on the surface you would have changed your overt generosity towards others. Since there is no scientific credibility regarding personality \u2018types\u2019 such as the Myers-Briggs theories, there\u2019s no need to comment on that. ",

            "answer_text": "Permanent change of behaviour requires the combined effort of the emotional(limbic system) and cognitive(prefrontal cortex) brains. Limbic system in the human brain facilitates absolute learning. Only if he/she learns, they can proceed to change. Initial learning leads to exhibition of executive actions. The set of executive actions has to become an habit/routine, that's done by the prefrontal cortex. If the prefrontal cortex gets damaged, the person changes his behavior too often and finds difficulty in creating habits. If a person's limbic system is damaged, same behavior will be exhibited through out their lifetime. ",

I personally have the philosophy that personalities are built upon accepting or rejecting new information or stimuli from the environment around you, so one's personality is constantly evolving, growing, and changing. In a single person, some core ideas may stay constant throughout their lives, like a love for the smell of apples or maybe a favourite word, but the whole personality never stays constant. Has your favourite colour stayed the same throughout your whole life? Has your opinion on relgion or ideas about politics the same as they were when you first developed them, or have they evolved as you learned more about the moods of colours or theories of creation or the effects of political change?

Your personality goes through cycles from an adolescent to maturity, where your dominant and inferior functions switch and then return back to what they were during childhood when you reach maturity. The only thing that you might be able to influence is your perception about others based on the knowledge you now have of their own personalities. In other words you mature and establish an ability to see others through a more understanding lens. But your essence will always remain the same. ",
