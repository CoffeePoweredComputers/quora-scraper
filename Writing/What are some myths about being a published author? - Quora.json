That how well your book sells is entirely dependent on how well written it is. That the majority of authors can get rich or at least support themselves from writing. That traditionally published authors have total control over things such as editing, cover art, and even the titles of their books. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest myth that the typical published author could actually have a livable income from the published book. It very nearly always isn\u2019t the truth. Many outstanding and \u2018successful\u2019 authors I\u2019ve worked with could not possibly live without their regular daytime jobs. Now look at my bio for why I say that. I myself wrote two non-fiction books and published them via the traditional route back in the 1980s. Frankly, they never made any money even though their print runs sold out. ",
