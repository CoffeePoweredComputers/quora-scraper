            "answer_text": "There are lots of penpal sites on the internet these days. Letter writing by post has not gone away - there are sites that specialise in penpalling the old fashioned way. I have tried a few clubs but keep coming back to my favourite which is Globalpenfriends due to their long track record and safety features. You register a profile and can then create a list of postal addresses or start messaging people that are interested in penpalling by post. Its great fun and very rewarding to check you mail box and find something other than bills - i actually look forward to checking for post now. Yes, its slow and takes time to sit down and write a letter - but its a very good was to gather your thoughts and step away from the modern life. There are also other forms of snail mail penpaling - such as mail art and pocket letters.. there is a whole other world out there - start exploring! ",

            "answer_text": "Back in the long ago days before email, let alone social media, I used to correspond with friends who moved away or people I met while traveling. Even after email was a thing, I still exchanged letters with some people because we enjoyed it \u2014 although I don\u2019t anymore. Do you know someone who lives some distance from you? Write them a nice letter. Friends, relatives, former teachers \u2014 you could even write to an author you admire. (Your local library can help you find the address of their publisher, which is where you would send it.) I did that twice, and I got a reply both times. Moreover, I ended up corresponding with one of my favorite authors for a couple of years. Be creative, send out a few letters and see what happens. Good luck! ",
