            "answer_text": "I decided to answer this question because I think there are good approaches, but also because I believe the question starts with a flawed assumption: a higher GRE makes you necessarily more competitive. There\u2019s an assumption both in and outside the US that grad schools stack-rank candidates: they take their GPAs and exam scores and perhaps factor in some prestige-of-university multiplier, then score each candidate and admit the top X. Nothing could be further from the truth. For programs that receive large numbers of applicants, the first step is filtering. This is where a low GPA or low GRE scores can hurt. Committee members quickly skim perhaps hundreds of applications, looking for a reason to remove each from consideration. There may be specific criteria, or some combination of criteria, but it\u2019s often just a question of whether or not the candidate stands out in any way. GRE scores and GPA are absolutely not ways in which you can possibly stand out. It doesn\u2019t hurt to have high GPA and GREs, but by themselves they won\u2019t mean much. Grad school, even at the master\u2019s level, is not like undergrad. At the master\u2019s level, you will primarily be taking courses, but the courses will require project work that demands creativity. At the PhD level, you will take courses (in the US), but these are preliminary to starting your research, which is what the PhD is focused on. How do you stand out? Don\u2019t be like everyone else. The more independence and creativity you show, the better. Having worked in a professor\u2019s lab and having co-authored papers is nice, but since it\u2019s impossible to know what your role is (unless you are the first author, or the second author after your professor), thee don\u2019t count as much as people think. If that paper is supported by an excellent letter of recommendation explaining your role and stressing your contribution to the definition of the problem and/or the creation of a novel solution, then this counts much, much more. So what\u2019s the point of the GRE? It\u2019s a general aptitude test, and used to gauge some generic potential. All you need is sufficient grades. This is typically around the median scores, but they can be lower. Many, many admitted PhD students scored 800 (top possible score) on the quantitative, but what that means is that in any given year, 1/3 or more of students admitted didn\u2019t have 800s. Additionally, many students with 800s won\u2019t be admitted. Just get your scores good enough. Now, what about the GRE? What I recommend is starting with the Princeton Review study guide (I have no connection or financial or other interest in Princeton Review). Unfortunately, you need to buy a new one because you need it to be current and you need access to practice exams. Go through the book slowly. This means planning ahead. Like any study process, this works far better over time, and \u201cintense\u201d studying will yield diminishing returns. I spent about 1 hour studying/day, but I was working full time. If I had the time, I would have gone to two hours, but no more. Work your way through every exercise and page. Those expensive courses you can purchase? They\u2019re just going to walk you through identical exercises. Put in the time now and save yourself time and money. Do not play the \u201cI know this\u201d game to choose whether or not to go through the material. I\u2019ve taken the GRE and can guarantee you that at no point will you be asked if you know the material. \u201cI know this\u201d is just a mechanism people use to not be empirical and find out what they can do. What you can do is far more important than your own assessment of what you do and do not know. After you\u2019ve been through the book, take several practice tests. After the test, see where you had problems and re-study that material. After 3\u20134 test, your score will likely stabilize. If that stable score looks good (that it, it\u2019s sufficient for your needs), go take the exam. This does mean you need to plan ahead, although generally it\u2019s not a problem to register for the exam and then reschedule (as long as you do so ahead of time; how long may depend on the country and testing center). Only if you are not able to get your score to a specific point that seems critical should you go any further. Retaking the exam, spending money and time on additional prep, and scoring a few points more is unlikely to have any effect on your admissions. Also, you can spend a fortune on group and individual test prep. The people selling these services have a vested interest in convincing you that your scores need to be higher. Not all recommendations are suspect, but realize that ultimately you\u2019re turning to the same person to tell you whether or not you are adequate and for services to improve. Power tends to corrupt. Do not waste time or money starting out in prep classes. I\u2019ll be honest; if you can\u2019t self-study, you\u2019re not going to succeed in grad school. It\u2019s fine to get to a point where you need assistance, and then to seek assistance. This is actually a really good sign for your future academic importance (asking for and getting help). However, if you can\u2019t get to this point on your own steam, you really need to assess your mechanisms of motivation. Two final points: Don\u2019t ignore the analytical writing portion. This is especially true for PhD applicants. It not only counts, it\u2019s a good indicator of success. Given how much reading and writing PhD students do, I would seriously reconsider a PhD program if you can\u2019t get at least a 4.0. If you look at the criteria, a 4.0 is hardly an absurd goal. For a master\u2019s degree outside of the liberal arts, this is less critical.Don\u2019t worry about your composite score. Don\u2019t think about your composite score. No one cares about your composite score. The three parts are entirely separate. The fact that verbal and quant are graded on the same scale is meaningless, as the scores are not analogous (it\u2019s much harder and less common to score highly on the verbal part). Of course, the analytical writing score is not on the same scale at all. Most programs principally care about verbal or quant. Few programs care highly about both. PhD students in the humanities often have quant scores that wouldn\u2019t get them into an MS program in a scientific field, and vice-versa.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose you want some direction with the preparation methodologies for taking GRE. So, I would rephrase that question :) Now what you can do is go for a mock test by some testing service providers at your place or any such organization online (eg. Magoosh). This will give you a feel of GRE and tell you where you stand, in each section, as per the revised GRE standards.Then buy a Barron\u2019s or any other standardized book, you\u2019ll find many, to start off with your preparations. Also, make sure that you are taking mocks time to time to check your growth. After you\u2019ve become comfortable with your preparation and booked a GRE date, buy the official guide by ETS and take the 4 tests provided by ETS. Trust me this, the score you get in those 4 exams will extremely closely reflect what you\u2019ll get in your actual GRE. Best of Luck. ",
