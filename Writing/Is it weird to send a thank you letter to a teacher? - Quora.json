            "answer_text": "Back in 1977, I was a freshman in high school and quite heavily involved with the school radio and TV stations. The teacher in charge of those told me about an internship opportunity at a new local TV station. The internship led to part time employment and later to a full time job. About ten years after that I was named Chief Engineer of the station. I sent one of my new business cards and a letter of thanks to the teacher who\u2019d opened that first door for me. He responded with a cordial and congratulatory phone call and we swapped a few war stories. Another eight years passed and I was back at that same high school for a parents night.* I stopped by the Media Center to say hello to my old teacher. Funny, the room still smelled the same and his desk was still buried in paper and the same old bulletin board was mounted on the wall next to his desk. In one corner of the bulletin board was tucked my business card. So whether it\u2019s weird or not, send your thanks, odds are it will mean more than you imagine. *If you really want to experience time-travel make sure your kids go to the same schools you did. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Have you ever been to a movie set? You walk along a street that is not really a street, flanked by buildings that are just facades. People are like movie sets. We hide behind whatever it is that we want others to see. I don't think the intent is necessarily deceptive. It's not that we are pretending, or \u201cwearing a mask\u201d. It's more about endurance - about getting through whatever we are trying to get through. It's about meeting social demands, about protecting ourselves or someone else. You really shouldn't be seeing me like this. When you see a teacher, a manager, a boss, a coworker, a friend, what you see is this able, everyday character, together, a regular, but the truth is you have no idea what hides right behind the scaffolding and plywood. I will tell you what's back there: A shitty day, early morning bad news, insecurity, pain, self-doubt, fear. Shame, maybe; worry, guilt, a relationship that is falling apart, or something heavy and burdensome, like responsibility or a secret. If someone did something for you, tell them. Tell them. Be very specific about exactly what it was. Remind them that their actions mattered, that what they did had impact, meant something to you, shone a bright light in a dark room. Life is hard. Even on good days when what you see is consistent with whatever lurks behind that careful facade, even then words that remind you that something you did mattered are essential to our survival. Go write and deliver that thank you note. Go. Save someone. ",
