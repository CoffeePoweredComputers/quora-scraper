            "answer_text": "This is not going to sound pleasant, but the fact is that if you are asking you are not sure yourself. There's no context for what the issues you are talking about are such as financial, child stance, job, family, adultery, or anything of the sort. I can say having a baby right now is very bad advise. If you both are having long term marriage issues then adding a baby to the mix would be adding fuel to a fire plus it may compromise your health/ finances. A marriage vow renewal has no legal standing beyond a social one. If you are feeling unsure DO NOT have a baby with him. A baby cannot be undone, your entire life you will be connected both to the baby and the father even if you give it up for adoption. Honestly him throwing 3 very costly decisions very spur of the moment like this says that he does not value your input. If you feel trapped to say yes then it is not an offer. If you two were in good standing with each other this decision would be a clear yes at least on vows and getaway. All in all I like the another commenters response that you should attend couple's therapy. My best advice is to tell him not right now, and to tell him you need to work on you guys' issues rather than adding a baby to the mix. Also Do bring up past issues especially if they are relevant to the current issue at hand, but do not accuse. If you still want to be with him go to therapy and work on the problems don't slap a bandaid on it that a vow renewal ceremony will do. Honestly all 3 together sounds very shady it sounds like he is trying to trap you or at least guilt you into staying. If you are on birth control make sure that it is away from his hands because he may or may not sabotage it if you say no if he fears you may leave him. ",

Does he know what the issues ( you ladies throw so much in that nothing ever gets sorted) Baby, I absolutely would not do that. I think if you don\u2019t go then you might as well pack a case because he will see that as a massive sign that you don\u2019t want him. Learn to adjust him, you ladies talk too much and are nicer to your dogs. He needs training just like a dog but you can\u2019t do it in one argument. With a dog you may dominate the door area then move to something else when river gets it. I\u2019d suggest a man is no different. Enjoy your holidays, get a new cossie so his babe is the best on the beach.. he\u2019ll like that . Good luck ",

If you have a baby on this trip, that will make it more difficult for you to leave. Most couples would not have a baby in the middle of a marriage crisis. \u201cListen, Joanne. You are twenty one now. Your daddy and I really did not want another child. But we went through a crisis in our marriage, so we decided to have you to divert our attention away from our marriage problems.\u201d Your husband is very worried, that you will throw the towel into the ring and leave. That is why he is bribing you to stay. But bribing your partner to stay, will not solve any problems. You will have to go through a process of negotiation to remove the barriers and the miscommunications to get on the same page again. Maybe you can do that between the two of you. Maybe it is time for marriage counseling. But it sure ain\u2019t time to (methaphorically)put a suitcase full of money on the table to bribe the other partner into doing your bidding! Especially not, if a baby gets involved as a \u201clightning rod\u201d to mitigate the pain of it\u2019s parents, when the marital lightning strikes! Greetings, Robert. ",

Renewing your vows is nice, but the time for it is when you're not having issues. A baby is also nice, but won't fix the problems. I'm not an expert, but taking a trip to renew your vows and conceive a child sounds like a way to trap you, not fix things. ",

I mean, do you lose less if you step back now or later, after you have both tried for a reconciliation. ",
