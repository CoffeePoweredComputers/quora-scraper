            "answer_text": "detailed physical traits. When the text is so descriptive, it is very easy fo the readers to visualise the appearance of a character. Especially when there are specific words to indicate the location and position, like where exactly a mole is on the face or where the brows start and end, the readers are navigated to follow the writers path to create the character in mind.Vivid description of the characters action. Verbs help. And words to show the strength and extend. Same as the appearance, it is there for readers to visualise so that the character seems like right in front of their eyes.Relationships with others. A very real character has clear and mutually involved relationship. How the character thinks of another character and how they receive each other\u2019s thoughts, how the character acts towards the other one, and how they respond and react back. This allows the readers to link the character to a real person in their own daily life, and thinking the character so familiar and may just appear in the next second.Give the character a valid and reasonable motive in whatever doing. This requires the writer to offer more background information of a character and the experiences had been encountered. Knowing the background of the character, the readers will understand the way the how the character behaves, and showing more sympathy towards the character, as they can even relate the character to themselves and add on more personal illustrational stories.",

            "answer_text": "Positive and negative traits make a book character feel real. I have read some fiction stories where the main character is made perfect, meaning that they don\u2019t make mistakes, everybody loves them, they\u2019re usually very attractive and funny. Or, in a reverse way, the main character is going through a lot of hardships, everybody hates them, they\u2019re not as attractive as others, mute and depressed. To make a real, relatable character you have to let them make mistakes, have imperfections in their personalities and looks, show both the good and bad aspects of their lives. Sometimes you have to let the main character be the villain, because in reality you\u2019re not always right in other people\u2019s eyes. ",

Most of the characters have at least one major flaw or a few minor ones. That\u2019s why we cried when they died. It gives them depth. I wouldn\u2019t feel connected to someone if they were smart, funny, pretty, and anything anyone would want to be. Even in video games we tend to pick characters of love them more if they aren\u2019t perfect. Overwatch demonstrates this. Most characters have been hurt at some point in their life or are absolutely insane. We know people that (on a smaller scale) are crazy or hurt, emotionally. So we feel more connected and love them more. ",

If you\u2019ve followed a character for a while, say Harry Potter or Hercule Poirot or whoever these people are in Friends, do you feel like you know them the way you know your best pal from high school?
