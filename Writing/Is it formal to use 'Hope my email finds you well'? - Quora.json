            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a bit formal, a bit old-fashioned, and perfectly fine in the right context. That greeting dates back to a time when your letter might have found its recipient either Ill or deceased. A time when there were no phones, no social media, no online search for obituaries. Illness and \u201cearly\u201d death were all too common, and the school friend you had not seen for 5 years, but who you hoped might help you find a position in his firm, might have been dead for two or three years by the time your letter found him. Does the phrase have the same resonance today? Probably not. But its intention can be as benign and genuine as if it had been written 200 years ago. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a bit formal in an email. Phrases like that in snail mail evolved because the communication rate was slow. It would often be weeks or months between letters, so it was normal to mention significant life events\u2014significant changes could have happened. With email, the delivery time is negligible\u2014less than a few seconds, usually\u2014which means the communication rate really only limited by how fast you can type (and how willing you are to communicate). It\u2019s unlikely conditions can have changed much. If your communication with the person is rather infrequent, it\u2019s still a bit formal\u2014but formality isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, there, either. ",
