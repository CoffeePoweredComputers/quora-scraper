            "answer_text": "Tie it to value. Without more information, here is the theme for you to consider... Prove the value of your request as objectively as possible. Business exists to make money (whether for owners, individuals, shareholders, etc.), so funds are usually only allocated where value exists at multiples of the funding amount. For example, are you asking for funds to launch a new project? Then show your boss the proposed outcome, data from other organizations launching similar projects, etc. that illustrates how the investment of funds now will yield a much more valuable return. Or, for another example, are you asking for a personal raise? Show your boss, as objectively as possible, the value you\u2019re creating in your workplace. You should be able to prove your value at multiples of your proposed pay and raise, because obviously a company has a lot of overhead, risk, and would ultimately make no money if it paid everyone equivalent to what they produce. (I point that out because I commonly hear \u201cI created X in value, so I should get a bonus of X\u201d but that argument misses the point of business. What not to do\u2026 Do not make it a subjective request. \u201cThis project would be cool\u2026\u201d or \u201cI work really hard\u2026\u201d or other subjective, non-valuable justifications do not give your boss a reason to invest funds into whatever your request is. There needs to be objective indication of a return for your boss. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not clear what you are asking for and why. From a comment you replied to you mentioned your wife\u2019s computer course, but that doesn\u2019t explain why you would be asking your boss, unless you are asking to borrow the money or obtain a loan - unless your wife is also an employee. Without knowing your relationship with your boss and the nature of your job, it\u2019s hard to give a good answer. If you are asking for an advance on your salary, you could explain that you have been a loyal employee who is helping their wife get computer skills and that you would be grateful for an advance on your expected salary, and would repay the loan. If you are asking just for a loan, then you could write a letter asking your boss if he would be willing to help you raise funds for your wife to take this course, and lay out a schedule for repayment of the loan, and add an additional fee for interest on the loan. For both, you would need to justify why you are asking them, and how you are going to repay the loan. May I suggest you practice how you would ask someone to do this, and find a way to come up with the words that you could use in a letter. It is better for it to sound natural, like you are asking personally. Write out some ways you would ask in person and practice saying them to see how they sound. And once they sound good to you - and you might try getting someone to listen and see how it sounds to them - then write it out as a letter, and hope for the best. ",
