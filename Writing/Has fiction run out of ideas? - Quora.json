            "answer_text": "Fiction has not run out of ideas and fiction will never run out of ideas. One person cannot ever hope to learn all the ideas fiction has had, much less the ideas that are yet to be. The public\u2019s tolerance for new fiction, however, has some limits. They like familiar things with a minor twist, so that\u2019s what sells, so that\u2019s what gets promoted, so that\u2019s what sells again and the cycle continues. An alternative way to look at it is fiction never had original ideas. Basically anything we\u2019ve done, Shakespeare did before us and he ripped off Ovid so it\u2019s all a rehash anyway. Read Joe Campbell for more on that theory. Either way, if you want more interesting, new feeling fiction, you\u2019re going to get away from the Summer blockbuster and the NYT bestseller list, and browse the Indy films, the fringe graphic novels, the dark corners of the novel scene. You\u2019re going to take some risks, and read and watch a few entries of dubious taste before you kind your fictional kink. Have fun. ",

            "answer_text": "I like to think that the void in which writers pull their ideas from is as limitless as the future. We can never know what sort of motivation or inspiration lies before us. On the other hand, I think that most movies now have really stupid names. Not that they are running out of ideas, they just are not coming up with very creative names. ",

As long as there are human beings alive anywhere in this world, there will be ideas, there will be a story, there will be fiction. Creativity is endless. ",
