            "answer_text": "Yes, it is real. I\u2019ve experienced in my hobby writing (science fiction/horror) and professional writing (technical). I\u2019ve occasionally had a story flow and then realize I don\u2019t know what to do after reaching this point. What is a good way to tie up the loose ends? How do I get from this great action scene to the ending I have imagined? What are these other characters doing, and should I show it to the reader? I periodically interview other writers for my N3F and Liberty Island Magazine columns. Sometimes writers get a great idea for a novel or story but may not be able to get the structure or details to crystallize. For some, it means the story sits for weeks or months. For others, they\u2019re asking for ideas after banging their head on the keyboard for a few hours. I run into it professionally from time to time, though that\u2019s less of an issue because of how much detail generally comes with the request. For example, someone asked for a 500 word article on supercars. OK, what can I write about that includes these key terms and hasn\u2019t been done a hundred times over? Or I\u2019m asked to write yet another plumbing article. We\u2019ve already discussed what shouldn\u2019t be do-it-yourself and what signs of impending plumbing problems are. What else can I do that isn\u2019t a rehash? It isn\u2019t a matter of will for most writers. I want to get the story done and submitted. Or I want to get the article done so I can send it in and get paid. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps this could be called Editor\u2019s Block as writing includes this activity as well. Being upbeat and creative, or business-like and creative, can lead to an initial momentum, but the next day can be full of frets and frowns. Some traumatic experiences sabotage us\u2026 and yes, we need to get back on track, but getting back on track isn\u2019t always that easy. Imagine it like there\u2019s hardly any feedback or upvotes or no income paying for our writing to continue. I\u2019ve had poverty shoved done my throat sideways for decades. I kept going until I had nothing left to pay for the expenses to distribute my thoughts to others. Later on, family finances improved. So there I was paying out the extra for various ways to improve. I had to get larger TVs and PC monitors and better white QWERTY keyboards, basic reading glasses to help me focus on the text better. So as I could pay for the computer and Internet age I wasn\u2019t going to suffer writer\u2019s block any further? : No, I\u2019ve had times I simply got on with life instead. When you\u2019ve written about 3,000 poems, you\u2019re not in a damned hurry to write another 3,000 poems. Same with writers who think that way, too. \u2018Why worry about a thing?\u2019 as the pop song says. Do we really NEED to write? Are we somehow addicted? Or do we feel it\u2019s our destiny? Maybe we\u2019ve got a few years left in us? Should we invest more time writing or not? This is where the nagging doubts can undermine the good that only we can do. : Do we want to make money, help Mankind, or both? Whatever the motivations are, we put in the hours at the expense of our lives and our time left on this Earth. We either retire or we return to write another day. : denismartindale (co)(uk) : ",

But my boss, which believe it or not is my journal, won't have any of it. If I don't want to write or am blocked or just cant think of anything, I have to give my journal an explanation why. My journal is heartless, ruthless even. It's wants every little detail as to why I don't want to write, or am blocked, etc. so I tell my journal why and why not and this and that and by the time I'm done making excuses and such I'm back to writing because I'm tired of explaining everything to my journal. I write in my journal first thing every morning and even then if I can't come up with anything I have to explain why! It gets me out of my block almost everytime. Except for those days I just absolutely refuse to write like a 2 year old refusing to nap. I just write, \u201cNot today journal, not today!!!\u201d But, most of the time it pulls me back to what I'm suppose to be doing. ",
