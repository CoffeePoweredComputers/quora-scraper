            "answer_text": "What tense is preterite? It is what we call the \u201csimple past\u201d in English: I came, I went, I bought a book, etc. The preterite case is called different things in different languages - in French, for example, it\u2019s called the \u201chistoric past\u201d - le pass\u00e9 historique; in Italian, it's called passato remoto -The \u201cremote past\u201d. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the term \u201cpreterite\u201d is only used when talking about its equivalent tense in Spanish, (pret\u00e9rito). Portuguese (pret\u00e9rito perfeito) and Catalan (preterit). ",
