            "answer_text": "Step 1 Before you try to remember the shape of a Chinese character, make sure you have borne the basic strokes firmly in your mind, as is shown in the following table.  If you have no problems with this step, jump it. Step 2 Get used to the right order of strokes. In principle, write from left to right, up to down, outside to inside (depending on the structure). You can find the exact order on internet. You can start from radicals and simple characters, thus later you\u2019ll be able to easily combine them together into new characters. Take the radical \u201c\u9485\u201d, which comes from \u201c\u91d1\u201d (metal, gold) for example, the right order of strokes is \u201c\u6487\uff0c\u6a2a\uff0c\u6a2a\uff0c\u6a2a\uff0c\u7ad6\u63d0\u201d. And for a simple character \u201c\u4e2d\u201d (middle, center), the right order is \u201c\u7ad6(short)\uff0c\u6a2a\u6298\uff0c\u6a2a\uff0c\u7ad6\u201d . If you put them together, you have \u201c\u949f\u201d (clock). Applying the aforementioned principal, write \u201c\u9485\u201d on the left side first, then \u201c\u4e2d\u201d on the right. This will largely reduce your work. There\u2019re several different kinds of basic structure of Chinese characters. left - right \u5403\u3001 \u559d\u3001\u73a9\u3001\u4ece\u3001\u4f60\u3001\u8bed\u3001\u6c49\u2026left - middle- right \u6e38\u3001\u5012\u3001\u6e58\u3001\u6811\u3001\u884d\u2026up - down \u5434\u3001\u5b57\u3001\u5b66\u3001\u5168\u3001\u8981\u2026up - middle - down \u51f3\u3001\u58f6\u3001\u610f\u3001\u7ffc\u2026(not many of them)surrounded \u56f4 \u3001\u56de\u3001\u56da\u3001\u56fd\u3001\u56f0\u2026half - surrounded \u8d77\u3001\u8d76\u3001\u8fc7\u3001\u9006\u3001\u540c\u3001\u5efa\u3001\u533b\u2026other (combinations of 1\u20136) \u60f3\u3001\u82b1\u3001\u7b52\u3001\u5a31\u2026 (They are not complex as long as you regard some small radicals together as one bigger part)If you have already mastered this step, congratulations! You now have the basic skill to identify and remember a larger number of characters. Step 3 Many characters can be split into a radical indicating its meaning, the other its procunciation. For instance, \u201c\u949f\u201d (clock) is made out of metal, so it has a rdical \u201c\u9485\u201d indicating metal. Its pronunciation is identical with \u201c\u4e2d\u201d. Therefore, by asscociating the radicals and other parts, it can be easier when you try to write down a word (consider which catagory it lies in: water \u6c35, speaking \u8ba0, metal \u9485, person \u4ebbetc.) or guess the meaning of a character you don\u2019t know. This skill will allow you to learn more efficiently. However, language learning is all about work after all. So the most widely used method, dictation, is a must. You can give yourself a dictation by recording the characters (better words) beforehand, and compare what you have written carefully with the correct character in large size. Collect those you made mistakes on, and include them in the next dictation. This process can be painstaking, but it works well! If you have interest It\u2019s a good way to learn characters by improving your handwriting. Find a script font (say. from a copybook for callography) that pleases you, and just write as much as you can. Not a suitable method for starters, but a good way to get a insight of the charm of characters. Have fun learning Chinese! ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you need to know that there are 2 types of Chinese (Hanzi), Simplified Chinese (SC), which is used by Mainland Chinese. Another one is Traditional Chinese (TC), which is mainly used by people who live in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. If you talk with guys from Mainland China in writing, SC is a good choice. But if you need to discuss something with people who are from 2 SARs and Taiwan. TC is better. In a nutshell, it is up to who you'd like to chat with. In handwriting, TC is more complicated than SC (that's why we call it \"Simplified Chinese\" :) ), for example: \u4f53(SC, meaning: body) and \u9ad4(TC); \u8fc1(SC, meaning: move) and \u9077(TC). However, some characters are the same, such as those are used in number system. Basically, one Hanzi consists of some strokes(except \"\u4e00\", it only has 1 stroke). It is similar with English Words, an English word is a combination of letters, and one Hanzi is a combination of strokes, the difference between them is that letters represent pronunciation as well, yet strokes not. Therefore, if you'd like to write awesome Chinese characters on paper. your first task is to practise writing strokes.Wikipedia has some details regarding strokes, here is the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJKV_character)Buying a notebook, and imitating in accordance with the table of basic strokes are very important for the beginners. Then, you can think more about how to write Hanzi after you can write all strokes rapidly. Now, you should focus more on the structure of each Hanzi for the reason that Hanzi is a form of two dimension character, you need to put each stroke into a \"relatively correct position\". It sounds like building a house, you need to put everything into right places. To practice this, you need a special notebook, which is called Tian Zi Ge. @Kevin Ciel Jobs' answer has already shown it to you. At this stage, you still need samples for imitation, to get the sense of the structure of Hanzi.  After getting the sense of the structure, you can find more Chinese characters to do more practice without Tian Zi Ge, it only helps you to get the sense of the structure of Hanzi, don't waste much money on this kind of special notebook once you almost get the that sense. Practising on notebooks that we commonly use is completely okay at that time. Finally, here are some tips: Imitating is very very important, even for Chinese themselves. Exercise books, which are also called Zi Tie, are helpful. They are good samples to imitate.Doing lots of exercise on strokes, it is really boring, and takes you much time. But trust me. You will get more return from the practice, it really helps you a lot on the understanding of the structure of Hanzi. You can do the practice by using pencil at first, because it is convenient for you to correct mistakes, especially when you do the practice by using Zi Tie.",
