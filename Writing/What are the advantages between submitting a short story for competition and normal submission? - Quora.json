            "answer_text": "In my attempt to give a comparison, I'll assume that the competition in question and the platform you are submitting to have similar reach in terms of readers, and have credible judges/editors who'll evaluate and publish your writing. Competition Advantages You get critical feedback on your work. Any good competition you'll submit to would have a readers' choice and judges' choice category. If you don't win, you can always ask the judges(privately over mails), where you went wrong and how to improve. If you didn't fare well in readers' choice category, you know they're not able to connect to your characters/writing and you'll know that you have to improve.You get to meet and connect with fellow writers. I've found great critique partners in competitions, and some brilliant writer's to follow.If you're really good, you'll find many followers, which is always a good thing.If you manage to win a competition, it serves as a big confidence booster, pushes you to write more, and maintain (and better) the level of quality that you have just shown.Though submissions have reach too, the engagement with readers is just not on the same level as competitions. Readers hope to read get better quality content at competitions, and would evaluate your writing with that standard in mind.Competitions are short-lived, submissions are mostly on-going year round things. So competitions are promoted much more, and drive new readers in the process, giving you wider readership.Rewards. If you win, you'll the prize, which is always welcome. :)Disadvantages If you don't take criticism well, don't submit to competitions. People often point out why they didn't like a part of the piece. Some will genuinely try to be constructive, some are just plain rude. You need to be strong enough to take it.It's very hard to judge any creative work. There might not be anything wrong with your work, and it just might not be the thing the judges like. Everyone feels/reacts to things differently. But often, participants lash out when they not win, thinking my piece was certainly better than this crap. If you really feel that you've written your best work, and it's true to yourself, don't take the results to heart and just keep writing.  Submission Advantages A published submission always looks good on your portfolio. A competition entry where you didn't win anything - Not so much.Submissions don't get that many critiques, as the reader segment includes very few who are writers. If they like your writing they'll comment/share it, if they don't, they'll move on to other things. So if you're not looking for feedback, it's best for you.If you get published by a medium that only publishes select articles, it's always a good feeling.Disadvantages Pretty much the advantages of Competitions. You don't get quality feedback, and won't get to meet new authors.Submissions might have large volumes of subscribers to mail/RSS feeds. But few, take time to comment/contact the author. Chances are you'll never know how many people have read your content, and sans feedback/results, you're left in the dark. It can get depressing. If you're starting out, I'd recommend participating in competitions. They really do help you get better. Soak in all the feedback you get, and work on it. Make good writer friends. It'll help you in one way or the other. Even if it doesn't, conversations are seldom boring with writers. :) If you've already achieved quite a bit, and are confident that you've fully developed your voice/style. Go for submissions, as the only thing that should matter to you is a better portfolio. If you can, do both. One should never pass up on an excuse to write more. :)Hope this helps. Happy writing! ",
