            "answer_text": "What is the argument? So what is the real question you are trying to address? Are you trying to argue that X is a good teacher, bad teacher, needs to change something, needs to continue doing something, etc.? With any kind of writing, you have to brainstorm the topic. What\u2019s the question you are trying to answer? Then sit down and make a list to address the argument you are trying to make. Pull from that list the most important or the weightiest of supports for your essay. Then take that list and put them into the order of weakest point to strongest point. (By doing it this way, you leave the reader with the strongest impression which stays with them.) With the list which is now the body of your paper, you need to come up with examples to illustrate your points. Shoot for the bare minimum of one example, but you would be better served with two or three good examples to support your claims. You have enough to probably start the intro and write a thesis. Try using an anecdote involving the teacher to illustrate something related to your topic. So if you are saying that Teacher X is deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize, then show that teacher doing something deserving of such an award. Bring in your thesis, \u201cTeacher X truly deserves the Nobel Peace Prize since he has shown selfless devotion to his students, offered new and innovative methods of teaching calculus and gives hand of his salary to the needy.\u201d Then you start writing the body paragraphs. One on the selfless devotion, one on the methods of teaching and one on the fact that he gives away his salary to the needy. Then the conclusion. Traditionally, you re-state the thesis in a new way, and draw your conclusions about the teacher. ",
