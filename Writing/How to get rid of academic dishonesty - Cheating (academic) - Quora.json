            "answer_text": "You can get rid of academic dishonesty by making an honest academic commitment; you can't get rid of it by only talking to the people who will check your statements.

It is not only academics who are guilty of this act. When politicians make a commitment and then break it, the person on the receiving end often doesn't feel particularly victimized. However, this too fails to do justice to the situation. We want to punish our leaders for personal treachery, but not for betraying the public's trust! ",
