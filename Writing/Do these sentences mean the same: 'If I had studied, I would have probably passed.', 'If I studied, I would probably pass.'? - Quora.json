            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t mean the same thing. The first example is talking about an event that has happened, the conditional in the past. (Grammar wonks call this the \u201cthird conditional\u201d.) The implication of this sentence is that (at a specific point in the not necessarily recent past) the speaker took and exam, failed it, and acknowledges (in retrospect) that s/he didn\u2019t study enough for it. The second example is talking about an event that is at some point in the real or imagined (but by implication near) future. (Grammar wonks call this the \u201csecond conditional\u201d.) The implication of this sentence is that the speaker is considering whether or not to take an exam, and weighing up the amount of work involved in relation to the probable outcome. It has a more speculative tone to it because the use of the conditional word would makes it sound as if (a) it\u2019s not certain that the speaker is going to take the exam; and (b) is not sure of the outcome if s/he does. If you say \u201cIf I study, I will pass\u201d that has more of a definite feeling. (Grammar wonks call this the \u201cfirst conditional\u201d.) This means: I\u2019m going to take an exam (it\u2019s a reasonably certain event in the predictable future); and provided I put enough effort in, it seems likely that I will succeed. Grammar wonks also refer to the \u201cZero conditional\u201d which is used when describing when one thing is the logical consequence of another but doesn\u2019t have any (or much) unpredictability: \u201cIf you drop a glass out of a third-floor window onto concrete, it will break.\u201d ",

The 1st one is positioned after a test which was failed, and gives the excuse for the failure as not having studied \u2014- IF I HAD (in the past before the test) studied, I believe I would have passed \u2014- but I didn\u2019t, so I failed.
