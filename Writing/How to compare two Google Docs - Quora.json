            "answer_text": "If the two Google Docs are similar in content, copy and paste the contents on top of each other in a new blank google doc and go to File> See Revision History to view the highlighted changes. Update:This doesn't work in practice as it just crosses out everything you pasted over. In theory, google's built-in revision history for documents handles this problem from ever presenting itself IF the document was created in google docs to begin with.  A google doc by design has only one version and -isn't ever copied.  It's shared and updated only by those with edit access.  All user edits are tracked with time stamps and reverting back and forth in time is a breeze.  Spotting what someone did to a google document is simple and you should (in theory) never need to have 2 separate versions of a google document.  This doesn't solve the issue of migrating a bunch of word documents into the cloud however and seeing the differences between them.  MS Word is designed to have multiple saved versions of a document filling up your email and your hard drive.  So, if you google \"comparing 2 word documents to see the difference\" you will find a few solutions to the problem because, that's a core problem with Microsoft word. ",

I have tried some other tools I found on Google but I stick with this one as it has an online version so you don\u2019t have to install anything;it\u2019s free;it\u2019s simple visually (not geeky);also it has shortcuts which is useful when you decide to merge to documents.",
