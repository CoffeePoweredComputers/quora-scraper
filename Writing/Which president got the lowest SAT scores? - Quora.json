            "answer_text": "Hmm, this is relatively difficult to answer since the SAT has only been instituted during this 1900\u2019s so that would make it difficult to compare SAT scores. Not to mention not many president\u2019s have disclosed their scores either. However, I will answer your question subjectively based on the intelligence of past and present president\u2019s. First on my list is probably John Quincy Adams. He was an exceptionally smart guy who went to Harvard Law school and achieved diplomatic success. Rumor has it that his IQ score was around 180 and that\u2019s comparable to some geniuses. Second on my list is Thomas Jefferson. He was an inventor, multilingual, and a president of the United States. If that doesn\u2019t impress you, then I don\u2019t know what will. Third is James Madison. I\u2019m quite frankly most impressed with his work as a political author for the federalist papers. Rumor also has it that he has an IQ of 155 which is exceptionally smart. As for the Presidents who I think would score the lowest on the SATs I would probably say Donald Trump. Say what you want about him, I just think he\u2019s an idiot. His professors at Columbia said he was the laziest kid in the class. And for crying out loud, if you don\u2019t believe climate change is real, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. Two other presidents who id think wouldn\u2019t do well on the SATs is probably Andrew Jackson and Ulysses S. Grant. My reasoning for Andrew Jackson is that he grew up on a rural farm and had no formal education. He was simply a war hero populist president who broke the standards of what a president should be. As for Ulysses S. Grant, yes he was a war hero, but that doesn\u2019t equate to being smart. His whole presidency was plagued by corruption. His military successes were luck driven unlike his counterpart Robert E. Lee who was a genuine military genius. Again, these are my subjective rankings. I think in general, all president\u2019s leading up to Andrew Jackson were all very smart individuals who would have no problem acing the SATs. ",

            "answer_text": "When Reagan and George H.W. Bush were applying to universities, there wasn\u2019t a need for the SAT. So the only Presidents for whom an SAT test would have been a thing were Clinton, George W. Bush, Obama, and Trump, which is a fairly small pool. Further complicating an answer is that nobody releases SAT scores. Heck, I would doubt that my wife even knows my SAT scores, and we\u2019ve been married for a while now. So with those limiting factors understood, we can take guesses: Clinton went to Georgetown in the 1960\u2019s so must have done alright. He later won a Rhodes scholarship and went to Oxford to study PPE, so he was no dummy.George W. Bush went to Philips Academy in Massachusetts for high school, and from there to Yale. Again, he must have done alright to get into Yale.Obama went on full scholarship to Occidental College and then transferred to Columbia as a junior. Again, he was clearly no idiot.Trump went the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, and then to Fordham in 1964. Fordham is not a bad school, but it is not as good as the other schools listed. He then transferred to Penn, which is not trivial, and clearly shows some ability. However, in 2015, Trump\u2019s then lawyer, Michael Cohen, threatened both Fordham and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released Trump\u2019s academic records. He has also threatened legal action if anyone releases his SAT scores.[1]Given that, the most likely guess, and it is a guess, is that it is Trump.
