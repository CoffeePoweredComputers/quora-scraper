            "answer_text": "\u201cDon\u2019t just read the easy stuff. You may be entertained by it, but you will never grow from it\u201d Reading a psychology book isn\u2019t enough. Applying the principles into our daily life is what makes the book the best book. Here are some best psychology books for beginners which I found to be changing the way we think. Blink - Malcolm Gladwell.One of the best psychology book that I have ever read. The book is a collection of many short stories showcasing how people are able to develop a sense about things, it becomes one of the more interesting books on the unconscious because of this.  Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel KahnemanThis book challenges the various cognitive biases people subconsciously possess. The book states that our mind are composed of two parts - an instinctive and primal section, and a more critical and rational section, together with their manifestations in decision making will give you an \u201caha\u201d moment of relatability.  Emotional Intelligence: Why it can matter more than IQ - Daniel GolemanAnother one of my personal recommendations. You may have noticed in recent years the fading of the IQ, and the emergence of this new theory of EQ or emotional intelligence. As the name implies emotional intelligence is our ability to identify and handle not only our own emotions but the emotions of others, and our ability to handle situations according to these principles.  The happiness hypothesis - Jonathan HeidtThe author brings to light the beliefs of ancient systems and puts them under the scrutiny of modern science. The book shows the flaws and misconceptions of various systems and practices as well as their truths. Whilst offering a tangible solution to the many vices and privations which trouble the modern person.  Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Since a beginner has more idea of the physical aspects of psychology and has most probably observed the play of psychology in the physical world than a mental one, I would strongly recommend starting with something that guides you on body language and related behaviour. Jumping into something deep like Interpretation Of Dreams might sound attractive but it will hardly push you to take a second book on psychology before long. A book on body language will be easier on the mind as most examples and topics will be relatable and easy to understand. You will find that you have observed that behaviour in the people around you and even in yourself. This will help generate interest and keep you hooked. You will face a lot of \u201cAah\u2026that\u2019s why...hmm\u2019\u2019 moments during the read. That is why a book on how your thinking affects your body language and more importantly is revealed in physical gestures will appeal to you. Other than that, learning about body language will be a great booster for a better social life. Imagine you knew from the cues that the person is giving through physical gestures, whether he or she is interested in talking to you. And much more\u2026 I started my reading of psychology with a book on body language too. It was Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons To Master The Silent Language by James Borg. It taught me the basics of psychology behind different body gestures and kept me rolling for more in psychology. Hope it helps. Best of luck!!! ",
