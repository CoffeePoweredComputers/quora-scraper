            "answer_text": "For me, the big killer of motivation for writing fiction is a combination of hoping to make money and realizing that the competition in numerical terms is astronomical. The more my heart goes after the business aspect, the less I feel like writing. To stay motivated, I choose to not care about making money. I also stay out of bookstores. The endless rows of novels tell a sad statistical reality that, frankly, I don\u2019t want my subconscious mind to know. I focus on writing a story that one and only one person, hopefully one of my descendants, will someday read. She or he will find my work compelling, thought provoking, impossible to put down, and beneficial to practical living. Being helpful is the key to motivation for me. Writing becomes a spiritual endeavor, almost altruistic. The trick is conveying genuinely useful insight through the story. To find useful wisdom, I read non-fiction, watch YouTube videos, try new things (excluding opiates, methamphetamines, etc.) and seek the rare gems of obscure knowledge that various scientists, gurus, philosophers and thinkers have found and shared during this brief patch of recorded human history. The fallacy to avoid as a writer is assuming that anything amazing and life-changing must have already reached the public\u2019s attention. Obscure concepts must be mundane, worthless or impractical. The universe consists of matter and energy alone, therefore nothing is weirdly special. The opposite is true. Consciousness is fundamental. Free will is alive and well. At least pretend that I\u2019m right about this, because much of humanity\u2019s astonishing, useful knowledge remains buried away in books that approximately no one has read. And materialists did not write most of it. I think the obscurity of human wisdom exists because journalists, with rare exception (Gram Hancock, for one) are too busy stoking the outrage machine of political \u201cnews\u201d to read and report on, for instance, a book about finding joy and purpose hidden in modern genetics. (Read Signature in the Cell, by Stephen Meyer, PhD.) As to the self-confidence it takes to keep writing: If you\u2019re hoping to make money from fiction writing, it would seem there isn\u2019t much need for self-confidence. The vast majority of fiction writers who have \u201cmade it\u201d report ongoing ups and downs of self-confidence and doubt. Yet they plow on, writing rapidly (especially the indies) to keep new product available to readers. The joy of past success spurs them on, but it doesn\u2019t quench self-doubt or the fear of the next novel being a flop. In fact, some share this fear openly on videos and podcasts, solidifying the almost personal relationship they have with their readers. Lemons to lemonade. If you don\u2019t care about making money, then your self-confidence can come from having something that you know will be useful to your one reader someday. That young woman or man, perhaps not yet born, will have a better life because you have provided guidance, an attitude, or a technique of some sort that has helped you find your way in life. If this motivation for writing is enough for you, your chances of financial success may improve because the quality and inherrent value of your work will be your only concern. Self-conscious worry about how your sentences will sound to a well-read critic won\u2019t be a factor. And since you\u2019ll know beyond doubt that you\u2019re conveying something of great value, self-confidence about your message will keep you motivated and writing. ",
