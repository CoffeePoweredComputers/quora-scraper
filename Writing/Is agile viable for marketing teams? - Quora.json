            "answer_text": "Yes, agile is viable for marketing teams. Let\u2019s walk through some of the benefits your team will experience as a result. Release Work Faster According to an AgileSherpas 2020 State of Agile Marketing report, 53% of Agile marketing teams achieve faster time to get things released. When teams are able to break out work into smaller deliverables, it improves their ability to pivot should things come up. Take 2020 for example. Once COVID-19 hit, every marketing playbook went out the door. Teams that were working through Agile had an easier time adjusting than those working in, for example, Waterfall. They already had the processes and mindset in place to break work out into smaller deliverables and deliver them often. Identify and Tackle Roadblocks Sooner If you\u2019re working in Agile, you\u2019re likely also running scrum meetings. These daily standups are a great opportunity to bring up blockers and quickly discuss solutions to help minimize or remove interruptions in work. The best way to structure your scrum meeting agenda is to include four prompts: BlockersWhat did you do yesterday?What do you want to accomplish today?How close are we to hitting our sprint goals?When you cover these four points every day as a team, you\u2019ll be able to identify roadblocks as they appear and make the necessary adjustments to remove them. Change Gears Quickly and Effectively Similar to the eBook example shared earlier, when marketing teams are able to deliver more small-scale projects, and frequently, they\u2019ll have more data at their disposal when analyzing what\u2019s working (and what\u2019s not). If a campaign didn\u2019t land, or a certain channel wasn\u2019t driving the leads you thought it would, you\u2019re able to easily switch gears by your next sprint. Where some teams would lose a whole quarter\u2019s work, Agile teams might only get pushed back 2 weeks or 1 month (depending on how long your sprints are). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I did use Scrum to some extent in my Marketing of 6 team members (incl. me) nearly 10 years ago. The benefits I had particularly in my team were visible right away - even I was far away from the Scrum I would do today. ;-) Benefits included: Transparency - My team increased from 2 team members to 6 within a day. While I was not always sure, what my individual team member was doing on her daily work, I could get transparency with the team on daily work thanks to Daily Scrum, planning & retrospectives. Something, I immediately got, but also the team were enjoying: They mentioned to me, that thanks to those meetings, they could easier help each other to achieve the sprint goal - even it was not their specialty or key competence.Team empowerment - I had 2 young university graduates in the team, who started very shy and were not sure, how much they would be able to contribute. Thanks to the planning & retrospectives, they could make their own choices & decisions, which helped them to more and more speak up and take risks. They both together tried a startup right after leaving my team.Team alignment - As mentioned above, the team enjoyed the transparency and make them helping each other more. Therefore there was a constant clarity on the vision & goal of the team and they all contributed to the team.We ran Scrum in 2 week sprints, in which we planned on Monday mornings, had Daily Scrums ever late afternoon before heading home and a Review/Retrospective combined in the end of the Sprint. While we had not a clear vision on the product vision in the beginning (it developed into an implicit understanding), we had clear yearly goals, which I - in my role as PO - broke down into quarterly, monthly and then as team into Sprint goals. They were a bit KPI/Metric centric, but at least we had a transparency & clarity about it. So, yes it is possible and with some commitments and clarity you will get instant results. The teams usually like it, as the more creative they are, the more they value the diversity & feedback. If you do not have a huge team, I would not overthink too much on how to get started, but rather have a clarity on the sprint length and ensure, that you constantly come together to retrospect, but also plan for the future. Document your learnings and improvements and see how you can become better as a team. ",
