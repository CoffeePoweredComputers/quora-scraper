            "answer_text": "\"The Art of Immersion\" by Frank Rose. This a very good read; for a distinctly more practical view you could go to \"The Producer's Guide to Transmedia\" by Nuno Bernardo, on the other side will give you a more practical view of transmedia storytelling. \"A Creator's Guide to Transmedia Storytelling\" by Andrea Philip, keep a lookout on this book. \"One Year in Transmedia\", this is a book I just released and it's available as a free download here: http://cl.ly/Cxb3\"Convergence Culture\" by Henry Jenkins, this is a must read for every transmedia storyteller.",
