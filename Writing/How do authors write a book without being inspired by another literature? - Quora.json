            "answer_text": "Literature that we have known can inspire us in various ways. A single line may start for us a completely novel and interesting train of thought that leads to a book of our own. We may even have misunderstood what we read.We may read a novel or a story and disagree with it so strongly that it provokes us to write a book that illustrates our own view of the problem. Again, we may have misunderstood what we read.The plot structure of some much-loved book may give us an idea about how to structure a similar story of our own imagining.Experience of many books gives us a sense of form and technique for how to handle certain material or scenes, or how to structure a story. The understanding we obtain this way becomes part of our toolkit for writing.The sources that led us to such understanding might look like the contents of a small library \u2014 if you have read 500 novels, how to quantify the total contribution of each novel, unless it\u2019s truly technically innovative, such as is the case for Joyce\u2019s Ulysses or Proust\u2019s big novel? You can\u2019t.The key is to do your own thing, not imitate others. That doesn\u2019t mean you are like the Bible\u2019s Adam, and had no forebears. There have been a lot of literary giants in the past. You get the chance to see if you can climb onto their shoulders. It\u2019s disingenuous to think they didn\u2019t provide you a higher vantage point. But you don\u2019t need to be their sedulous ape, either.How we use this \u201cinspiration\u201d may surprise the reader. It is highly probable that no influence can be detected. The new book is, well, new. I have gotten into arguments with people about this issue before, and much of the source of argument comes from a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word \u201cinfluence.\u201d Many readers think \u201cinfluence\u201d means \u201cimitation.\u201d That is the most blatant form of influence, and not even an interesting example. The broader meaning, where experience and information and example shape our way of seeing things is a more subtle form of influence. On that basis, writers may say that they have never *imitated* any other work, but they would readily admit that they picked up this or that trick here, or picked up an idea there, or they feel close to the way writer <Z> tells a story. Subtle influence is unavoidable, and it may not be easily detectable. Imitation is often easily detectable. All of us have been influenced in subtle ways too numerous to be quantifiable unless we are the proverbial tabula rasa. A good many writers never imitate another writer or book. It\u2019s very easy to avoid conscious imitation. Just tell your own story. And as for inspiration in general, anything can inspire you, not just ideas from books. But books help to furnish more than a room \u2014 they also help to furnish your mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, I don\u2019t think an author has truly written a book without being inspired by another. It comes, conscious or unconsciously, as we read. However, it is true that authors may be inspired by various other instances, such as their own life experiences [ perhaps they have experienced something truly heartbreaking, heartwarming, extraordinary that is so different from everyone else\u2019s own personal story that their work becomes truly an original ]. Or, it could be that their creativity skills are far higher than the normal author and because it is so, they are able to create unique and out of the world characters that are truly amazing. ",
