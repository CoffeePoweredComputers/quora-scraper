            "answer_text": "There are plenty and I\u2019ve tested many. Not only will these put you on a better path for the rest of the year, but they\u2019ll position you for success once the new year begins. Here are the top 10 tools that I want you to focus on. 1. Google Analytics Why should you be using this free tool? The answer is simple: because you need to understand everything about your target audience and the people visiting your website. With Google Analytics installed, you can track data within a variety of categories: Real-TimeAudienceAcquisitionBehaviorConversionsFor example, the Acquisition tab will provide you with access to all types of traffic data. I suggest that you take a look at your traffic-based on channels. You\u2019ll see something like this:  With this data, you\u2019ll better understand where your traffic is coming from. You can then adjust your digital marketing strategy to take full advantage of your top channels. In this example, the website is receiving a lot of direct traffic. While that\u2019s great, it\u2019d be nice to increase the diversity a bit, maybe by focusing more time on organic search and social networks. Once you install Google Analytics, the tool does all of the work for you. Give it some time to collect enough data and then begin reviewing the results daily. 2. Moz Check My Listing Are you confident that your target audience are able to find you online? If you can\u2019t answer \u201cyes,\u201d without hesitation, something is wrong. Fortunately, you can address this issue with the help of the Moz Check My Listing tool. It\u2019s designed to show you how your business is listed online. More specifically, you can check your listing on Google, Bing and a variety of other local search engines. Getting started is as simple as plugging your information into this box:  At that point, the results are generated and you can then decide what to do next. Here\u2019s a sample results page for Petals & Stems Florist, in Dallas, Texas:  Your current score is important, as it shows how close you are to 100%. But, the tool doesn\u2019t stop there. As you scroll down the page, you\u2019re presented with four tabs: CompleteIncompleteInconsistentDuplicatesIn addition to reviewing the complete results, you want to pay attention to those that are incomplete. These are the results that need fixed immediately. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll see:  Best yet, there is a link to \u201cupdate listing\u201d or \u201ccreate listing.\u201d This makes it simple to quickly and efficiently take care of the problem. As a small, local business, you\u2019re faced with quite a bit of competition. If you can outdo your competitors, in regards to search engine optimization and digital marketing, you\u2019ll have a much better chance of reaching the top of your industry. Let the Moz Check My Listing tool provide you with an added boost. 3. Google PageSpeed Insights Does page speed matter, when it comes to SEO and search engine rankings? In the early days of search engine optimization, the answer was no. Today, however, this has all changed. Google has made it clear that site speed is used in web search ranking. Use the Google PageSpeed Insights tool, to ensure that your website isn\u2019t falling behind in this area. After entering your URL, the results page spits out a variety of information: SpeedUser ExperienceThings to Consider FixingThe speed results look like this:  You want your score to be as close to 100 as possible. If you find that it\u2019s anything less than that, don\u2019t hesitate to follow the guidelines under the \u201cconsider fixing\u201d headline. Pro tip: don\u2019t forget to check the speed for both mobile and desktop devices. You want to score high for both of these. 4. SimilarWeb Do you want to see how your website is performing across a variety of metrics? Are you interested in getting an inside view of your competition? SimilarWeb is not only a free tool for doing both these things, but it\u2019s one of the easiest to use. And, the data is presented in an easy-to-read format. A search for Helping You Succeed Through Online Marketing! provides information on a variety of traffic-related data.  There\u2019s a lot of information to soak up, so don\u2019t rush through the results page. Review each section in great detail, making note of any data relevant to your SEO campaign that you can use to improve your search engine optimization and marketing plan in the future. For example, I urge you to go over the \u201csearch\u201d data with a fine tooth comb. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll learn how much of a site\u2019s traffic comes from search, top keywords, keyword phrases, paid keywords and more.  It\u2019s not likely that you\u2019ll use SimilarWeb on a daily basis. But, it\u2019s definitely one of the best ways to keep an eye on the health of your website, while also tracking your top competitors. 5. SEO SiteCheckup Are you one of those people who think that search engine optimization is a complex, advanced process that can never be solved? I know where you\u2019re coming from. I used to be in the same position as you. But, through experience and the use of the right tools, things began to come together for me. One tool that I suggest you use is SEO SiteCheckup. It provides a variety of features, including, but not limited to: Analysis of SEO issuesSEO monitoringCompetition monitoringAbility to create SEO reportsIf you want to see what this tool is all about, get started by running your first free search. This is as simple as typing your URL into the search box on the home page. The results are listed for easy review:  If you\u2019re lucky, your website will receive a perfect score. This means that you\u2019re doing everything right, from an SEO perspective. Of course, this isn\u2019t something that you should expect. There\u2019s a good chance that you\u2019ll need to address at least one issue within your SEO campaign, such as the \u201cheadings status.\u201d Pro tip: running a site check-up is only the first step. If it turns up any problems, click the \u201chow to fix\u201d button, for advice on resolving the problem. With this digital marketing tool, you\u2019ll always know where your site stands, from an SEO perspective. If you follow the advice as outlined, you can rid your site of lingering SEO campaign problems, with the hopes of pushing towards the top of the search engine rankings. 6. Google Search Console Are you using this free and powerful search engnine optimization tool? I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have asked people if they are using Google Search Console, just to be surprised by their answer: no! Yet another free digital marketing tool by Google, this is one that will give you a clear idea of how your site is performing, and it\u2019s a must for every small business. The dashboard will give you a solid overview of your site\u2019s health:  This is a good jumping-off point, but you\u2019ll want to dig deeper. The search traffic tab, for example, can give you to information regarding: Search AnalyticsLinks to Your SiteInternal LinksManual ActionsInternational TargetingMobile UsabilitySearch analytics is one of my favorites, as it allows you to \u201canalyze your performance on Google Search.\u201d You can search for data in many ways:  Of course, Google Search Console is one of the best and most accurate ways of tracking links to your site. And. as you know, this is imperative to ranking high in the search engines. Be sure to track not only the number of links, but also how your data is linked and which pages have the most links. With Google Search Console, the more you dig, the more you\u2019ll find. And, remember this: your data is updated on the fly, so don\u2019t be afraid to review your dashboard at least once a day. 7. SpyFu Have you ever heard the saying \u201ckeep your friends close and your enemies closer?\u201d This isn\u2019t to suggest that your small business competitors are enemies, but instead to explain that it\u2019s a good idea to know what they\u2019re doing, in regards to search engine optimization and digital marketing. While there is a lot that you can do on your own, you only have so much time for tracking and reviewing your top competitors, as a small business. This is why you want to rely on a tool, like SpyFu. With this in your digital marketing toolbox, you can quickly see what your competitors are up to. Head to the tool\u2019s homepage and type in the URL of any website.  From there, run your search and wait for the information to be displayed (it only takes a couple of seconds.) If you wanted to learn more about my website, a search would turn up a report page that looks like this:  But, that\u2019s just the start. You can continue down the results page, collecting data related to: Shared keywordsTop keywordsRanking historyInbound linksSo, what if I know what the competition is doing? There\u2019s no doubt that you want to spend more time focused on the effectiveness of the SEO campaign of your small business and less time on the competition. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that you should turn a blind eye. With the help of SpyFu, you can do things, such as: Uncover new keywords to attempt to rank for.Determine if you or your competition are having more success for a particular keyword or keyword phrase.Learn more about a competitor\u2019s link profile, thus giving you the opportunity to secure the same links.Start with a couple of your top competitors and then move on from there. Soon enough, you\u2019ll know who your biggest threats are, when it comes to ranking your website. 8. Cyfe What method do you employ to track all of the data that\u2019s related to your business? Like many, you may not have an answer to this question. Instead, you move from one tool to the next, to pull data and review numbers. If you\u2019re tired of wasting time on this, you\u2019ll want to learn more about Cyfe. As one of the most user-friendly business dashboard solutions, you can get up and running in no time at all. And, since it\u2019s free of charge, you might as well give it a try. Cyfe sells itself as a tool that brings together all of your business metrics in one place. You don\u2019t have to separately log into each application to track your data. This is the old school way of doing things. The main reason that I like Cyfe is the fact that it has one of the largest integration libraries of all of the business dashboard providers. It connects to a long list of social networks and applications, such as: TwitterFacebookYouTubeGoogle AnalyticsStripePinterestZendeskSalesforceShopifyAnd, that\u2019s just the start. Chances are good that if you\u2019re pulling data from a source, it can be integrated into your Cyfe dashboard using their pre-configured widgets. And if they don\u2019t have the widget you\u2019re looking for, then it\u2019s simple enough to build your own. If you\u2019re anything like me, you enjoy tracking and comparing data, as often as possible, but you don\u2019t enjoy spending hours on this task. That\u2019s why you should create a Cyfe dashboard, before the end of the year.   9. Social Mention When it comes to search engine optimization and social networks, there are a few things that you need to know. It\u2019s hard to quantify the exact impact of a sound social strategy on search engine rankings, but it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry. Even if your social strategy doesn\u2019t directly impact your rankings, it will help enhance your brand. As a result, your digital marketing strategy will eventually pay off. Social Mention provides \u201creal-time social media search and analysis.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most basic tools on this list, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it offers nothing of real value. In addition to clicking on one of the many trends below the search box, you can also run a unique search for any keyword or keyword phrase. After doing so, you\u2019ll be presented with a list of recent social network mentions. This is accompanied by a data box that looks something like this:  You\u2019re given access to other information, as well, such as sources, top hashtags, and top keywords and keyword phrases. You can use this tool in many ways. For example, you can use it to track brand mentions. As you come across these, you are presented with the opportunity to engage with your audience. Or, maybe you\u2019ll use Social Mention to keep tabs on your competition, knowing that you can learn more about them, with the idea of \u201cone upping\u201d them in the near future. You can do a lot of digging around on social networks, without the help of high-powered tools. However, this can be a time consuming process that doesn\u2019t produce any hard data for your SEO campaign. If you want to track social network mentions, without wasting time, there aren\u2019t many small business, digital marketing tools that offer higher quality or more in-depth data. 10. Google Keyword Planner Where do you turn for keyword ideas? There are many answers to this question. But, the last thing that I want you to do is to guess. If you do, you could soon find yourself chasing after rankings for the wrong set of keywords. To remove the guesswork and ensure that you\u2019re always making good keyword decisions, it\u2019s best to let Google Keyword Planner be your guide. Not only is the tool free, but it\u2019s operated by Google. In other words, you know that the data will be as accurate as possible, making it an essential tool for your SEO campaign. It all starts by inputting the appropriate data in this form:  An example of this would be the phrase \u201ccontent marketing.\u201d Type this into the first box and click the \u2018get ideas\u2019 button. In addition to search volume trends by month, pay close attention to: The list of search termsAverage monthly searchesCompetitionAs you\u2019ll see, there is more than the primary keyword that you searched for. There are other ideas, all of which could be implemented into your marketing plan.  I suggest using Google Keyword Planner, before you launch your website. Along with this, you can rely on it as you create fresh content. It helps to ensure that you select high traffic, targeted keywords and keyword phrases for each blog post that you create. ",

The bottom line is this: If your site isn\u2019t optimized for mobile devices, you\u2019re in big trouble. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need a full-time developer to get ready for this update. All you need to do is run your site through the Mobile-Friendly Test tool.

Most keyword research tools work the exact same way: Enter a seed keyword into the tool.Get a list of closely-related terms.The problem with this approach is this: Everyone types the same seed keywords into these tools. Well, Seed Keywords takes a completely different approach. Instead of pulling seed keywords out of thin air, you ask your customers how they\u2019d search for you online.  Then, type those seed keywords into your favorite keyword research tool.

Google Analytics See how people find and interact with your site. OK, OK. Google Analytics isn\u2019t really an SEO tool. But it\u2019s almost impossible to run an SEO campaign without it. Why?

Keys4Up Generate a list of untapped keyword ideas. Keys4Up uses a proprietary algorithm to generate \u201clateral\u201d keyword ideas For example, when you type \u201cContent Marketing\u201d into the tool, you DON\u2019T get a list of variations of that term. (Like: \u201cContent marketing strategies\u201d). Instead, you get keywords that people would associate with that term:  Best Feature: Keyword Export The one downside of Keys4Up is that you can\u2019t see how many people search for the keywords that it gives you. Fortunately, you can export your keywords to a CSV\u2026 and upload that CSV to another SEO tool that does provide monthly search volume.  17. Yoast WordPress Plugin The best SEO plugin for WordPress. If your site runs on WordPress, you need to install Yoast ASAP. It\u2019s by far the most robust SEO plugin on the market. The best part?
