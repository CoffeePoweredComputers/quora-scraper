            "answer_text": "Young writers (and in fact writers new to the craft) do not read enough (neither the genre they\u2019re writing in, nor books that will help them better the skill, nor books outside of the genre they\u2019re interested in writing). If you don\u2019t read, you\u2019ll create in an impenetrable bubble\u2014a prison in which creativity can\u2019t grow or evolve. Essentially, many young writers fall in love the the \u2018idea\u2019 of writing, an idea that came not from the reality of writing, but what TV, movies, and what people have said about writing. Many young writers don\u2019t practice writing in a realistic way with realistic expectations. As a result, they abandon the practice when it gets difficult; they sometimes react smugly to criticism; they practice and practice using the same methods over and over but never get any better. They essentially like the idea of being a writer\u2014they want fame\u2014and receiving the attention of writing a book people enjoy reading (in other words, they want to be a famous person with whatever qualities they\u2019ve associated with what they think a famous writer has). But they don\u2019t give other writers the same respect: they don\u2019t read any other writers\u2019 work. In Zen and the Art of Writing, Ray Bradbury talks about \u201cfeeding the muse\u201d a varied diet of literature which keeps the muse healthy and ready to assist in the writing process. He says you should read books on the Craft of Writing, Creative Non-Fiction on all types of topics, Poetry, and Fiction to practice the art effectively. There are no short cuts to gaining the skills and benefits of reading, interacting with a text by annotating, responding, and emulating. So get some books! Find a book club! Take a literature and creative writing class! Write and read every day and you\u2019ll grow as a writer, no matter how young you are. Got anymore questions?

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t particularly say young writers, more so new writers. There\u2019s a common thread among new writers: Poorer spelling, grammar and punctuation.Inspiration becomes a light fanfiction. Many writers start out as teenagers writing fanfiction or short stories inspired by their favourite novels. This sometimes translates to books that are more akin to the original than own work.Poor formatting, such as paragraphs, indentation, chapter placement and spacing.Lack of reading. A big mistake is to stop reading when you become a writer, especially when you\u2019re writing. It\u2019s important to study other writer\u2019s work and learn from it, look at the sentences and structure of the paragraphs. What has the author done here? Why such a placement? How does it make you feel?Writing only on a phone. Even a good editor may struggle to edit writing on a phone. When I add to my novels on my phone during the day, I can certainly see odd punctuation or other minor issues at night on my desktop. Phones have an autocorrect system that sometimes alters placement or swaps words entirely.",
