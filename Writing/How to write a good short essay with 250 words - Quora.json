            "answer_text": "PREWRITING[1]A good way to begin is to think about your purpose. What are you hoping to achieve by your essay? Would you prefer to inform, persuade, or both? What would like for people to do after reading your essay? Change their thinking? Change their feelings? Change their behavior? After deciding upon a general subject, next, ask a question that you think needs a strong and clear answer. The best essays are in response to a question someone is asking or ought to be asking. Narrow the question, such as you have done in the question you asked: \u201cHow to write a good, short essay with 250 words.\u201d Your essay is your answer to the question you asked. Effective essays usually have four characteristics. FOCUSFocus refers to the big idea of your essay, which is the answer to the question you asked, and can usually be stated in one single sentence.You must establish and maintain the central idea throughout the essay. Don\u2019t allow anything in your essay to drift \u201coff the subject.\u201d (check for this in your revision copies of the essay.) ORGANIZATIONEssays are organized by standard paragraphing. A paragraph is a \u201cchunk\u201d of information about one single aspect of the subject. Notice the paragraph above this one. It\u2019s all about \u201cfocus.\u201d Remember, \u201cdiscuss only one subject per paragraph.\u201d DEVELOPMENTEssays are \u201cdeveloped\u201d with examples, short anecdotes or stories, quotations, reasoning, and/or data. Your goal is to leave readers with a sense of having had a reasonably full discussion of the question you asked. MECHANICSAcademic essays should follow the conventions of Standard Written English, and should be free from errors in grammar, diction (word choice), and punctuation. Moreover, the use of other people\u2019s material, such as quotations or paraphrases, should be \u201cdocumented\u201d with MLA, APA, or some other form of bibliographic referencing system. Good essays are the result of adequate preparation and planning (prewriting) and revision, editing, and proofreading. Hope this helps. Footnotes[1] Before You Start Writing That Paper...
