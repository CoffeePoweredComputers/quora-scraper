            "answer_text": "The paperback copy is 384 pages, per Amazon. Trust me though, the book is so good that all those pages will fly by. The movie stayed pretty loyal to the book, but of course, there are more details in the book. Did you know that Lecter's eyes were described as \u201cmaroon\" in the book? His teeth are \u201csmall\" & \u201cwhite.\u201d Descriptions like that really build a visual of the character that the author wants me to see. I watched the movie before reading the book, but Anthony Hopkins couldn't have been a more perfect Hannibal (sans the maroon eyes). Check out the book. It's really good. ",
