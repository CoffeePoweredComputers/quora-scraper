This flexibility has led to the popularity of sharing screenshots as social media posts. These screenshots could be of your own posts from other social media platforms that you want to share on a different platform. These could also be posts from other users that you simply took a screenshot of and shared. In fact, you can practically take a screenshot of anything on the web and share it on social media. Here\u2019s an example of a person who posted a screenshot of a tweet on Instagram.  Image via Instagram  4. Unboxing Video Unboxing videos have become quite popular in recent years and have a whole viewer base of their own. These usually have a person unboxing a product and then showing its various features. This kind of videos can be created for any type of product that comes packed in a box. In fact, a lot of brands also collaborate with influencers to create such videos of their products. This solves multiple purposes at once. For one, it creates excitement about the product that is about to be unboxed. Second, it works as a \u201chow-to\u201d video showing ways to use the product and to list its features. Third, by partnering with an influencer, you can reach a much broader audience. Overall, if you have launched a new product or want to inform people about an innovative product, try these videos. Also, collaborate with influencers to get a broader reach.  5. Quotes Quotes are simple, inspiring, and engaging all at the same time.

The only thing that you need to take care of is to keep these relevant to your brand or niche. You should know your audience and post the kind of quotes they might like. While we are not suggesting posting a quote daily, but you can do this once in a while to keep your posts\u2019 engagement rates high.  Image via Instagram  6. News A lot of people actually find out about the happenings of the world through their social media feeds. In a generation where fewer people actually read a newspaper, sharing news posts is a great way to get their attention. One added benefit of sharing news is that you can also give your opinion on it and support or oppose a cause. People connect with brands better if they have similar ideologies. So, sharing a news post from something in your industry or relevant to your brand is a great way to drive audience engagement. Twitter and LinkedIn are usually the best platforms for such posts, however, this type of content can also be shared on Instagram, Facebook, and others as well. Here\u2019s an example of a news tweet.  Image via Twitter  7. Caption This Post These posts have become quite popular on Instagram, but can be easily used for other social media platforms as well.

Informative Articles Social media is not all fun and games but can be used to promote your blog or other content as well. You can share informative content in the form of a social media post that links back to the original content. Twitter and LinkedIn are both very good for sharing such posts. These will not only establish you as a thought leader but will also direct traffic to your website. Here\u2019s an example of a LinkedIn post about an article on another website, with a link to direct traffic there.  Image via LinkedIn  9. Tutorial Video These videos show a product in use, along with a detailed step-by-step tutorial on how to use it the right way. Such videos are especially popular in the beauty industry to show how to create different makeup or hair looks. However, these can be used for practically any type of product. The best part is that you can use such videos for different platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc. And, a tutorial video is not necessarily for just B2C products but can be made for B2B products like software as well.  10. Infographic Infographics are the perfect combination of information and visual appeal as they provide information in a visual manner. These can be posted on almost any platform and can be used to provide a lot of information in less space. Additionally, their visually-appealing nature makes these stand out from other content. So, you can use these to grab audience attention, while also providing information in an easy-to-grasp manner. Here\u2019s an example of an infographic shared on LinkedIn.  Image via LinkedIn  11. Ask a Question Another great way to get more comments on your social media posts is to ask your audience a question and encourage them to write their answers in the comments. This is a simple, yet effective technique to engage your audience and get more comments. However, this only works if your question is interesting enough for people to want to answer. So, you need to understand your audience first and then pose a question that will grab their attention. Needless to say, that it should be related to your brand or niche as well.  12. Industry Facts If you are totally out of ideas for what to post on your social media, just share a fact related to your industry or niche. It does not require much effort and establishes you as an industry expert, while also getting audience attention. Here\u2019s an example of one such post from Twitter.  Image via Twitter  13. Product Pictures Instagram and Facebook have emerged as social commerce platforms from simply a social media platform and several brands are using these as such. These businesses do that by posting product pictures and adding a link to where people can actually buy that product. So, if you have a B2C product-based business, this should be the type of social media post that you should definitely use. Even if you can\u2019t add a link with all product pictures, you can share the product name or code to make it easier for people to find it on your website. Here\u2019s an example of how H&M does it.  Image via Instagram  14. Cute Animal Pictures or Videos If you want a fail-proof, filler content that always grabs audience attention, post cute animal pictures or videos.

            "answer_text": "I think that whatever type of posts you decide to create there all have to have something in common to perform in 2020. They must be authentic! Based on my experiences in marketing, I\u2019ve noticed that the audience always engage more with the post with a real and fresh perspective. So I\u2019d suggest to use a photographer with a fresher look or stock image platforms that are new and smaller. I personally use Jumpstory and I can always find some authentic visuals there. ",
