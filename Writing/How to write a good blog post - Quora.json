            "answer_text": "Everyone has their own styles/preferences for writing/reading blog posts. How you write your blog posts will likely depend on your blog's topic, your audience, and your goals. For example, a blog post about computer programming would likely be very instructional, where as a blog about relationships would likely be more emotional. Below are my favorite tips writing blog posts.  1. Length: Not too long, not too short  Write posts that are long enough to deliver value and have character, but not so long that it\u2019s intimidating or overly time consuming to read. Get to the point, but make sure you\u2019re adding enough character and detail. I usually aim for about 700-1200 words. Sometimes more sometimes less.  2. Attention Grabbing Title The title is often the first thing a reader sees when deciding to read a post. If the title is interesting and attention grabbing it is more likely to get clicked. Use a unique title that clearly explains what the blog post is about and what value the reader will get from reading it. If you have a blog post about gardening, don\u2019t title it \u201cgardening.\u201d Instead title it something like \u201cHow to Start a Garden in Your Own Backyard.\u201d Titles that start with \u201chow to\u201d or \u201c# tips\u201d are very popular.  3. Deliver Value Blog posts, and all forms of content marketing, should deliver educational or entertainment value. The more value your readers get, the more likely they are to return for more, engage with you further, potentially buy your product, or share it with their friends.  4. Show Character Authenticity is a great trait to have. Share your unique opinions. Share your stories and experiences. Don\u2019t be afraid to use slang, jargon, or less than perfect grammar if it adds the right character. I regularly use ellipses and emoticons in my blog posts and email newsletters.  5. Use the Right Keywords Use Google Keyword Planner and other keyword research tools to determine which keywords and phrases you should be using in your title and body. Using keywords and phrases that match what people are searching can improve your search ranking. You would be surprised that the words you use are not always the words people use when they search on Google.  6. Strong First Sentence The first line can make or break a blog post. If it\u2019s great, readers will be intrigued to keep reading. If it\u2019s boring, they may lose interest and browse away.  7. Concise Conclusion I sometimes include a bullet pointed list of the key takeaways from the post. It allows readers to get value from the post quickly and easily. A short paragraph with some closing thoughts may also be helpful. 8. Add Sub Headings Including sub headings within a blog post helps to make it more readable and organized. Break up your blog post with a different sub heading to highlight and separate the main points or topics of the post. As you can see in this answer, I'e added a sub heading for each tip.  9. Ideal Frequency  You don\u2019t want your readers to forget about you, but you don\u2019t want them to get sick of you either. As your community grows larger and more engaged, they may want more frequent content. If your have an email list, you might not want to email them more than a couple times per week, as they could get irritated by receiving too many emails. I would recommend about once per week if you can.

            "answer_text": "In order to write a good blog post, I think you need to put a piece of your soul into it. You need to bare something to the world that you are afraid to. If you are feeling a little sick before you hit the publish button, then you are on the right track. I just started blogging recently. One day I was thinking about my past regrets and I just couldn't take it anymore. I started typing furiously. What came out was the best post I have written so far. It contained all of my regrets towards cheating on my ex-girlfriends. When I posted it I knew that my family, friends and many strangers would see it. I swear I only got three hours of sleep the night before I posted it. Then something awesome happened. I posted it, and people started messaging me telling me how brave I was. People started telling me about things that they regretted, they said they could relate. It invigorated a passion in me for writing that I didn't know I had. Put your soul into everything you write, and you will become a good blogger. I try to do that with every post I put up. This is the post I put up that day.7 Deadly Sins: Lust I still get a little afraid every time I know someone is reading it.If you like it, please share/follow/like it. I post every Sunday and Wednesday. ",
