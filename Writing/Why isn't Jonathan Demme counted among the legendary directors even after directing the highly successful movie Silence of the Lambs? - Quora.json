            "answer_text": "All of the legendary directors have created at least a handful of masterpieces - and most of them more. Jonathan Demme did create Silence of the Lamb and Philadelphia, but, for whatever reason, he didn\u2019t get to create a lot of great movies after that. The only other movie of his that I have seen is The Manchurian Candidate, a remake, and that was just a so-so thriller, but nothing close to the other two. And of course it wasn\u2019t as good as the original. By comparison Martin Scorsese remade Cape Fear with much more success. ",
