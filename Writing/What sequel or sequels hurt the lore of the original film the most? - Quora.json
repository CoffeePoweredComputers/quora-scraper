            "answer_text": "This question is quite the flame bait for The Last Jedi discussions\u2026 well, since I loved TLJ, that one\u2019s out of question to me, but: My answer is Justice League. I know the DCEU didn\u2019t gather many fans, but I was definitely one of them. Yes, I\u2019m a die-hard fan of the MCU, but I also really enjoyed the more gritty, realistic, character-driven nature of the DCEU. I absolutely loved Man of Steel and really liked Batman v Superman. Wonder Woman was great too until the third act. But the DCEU made a grave mistake: They rushed their cinematic universe format, trying to copy Marvel. As such, Batman v Superman had to develop two protagonists at the same time, one of which had never had a solo movie before, and also introduced several other characters, and\u2026 half of the movie just appeared to revolve around setting up sequels. So, once Justice League arrived, it was almost bound to fail. A very, very good filmmaker might have still turned the whole thing around, but let\u2019s be honest, Zack Snyder is an amazing cinematographer, but not the best director around. Justice League had too many main characters which all received barely any personality. The villain was the worst, most boring comic book villain I\u2019ve ever seen. But the tone\u2026 it flew in the face of everything that came before. Batman\u2019s character, slowly and quite effectively built up and developed in BvS, flew right out the window. The dark atmosphere was also dropped, and ultimately, Justice League just felt like a would-be Avengers movie (which is really sad because Joss Whedon participated in it, why did he rip off his own previous work?). On its own, Justice League was an okay movie. Quite entertaining, if nothing else. But as part of a previously established Cinematic Universe, it was just plain awful. ",

            "answer_text": "There are so many. I\u2019ll name a few. The Last Jedi: the worst of the worst for me. It as it was written specifically to destroy and undermine everything that was estabilished in the previous 40 years and 6 movies (not to mention books, comics and so on and so forth) of Star Wars history. And judging by the interviews and behind-the-scenes videos it was actually that way. The Last Jedi is obsessed with the fallacious idea that in order to move forward you have to destroy everything that came before. It is as if someone walked into the Louvre and said \"you guys need to stop holding onto the past,\" and then threw a torch down, cackling as hundreds of years of irreplaceable works of art burned to the ground, and then, standing triumphantly on the ashes, drew a smiley face. In order to make room for the new characters to shine, Rian Johnson obliterates the character of Luke Skywalker to the point that Hamill himself couldn't recognize him; in the Original Trilogy Luke Skywalker transforms from a whiny farm boy into a hero who proclaims \"I am a Jedi, like my father before me\" and manages to do what both Yoda and Obi-Wan thought impossible: bring Darth Vader back to the light. In this film, Luke is tempted to murder his own nephew before he even did anything wrong simply because there is a chance he may turn to the dark side, but the worst thing is that after that rather than attempt to fix his mistake he falls into a pit of despair and hides on an island as his friends are slowly wiped out by the First Order. When Rey arrives he refuses to train her or help the resistance in any way (despite having made a map to his location in the previous film), until a strange out of character pyromaniac Yoda force ghost appears and tells him Rey is perfect already and also the extremely cliched line that \"the greatest teacher, failure is.\" Luke is not the only wasted character from the Original Trilogy either: Chewbacca serves as nothing more than comic relief and Leia is incapacitated for most of the film after a strange Mary Poppins-esque stroll through outer space. Admiral Ackbar is killed so unceremoniously you barely even notice he dies. The usage of the force in this film is wildly inconsistent with the previous films as well. First of all, force ghosts never were able to alter physical reality, yet in this film Yoda is able to bring lightning down from the sky, leading us to the question of why the force ghosts haven't just destroyed Snoke from their impenetrable positions in the netherworld. Leia is able to fly through outer space, and people can telephatically talk through light years of space and even send avatars of themselves with all their powers. Rey is able to lift multiple tons of boulders with apparent ease despite how difficult it was for Luke to make a single X-Wing in the Empire Strikes Back even budge. The force projection that Luke does at the end is actually interesting, but for some inexplicable reason they decide to make it kill him. From a critical standpoint, the film is an incoherent mess. There is little to no character development and the plot is little more than a long, drawn out series of \"gotcha\" moments; we are treated like dogs, as Rian Johnson dangles delicious treats above us before rapidly yanking them away. In the climax of The Force Awakens Rey finds Luke and extends his lightsaber, but in The Last Jedi Luke merely throws the lightsaber over his shoulder. Leia is sucked into outer space, only to magically force fly back to safety. Luke agrees to train Rey, but then quits after only one pathetic training session. Finn is about to heroically save what's left of the resistance, but - surprise! - he is saved at the last minute by his awkward love interest. Snoke is the most powerful villain in any Star Wars movie ever, but is anticlimactically killed by a cheap trick. The entire first half of the movie leads us to believe Kylo Ren and Rey will join forces, but after Kylo Ren saves Rey - surprise! - they're not going to work together: Kylo Ren will remain the stereotypical bad guy and Rey the infallible heroine. Rian Johnson had a chance to actually do something original and daring in this respect, but instead chose to take the safe route. The writing in this film is atrocious. Several lines are lifted verbatim from the Original Trilogy. The humor is out of place, overused, and sounds like they took the words of a heckler writing in the margins and thought they should actually put it in the movie (Star Wars meets Rocky Horror Picture Show). We are distracted by pointless subplots that are of no consequence. The new characters have no personality and sound like modern day buffoons who were simply transplanted into the Star Wars universe. There is so much wrong with it that you really just have to see it for yourself, although I would recommend not paying money for it. In conclusion, The Last Jedi is the worst Star Wars movie ever made. It is heretical. It is the anti-Star Wars. It stinks. Son of the Mask: This movie got only 2,2 out of 10 stars on IMDB. And you can easily guess why. The real question should be: how is it not any lower? Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds \"Cuz I gotta!\" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, \"Good Lord, Why?\" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party. The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying. Blues Brother 2000: As I watched the film, I couldn\u2019t help but feel just how much John Belushi\u2019s presence was missed. There was no edge in this film, no sense of rawness or danger that Belushi filled the Joliet Jake character with. The magnetic and captivating presence of a comic actor of Belushi\u2019s magnitude can\u2019t be replaced with an obnoxious kid, Curtis\u2019 illegitimate son, and a new designated fat actor. Dan Ackroyd, as this movie makes painfully clear, was not the star of the original Blues Brothers. Batman Forever (1995): Critics complained that Tim Burton\u2019s vision of Batman in Batman Returns (1992) was too dark and serious. Batman Returns failed to meet the financial heights of the 1989 Batman, so of course that means it\u2019s time for a complete redesign of the franchise. Gone is Tim Burton and his sense of gothic darkness, gone is Danny Elfman\u2019s moody and inspiring score, and gone is Michael Keaton\u2019s brooding Bruce Wayne and Batman. Scrap the whole \u201cmess\u201d and bring in\u2026 uh, Joel Schumacher. Replace the short but talented Michael Keaton with the physically-fit but wooden Val Kilmer. Change the tone from serious and dark to brightly coloured and dumb. Take everything that made the first two Batman films good and throw it out the window to try and sell more toys! Put a lime-green leotard on Jim Carrey! Put Tommy Lee Jones in terrible makeup and give him awful one-liners! Add in Chris O\u2019Donnell as Robin, and to further increase the unintentional homoerotic undertones, give the Batsuit nipples! Give everyone stupid quips and blow lots of things up! Let\u2019s not even discuss Batman & Robin. The Lion King II: Although I consider myself quite a big Disney fan (at least of the old Disney), I never liked the sequels. The film continues the story of the original Lion King, with Simba being the leader of the pride. However, Simba's more of a background character now. And instead of trying something new, by making it an entirely new storyline, they basically copy and pasted for the most part. Only this time there is a bad character that will turn good and fall in love with a character on the good side so that eventually all bad characters will become good, except one who will refuse to yield and just die. Sounds good? Not to me but the worst are the characters: Simba, once the best Disney character IMO, became a tyrant and a bigot in order to make the plot works, Nala is useless, so is Zazu, Timon, Pumbaa and Rafiki are there just to make jokes and the new main character Kiara is a whining spoiled brat who could not be less sympathetic. Kovu has potential but it is not handled well. With the proper writing, he could have been an interesting character but of course proper writing is absent in this. The villain, Zira, is basically a lion version of Shenzi from the first movie, more vicious but not more captivating. She completely lacks Scar\u2019s charisma and it doesn\u2019t help that in order to accept her existance we are supposed to magically forgot that in the first movie all lions were on Simba\u2019 side, none on Scar\u2019s. No dear Disney, kids are not stupids. They notice these things believe me. As in most Disney sequels, the animation is Saturday-morning cartoon style, leaning heavily on cheap computer graphics that give it a sterile and stagnant look. No trace of the earthy, organic visuals of the 1994 classic. The characters, as you've probably concluded, look off model most of the time and move awkwardly. Disney should pay respect to their classics and avoid a sequel if it's not going to receive a normal treatment. I can\u2019t think of others at the moment. ",
