Now , finding sponsors mainly depends on what you are blogging about. As you are blogging about Self-help, you need to follow some self help mentors. Increase your presence. put quality content regularly and very soon sponsors will be approaching you. It is you who has to answer a simple question honestly. Is your blog at a level where someone would want to put his money there? Unless you honestly don\u2019t think the answer to that question is yes, Keep Working.

            "answer_text": "Looking at your blog, its a self help sort of blog, due to which it can be a bit tricky to find sponsors for your blog. Here is how it works out. You have a blog with a particular type of audience, for example if you blog about hairstyle, you have audience who is interested in hairstyles. At this point of time, if a shampoo company comes into market, they will look at your blog and say \u201chey, he has the audience that has lots of potential buyers\u201d ( because you write about hairstyle and their product is about it ) so, they will contact you for sponsorship because they want to reach to your audience and get sales. But in your blog, I can\u2019t figure out any related product. What you can do instead is try your hands in affiliate marketing and sell self help books. Or, find products related to your niche and contact companies manually for sponsoring your blog. ",
