            "answer_text": "Several years ago, I posted a question on a http://ff.net forum in the Hogan\u2019s Heroes, fandom\u2026If you had to take down every story you wrote and could only leave one up\u2026which would it be? I had to think long and hard about my answer, (I\u2019ve posted a lot of stories)\u2026.but I chose the very first story I ever posted. I think it says it all\u2026.here is the link to my profile page\u2026.and I\u2019ve pasted the story below: Title: RemembranceCategory: TV Shows \u00bb Hogan's HeroesAuthor: snooky-9093Language: English, Rating: Rated: KGenre: General/DramaPublished: 11-21-08, Updated: 11-21-08Chapters: 1, Words: 405  Chapter 1: Chapter 1  May 1943 Tunnels under Stalag 13 They had been hidden in the tunnels for three weeks. But the men were kind. They were given food and new clothes. Some of the soldiers spoke German. They played card games and checkers with the younger children. One nice man with an English accent even showed them magic tricks. Their fear became less noticeable, still there, but not the overwhelming dread that previously threatened to sap their souls, their spirits. One man was the leader. He was strong and decisive. He spent a lot of time on the radio. Sometimes his voice was raised and angry. She knew then he was talking about them. She didn't understand English, but she could hear the anger and frustration in his tone. He would leave the chair and pace. But he was kind. His face softened when he saw them. \"Don't worry,\" he said in German, \"we'll get you out of here.\" He winked. The children smiled. Once, two other soldiers came through the tunnels. They were American airmen. They looked like they belonged in the movies. The flyers were hurt and scared and so young. But the men were kind. The leader and his men fixed them up. The two Americans stayed in another area and didn't talk to them. Within two days, they were gone. One day the man who was the leader sat them all down and spoke. \"Tonight you will be leaving. Two men from the Underground will take you to the sea. There, you will board a submarine and go to England. You will be safe there. \" The adults gathered their belongings and dressed the children. Her father said, \"We will never forget what you have done for us, Papa Bear.\" The leader smiled. \"Just do what the Underground says and you'll be fine. Forget what you have seen here. Good luck.\" May 1988 Arlington National Cemetery, VA Clutching the obituary, she entered the visitor's center. \"May I help you find someone, ma'am? \" The soldier provided her with a map and directions. She approached the grave. Others had been there before her. Many had left flowers. She took a deep breath and stepped towards the site. She placed several small rocks on top of the gravestone and recited the Kaddish. Tears streaming down her face, she whispered \"I'm sorry Papa Bear; I will never forget what I saw.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Good lord. My best fanfiction? Like, as in one I\u2019ve written? By what parameters are you asking? Hmm. I\u2019ll come from a few angles: First, by my statistics; The most hits:  By Kudos:  By bookmarks:  And finally, by subscriptions:  So. If we go by what other people think, using AO3\u2019s statistics; if the amount of people who want to know where this is going to go in the future, and think that that is going to be a good place, because they like it enough at the current moment to continue reading the fic as it is updated, then SHEILD!Stiles gets the cake as my \u2018best fanfiction\u2019. if the amount of people who read the fic is an indication of my \u2018best fanfiction\u2019, then it\u2019s Something Something. if the amount of people who would read my fic again is what should be counted, then it\u2019s Golden Bullets. And if it\u2019s the amount of people who confirmed they liked it through hitting the like button, then it\u2019s AUD: First Year. I gotta say, I am proud of all of those. But, if we go by my estimation, as in, the one I\u2019m most proud of, that took me the most effort, that I enjoy myself as a fic and have no qualms with, it\u2019s\u2026 difficult to say. It\u2019s either, a) The Want Of Gold To Stay (+ it\u2019s epilogue, The Riddle Problem, which I don\u2019t really count as a separate fic even though it\u2019s posted as one), or b) For When The Sunset Turns To Gold. I hope my reasons for having trouble choosing between those would be clear, after a read of them :). ",

This is a Vegeta/18 story Because I ship that hard.Life is Full of Strangers, an SYOC story in which 15 OCs with weird powers, have to survive both themselves and a few\u2026dangers I have planned for them. But that's episodes away, and we're only on episode 1 so far.Or, MoniTale! An Undertale X Doki Doki Literature Club story in which Monika and The Player are sent to Undertale (long story) and Frisk is sent to Doki Doki. Basically, it's my attempt to do a mix between a Monika redemption story, a self insert, and an X-reader, as it can be taken as all of the above. Considering that The Player is both an Analog for me and the reader, depending on whether or not Monika is your favored Doki. If your Team Monika, then you can easily set yourself in Players shoes. But if your Team Natsuki/Yuri/Sayori then you'd not see yourself in Player. You'd see yourself in MC or\u2026someone else's place. Hehehe, I'll never tell you who though.Hmm, notice anything about the above list? Yeah, you can tell which one of these is the one that's gaining ground fast. MoniTale is the newcomer who is destroying the opposition. But LiFS is the experienced fighter who's still got a lot of Life left in it. HoV is the saddest one of all, it's an old man who's on his last legs. No one seems interested in it anymore, and without an indication that people are reading (say, a review) I have no reason to keep writing. But hey, it doesn't mean that HoV isn't one of my best works (especially in the later parts, seriously get passed chapter 5 I believe and the story is pretty good). Here's some links for the stories, and if your interested I have a few Drawings for MoniTale you can view, just ask and I'll link you to my official DeviantArt account, where the two oldest pieces of MoniTale art have been posted. (Note, if you, someone who has talent wants to redraw these I'd be most appreciative.

            "answer_text": "What is your best fanfiction? That\u2019s a difficult question to answer. Possibly The Cloak of Mist. It occupies the border between fanfiction and original fiction; it is a completely original story but it utilises the concept of the Slayer from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Set in the Isle of Man (my home) in the year 1014 AD, it is about a young Manx girl who finds that she has been Called as a Slayer and must fight against an army of vampires led by a Viking sorcerer who plans to cover the Island with a perpetual shroud of fog, the Cloak of Mist, to create a haven for vampires from which they can launch raids against England with impunity. It has a solid basis in Manx folklore and history, the result of much research, and many readers have told me that they love my heroine Bahey Dhone. The other possible choice would be The King of Elfland\u2019s Daughter. It\u2019s part of my massive mega-crossover Tabula Avatar series, which crosses over Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Stargate SG-1, Neverwinter Nights, and in this particular story NCIS. The NCIS Major Case Response team investigate the murder of a Marine and find themselves involved with aliens, magic, and a psychotic killer who cannot be harmed by bullets. I haven\u2019t included a link because, even though I try to make all the stories in the Tabula Avatar series capable of being read as stand-alones, The King of Elfland\u2019s Daughter is one of the last in the series and it isn\u2019t the best place to start. I\u2019m just particularly proud of the plot and the way I portrayed the relationship between Gibbs and Cierre. Originally Answered: What is your fanfiction about? If you strip away the recurring themes of the relationship between Memory and Self, what it means to be a god, the nature of reality, bravery in the face of inevitable death, and the struggle to reconcile the moralities of different worlds\u2026 my fanfiction is about attractive women hitting people with swords. The Cloak of Mist: Bahey Dhone, an attractive young woman, who hits vampires with swords.The Tabula Avatar series: Buffy, Sorkatani, Sharwyn, Egeria, Temina, Neeshka, Jaheira, Kenadi, Eilistraee, and Cierre\u2026 attractive women who hit people with swords.The Dark Companion: Cierre, Nathyrra, \u00c9owyn, Loth\u00edriel\u2026 attractive women who hit people with swords and, in Loth\u00edriel\u2019s case, an amputation knife.Queen of Swords: Elisif, Lydia, Kaie, Jenassa\u2026 attractive women who hit people with (as if the title didn\u2019t give it away) swords.Back to Black: Bellatrix\u2026 an attractive woman who hits people with spells and (just to be different) a knife.Divakiin!: Rhiannon\u2026 an attractive woman who prefers to use bare hands but circumstances compel her to spend most of her time hitting people (and dragons) with swords.Les Morts Dansant: Laelryne and Cierre\u2026 attractive women, surrounded by an overwhelming number of savage enemies, who cope with the inevitability of their deaths by hitting people with swords. And, just to be different, Extinction Event: Queen Ninmah, an attractive woman who intends to hit Earth with an asteroid four hundred kilometres in diameter. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm \u2026 \u201cBest\u201d is a rather hazy qualifier, don\u2019t you think? Based on the number and tone of reviews, probably \u201cTransition\u201d ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6263444/1/Transition )It\u2019s a Teen Titans story set somewhat after the end of the series (that\u2019s the original anime-style series, not the execrable Teen Titans Go!) where the main characters are Raven and Jinx. This is also what I consider my first legitimate novel. Based on the amount of work and research I put into it, and the fact that the OC is my proudest creation to date, probably \u201cMeltdown\u201d ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10175297/1/MD1-Meltdown )A Frozen story, everything that happened in the first movie is historically accurate for this tale. It is my answer for why Elsa had ice powers in the first place (because in the movie, no one seemed to give a rip). It ignores \u201cFrozen Fever\u201d, \u201cOlaf\u2019s Adventure\u201d, and \u201cFrozen II\u201d. Yes, I now know Elsa is the Fifth Elemental Spirit, but that wasn\u2019t even hinted at in the first movie. Based on the level of punch-to-the-gut emotional response, probably \u201cServed Cold\u201d (Frozen (2013) [Archive of Our Own]) Another Frozen story, one reviewer referred to it as a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d. However, I would warn anyone who thinks about reading it that, if you love Anna or Kristoff or Elsa at all, you may wish to read something else. This is intense, graphic, and tragic, and I wrote it because my Muse made me. Based on the depth of the character study involved, it\u2019s a tossup between two Teen Titans stories: \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10644924/1/No-Tears-Left-to-Cry ) and \u201cA New World\u201d ( https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8573491/1/A-New-World )The former is an exploration of Beast Boy\u2019s reactions to losing everything he loved, and his quest for revenge. The latter is Starfire-centric and details how she handles several new and unusual things about her adopted home. So \u2026 I will leave what you mean by \u201cbest\u201d up to you. Happy Reading! ",

            "answer_text": "I've written many fanfics, it being a very good way to destress during grad school. Most of my fanfics tend to deconstruct characters or worlds in some way. Some of the ones I\u2019m proudest of: My DESTINY series of Xena: Warrior Princess fics are set in the Conqueror-verse after the death of Xena the Conqueror, and follow the travels of Gabrielle and Caesar (whom Conqueror Xena kept as a slave.). In Avatar: the Last Airbender, two fics of mine are Water Wedding, dealing with a marriage between Zuko and Katara (yes I will ship Zutara to my dying day), and When All Your Dreams Come True, about if Zuko had managed to capture Aang during the first season (warning: this fic is very dark and I think I was probably clinically depressed when I wrote it). I have two series of fics in the Fallout verse, one series following my Lone Wanderer Samantha, and one series following my Courier, Samara. I also have a Fallout 3/Fallout New Vegas crossover with Samantha (but NOT Samara) of which I\u2019ve completed Part I of III: The Emperor and the Messiah I also have a few other odd ones here and there - a couple of things in Skyrim \u2014 but those are the ones I consider my best work. My most recent postedones are a couple of fics in the Team Fortress 2 universe dealing with the Scouts discovering that their mothers have cancer, and I\u2019m currently working on a fic exploring the backstory of Medic (I need to get this one cleared off the board so I can finish my Fallout crossover :P it just jumped the line and wouldn't go away).

We next find him in Dallas Texas working as a detective on a Muggle Drug Task force. The Wizarding World once again makes demands of him. Witch Weekly, find Harry, Ron and none other than Draco doing a photo shoot for Witch Weekly because they are three if the 10 most eligible bachelors that year. Life on the Streets is post Half Blood Prince. Harry runs away from the Dursley's after he is accused of murdering his cousin. This involves prostitution, drugs and living a life of abuse. Porn Star, finds Harry running a porn studio. And starring in many of his own movies. This does not feature Draco. But has a side of Harry/Hermione, though it is mostly slash. The last one I'll mention is Aberforth's Goat Farm. It is a series of Drabbles. About the appeal of the goat farm. It started because of a off handed remark about a bad joke made in the now defunct Restricted Section's chat room. It never should have been but... I couldn't stop it once the plot bunny not only appeared but beat me about the head and shoulders with the thing. ",

It would probably be classified as a romance (Snape/Original Character), but it\u2019s more of a dark drama than a romance. Here\u2019s the description from fanfiction.net: \u201cCanonshafted by HBP & DH, but still very IC. When a N.E.W.T. Potions field trip goes badly wrong, a chain of events is set in motion that may cost Snape more than his life, and a student more than her heart. Angst/dark romance. SS/OC of-age student.\u201d I\u2019ve also written way, way, way canon-shafted fan-fiction based on The Sword of Shannara (I came up with the story and expanded worldbuilding years before the first sequel was published). The story is far more extensive than what I have yet posted, but it seems like I never get around to posting more. And I started writing a cross-over fic-fic with The Shannara Chronicles and Supernatural. Once the second season of The Shannara Chronicles came out, I realized that I would have to make some adjustments to where the story was going. But do to that, I\u2019d need to sit down and binge-watch season 2 again and take notes. Haven\u2019t gotten around to it. Heck, it took me years to finally wind up the epilogues of my Potter fan-fic. ",
