            "answer_text": "How do I add a question description? With some degree of difficulty. Quora used to permit longer questions, but a few years back, they closed up the number of characters available for people to ask questions with, to only (I think) 250 character places. This is because Quora wants questions to be more concise - and canonical, but not so specific that they are only applicable to the original question asked\u2026 The idea being, that question writers would have to spend some time editing and tightening up their questions before they asked them - this is the preferable option. The other option is to be as specific as you can with your question, but add some additional details in a comment (the little word bubble on the right hand side under the actual question). The rules about questions that Quora puts out are also helpful to understand what will sound good to Quora - and what won\u2019t.
