            "answer_text": "Know your customer. The writing good sales copy is to know exactly who you\u2019re selling to, and why they want what you\u2019re selling. Speak in layman\u2019s terms. Instead of focusing on what their problem is, focus on what solution you\u2019re selling to them is, and speak to it. Keep the navigation simple. Don\u2019t bombard them with text. The less words, the better. If you\u2019re writing a long-from article, make sure to break apart the text with headers, sub-headers, and bulleted lists to keep the content easily digestible. Listen, and be direct. Ever been to a store, and you know exactly what you want, but the salesperson goes into a sales pitch and over-explains the benefits? Annoying! Imagine the prospect in front of you. What do they want? What\u2019s their lifestyle? What do they care about? Understand your different types of customers, and speak to them directly through your website, advertisement, landing page, or e-mail. Keep practicing. The key to getting good at copywriting is practice. You\u2019re going to write some bad stuff, and you might get some harsh criticism from your clients. Just remember, you have to be bad at something before you get good at something. Be persistent and keep your mind limber by writing ad copy for a brand that exists, or create your own. Separate yourself from your writing. Sometimes writing is very personal. Your mind can work against you, especially after getting lots of rewrites and rejection in the beginning. Make sure you\u2019re able to separate your emotions from your drafts, otherwise you\u2019re going to have a bad time. ",
