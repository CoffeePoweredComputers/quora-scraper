            "answer_text": "He writes for those who do not read. I witnessed one of the comments here in Quora where someone told that he\u2019s the Brown Dan Brown (minus the plots, if I might add). If you were growing up on Enid Blyton and Ruskin Bond stories in the late 90s like me, you knew that the Indian readership was at an all time low. Those who read books - read all kinds of books and were a microscopic minority. The quintessential image of a \u201cbadass\u201d was someone who used to \u201cstay miles away from books\u201d. With the phenomenon of Chetan Bhagat, a lot of these people took to reading. Now, the quintessential badass can also be viewed as a character from a Chetan Bhagat novel. He is from IIM and like most post graduates out of management colleges, he loves viewing the book as a product than a piece of literature. Also, his readers are his target customers. He is famous in schools between the ages of ten to fifteen because this age group is awed by the mere mention of the words \u201csex\u201d, \u201cfuck\u201d, \u201cboobs\u201d and so on. He is also a cult of personality in colleges since his characters deal with college students and fresh-out-of-college graduates. Most readers cringe at his books for obvious reasons i.e. mechanical behaviour of his characters or lack of literary prowess or giving rise to a number of similar superfluous, abhorrent authors in terms of content. However, Chetan Bhagat does not write for them. People might feel they are empowered when they criticise Bhagat but for Bhagat, they are not his target consumer. They are whom we can best describe as a \u201cwindfall profit\u201d for Bhagat or his extra source of revenue. We also see a rise in a number of Chetan Bhagat-style authors, as said before, but they do not succeed. This is because they target the readers and not those who do not read. As an Indian author, I\u2019m glad that Chetan Bhagat wrote books and to me, it\u2019s special. It is better to listen to people saying: \u201cI read Chetan Bhagat\u201d instead of \u201cSpare me! Books aren\u2019t my cup of tea\u201d. It\u2019s easier to reach out to them and ask them to go through one of my books! Better for my sales! *wink, wink* ",

I would suggest you read all of his work and explore specality you intended for & & never compare one writer with another as every writer writes about new things. If everyone is working on different aspect then everyone is perfect in his or her horizon. You simply can't compare them on the basis of popularity, nationality or how they are using alien words and headache type grammar. Never ! ",
