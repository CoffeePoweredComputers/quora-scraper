            "answer_text": "Yes, but with limitations. Only as long as you're tourist or business visa is valid. And you don't become a resident. If you become a resident, your time in that particular state is limited to drive with your \"out of state\" license. But some \"uneducated police\" may still write you a ticket and try all kinds of trouble, all the way to tow your vehicle. Happened to me. Of course, judges and courts will figure out the \"real\" laws and dismiss the ticket. But you have lost time (time is money to) and a lot of unnecessary trips, including a court date. Also impound lots won't release your car without a US license. Legal or not. America is all about business. Fairness has no value. The tow truck driver actually used his driver license the next day to get my car out. This how I met my first \"real\" good American. We turned into friends and hade regular meetings, till I moved into the next state. To avoid having to deal with \"aggressive,unlawful acting, uneducated police\" \u034fy\u034fo\u034fu can get a temporary US drivers license with your valid visa, in whatever state you have a address. And avoid any dealings with foreigner unfriendly police. A US drivers license will also help you to start establishing \"things\" (like history \u2026) y\u034fo\u034fu need in the US anyway, if you maybe get married and you decide to stay some day. Good luck and success in the US. It's still a land of opportunity. If you work hard or smart, you can make it. No matter what frustrated people, or people living on the streets say \u2026 it just doesn't tolerate laziness and wasteful behavior anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "In Los Angeles, if you live in a foreign country, you can drive with a license from that country. If you live or work anywhere in California, including Los Angeles, then you are not allowed to drive anywhere in California, including Los Angeles, without a California license. Again, this rule does not apply if you are a foreign visitor who does not work or live in the U.S. and you have a valid license from the country where you do live. An International Driving License is not valid in the U.S. To drive in the U.S., you must have a regular, non-international, license from the country where you live. In the U.S., the only use for an international one is if you have a license from your home country that is not in English and an international one that is in English (the international one helps the police to tell what the other one says). You can still drive using your Indian license. Regular police in the USA do not check immigration status for someone they have stopped or who has been in a traffic accident. Check with the office that issues driving licenses, but most states do not require someone to get a state driving license unless they are relocating to the state permanently. For example, a university student from another state does not have to change their license even though they are living in the state most of each year. However, daily life is easier with a state driving license. Someone in the USA on a long term visa can usually get a state driving license. You can apply once your H1B visa is renewed. http://www.bmv.ohio.gov/driver-license.a... You can avoid having to give up your Indian driving license by going through the whole application process as though you never had a DL, including taking any required classes and taking the driving test. It's best if you do that anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "Short Answer: Yes. How: The IDP (IDL is a misnomer, there is no such thing as an international license) is simply a translation of the DL in 10 languages. Indian DL is issued - surprise, surpise - in English! So, in US a cop can read it without looking at the translation provided in the IDP. Not so much if you are in Paraguay or Brazil or Spain or Portugal - they may need the IDP as the cop most probably will not speak / read English. If the cop is proficient in English, he/she may not ask for IDP. Why: There are international treaties which recognize the DL of one country in another. One is from 1949, I forgot the name of the treaty. That allows Indian DL in US. For How Long: Here it becomes a bit muddy. In US, motor vehicle acts are state matters. As long as you are not a resident (take a job, lease a house, put your child in school etc.), you are a visitor and as a visitor most states allow you 6\u201312 months on your Indian license - you need to check the respective state DMV. How do the cops figure out how long you have been there: You need to show the passport and if you got a paper I-94 form to the cop. That helps them figure out how long your current visit has lasted. If it is less than the the mandate period in the state, you are fine or else you may be fined. Post Script and Pet Peeve: It\u2019s a pet peeve of mine seeing how many times people just blindly suggest to get an IDL to people when they are visiting the US. Indian DL and all govt. document are published in English. These will work perfectly fine in all English speaking countries and may also work in most Nordic countries. The last I checked, Norwegian, Danish or Finish are not part of the languages in the IDP. An IDP has the following languages: English, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, German, Arabic,Italian, Swedish and Portuguese. ",

Was stopped for speeding 3 states before. I told the cop the truth \u2014 that I was admiring the natural beauty of their state and didn't realise that I was going fast. Which was the truth. America has some incredible sights that one can enjoying Driving, cycling, walking, hiking or by a train journey. Coming back to the point, the cop took my license and papers. Checked on his computer. Returned the papers and license. Gave me a warning and let me go. Your International Driver's license is valid for a year. Your American driver's permit (as it is called) is valid for 4 years. The Indian one should work for about a month or so. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience, I have a driving license issued in English by the state of Andhra Pradesh, in 2007, which says \u201cIndian union driving license, Andhra Pradesh\u201d While I was a student in the USA, first six months I spent in the country, 2014 , I could rent cars with this and my Passport, and no idp was needed. I did this till I met requirements of establishing residency, in some states like Georgia it is one month, and a state like Minnesota it is six months. When I am a resident according to the state law, I can no longer use my license form my home country. When I was close to becoming a resident for tax purposes, I went to get my license from the state I was living at. At this stage, completely depending on the issuing authority, they can accept your Indian license and remove taking a learning permit as a mandate, and straight away ask you to take a written test and subsequently a driving test, which is two steps before you receive your license in the mail. If they reject to honor your Indian license for any reason, print not clear, issued in the past and hence not a smart card, your state formed recently not in records for the DMV yet, eg-Telangana, you will have to obtain a learners permit, thus increasing a step making it three steps.

I have to say that I was surprised by that answer!  1949 Road Traffic Convention and the 1943 Inter-American Automotive Traffic Convention is an international agreement that allows this.  Like so many other things in the USA, it's one law with 50 different implementations.  Technically, all you need is a valid license issued by your government (and be on the list) to qualify. However, it would be best to get an International Drivers License from your government.  This license is slightly bigger than a passport and has a number of translations in it. a pdf with the list of nations belonging to the convention : http://www.massrmv.com/rmv/dmanual/appendixA.pdf the web site from the USA . gov  Driving in the U.S. I have been to India twice in my life, and I would say that the driving is a lot easier in the USA.

            "answer_text": "Alas! The US Government does not recognise the superior driving capabilities of Indian drivers and what it takes to drive on our roads. Our driving is relative. They believe in absolutes. Our speed and maneuvering are relative to other vehicles or objects (like cows, pedestrians, pot holes or people sleeping on the pavement). Deviants are quickly penalized. Punishment may vary from a simple reprimand (known colloquially as verbal abuse) to death. On the contrary, the US Govt. expects people to follow rules regardless of the fool right ahead of you. Silly people! How do I know this? My brother got an international driving licence from the local RTA office just before leaving for the US back in 2004. Assuming it was valid he bought/borrowed/rented (not sure which) a car and started driving around in the US of A. Until of course a cop stops him. My brother flashes his shiny new international driving licence. The cop frowns and says that it is only valid for a month from the date of entry and that he needs to get a licence issued by the local authorities. So, yeah he had to do that. ",
