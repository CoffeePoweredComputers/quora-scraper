            "answer_text": "One word: agency. Agency make any character strong. Not \u201cstrong\u201d in the sense that they\u2019re commanders or have a great deal of physical strength (which it seems to be confused for these days) but strong in the sense that they make the plot move forward with their choices. Rose from Titanic would actually be a great example of this.  No, she\u2019s not a fighter, nor is she trying to break the glass ceiling in another male-dominated field like chemistry, law or engineering. Just by looking at her, you can tell she\u2019s quiet traditionally feminine as well but yes, she is a strong female character. Why? Because most of the films plot points happen because Rose made them occur by the choices she made. At the start, yes, she\u2019s just reacting to what happens around her with her impending marriage to a man she both doesn\u2019t love and who has abusive tendencies. And yes, Jack does have to save her when he talks her off the ledge. But after that? Rose chooses to manipulate Cal into inviting Jack to dinner. The next day, she chose to seek Jack out so to thank him, not only for saving her life but for corroborating her story that she had slipped, rather than climbed over the railing. She also accepted his invitation to the third class party after dinner, despite knowing it was considered improper (and Cal even flipped a table over that in the next scene.) For a while, she again seemed to accept her fate as women of the era had little power outside of being married but chose to take Jack\u2019s advice and fight for what she wanted out of life, rather than what was expected of her. She choose to let Jack draw her naked and she chose to sleep with him too. And though she didn\u2019t make the iceberg hit the ship, she still made choices that drove them towards the end. Like going back to save him after Jack was accused of a crime he didn\u2019t comitt and choosing to get off the lifeboat as the ship went down and take on the risk of falling in the cold water where many passengers died, Jack included. And when he died, Rose didn\u2019t lay there and give up, she fought for her life and lived it, just like she\u2019d wanted to and was thus, able to honor her promise to Jack as well.  And it still didn\u2019t stop there. After Rose was rescued, she hid from Cal and used Jack\u2019s name once they arrived in New York City, both to honor him and hide from her mother and Cal, both of whom never discovered she lived thanks to her name-change. In other words, most of the plot points (save the iceberg) were driven by the choices our main character, Rose made. She wasn\u2019t a combatant, nor a genius scientist or really, anything other than a beautiful woman with no amazing talents to speak of. Yet I\u2019d call her a strong character because she was active in her life and because, most of the choices she made during the story sent the plot moving. Rose needed to be in that movie, as without her, most of the events would never have happened at all. The issue with the phrase \u201cstrong female character\u201d is that people see the word \u201cstrong\u201d and think it can only mean one thing; physical strength. For me, the word means this character is active in shaping their lives. As for how that looks? Well, that depends on the story you\u2019re telling. ",

            "answer_text": "The first question we need to ask ourselves is, what exactly is a strong female character? The \u2018Strong Female Character\u2019 is a common trope in media. She is bold and aggressive and emotionally distant and great at kicking ass and \u2018not like other girls\u2019. She has stereotypical masculine interests and scoffs at makeup and dressing up. While there is nothing wrong with writing a character with these attributes, it can be a bit tiring and repetitive to see all female characters written exactly like this. Often such characters might seem pretty one dimensional and lacking any depth, instead they feel like a caricature of a supposedly strong woman. This is because their is nothing more to their character than being \u2018strong\u2019. They do not have any flaws that make them human. Also when majority of strong female characters are written this way, it does seem to imply the a woman can be considered as strong only if she does not have any traditionally feminine qualities. A strong female character does not necessarily mean that she must be physically strong or has a bold personality. What is important is that she should be well written, have some depth to her character and play a significant role in the story. First let us focus on writing female characters with some depth to them. This means that they shouldn\u2019t simply be a one-dimensional idea of a cliche type of character. To give them this depth, avoid writing characters with traits completely confirming with one particular stereotype, like say, the tomboy or the damsel-in-distress or the mean popular girl. Instead mix up character attributes. Give layers to your character that won\u2019t be obvious at a first glance. This can be better understood with the help of a few examples. Rachel and Cassie from Animorphs Animorphs is a books series about a group of six kids who are trying to fight off an alien invasion. There are two girls in this group:- Cassie and Rachel. Rachel seems like a stereotypical blonde beauty, she is pretty and into makeup and dressing up. Whereas Cassie hates getting dolled up and is more comfortable in jeans and t-shirt. This would lead to the assumption that Cassie is more reckless and spirited while Rachel is the more soft spoken emotional one. However this is far from the truth. Rachel is the one who does not take any shit, the fiercest and most brutal fighter who is unafraid to cross any lines. Whereas Cassie is the peacemaker, and the one who is most concerned about maintaining the moral high ground. Thus both these characters are not simple caricatures of the Girly Girl and the Tomboy. Instead there is so much more to both of them. Their characters are a combination of different attributes, just like any real woman you would meet. Rose Maylie and Nancy from Oliver Twist Oliver Twist is a novel about a young orphan, set in early 19th century England. Two of the most prominent characters from this novel are Nancy and Rose Maylie. However Nancy is a far more interesting character than Rose, as she is well written. When asked to describe Rose\u2019s character, the only thing that comes to mind is the she is \u2018nice\u2019. She is good, kind, pure, loving and caring. There isn\u2019t much to her other than the fact that she is the epitome of goodness. In fact the only flaw she has is her family background, which is not even a character flaw. This makes her quite an uninteresting and one-dimensional character. Nancy is not exactly as \u2018moral\u2019 as Rose is. She is part of a gang of crooks and thieves. It is heavily implied that she is a prostitute. At the initial part of the novel she does morally questionable actions. However she seems to have regrets and later on in the novel she risks her life to do the right thing. It is obvious that her conscience hurts at some of the things she does. It is her circumstances in life that made her what she is, she did not have much of the choice. The moral dilemma she has and her struggles to do what is right makes her a far more interesting character then the perfect Rose. Another important factor to be considered when writing female characters is that they should have relevant roles in the story without being completely defined by the male characters. The character should be so much more than just the love interest or sister or mother to the male characters. There are some tests which help us determine how much importance the story gives to its female characters. Sexy Lamp Test Will there be any significant change to the story if the female character is replaced by a sexy lamp? If the answer is no, then it fails the sexy lamp test. This test helps us to understand if there is any relevance to the women beside being the love interest who just sits around and looks pretty. Only the stories which feature strong and well written female characters that actually have agency and make significant decisions that have an impact on the plot will pass this simple test. Bechdel Test Does the story have Two named female charactersWho have at least one conversation with each otherAbout something other than a man?If yes, it passes the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test ensures that there are multiple women significant to the story whose character arc does not revolve around a man. However this test is not without it\u2019s flaws, and can only be used as a baseline. It is not a fail proof test. Passing the Bechdel test does not guarantee that the story does not contain sexist or problematic elements, and sometimes a book dealing with feminist issues may fail the test due to various circumstances specific to the story. Tldr: To write strong female characters, it is not enough that they seem fierce and independent on a surface level. Your characters must be well written, three dimensional with unique strengths and flaws, as well as play a major role in driving the plot forward.
