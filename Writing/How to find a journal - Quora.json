Are you looking for an appropriate journal that will publish your work? This is a bit more difficult. I\u2019ve actually written a short guide that will give you some more information about preparing a paper for publication, including selecting the correct journal. Preparing to write a scientific paper As a quick summary, start by identifying your target audience. What journals do they read. What journals do they publish? This should narrow it down to a handful of journals. Next, you need to learn more about those journals. What kind of papers do they publish? What is the scope? Does it fit with your research topic? Try to find out as much about the journal. If you are not sure if it is appropriate, ask a colleague or ask the editor. They will be happy to help. Please let me know if this is what you mean with your question. Cheers Zoran ",
