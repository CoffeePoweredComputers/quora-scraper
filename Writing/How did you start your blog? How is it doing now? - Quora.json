            "answer_text": "Ahhh\u2026which one? I currently maintain several blogs of various subject matter. None of them are drawing great traffic numbers, even after several years. It\u2019s likely more about how I promote (or don\u2019t) them, or maybe it\u2019s just my subject matter isn\u2019t \u2018interesting\u2019 enough. Don\u2019t really know, but I do it anyway, because I enjoy it. I do use Google Adsense in my blogs, which, of course, is directly tied to traffic (and clicks from that traffic); which means my blogs are currently not earning a great deal. But again, it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s creative, it\u2019s \u2018rewarding\u2019 in other ways, so I continue. I also use some of my blogs to help boost my sales of graphics and slogans for imprinting on various items through sites like zazzle.com. I try to use the graphics I create for my zazzle \u2018store\u2019 in some of my blogs, and I provide links directly to my store pages where those graphics are being shown on the various products available. Again, unless you\u2019re \u201cready, willing, and able\u201d to put quite a lot of time and effort into blogging, making money doing that is rather slow and rather meager, at least in my experience. But I\u2019m already retired, and not eager for putting out lots of energy for something that might or might not succeed (monetarily); thus, I do it for the personal gratification and satisfaction I receive from writing about things I am \u2018passionate\u2019 about, y\u2019know? Just sayin\u2019\u2026 Here are a few of my current blogs/sites, for reference: Just Saying My Piece! Earn Money Online! Campfire Content Funding America\u2019s Healthcare Is It Any Wonder? There are a few others, too; check the sidebars on the sites for links. ",

            "answer_text": "I have written only one blog based on advertisements. And hopefully it is appreciated by many people. Following are the points which are my way of writing. If you don't prefer to buy paid plans in beginning then you can begin with free plan on WordPress.Later on when you are no more a beginner then you can buy hosting.Content is king. You should never compromise with content in any case.Blogging is 70% content and 30% digital marketing and SEO.There are several topics to write a blog. You can begin with any of the topic which you think you are good at. It can be related to fashion, cooking, management, lifestyle, food, books etc.It's not necessary that your topic should be something new. It is more important that what are the points which you can express in that topic and others cannot.It is more important that what is your take on that topic and how different or new it is from others.You can add images and themes in your blog which will make it attractive.Take a first step and post your blog. Grammatical errors or any errors are possible as a beginner but content should be worth it.Then learn basics of digital marketing and apply in your blog. The best way to learn digital marketing is through experience. Try to implement whatever you have learned in your blog.I hope it helps. I am also a learner and there are many things which I have to still learn in blogging. Anyways, if you want to see the samples on blogging you can read my blog here- Fevicol Ad Film by Ogilvy Firm and Pidelite Or you can also refer to WordPress or Google.. There you can find blogs on different areas. Best of luck. ",
