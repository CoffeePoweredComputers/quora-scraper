            "answer_text": "As a left handed oddity in a predominantly right handed world, I think it would be a waste of effort to learn how to write using both hands unless your right hand is at a constant risk of getting damaged permanently (work related, etc.) Lets put things into perspective;  1. Most things are more ergonomically designed for right handed people.  2. You'd always be a bit better using your dominant hand when writing even with much practice. 3. Should knock on wood (hope it doesn't happen), something happens and the need to using the non-dominant hand come, you'd probably learn much faster because its a \"need\" not a \"want\". I'd suggest spending the time and effort to learn something more viable and useful say a new language or skill. ",
