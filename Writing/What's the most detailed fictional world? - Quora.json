            "answer_text": "I would have to say it's the DiscWorld by Terry Pratchett. While there have been many worlds described in Fiction, very few have the depth of detail that the DiscWorld does, just off the top of my head I can name 10 different countries from Discworld, which all have specific cultures, climates and histories. But more than that, the detail spans the whole world, so you could actually describe the topography,(without having to look at some of the superb maps). Most fictional worlds are either mono-cultural or have interactions between a maximum of 3\u20134 different cultures, and they usually have specific climates and singular histories. This just isn't the case with the DiscWorld, and over the course of the many books, a very detailed and living world emerges. ",
