            "answer_text": "Marine vet here. Don\u2019t do it. Try to talk him out of it too. For starters, the likelihood that you both get the same duty station is incredibly slim. So not only will you not get to spend time together, but you will likely be stuck on opposite sides of the country. If you are a civilian, at least you have the choice to move to where he is stationed. Marines aren\u2019t getting sent to war at the moment. Combat arms Marines are melded to need battle. So not being at war is mentally and emotionally exhausting for a Marine. It\u2019s all \u201ctraining to train.\u201d Non-combat arms MOS\u2019s in the Marines are unnecessarily strict and obnoxious. You (and him) will be infinitely happier in the long run if you do the same job in a different branch. I haven\u2019t met a POG that didn\u2019t wish he/she was in the Air Force. Most embrace the suck and claim that they enjoy it, but no enlisted truly does. I HIGHLY recommend going to shitty college and then commissioning in the military after you graduate. You will make significantly more money, and have a much better quality of life. If you are going to join the military, at least join something that will give you a good quality of life. Suffering for 4+ years sounds cool when you enlist, but in reality it sucks. Above all, the one piece of advice I can give is to never, and I mean NEVER accept a contract for \u201cneeds of the Marine Corps\u201d as your MOS. Always have an MOS in mind, and never ever accept any job that you aren\u2019t certain you want. I cannot stress this enough. The recruiter is incentivized to get you to enlist without a defined MOS, and if you do, 99 times out of 100 you will be stuck in the worst, most degrading job the Corps has to offer. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, first you should realize you wouldn\u2019t be joining the Marines with him. You may join the Marines at the same time as him, but it won\u2019t be with him. You will flatly be joining the Marines alone. Again, you won\u2019t be joining the Marines with him, you will just be joining the Marines. If you enlist together, once you start training you will most likely never see each other again. You won\u2019t be kept together in any way even if you choose the same MOS. The only way you will probably ever see each other again will be if you both can get leave requests accepted at the same time and the one or both of you flies by civilian airplane and visit while you\u2019re both off work\u2026 usually about a week or two\u2026and then you both fly back to your job locations. Just like the civilian world when a partner moves across the country or to another continent\u2026 except harder to get vacation time at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "Just tell him you\u2019ve been thinking about it. There is, or at least used to be something called \u2018the buddy program\u2019. It\u2019s a conditional item in the contract that says you\u2019ll be stationed together. You\u2019ll want to ask the recruiter about the details, as it might just be a request to be stationed together. In any case, you\u2019ll join at the same time, get all your training done separately, and possibility end up on the same base. If it can work out like that, a word of advice. The Marines are not a family oriented organization. The divorce rate for first term Marines is extremely likely, like 110%, seriously. So, during your first term, DO NOT get married or have any kids. Marriage is tempting because it can get you out of the barracks and a housing allowance. I\u2019ve seen too many of my friends have it backfire and they would end up crushed. It\u2019s more important to build your foundation and be patient with each other, and have a long happy marriage. Take that advice seriously, and good luck. ",
