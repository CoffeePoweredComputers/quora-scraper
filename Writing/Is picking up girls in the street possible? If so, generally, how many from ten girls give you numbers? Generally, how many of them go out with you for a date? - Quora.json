            "answer_text": "Anything is possible! Before the existence of things like dating sites, how do you think men picked up girls?? It was at parties, churches, stores, bars, clubs, the street, etc. It was in person, which means that they put their fears aside and approached. Some guys are naturals and are good talkers so they may have better success with approaching women. The average guy, might get one phone number per 10, 15 or 20 women. If I had to give any advice, I'd say just get out there and allow yourself to get rejected as much as possible and learn to accept it so much that it becomes as easy as tying your shoes. ",
