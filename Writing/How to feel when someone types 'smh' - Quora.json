            "answer_text": "I dislike it, compared to using actual words. I think we\u2019re becoming over-reliant on these abbreviations. I understand using them in chat online rather than typing out a long phrase. However, I completely abhor people using \u201cu\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d and other such abbreviations. You\u2019re saving yourself TWO letters. What really upsets me is that these abbreviations are carrying over into our other written words. We use these in our emails and I\u2019ve seen them in letters and school papers as well. What\u2019s more unfortunate than ANY of these things is that it\u2019s now seeping over into spoken word. I\u2019ve heard LOL and OMG spoken out loud more times than I care to recall and several other things like this are coming out more and more often. I guess I\u2019m just a fan of proper English. *smh* *grin* ",

SMH. I like it. I wish Facebook had a SMH response button. It fits my response quite often. It is not mean. I will probably not use it because I never use any of these as I never think to do so when I am typing. I read them fine; I just never use them. Reading and writing must be in different parts of the mind. ",
