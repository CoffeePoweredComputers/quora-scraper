            "answer_text": "There are a couple of ways - You can get experience on low or no budget films, working for expenses only. You'll learn as you go and build yourself a solid showreel, then apply for paid work. How easy it is to get this kind of work depends on your current skill level and you may need to start at the very bottom and work your way up. Another way is to become an editing assistant - working with professional editors who will teach you things and building connections in the industry. These aren't mutually exclusive and you may do both. Having a job as and editor or assistant and then working on side projects in your spare time. Lots of people do this. In fact to get an editing assistants job you may need a bit more experience first. Usually you'll keep your 9 to 5 to start with, getting a bit of pro bono editing experience on the side. Before committing full time to editing. This is what I've done as a cinematographer. ",
