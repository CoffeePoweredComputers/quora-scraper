            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been to a lot of bridal showers and never once was I asked to pay for a meal. If I was planning one I\u2019d plan one I could afford without asking guests for pay for their meal. Most of the bridal showers I\u2019ve been to serve snacks and cake or maybe little sandwiches. It\u2019s usually at somebody\u2019s home and close family or friends might have all helped with bringing a salad or something. The whole point of having a shower in the first place it to help the bride with things she is going to need as a newly married woman. There are different kinds of showers and some have a theme. I\u2019ve been to all lingerie showers. If there is no theme you could get something that could look expensive but isn\u2019t. How about a really nice cookbook? You find a beautiful bag at the $1 store, tissue from the $1 store and a card. Then you could find a very nice cookbook at the used book store or online. Inscribe something nice in the cover and maybe flip through it and stick in a pink index card where you\u2019ve written \u201c\u201cThis is my favorite recipe!\u201d Then you could also out things in the bag with the cookbook like a mixing spoon, whisk, measuring cups or anything else that might look nice in the bag. You don\u2019t have to buy things from Williams and Sonoma for this at all and it can look very well thought out but not be expensive at all. Now, after all that she probably has a registry so you\u2019ll want to look at that. IF you decided you should be getting something off that list you should pick something you can afford! You can always take my suggestion and \u201c\u201cdress it up\u201d a bit so she will never know exactly what you spent. If she has dessert plates on her list you could get those and include pretty matching napkins from ROSS. you\u2019re still going to have to get her a wedding present as well so don\u2019t feel you must go into debt over this.

            "answer_text": "I cant believe anyone would invite someone to a bridal shower and expect them to pay for their own meal. Quite honestly you dont need to give a gift if you are paying for your own meal. YOU are the gift for being there. In my day a bridal shower was called a kitchen tea and no gift was allowed to cost more than 50p by today's standards that would probably be about \u00a32.50. We gave things like a tea cloth, tea strainer , tin opener etc. OR just stick a fiver in an envelope but frankly I would give NO gift as there is still the wedding gift to get. ",
