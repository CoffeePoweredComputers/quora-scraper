            "answer_text": "Although i agree with the other answers, i think it really depends on how do we define - \u2018being happy\u2019. For instance if \u2018being happy all the time\u2019 means being jovial, fun to be around, cracking jokes, then how would it look when somebody broke him/her the bad news that a loved one just passed away for instance. So as others (eg. Israel) has stated - going with the flow, ups and downs, not clinging to ideas, concepts, feelings, moods, perceptions, moods, labels, expectations, social norms, chasing money / fame / praise / gain etc Not resisting life - is the way to go. Being Free / Liberated / Awake does not mean having no emotional landscape and being cheerful 100% of the time. Having a fulfilling, meaningful life does not mean being happy all the time. Here a few little tips / traits of someone happy / peaceful / content IMHO that come to mind: Giving but not expecting to receive. Accepting everybody is similar (eg. we have body / organs / needs / wants etc) but also different (we all have different tastes / values / perceptions etc). Seeing the big picture and polarity of life. eg. You can\u2019t have light without dark. Too much sunshine makes a desert. Being Psychologically Flexible eg. Psychological Flexibility: The Superpower of Mental Health and Wellbeing See books / videos by Steven C. Hayes & Russ Harris eg. The Happiness Trap by Russ Harris peace ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say that person really gets it. Being always happy means accepting anything that happens to you in life. Whatever it is, you accept it and move on, and furthermore, you see it as a good thing. There\u2019s many people who live under the philosophy that every single moment of your life you are exactly where you need to be and all is as perfect as it can be. If you see life in those terms and choose not to judge whatever happens to you, but instead go with the flow and smile, life is going to be a blast for you. The majority of people though, are used to label experiences and stuff that happen to them as good and bad, and that creates a rollercoaster of emotions that can turn their lives upside down. So, it\u2019s really up to you how you want to see the world. Enjoy! ;) -Israel. ",
