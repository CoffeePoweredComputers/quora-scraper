In other ways, sometimes it can be bad for your health, as in it may cause insomnia or take your anxiety levels to the extreme.

You may also find it hard to relax and feel traumatized. If this occurs, you know you aren\u2019t in a good state to sleep or read another one. I prefer to read a factual book after a scary story as it helps me forget about it. I hope this helps. ",
