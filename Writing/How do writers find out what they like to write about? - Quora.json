            "answer_text": "I can only speak with any (small) amount of knowledge on Fiction.  I find ideas generate themselves while I'm reading. On average I read about 2-4 novels a week (unless life gets in the way), so I have never experienced a shortage of ideas.  The short of it is:  I've always liked Spaceships and Dragons. I read daily. During that time part of my mind is preoccupied with what I would be writing if I was in control of the story. Often that simple imagining spins off a completely unique story or idea.  My ideas are often \"what if\" situations from those two genres (sci-fi/fantasy), which I build into their own unique world. The \"what if\" method is something I took away from Stephen King, so he can be my example of how it can work in any type of fiction.  I love taking clich\u00e9s and shattering them into pieces. Reading Terry Pratchett my entire life was likely responsible for this.  My advice:  Read lots. On everything that interests you. Don't be afraid to write about anything.  Write, seriously, write. A writer will only ever find out what they like to write about when they begin writing. That's it. That is literally the only way to find out if you like to write about something.   See something you like? Steal it. Now don't be silly and directly steal the exact idea, that's a horrible practice. When you copy a piece, even with slight changes, your work is an ugly reflection of the original piece. There are some paintings I like, but I would never try to paint them myself.  I mean this in a different way. I appreciate how Brandon Sanderson creates his Magic systems, and the cultures of the worlds he builds. They follow rules or guidelines. It makes each book he writes have a unique flavour, and lets him avoid falling into any Fantasy clich\u00e9s. From him (and dozens of other authors) I've taken the importance of building a world, and showing it through character.  Take what you know from others, and blend it in a way that furthers the story you want to tell. Or the point you want to make.   Write what you know (non-fiction), but never fear exploring the unknown (fiction). Writing what you know gives you a solid position to start from. Write from your passions, write from your experiences.  However, I've always taken a small issue with this. It's always spoken of as a strict rule, and I disagree.  I don't know what being stabbed through the leg is like, at all. Sure, I've experienced pain, staggering amounts of it, but I don't understand the mindset that moment would bring. I don't know if my perception would speed up, or slow down. If shock would stop the pain, or if pain would become my whole world. I truly don't know with any certainty. Don't let that stop you from writing a scene where your character is getting stabbed through the leg. I've read enough, watched enough, and experienced enough personally to write it convincingly.  We're intelligent enough to imagine ourselves in situations, use that to your advantage.  Remember, I'm speaking of fiction. I'm not going to write a character that's an absolutely brilliant scientist as my main character, because I'm not smart enough to pull that off. I'll have them as a side character, and I'll research just enough to make it convincing.    You are the only you. (That looks stupid and obvious, I am aware) Don't be a bland knock off of someone who writes better. Practice enough so that you're comfortable writing about anything. What do you want to write about? Write it. It can be something thousands of people have already written on, if you write it from a place of open honesty with yourself, with no fear of how others may see you, you're already ten steps ahead.   \"Start telling the stories that only you can tell, because there'll always be better writers than you and there'll always be smarter writers than you. There will always be people who are much better at doing this or doing that - but you are the only you.\"   Neil Gaiman  For a better answer, refer to Ellen Vrana. ",

            "answer_text": "This is the approach I use to generate content and ideas. I\u2019m an essayist (although I prefer \u201cwoman of letters\u201d, can we start that?).  My writing is under 5K words. I will write longer someday and will use this approach, it\u2019s served me well.  1) Write what you know \u2013 My rule #1.   Write TOPICS you know \u2013 Dickens couldn\u2019t have written Jane Austen and Austen couldn\u2019t have written Dickens. They wrote the world and people they each knew. I\u2019m not going to write a book on Peruvian potato farmers but being a US immigrant in London? You bet.  It got easier when I stopped trying to write things I thought I should write (business) and started to write things I could write (self-reflection). If you want to write about something that you don\u2019t know about, experience it, learn about it, understand it. Then write if it feels right.  Write in the STYLE you know \u2013 I\u2019m from the Midwest, I read a bit and I grew up watching Britcoms. Thus my style is not-erudite, I insert the occasional intellectual tidbit for fun, and I love irony (highbrow way of saying I\u2019m sarcastic).  2) Read a lot and read aggressively \u2013  Read with the intent to learn and to stimulate your creative brain. Mark up the books, circle interesting things, talk out loud.  This is not relaxing reading, you WANT to reread paragraphs 12 times because you were daydreaming.  Let your brain meander. I have 3-4 books and jump back and forth.  I have a pen, a highlighter and a notebook. I shut off interactions, I\u2019m introverted so can\u2019t think well when interrupted by someone else (I can work around others though).  If you work better in a group or public, do what you need.  I wrap in a blanket and make a pot of tea (physical comfort is key too). I pick writers whose styles I like, who tell stories that trigger my thoughts, and who teach me new things. Today I had Pauline Kael, Anthony Trollope, London Times and Tina Fey\u2019s books open at once.  It is chaos. But from that come little ideas and then big ideas. It takes practice but if you do it well, it feels like flow.   3) Write it down, all of it, then make sense  \u2013  I read and take gibberish notes.  To bring order, I use a notebook, which I divide in sections.  In the first section I write ideas on topics. For example, something caught my attention recently that was a reimagined fairy tale.  I\u2019ve always wanted to do a reimagined take on Metamorphosis. I wrote that down. I brainstormed the idea of becoming mute (I fear I\u2019ll run out of things to say), then asked what effect that would have on others, could they understand me? I wrote this down. Now it's an idea.  I come back to these things later, rework where they could go, ponder, see if I can take it somewhere. If I can\u2019t, I let it go. (It\u2019s in the notebook, I can return). If I\u2019m on a roll and the story takes shape, I abandon the books, take out my computer and write the actual piece.  I write until my brain runs out of thoughts. In the second section of the notebook I write down words and phrases.  Today I wrote down \u201cluminal.\u201d  I loved it.  And the phrase \u201cshoveling it on\u201d which I found funny, perhaps I will couple it with something that is delicate to make it even better.  All things I read or heard.   I write down things that fit my content and my style. 4) Solicit and listen to feedback \u2013 Audiences tell you what to write.  And guess what, if you\u2019re good at writing about something, you will like writing about that something a lot more. Quora has been amazing because through my test/practice blog You better be written down, I\u2019ve gotten comments and feedback on what I can do and what I cannot.    People ask why anyone would write for free on Quora, and I say, hell, why do people REVIEW for free?  Don\u2019t care, they do.  And I\u2019m milking it!  Super smart (and opinionated) people here, take advantage. 5) Iterate Steps 1-4 -  I started doing this a bit ago and I was crap.  No thoughts, no ideas, no order, nothing.  I can improve a lot in generating, testing and improving thoughts (and writing, obviously) but I\u2019m better than I was and I improve the more I practice. That's it for me. Writing is personal so find your own way. One thing that is fundamentally true, however, is you have to put yourself in the right mental and physical state to unleash what\u2019s in your brain.  To connect with that flow, do whatever it takes and the ideas will suggest themselves to you. Then just write them down. ",
