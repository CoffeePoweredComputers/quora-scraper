            "answer_text": "As Ernest aptly points out, tuition ranges from \u00a325,000\u201335,000/year. Cost of living ranges from \u00a310,000\u201315,000. So at best, you are looking at \u00a335,000 per year, and at the most, \u00a350,000 per year, or \u00a3105,000\u2013150,000 over three years, which converts to $130,000\u2013190,000. That\u2019s a pretty good deal, considering that US universities of comparable quality usually cost approximately $300,000 over four years. ",
