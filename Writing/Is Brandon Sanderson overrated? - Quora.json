            "answer_text": "No he isn\u2019t. He is way too underrated. JK Rowling published 7 books all based in one world and she became a billionaire from it. Brandon has created so many different worlds and is even connecting them in a universe. Each world has its own magic system. Someone these worlds will have 5 book series, some 3, some a single one. I enjoyed all of his books. Some might take longer to get into then others, but by the end you are rooting for their characters. He gives countless people hours of entertainment and deserves recognition for it. Perhaps you dislike his way of writing, that is fine however you will find many fans (myself included who love his books) and one must give credit to where it\u2019s due. ",
