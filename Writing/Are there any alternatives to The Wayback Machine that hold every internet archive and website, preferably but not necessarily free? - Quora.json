Man, I don\u2019t know how one would do that, there is an enormous amount of Web content out there, some of it \u201carchival \u201c some of it simply abandoned. But Memento Time Travel, which runs as an extension in Chrome can find and reconstruct archived content from a large and expanding list of native archives. Most pages archived in the USA, are relatively easy to find, but Memento is rich in international repositories that aren\u2019t as well known or easy to access. The \u201cnative\u201d list is: archive.today, Archive-It, the Portuguese Web Archive, DBpedia archive, Icelandic web archive, Internet Archive, Library of Congress Web Archive, National Library of Ireland Web Archive, PermaLink, PRONI Web Archive, Stanford Web Archive, UK Government Web Archive, UK Parliament's Web Archive, UK Web Archive, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek , and transactional web archives that run the SiteStory software that self-archives web server content. cheers ",
