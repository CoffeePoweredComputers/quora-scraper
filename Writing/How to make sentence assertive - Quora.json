            "answer_text": "There are four types of sentence in English language. These are- Declarative sentence OR Assertive sentence,Imperative sentence,Interrogative sentence andExclamatory sentence.ASSERTIVE SENTENCE: A sentence that makes a statement or assertion is called a Declarative or an Assertive sentence. It starts with a capital letter and ends with a period. Sometimes Assertive sentence called Affirmative sentence but it is not all correct. Assertive sentence is divided into two parts- Affirmative sentence andNegative sentence.Affirmative sentence has a positive meaning but a negative sentence has a negative meaning. Both Affirmative and Negative sentence are Assertive sentence.
