            "answer_text": "Depending on what type of accident this was, your job or school may want to see the police report (if it was a car accident), or a note from your doctor (if it was an accident that required medical care). You would write a letter in addition to the above, and state what happened, the date and time it occurred, and how it has affected you, such as, how long you will be away from work/school while you recuperate. You would address your letter to your boss or human resources (if you are requesting leave from a job) or a teacher, professor, or principal (if you need to take time off from school). If your job or school responsibilities are such that you could work from home, and you are physically and mentally able to do this in your condition, you may want to consider offering to do some work from home. This will demonstrate that you still have your heart in the game. ",
