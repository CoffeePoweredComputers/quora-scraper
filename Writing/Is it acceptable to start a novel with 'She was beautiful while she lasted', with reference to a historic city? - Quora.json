It\u2019s acceptable to start a novel any way you like. Your book, your rules. But you want the start to be evocative and engage your reader. \u201cShe was beautiful while she lasted\u201d doesn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not a bad idea, it just needs to be made more evocative. Perhaps something like \u201cShe was beautiful once, this city by the sea, though her beauty had long since faded, her once magnificent tree-lined streets now overgrown and shabby, her stately Victorian mansions decaying into ruin.\u201d ",

Now look how it starts: \u2018Of course he was late.\u2019 That\u2019s a great way to start. Who is he? Why was he late? What was he late for? Why of course? In five words you put four questions into the reader\u2019s mind.\u201d I think you have to give the reader information fast enough that they don\u2019t feel lost at sea and give up, but you want to put questions in their mind, make them curious, make them care. It\u2019s a balancing act. But if you are going to be mysterious, please please remember a rule of writing so basic that I\u2019ve never seen it written down anywhere, yet Hollywood has managed to forget it: If you are writing a mystery, You must know Who Dunnit! (I\u2019ll never forgive the writers of LOST.) ",
