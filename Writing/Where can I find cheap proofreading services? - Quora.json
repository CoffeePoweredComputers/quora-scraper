            "answer_text": "You can find cheap proofreaders on all of the major freelancing sites (such as PeoplePerHour, Fiverr, and Upwork), but paying less isn\u2019t always worth it. Cheap services sometimes mean poor quality or that the person isn\u2019t skilled or experienced. And a poor-quality proofreader is little better than using free software such as Word\u2019s spellchecker. Like most things in life, high-quality proofreaders usually aren\u2019t cheap. If you\u2019re lucky, you might find a proofreader who is new to the freelancing world and still charging entry-level rates, but these great rates might not last forever. Generally, it\u2019s better to pay a reasonable price for a good, reliable proofreader who knows what they\u2019re doing. If you must go for a cheap proofreader, make sure you know what you\u2019re getting. Check their feedback and reviews thoroughly before hiring them. Look out for proofreaders who have a degree in English, have a certification in proofreading, or have experience working for a publisher. Ask them to provide a sample proofread, then check it thoroughly. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there are a lot of places where you can find cheap proofreading service on UpWork, Fiverr, and freelancer. Also, there are other options too like Grammarly and other online proofreading tools. But you can only rely on these tools when you do not focus much on the quality. Quality service cannot be cheap because a quality service offers good quality and trusted service by adding value to your content. ",
