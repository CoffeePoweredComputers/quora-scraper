            "answer_text": "I wish I could. But her deeds are entirely opposite of what needed to show gratitude towards her (lol!). In this era of emails and messengers, the people have also become virtual and have lost morality, respect and majorly common sense. Writing is the best way to showcase the feelings, though one can not see the emotion but can surely feel them. You can write as \u2018long\u2019 as you want and as much as you want. Also it showcases the worth of that person in your life, your love and affection towards them. It has it's own uniqueness and importance, especially in relationships. So if my partner is worthy enough, I would write not one but countless letter of gratitude. Cheers!! ",
