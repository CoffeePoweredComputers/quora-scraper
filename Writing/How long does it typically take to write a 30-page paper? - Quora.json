            "answer_text": "Actually writing it? If you have everything prepared and understand the subject and the specific material, a common average is an hour per page. But that is the easiest and quickest part. Finding the information, sorting out all the conflicts between different sources, often meaning going back through multiple levels of citations, working out how all the parts you will write about fit together, getting the graphics and other non-text parts in a good format, all that takes MUCH longer. It can take weeks just to search out all the possible sources, and the full process can take months, even years. For an example, that length is typical of a PhD or similar dissertation. Most PhD students start the work leading up to that before they even start a formal PhD engagement, and usually it is the thing that delays the completion, after at least 3 years. Some take 7 or more. ",

            "answer_text": "The length of time it takes to write a 30-page paper depends on the type and requirements of the paper. For an academic essay with fewer requirements, you can take up to 15 hours if the essay is purely textual. This also possible if you are typing at a speed of one page every 3o minutes. However, for a paper that requires the inclusion of graphics such as blog articles, it might take you up to 25 hours. Altogether, with editing, it typically takes one and a half days to write a complete 30-page paper because you will need to take breaks to freshen your brain. ",
