            "answer_text": "As you have asked the question, you want to give a review of the product on Amazon without purchasing the product. I would like to tell you that Amazon does not offer any product review without purchasing a product. But according to my experience, I have seen that if you buy a regular product from Amazon, then you can give a review on the product similar to the one you purchased without purchasing any product. But there is no guarantee that it will be live on Sunday or not, it will be a little doubtful, but Amazon does not accept any such wrong way of review. ",

It was a good idea, but here\u2019s what happened\u2026 Most very well written and actually helpful reviews got pushed WAY down to the bottom, while the people who actually bought the item write things like this: \u201cI like it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cIt arrived on time.\u201d \u201cIt arrived with damage.\u201d \u201cIt works.\u201d \u201cNot what I thought I would get.\u201d \u201cBoring.\u201d \u201cIt was the wrong color\u2026..\u201d And that is ALL. I\u2019m serious. A huge number of reviews that are now on the very top are literally one short line that does not help at all. ",
