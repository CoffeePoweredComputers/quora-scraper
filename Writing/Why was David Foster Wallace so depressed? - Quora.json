            "answer_text": "Depression is a physical disease with mental illness symptoms. Depression is not the act of depression. Depression is the lack of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. The symptoms of this deficiency is what we call depression. Your dopamine and serotonin levels are too low or missing. These are what your body produces when you are happy. If you cannot produce them, you cannot feel happiness. You can see it, but you cannot feel it. Like this question, the term \u201cdepression\u201d gives everyone the idea you are just constantly sad and miserable and everything will be better if you were just happy. But you physically cannot be happy. Those neurotransmitters do not exist, so that just leaves only the negative emotions available. So what I am trying to say is depression is not the overwhelming sadness everyone thinks it is, but the inability to be happy. Unfortunately, that is too unbelievable to understand. How can you have a missing emotion? But yet, that is what depression really is. I have been married for 25+ years to my college sweetheart. I have two brilliant children. I have a rewarding job I enjoy. I live in a 2-story house with a 2-car garage and a cat. What do I have to be depressed about? Nothing, but yet, I have depression because my dopamine and serotonin levels tanked. I tried all the natural techniques to boost them back up and they all failed. No matter how many hugs and happy thoughts I had, I was not getting better. I needed MEDICAL attention. Now that I finally found the right combination of medications, I feel normal again, but I cannot skip my medication. If I forget to take them in the morning, I can feel the depression creeping back in around lunch time. ",

            "answer_text": "Major Depressive Disorder is a chronic, often lifelong condition that takes a huge toll on the sufferer and on society. Medscape Log In This is a slideshow about MDD that addresses the suicide risk up front. I have suffered from it for 52 years now. It\u2019s hard to keep going, but people tell me I have work to do. UPDATE: I felt compelled to add more information about the risk of suicide. The following comes from: Depression and Suicide Please go there to learn more. Suicide Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people. A major cause of suicide is mental illness, very commonly depression. People feeling suicidal are overwhelmed by painful emotions and see death as the only way out, losing sight of the fact that suicide is a permanent \"solution\" to a temporary state\u2014most people who try to kill themselves but live later say they are glad they didn't die. Most people who die by suicide could have been helped. An individual considering suicide frequently confides in a friend, who may be able to convince them to seek treatment. When the risk is high, concerned friends and relatives should seek professional guidance. Suicidal thoughts may be fleeting or more frequent, passive (e.g., \"What if I were dead?\") or active (e.g., thinking of ways to kill oneself, making a plan). Preparations for death, such as giving away possessions or acquiring a gun, are cause for great concern. A sudden lift in spirits in a depresed person can be a warning sign that they are planning to kill themselves. Any level of suicidal thinking should be taken seriously. How Can You Tell if Suicide Is a Possibility? While suicide is often hard to predict, there are some warning signs: Being depressed or having other mental disordersTalking directly or indirectly about wanting to die or \u201cnot be around\u201dIncreased social isolationSignificant changes in appearance and hygieneGiving away valued possessions; making other preparations for deathA sudden change in moodWhile anyone can become suicidal, there are certain risk factors that make suicide more likely: Previous suicide attempt(s)Having a family member or friend who recently killed themselves; multiple suicides in the communityOther recent, significant losses, such as the loss of a relationship or jobCultural and religious beliefs supporting suicide (e.g., belief that suicide is a noble resolution of a personal dilemma)Alcohol and drug abuse (as this can lower inhibitions and increase impulsiveness)Feelings of hopelessnessAccess to means of suicide (e.g., a gun, a quantity of pills)Unwillingness to seek help and/or barriers to accessing mental health treatment",
