            "answer_text": "Although Churchill was said to quite skilled in the French language, he sometimes spoke an Anglicized form of French. For example, he would take an English word, and conjugate it as if it were a French verb. In 1943, when speaking to de Gaulle, he said the following: Si vous m\u2019obstaclerez, je vous liquiderai! He took two English words, \u201cobstacle\u201d and \u201cliquidate\u201d, and added the future endings, thus resulting in a rather humorous Franglais sentence. ",
