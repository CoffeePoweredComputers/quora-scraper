            "answer_text": "Sure. Your phrase stands on its own as a sentence: \u201cI'm about to leave.\u201d That is perfectly fine and something one might well say to alert others that one intends to depart immediately. I have heard people say that. There is more about this at the end, but something else came to the fore while pondering your question. My only criticism of your question is the misuse of punctuation: You forgot the commas. Commas are routinely omitted in modern writing, and sometimes they make a big difference. Without them, the meaning of a sentence, or even a phrase may become ambiguous. The two best examples I can suggest are song titles, but the third is so common that you probably see it every day in an email or text message. There is a song by Carl Perkins that he called Honey Don\u2019t! From the lyrics, it is clear that he addresses Honey directly and tells her forcefully not to do something. As such, the title should be rendered as Honey, Don\u2019t! (In 1955, publishers employed literate workers who understood this sort of thing and fixed faulty punctuation supplied by marginally literate artists. Look at the Sun Records label in the Wikipedia article.) Without the comma, it looks like the songwriter is explaining in an ungrammatical way that Honey does not do something. In modern times, this vital comma has completely disappeared. No one seems to know what it means any more.Britney Spears recently released a song called Work Bitch. This song title, too, is intended as an exhortation. Again, from the lyrics, it is clear that someone is being addressed as \u201cbitch\u201d, and that she is being told to get to work. When I first saw this title, I assumed that it referred to a bitch whose location was a place of employment. I thought that the person being described is a \u201cwork bitch\u201d as opposed to a \u201cclub bitch\u201d or perhaps a \u201chome bitch\u201d. As far as I know, no one has even said anything about this ambiguity induced by the missing comma. The album cover includes the same title with an exclamation point (Work B**ch!), but still omits the comma to indicate direct address. Am I the only person on Earth who thinks that Work, Bitch! should be the official title of this song?When you receive an email message that contains a salutation, does it always look like this?Hi Joe,In this last example, the sender really means, \u201cHi, Joe.\u201d That is a greeting, followed by a comma to indicate direct address, and then the name of the person who is being addressed. It is a complete sentence, so it concludes with a period. Those who follow the common form are conflating the archaic salutation form, \u201cDear Joe,\u201d with the more complex combined greeting and salutation. In the old form, Joe, who is held in dear regard by the writer, is being addressed directly. There is no comma after \u201cDear\u201d because it is an adjective modifying Joe, not something one is saying to Joe. It is not the same part of speech as the greeting \u201cHi.\u201d Whenever I explain this to young people, they give me a blank stare because they have no idea what I am talking about. These examples reflect the well-established trend that people have begun to systematically expunge the comma from general use. It has almost entirely disappeared in informal writing. One only sees it now where it serves as a de facto sentence delimiter in run-on sentences. They could use a semicolon, but that punctuation character is no longer used except as a statement delimiter in computer programming languages. Except in letter and email salutations, no one uses commas any more except literary cranks who write abstruse essays on forums like Quora. This is a tangential rant, but it does loop back to your question. I talked about comma use because, if I had not, you would have skipped right over this. Here is what you should have written. Is, \"I'm about to leave,\" a proper sentence?The rule is that when you embed a quotation inside another sentence, it must be set off at both ends with commas. Even if the quotation is a complete sentence unto itself that would normally end with a period, you must substitute a comma for that period if the quotation is not at the end of the containing sentence. I have always thought that this rule was a little stupid, and apparently, you did as well. You left a space between the last word in your embedded sentence and the closing quotation mark. Were you dithering about what to do? I empathize with you because I, at times, have had problems trying to embed sentences as quotations. What would you have done in your question if the embedded sentence were also a question? Consider this. Is, \"Are you about to leave?\" a proper sentence?Hmm. I would be hesitant to write that because it breaks the rule about setting off the embedded sentence with commas. You are supposed to put the second comma in at the end of the embedded phrase inside the closing quotation mark, but if you did that, you would have to put a comma directly after a question mark. If you left out the embedded question mark and used a comma instead, then it might not be clear that the embedded sentence is a question. One way to resolve the problem would be to put the embedded question at the end. The question mark, then, would do double duty by indicating that both the main sentence and the embedded question are questions. Is it proper to say, \"Are you about to leave?\"That might satisfy the punctuation police, but it seems a little too cute for my taste. I, personally, think that modifying the punctuation inside a quotation is stupid. If I were making the rules, I would specify that anything inside quotation marks would include only appropriate punctuation for the quoted material. Any other punctuation would pertain only to the containing sentence and be placed outside the quotation marks. Consider this question. What are the differing meanings of \u201cHi!\u201d, \u201chie\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d?Do you see how well that works? The first quotation is a greeting. It is a whole sentence, so it is capitalized and has ending punctuation. The other two are just words. The question mark is outside the last closing quotation mark, so it is clear that the last quotation is an element in the series as are the other two quotations. If one were to follow the current rules of punctuation, the sentence would have to be punctuated thus. What are the differing meanings of, \u201chi\u201d, \u201chie,\u201d and \u201chigh?\u201dThis is ridiculously ambiguous and absurd. It looks like the last item might be a question in itself. One might well reread the sentence to make sure that one understood its intended meaning. I\u2019m done with my punctuation rant. Lest we ignore the original question, we ought to address the propriety of sentence in question. The idea of \u201cproper\u201d can mean different things when you consider the context. A written statement can be ambiguous if the underlying intent is not stated. When spoken, the same phrase can clearly convey very different meanings by varying intonation and pacing. Consider what you might be saying with your original sentence. I'm about to leave. \u2014 Will anyone notice if I just slip out quietly? Does anyone care? Why don\u2019t you show me some affection and acknowledge that I have some worth as a person?I'm about to leave. \u2014 Well, that thing you said (or did) was terrible. It\u2019s enough to compel me to leave. However, I will stay if someone makes amends.I'm about to leave. \u2014 Oh, my God, that was disgusting. I can\u2019t tolerate such speech or behavior. I won\u2019t stay a moment longer.I'm about to leave? \u2014 I\u2019m almost out the door. Have you forgotten that thing you promised to {do | give me | say to me}?I'm about to leave. (downward tone at end) \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go, but I must. You\u2019ve clearly had enough of me and my welcome is clearly wearing thin.Indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes of course\u2026. It's similar to \"I am going to\", but it means that I am going to do something in the very near future, that it is probably the next thing that I am going to do. For example, \"I'm about to leave\" has a similar meaning to \"I'm on my way out the door\". Some examples John was about to sit down to dinner when the phone rang. ... This suggests that John was actually moving toward the dinner table and the action was interrupted by the phone ringing. Rumours that Microsoft is about to announce Office for iPad were current on the internet, in exactly those words, for at least three weeks before the actual announcement. I am about to start graduate school. ... This might be said weeks or months before you actually plan to start graduate school. It suggests that you have been accepted by a school and your discourse will involve preparing to start. If you look at the sentence \"It is about two o'clock\", that means that the time is close, or in the vicinity of, two o'clock. This is closer to the standard meaning of the word about, and may give some insight into why we use the preposition to give the meaning about which you are asking. \u2018To be about to\u2019 is used for actions that will begin very soon (in relation to the narrative \u2018now\u2019.) Some examples in the present tense: The train *is about to* leave. Hurry up, *it\u2019s about to* rain! The students are yawning. It looks like a few *are about to* fall asleep. And in the past tense: I *was about to* call him when he walked in the door. *was about to* have dinner when the phone rang. A similar construction is \u2018to be on the verge of\u2019. The contexts in which each is used are not identical though \u2013 \u2018verge\u2019 may suggest that something is building up to an impending climax. I find this job so frustrating that *I\u2019m on the verge of* quitting. The company is in bad shape. In fact, *it\u2019s on the verge of* going bankrupt. ['of bankruptcy' also possible]  ",
