Today I did some check-ups because I have trouble breathing. The doctor ordered me four days of medical rest since it resulted to be a lung problem which if not treated could get worse. To prove my justification I attach my medical certificate along with the order of rest and the prescription of drugs that will be using during this period. I wish you to understand me and understand that this is the fortuitous circumstance. If you decide to schedule such a meeting to a new date I would thank you to notify me Cordially, Juan Carlos Diaz SotoDepartment of FinanceINSURA S.A.C. ",

            "answer_text": "An excuse, in my humble opinion, needs to be clear, direct, and honest. Sometimes you need only say that you won\u2019t be there: \u201cI am unable to attend the meeting this Wednesday.\u201d You do not need to tell them why (my grandmother died\u2014again; I\u2019m going to the dentist; my azaleas will need watering). Not even if it\u2019s true. And a vague excuse (\u201cSomething came up\u201d) is just as bad. Of course something came up, or course you have somewhere else to be. Otherwise, you\u2019d be at the meeting. Right? Don\u2019t apologize unless you mean it. If your presence is essential, and you know that, then ask for what you want. Again, be clear. \u201cI am unable to attend the meeting on Wednesday. Is it possible to reschedule? Thursday afternoon will work for me, or next Wednesday.\u201d Saying \u201cthank you\u201d is good practice. ",
