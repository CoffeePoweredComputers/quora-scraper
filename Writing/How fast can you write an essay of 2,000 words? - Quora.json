            "answer_text": "This depends on the academic discipline and the professor\u2019s specifications. It typically takes me 20 minutes or less to obtain my scholarly references if it is 5 or fewer. Due to my experience I do not use an outline thus cutting time, as I have a built-in outline mechanism in my head. Once I come up with a clever hook and an adequate thesis sentence, I am off and writing the body. A typical 2,000-word academic essay is approximately 7 double-spaced pages, excluding a reference page and title page, if asked for. Again, dependent on the rubric and prompt, it takes me anywhere from 4 hours to a full day. On the other hand, if recounting a simple narrative essay, I can complete it in 2.5 hours or so. With practice comes timing. ",

            "answer_text": "Unlike my girlfriend who has kept some originality on her style of writing (she handwrites stuff on a notepad before typing it on a word processor), I end up opening MS Word or Google docs, then stare at the blank white screen growling like a hellhound until the writer\u2019s block lifts its\u2019 damned fog off my brain. Speaking of that moment when clarity hits. Most of my essays are opinionated, thus i do not bother to do any research (might do 3\u20135% of what normally should be done). Thus as the clouds of doubt lift off my brain, the strong thoughts come flowing. Opinionating my way through the 2000 plus words which will probably take me about 3\u20134 hours. That\u2019s all about it, folks. You just have to think it. The rest rolls in, on the right places. ",
