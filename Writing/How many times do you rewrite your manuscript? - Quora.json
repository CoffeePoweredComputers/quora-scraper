            "answer_text": "It depends. Sorry to be so wishy-washy. Any manuscript or book has three essential phases: research, writing and editing. Some of it takes a long time, some of it goes badly or well, some requires endless fiddling to get it right. So there are chapters or passages that are rewritten many times\u2014five, ten, twenty times\u2014and some that may not need it. Often material written later may affect earlier stuff and may require rewriting of one or both of these elements. Manuscripts are dynamic, living entities that often have a will of their own and make demands on the writer. Then there is the matter of fact checking, and its influence on rewriting. I usually leave fact checking for last, because it is usually straightforward and requires minimal, if menial, work. Every stated fact must be verified, every reference checked for correctness, unless you\u2019re writing sci-fi or fantasy in which you can play fast and loose with facts. Over all, I estimate that for every hour I spend writing I spend four hours fixing it. So . . . it depends. My least favourite response to this question came from a writer, who shall be nameless, who responded: \u201cRewrites? Editing? Say what? I just get it down and send it to the publisher.\u201d Perhaps he was so brilliant, such a natural, so dazzlingly talented, that he did not need to soil his hands with rewriting or editing. I do not think so but I will keep my opinion to myself. By the way, this writer was hugely successful, \u2018credited\u2019 with scores of potboilers. ",

            "answer_text": "You may not believe this, and some writers may call me crazy, but 0 times. Let me explain. I\u2019ve lost count of the books I\u2019ve written for my clients. I figure in the past six years I\u2019ve written at least 2 million words, and if divided that by 80k works, that\u2019s the equivalent of twenty-five full size books. Not all the titles were this size, but you get the idea. This does not count personal WIP\u2019s, personal short stories, or blog posts. So let\u2019s say I\u2019ve written a lot of words. During this intense period of writing I had to get very good at getting things right the first time. I outline and plot intensely, scene by scene, chapter by chapter. By the time I\u2019m done outlining, the events of the book are seared in my brain and I know the characters inside out. This doesn\u2019t mean I absolutely stick with the outline, but I operate on the theory that each chapter has a specific role to fulfill in advancing the story. Not only that but each chapter ratchets up the tension. The plotting part is complete and what I need to do is render the chapter word count according to the design of the book. The result is a tightly plotted book. There is very little cutting out a scene that doesn\u2019t work, or character that doesn\u2019t pull their weight, or rambling exposition that doesn\u2019t advance the plot. What I do perform is a thorough edit that grooms out vague, sticky and overused words, chop up extra long sentences and insert strong words in place of so-so ones. Finally, I clean up the grammar. Lest you think this results in boring writing, here is what a client said to me today: \u201cI like your writing style. Conversational and fun. This looks great!\u201d But that comes with six years of daily writing experience and studying my craft. Most writers don\u2019t get to write that much, as much as they\u2019d like to. ",
