            "answer_text": "Embrace brevity and here's how you can do it. 1. Read. Your thoughts are more or less aligned with what you read, so read meaningful content. What you read is what you think about and what you think about is what you write. If you come across a new word while reading, it always helps to look up the meaning in a dictionary and make a note of it. You can then use the word as a substitute for a phrase. For instance, \"get back to you\" can be replaced with \"revert\". It saves you 4 words. 2. Practice precis writing. This is the best part about the ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) board. It enforces precis writing as part of the English grammar curriculum in schools. Students are given a paragraph and have to bring out the gist of it in 60 words (including punctuations). No more, no less. Students have to rattle their brains as the 60 words have to include all important points addressed by the author. ",
