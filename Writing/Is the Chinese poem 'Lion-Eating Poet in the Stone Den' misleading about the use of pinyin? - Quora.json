            "answer_text": "That depends on your definition on nonsense. Does this sentence sound like nonsense to you: \"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\"?(Meaning: Bison who are intimidated or bullied by bison are themselves intimidating or bullying bison (at least in the city of Buffalo) -wikipedia) For me it does. However it uses a similar feature of the English language as the lion poem does for Chinese: \"Homophones\" = Words sounding similar but with unique meaning. Now, to your question. Is it misleading about the use of Pinyin?No, it is not. It follows correctly all the rules of Romanization of Chinese texts. It is an completely accurate summary of the sounds a Chinese person would articulate if reading the poem out loud. The poem read out loud would sound as weird and nonsensical as the Pinyin written down. (Correct me if I misunderstood your question. However, I believe this should answer what you want to know.) ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. In my opinion, this article (rather than a poem) doesn\u2019t have much to do with Pinyin. Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den by Zhao Yuanren (\u8d75\u5143\u4efb Yuen Ren Chao, linguistic, poet, composer and educator) is for amusement, a bit of \u2019showing off' (no offence to this prestigious linguistic) that you can actually write a whole article with characters with the same pronunciation (different tones). When we Chinese read it, we will admire Mr. Zhao\u2019s fantastic linguistic skills, his knowledge of Chinese, and the profoundness of Chinese as a language (\u4e2d\u6587\u7684\u535a\u5927\u7cbe\u6df1). No one will read it aloud - that is what we do for other beautiful Chinese literatures (poem and songs \u8bd7\u8bcd). Another thing is that Pinyin is a modern concept, for the ease of learning pronunciations of Chinese characters, as well as a link to the Romanian system, while Chinese characters has been there fore thousands of years. I mean, people can speak, read and write Chinese, without Pinyin. I\u2019'm not sure if Pinyin was there when Zhao Yuanren wrote this for fun. ",

            "answer_text": "I would call it devil\u2019s tongue. You don't want to hear it said out loud. We are perhaps considered nonbelievers by some and I don't care, but we are at least decent. I have never heard any Chinese talk or write like that. Maybe some blasphemous linguists would enjoy playing such an evil game. Pinyin with its imperfections can definitely serve as a tool for writing Chinese. Forgive me for my unwillingness to get into discussions about the fiction of pinyin being unworthy. I believe characters and pinyin can coexist. Let white cat and black cat work together to catch mice. They will not fight and bite each other to death. Character texts are excellent read visually, but are not always good for one\u2019s ear. On the other hand, although pinyin texts take more words to write, which might arguably be considered a downside; they are however more user friendly for listening comprehension. To make my point, I would like to invite you to have a good look at a short line of characters: \u9b31\u9b31\u5be1\u6b61\u81fa\u7063\u9f9c \u6e3e\u6e3e\u5669\u5669\u5e7e\u6642\u6b78 Just imagine a little kid writing each of those characters into tiny squares of his / her composition pads? How can anyone subject young children to such cruelty and torture. I guess the time it would take for a Chinese kid to draw all the strokes, no more no less, within boundaries, would be enough for a western kid to complete an essay paragraph. To me it is a unforgivable sin to subject any of our little friend to such monstrous task. I will end my answer with two different styles for you to compare: Which one has got higher IO, a cat or a dog? \u8c93\u8207\u72d7 \u58a8\u5e02\u5165\u590f\u6691\u6c23\u84b8\u4eba\u6eab\u5ea6\u9ad8\u9054\u651d\u6c0f\u56db\u5341\u5ea6\u6bcf\u65bc\u6d77\u7058\u898b\u773e\u96f2\u96c6\u4ef0\u81e5\u6c99\u4e0a\u70c8\u65e5\u4e4b\u4e0b\u808c\u819a\u8d64\u7d05\u800c\u4eae\u5982\u6cb9\u7206\u8766\u4ea6\u898b\u72d7\u96a8\u5176\u4e3b\u5410\u820c\u66f3\u5c3e\u5598\u606f\u4e0d\u6b62\u7109\u7d42\u4e0d\u898b\u8c93 M\u0101o he G\u01d2u Nage Zh\u00ecl\u00ec G\u0101o?

I hope you have come up with your own conclusion about whether that poem is misleading. \u4e00\u4e00\u4e00\u4e00 Attached is my answer to a similar question: Thank you for your comment. I don't advocate abolition of characters. I think pinyin and hanzi going hand in hand will benefit the whole world. Although as you argue the computer has made it easier to input characters, it does not address other issues, such as: visually oriented characters Words incomprehensible or hard to identify when heard Gap berween spoken and written language Custom of favouring shorter words Langguage not user friendly Translated words (lables) often misused. Definition, usage, etymology nowhere to be found Universal practice of direct word import rejected Ci (not words) is not clearly defined No gap between ci, thus no sense of grammar Ancient bamboo characters used in text and talk Too much liberty in forming words Trash words prevalent Xenophobia in terms of alphabet application I repeat : Chinese in character form suits us perfectly on paper, no reform necessary for that, but we can certainly do better with pinyin in this era of mass media .

            "answer_text": "This poem far predates Pinyin. Yuen Ren Chao wrote it in the 1930\u2019s in the United States, whereas Pinyin was not completed until 1958, and was partially based on Chao\u2019s own Gwoyeu Romatzyh. The piece itself only makes no sense in atonal pinyin, which is basically crippled pinyin (the equivalent of deleting 4 vowels from the English alphabet). In actual pinyin (or any tonal romanization), it is difficult, but not impossible to decipher, just like reading it out loud would also be difficult, but not impossible to decipher. Chao wanted to illustrate that the complete romanization of Chinese is unfeasible because classical Chinese is full of such pitfalls, and discarding classical Chinese is considered complete folly. ",

            "answer_text": "That is the point about Mandarin and Han Chinese. The meaning of the language is essentially conveyed in the text formed by characters, not much in the pronunciation. If you read out loud the essay to a native Chinese who does not know the story then he will be very confused. Nevertheless, if you show the text to him instead of reading it to him, he will understand it without difficulty and don\u2019t even need to read it out. This is what Mandarin and the Han Chinese language differs from most European languages. The basis is in the writing symbols, not in the sounds pronounced. Chinese writing text is not the symbols solely recording the pronounciations, it\u2019s the symbols that record directly the content of the language. ",

But I think it is quite far-fetched or \u201cpulled by the hair\u201d, as we Germans would say. Apart from far-fetched examples like this, apart from personal names and classical Chinese the characters can be replaced by Pinyin most time. Even some Tang poems by Li Bo or Du Fu can be understood in Pinyin only. With the Yijing (I Ging) it is much more difficult, I guess. ",
