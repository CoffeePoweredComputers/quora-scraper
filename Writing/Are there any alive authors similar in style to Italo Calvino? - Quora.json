            "answer_text": "This question is inherently difficult, because Calvino experimented continually with form, to such a degree that it's often said that no two of his works were written in the same style.   He's pretty unique.  His eclecticism and love of intellectual puzzles - and the beauty of his prose - reminds me a lot of Nabokov (not a living writer, sorry).  But he has a lightness, a love of slapstick humor, and a charming playfulness as well.  I've read some stories by Stephen Millhauser that reminded me of him, but Millhauser lacks his variety. Stanislaw Lem is reminiscent, especially of  Cosmicomics (again, not a living author). Early Pynchon perhaps.  Michael Chabon.  I see him as a strong influence on the Dave Eggers/ McSweeneys school of writers - they certainly share his playfulness.   If you're interested in some writers who most definitely are not living, Calvino gave a series of speeches about his influences that are collected in \"Six Memos For The Next Millennium.\"  It's a great read, and got me looking for all kinds of other Italian writers I'd never heard of before. Hope this helps! ***Update***I now believe David Mitchell is the living writer who comes closest to matching Calvino's playfulness, facility and formal eclecticism.   I've read three novels now and he measures up to Calvino's description of \"the sudden agile leap of the poet-philosopher who raises himself above the weight of the world, showing that with all his gravity he has the secret of lightness, and that what many consider the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars.\"  I really like David Mitchell.
