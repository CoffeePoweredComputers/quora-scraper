To show you some perspective Jeremy Schoemaker wrote every day for 3 years before he could get recognition and success. Are you prepared for this kind of work, if yes then read on Building an audience is all about gaining trust of your readers. You have to know about what you are writing and never try to write crap with half information because you will then be known as dummy writer. Step 1) No one knows if you are a writer, you will have to tell people that you are writer and brand yourself as a writer if you really want a career in writing. Step 2) If you ask for work, everyone will ask for your portfolio, so start building a portfolio Step 3) You should have a blog where you can tell people about yourself and your strengths Step 4) Showcase your work on your blog, this can be the first place to start building your content and start sharing on social media. Step 5) Create an account on fiverr, upwork, freelancer and other freelance websites and start bidding for writing projects. Step 6) Make sure that you are bidding low amounts for projects because you are just starting out and your main goal is to build primary clients and portfolio. You can charge top dollars later but you have to pay the price first. Step 7) \"Gradatim Ferociter\", Latin for \"Step by Step, Ferociously\" Let me tell you about a writer who I saw multiple times on my Facebook feed and other places. His name is Onibalusi Bamidele. He has been published on top blogs on internet. He is now very successful writer and you can follow his blog as he writes a lot of posts which helps amateur writers.

The are the people that will help you to get discovered. From my experience, one of the easiest way to achieve this is to always comment on their blogs. When I said comment on their blogs, I don't mind leaving mediocre, irrelevant comments all in the name of commenting, the type of comment I\u2019m talking about is the type that will arouse further discussion, engaging and meaningful comments that will make the blogger to notice you. If you do this 2 to 5 times, he\u2019ll certainly take notice of you, and that's how the friendship will kick-start. Another wonderful way is by writing and publishing guest posts on relevant blogs in your niche. The more you do this, the more you\u2019ll be able to syphon a part of the bloggers audience and make them yours. Check Website Traffic: 14 FREE Tools to Estimate Traffic Of Any Website ",

Be entertaining or informative, or preferably, both. If you do 10x work, people will notice. Then everything else gets a LOT easier.
