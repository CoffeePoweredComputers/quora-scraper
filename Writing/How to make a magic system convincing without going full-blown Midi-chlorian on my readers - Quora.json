            "answer_text": "Magic is, well, magical. Fantastical. You can do whatever you want with it. You have already decided not to be bound by physical laws, so go nuts. Be as imaginative as you like. But I think there are three important things you need to make a successful magic system: consistency, cost and balance. Consistency: Pretty obvious really. If you are not consistent in the rules of your system, the reader will definitely notice and feel cheated. Cost: Every magical act should have some kind of cost on the person performing it. It could be a physical drain, of energy, lifespan, blood, etc, or it could be a mental one, turning to the dark side, losing sanity, becoming more and more possessed by a demon, etc.  Balance: This relates to cost. Summoning a 40ft dragon should not be equivalent to unlocking a locked door. Deflecting an arrow should not be equivalent to reversing death. You need to design a balanced hierarchy of spells, both good and bad. And any magical minions your heroes face should have roughly equivalent level of spells at their disposal. But the 'bosses', they should be far more powerful, forcing your heroes to use intelligence, guile, loyalty and other positive things to overcome what looks like certain failure at the climax. A lot of people use a kind of rock-paper-scissors approach to balance. They use some version of the old elemental systems of water, earth, air, fire, blah, blah and blah. Then they work out a balanced graph of which elements defeat which others. This can work out well, you just need to be original with it. The problem with midichlorians, is that it tried to use scientific jargon and ideas to explain something inherently fantastical. That process takes away the awe and mystery of the force. If it is scientific, why don't they have scientific labs experimenting on those microscopic creatures, working out how they can make midichlorian-imbued gloves or sceptres or weapons for non-jedi troops to use. It just makes it more boring technobabble, instead of awesome mysterious magic. It's up to you how deep you want to explain your magic system. I think a good level would be half an explanation. Show it in action a lot and explain it a bit, but keep it slightly vague. People like the feeling of the mysterious, but it will also feel like a solid aspect of the world you create. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it's generally best to NOT make any attempt at explaining how the magic works. The magic-system in Star Wars was a lot more convincing, and less grating when they left it unexplained, it's only when they came up with a bullshit scientific explanation with midi-chlorians that it all started to look like transparent bullshit. Since magic by definition isn't explainable in a rational manner, attempts to do so by necessity backfire. Write down, and flesh out the system for the magic for yourself, but don't attempt to give the reader a full explanation for the entire system. Instead, just write what they do, and if they can't do something, then say what the limit is, but not why. As a rough parallell, if I write a story with electricity in it, I may write that some character turns on the light. I'll do that without explaining how switches work, or that there's hidden copper-wires in the wall that channels invisible energy to a lightbulb by way of pushing electrons around; all of that stuff is irrelevant to the story were all that matters is that the character did something, and the room is now lit. If my character runs into a limitation; it'd be the same deal: He'd fail to boil the swimming-pool with electricity, because the fuse would blow if he tries to pull more than 16 amps. I'd NOT want to explain what a fuse is, or that ohms law explains why the fuse blows when it does and so on; I'd instead simply leave it at that. The same thing applies to magic.  I snap my fingers and illuminate the room. I don't explain, or attempt to explain how that works. I'm unable to teleport to a location I haven't seen. No I'm not gonna explain why. I can make stuff levitate, but my magic ain't strong enough to lift more than about my body-weight, and it takes effort so I can't hold it up forever. Why ? Not gonna tell you. Any explanation would be bullshit anyway. Just make sure to make it consistent. I'll accept that lifting heavy objects is difficult without making an issue of it. But if some newbie magician in the next chapter lifts a mountain, I'm gonna go HiWaitaMinuteDidn'tYouSayThisWasHard? ",
