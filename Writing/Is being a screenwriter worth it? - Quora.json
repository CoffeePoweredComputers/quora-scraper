            "answer_text": "I laughed a bit about this question before attempting to answer it. Inasmuch as I find it amusing, I perfectly understand that there are some who genuinely want an answer to this question. I try my best not to be biased in answering questions related to any of my areas of specialization. So this answer is from my heart. We can liken being a screenwriter to being the president of a country. You know that the president controls the making and implementation of major decisions in the country. It is these decisions that in turn affect the life and condition of the people. If there's a bad government, there will be suffering, and if there is a good government, things would certainly be better. I give this analogy because I consider screenwriter to be more of a responsibility than it is an art. When you view screenwriting as an opportunity to correct societal ills, you'd understand that it takes a good screenwriter to write a good script that would address the problem of the society. Theatre is referred to as the mirror of the society, and the essence of it is to create a better world. When you see screenwriting or movies beyond ordinary entertainment to been a medium of passing a message, you'd understand it's power. There are many factors that would discourage the upcoming screenwriter. As a matter of fact, I'm still upcoming and I understand the huddles a screenwriter faces. From poor payment to the director messing up your script, sometimes even changing your story, the stress can be overwhelming. However, at every point you must remind yourself of the reason why you became a screenwriter in the first place. There's a lot more that I can say about this, but I don't think the space here would be enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Screenwriting itself? It\u2019s up to you to decide. But when you can see the results, when in theater or on tv people coming to watch the movie or show you wrote (co-wrote/rewrote/rewrote a bit), that\u2019s the moment that worth the process. The athletes receiving the medal for the accomplishment they just did. They trained for this for years, but it just paid off, when they run faster, jumped higher or kicked a** of now former champion. The writers recognized, often when work done a year or two ago (sometimes 5\u201310 years ago) was finally finished by somebody else and released. Some screenplays buried under so deep layer of dust, that they never see the daylight again. So this satisfaction can be never received. On the other hand, that\u2019s one of the best moral tests, showing if you really want to do this the rest of your life. So many screenwriters, agents and writing teachers tell, that the best you can do - write the stories you would want to see on screen yourself, if they were written by others. The talent? Myth. It just shows how quickly you can pick up particular skill - writing for example. So if you\u2019re ready to step into that shoes, let me a bit rephrase your question for you: Is doing the work you love worth it? ",
