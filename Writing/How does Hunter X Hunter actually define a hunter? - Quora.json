            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know what you specifically meant by that. But I think what defines a hunter is their capabilities to be one. Not just in terms of abilities but in terms of responsibilities to be a hunter. A license is not really necessary, take Kite for instance, he isn\u2019t a hunter however he\u2019s way better than many hunters themselves. Hunters have a broad field they could belong to but their main purpose is to explore unknown things such as the rare beast, hidden treasures, undiscovered places, old ruins or whatever that is as long as it\u2019s worth hunting for.
