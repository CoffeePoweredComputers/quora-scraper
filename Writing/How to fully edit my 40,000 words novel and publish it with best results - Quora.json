            "answer_text": "As others have stated. 40k word count is barely a novel but it makes a decently short novella. Most of not all professional editors take between 10-15k words out of a true book which is closer to 80-100k. So in editing your novella it would be decimated by such a cut and it would get pruned quite heavily. A publishing house wouldn't even examine it unless they were in the market for a short story and after editing it would be puny. So sorry write a much longer story before calling it a novel 80,000 or higher is generally novel sized books. ",

Unless it is aimed at mid-grade audiences, 40,000 words is very short for a novel. I suspect every publisher will dismiss your work without examining it because of the word count.

But anyway - The only way to learn how to do these things is to go through the process. I mean - how would you learn to cook a meal or fix your bike? You\u2019d DO THE THING. Slowly. With an instruction manual in one hand. And you\u2019d get better at it eventually. Everything you need to know about how to publish is on Amazon. Just read the FAQ. As for how to edit, how to write - you have to DO IT to LEARN IT. But - use a pen name to start. Then you\u2019ll be able to hide your early work in a few years when you\u2019re 1000% better. (How to do this is also in the FAQ). ",
