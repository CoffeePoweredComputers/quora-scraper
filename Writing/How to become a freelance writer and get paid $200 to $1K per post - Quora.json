            "answer_text": "I'll answer your second question first. To charge $200 for a single post, your work will need to be in-depth, thoroughly researched, and impeccably written. You'll need a thorough understanding of the industry you're writing for, including its major influencers, trends and pain points. Plan to spend at least an hour on research for every hour you write and to be responsible for connecting the post's content to the existing conversations in the industry. You're looking at 1500 to 2500 words per post. It's possible to charge that much, but your work has to say something that hasn't been said before. Dashing off a few 101-level paragraphs won't cut it. $1000 isn't an amount people pay for single blog posts. Sorry. To do this, you'll need to get into white papers, corporate brochures, business plans and the like. As to how to become a freelance writer at this level of the game: Skip freelancer platforms. You'll need to reach out to clients directly, either by answering ads or by cold-contacting.Have an impeccable portfolio that is easily accessible online. I set aside a page on my writer website and include the URL in client emails, but you can also use LinkedIn for this. You MUST have samples in your target industries to get this work.Orient your LinkedIn profile toward your target industries. Become part of their conversation. If you have experience working in those industries (and you should), make sure that's clear in your profile.You're talking about a level of the game that does exist, but it takes work, professionalism and skill to play.

            "answer_text": "I am not a freelance writer so this might not be the answer you are looking for. I\u2019ve been paid $200+ per post to write and here\u2019s how it happened. This came about from mainly two things: I had been running a game production company for a few years, working with brands people are familiar withI had written posts on our own blog on the topics of game development and production.So when I saw a company looking for people to write on this topic (I saw it on Twitter), I reached out and started getting paid to write articles on a topic I knew well. My point is, instead of thinking how to get paid a certain amount, think about why your post might be worth that much to a company. Establish authority on a topic is a good way to do that, and being able to show you\u2019ve done it before helps. ",
