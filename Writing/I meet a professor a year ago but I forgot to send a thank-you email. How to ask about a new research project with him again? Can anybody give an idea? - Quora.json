If you have proven yourself to be a reliable collaborator, I will work with you, even if there are personal problems. If we spent hours on the beach talking about late renaissance music, but you are a mediocre mathematician, I will not work with you. And thank you e-mails go right into trash. Not as annoying as head of department spam, but more annoying than penis enlargement spam. So don't think too much, just ask about another project, or suggest one yourself. The answer will depend on lots of factors, but not on aa forgotten thank you mail. ",
