            "answer_text": "Why do aspiring screenwriters fail? For one simple reason: because they\u2019re aspiring screenwriters. If you want to be a screenwriter, you only need three things: An imagination.A thick skin.The inability to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.That\u2019s pretty much screenwriting in a nutshell. How do aspiring screenwriters fail? By not approaching the industry as a business. And it\u2019s not their fault, necessarily; they\u2019re fragile little flowers who have always been told they\u2019re good enough, that they\u2019re pretty, and that their writing is the absolute bestest ever. They weren\u2019t taught how to take a punch. They don\u2019t know how to balance a checkbook. They don\u2019t know how to take a meeting. They don\u2019t know how to push or shove. They have shelves full of participation trophies, instead of a boar\u2019s head that they killed and field dressed themselves and then carried the carcass home uphill. Both ways. They\u2019re not A-type personalities. They hide behind their computer and anonymously submit their work to some dead email address that no one checks. They don\u2019t have a face-to-face with anyone. They don\u2019t engage in a live boss fight. They never level up. To correct some misconceptions: Screenwriting is a solitary vocation.Facebook, SimplyScripts, Reddit \u2026 they won\u2019t write your screenplay for you.\u2018Community\u2019 doesn\u2019t support screenwriting. Why? Because screenwriting is a solitary vocation. You can get feedback, and either fix your screenplay or defend your screenplay, but - at the end of the day - a \u2018community\u2019 doesn\u2019t buy a screenplay. It only pats you on the head and tells you you\u2019re pretty.There are PLENTY of communities out there for aspiring screenwriters. Most of them are made up of aspiring screenwriters. They\u2019re completely worthless. Just like aspiring screenwriters.If you\u2019re an aspiring screenwriter and you\u2019re looking to be judged by your peers you\u2019re an idiot; your peers are other aspiring screenwriters. Why would you want to be critiqued by other people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing?Aspiring screenwriters don\u2019t need to read each other\u2019s screenplays. They need to build the best story they can, follow EVERY rule, and sell their work. Screenwriting is a solitary vocation. Period.Organizations like the WGA encourage aspiring writers every single day. They have a whole list of pricing you can download, review, learn, and live by. That\u2019s all the encouragement any aspiring screenwriter should need.Studios encourage aspiring screenwriters every day: they buy screenplays, they make movies. That\u2019s all the encouragement any aspiring screenwriter should need.Contests, on the other hand, do nothing for aspiring screenwriters. Why? Because the only people who win screenwriting contests are the people who put on the screenwriting contests. Duh.You don\u2019t need \u2018thousands of books on screenwriting\u2019 to write a screenplay. The Screenwriter\u2019s Bible by David Trottier offers more than enough information to build a screenplay. You want to read more? Fine. Pick two more books. Read them. You\u2019re now done reading screenwriting books forever.Screenwriters - actual screenwriters, not aspiring screenwriters - don\u2019t \u2018blame\u2019 anyone, nor do they look for support. They approach screenwriting like a business. They write, they sell, they repeat. There\u2019s no \u2018lamenting\u2019 in screenwriting.Getting together as a group? Awesome. Aspiring screenwriters gathering to fail together. That\u2019s never been done before (triggerstreet, project greenlight, Zoetrope). Great idea. Procrastinate together. Fail as a large group. Screenwriting is a solitary vocation. Have you heard that before? Let me say it again: Screenwriting is a solitary vocation; you can\u2019t procrastinate NEARLY as much as you can in a large group, you can\u2019t second guess yourself while discussing the finer points of screenwriting software, you can\u2019t critique the latest moody vampire/child wizard schlock, and you certainly can\u2019t get sucked into reading the latest random action hero fan fiction so that the author - who clearly never took a grammar lesson to heart or knew that there was actual structure to a screenplay - will read your work and give you a pat on the head.All the latest \u2018we could start a website!\u2019 nonsense? It\u2019s nonsense. Write. Sell. Repeat.The odds are NEVER stacked against any screenwriter. Studios are in business to make money. You bring them a story that will make money and they\u2019ll pat you on the head, tell you you\u2019re the prettiest every, and give you a check. Now go write another screenplay.The gates to Hollywood aren\u2019t guarded at all. There are no gatekeepers. There are no gates. Turn on your turn signal, get off the freeway, find parking, and sell your work. No one is going to stop you from getting jumped into the gang.Every screenwriter can get a read. Every screenwriter can get a meeting. Every screenwriter can sell their work. The only thing missing from that last bit? The \u2018aspiring\u2019 part. Stop wasting energy trying to commiserate with other aspiring \u2026 no, scratch that; the word is \u2018failed.\u2019 Stop wasting energy trying to commiserate with other failed screenwriters. You don\u2019t organize, you sell. Write your screenplay. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do aspiring screenwriters fail? I believe I know why. When you look at the resources afforded to us, sites such as; facebook, simplyscripts, reddit ,etc, we don\u2019t have a community that supports its self. We do not even have the numbers to be judged by our peers. Most sites for writers such as facebook and the like, you can\u2019t even post your work for critique and the sites you can, it\u2019s always the same two or three people comment and always to tear people down. Instead of us helping each other. We need to read each others scripts. We need to critique and better our works. No one else will. Organizations such as the WGA do nothing to encourage aspiring writers. The studios do nothing to encourage aspiring writers. They could band together to help shape the future generations, but they are content with remakes and reboots. They do nothing to encourage writers. Then we also have to contend with contests that you pay to enter and maybe win a little and no guarantee your script will go anywhere while the ones over contests pocket a huge sum from all the hopeful writers. Then you have thousands of books on screenwriting but none from the actual studios. We can only blame ourselves for not supporting each other and most of all waiting for Hollywood to come knocking. My own personal thought is; why wait for Hollywood? If we could ever get together as a group, form a website, shape and build our scripts and then start our own channel such as on ROKU. We could start a website for a modest fee (that goes into filming our scripts) we pick scripts work and share shaping them and if revenue is raised by advertising, the writers get a chunk of that. Of course we need directors etc etc. If only we could just work together. Alone we wait for the studios to come to us, together we are the studio. We start small with horror and drama/comedy and build from there. I have ideas on how it could work, but I can\u2019t even get reads as most cannot. So how can you get your peers who won\u2019t help each other to organize? We just don\u2019t and millions of us die still waiting for a chance.
