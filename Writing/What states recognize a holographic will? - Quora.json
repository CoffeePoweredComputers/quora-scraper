            "answer_text": "\u201cUnited States The following states recognize holographic wills made within the state, though witnessing requirements vary: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. [20] The following states do not recognize holographic wills made within the state, but recognize such wills under a \"foreign wills\" provision (i.e., the will was drafted wholly within, and in accordance with and is valid under the laws of, another jurisdiction): Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana (which refers to it as a \"foreign testament\" provision. [21] ) Connecticut, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin. [20] [22] [20] [23] Maryland and New York recognize holographic wills only if made by members of the Armed Forces. In both states any such will is void one year after that member's discharge from service \u201cunless the testator \u2026 does not then possess testamentary capacity\u201d under Maryland law (Md. Estates and Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 4-103(b) (2013)) and for one year after the testator regains testamentary capacity under New York law (NY Est Pow & Trusts L \u00a7 3-2.2(d) (2012)). [20] Indiana and Missouri have no statutes making references to holographic wills. [20] All other states not listed do not recognize a holographic will in any instance.\u201c Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "A holographic will is simply one written in the testator\u2019s own handwriting These are problematic for a lot of reasons Rather than focus on a holographic will, what you should be focused on is getting your property and money into trusts with designated beneficiaries. These are invisible to the estate and bypass the will entirely. As such, they bypass inheritance taxes, too. Even if you \u201cdon\u2019t have enough to worry about\u201d, getting what you have into a trust make it less worrisome for those who survive you. My mother put her holdings into trusts - and when she died, probate was a simple filing because her estate was practically empty. Nobody can contest the beneficiary of a trust. ",
