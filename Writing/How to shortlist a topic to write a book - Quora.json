            "answer_text": "Compare and combine potential topics from outlines into a collection that strives for a major question or theme. The way to do this is to write them all to some length, one or more summary paragraphs, and get a sense of what could be expanded upon, possibly after research. What often happens is that it seems like too much for a single book, or else there are others also on it that have or had interesting angles, and it translates to something else. Try to defend it from criticism as another way to see it develop. Here it may have to field some very basic, disarmingly naive, questions, that point to related complications. Mostly it is about what is worth spending all of that time on, if only because that is what excites the audience. That is going to be a fraction of the thinking that goes into the notes. ",
