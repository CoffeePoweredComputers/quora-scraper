            "answer_text": "This is simply how I perceive it, but his wording and sentence structure is often short. If you compare it to Stephen King or Tolkien, both of these authors rely on descriptions and details in their story telling. Hemingway once mentioned that he often wrote and drank. I would guess that he did this, not only from vice, but to get the real raw emotion without inhibitions and put them down on paper. That and it's simply his general style of expression. He enjoyed keeping it to the point, straight forward, and perhaps a good platform for some insight on how male energy can also look compared to some of the more tender ways to write a make perspective. Not to say of course that's in every case, but it shows the stark contrast between the era and energy he had if you line up another author. Sometimes it can seem dry without more detail or description of what a character feels, or the happenings around them, but it's the flavour of his text and story contents that go hand in hand, and they seem to suit each other.

            "answer_text": "Hemingway\u2019s writing style is not unique. His minimalist approach seems to have been suggested to him by Gertrude Stein, but it has other practitioners. Though Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, I would argue that Raymond Carver is actually the most skillful wielder of the \u201cHemingway Style.\u201d Since fewer readers every year mistake Hemingway\u2019s bland style for profundity, his literary star slowly falls while his rival Fitzgerald\u2019s star blazes on. The Great Gatsby is not subtle, but it contains much of the stuff that dreams are made of, and its poetry does not seem to go out of style as Hemingway\u2019s lack of poetry has. ",

            "answer_text": "Hemingway left a strong impact with his use of abbreviated prose. His sentences were often quick, snappy, a style that wasn\u2019t often employed in his day because back then writers often got paid by the word And that is why the best of yesteryear like Dickens and Hardy and Bronte would spend three paragraphs describing a couch. The best writers of that age turned these flourishing descriptions into an absolute art form. But then we turn the century and along comes brash Mr Hemingway and his colorful but relatively abrupt style. And it was this style that heavily influenced literature from that moment forward. there are still writers who embrace the longer form and many who remain heavily influenced by the likes of Dickens. JK Rowling would be such a writer. if you\u2019d like an example of a modern day writer still using the older, flourishing technique, try this link.

He was and is copied, even to the point of parody, but most of that is just jealousy. You have to remember novels before Hemingway. He was a fresh style and voice and was devoted to his work. Read \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d if you are really interested. ",

Sort of hinting what may be the big problem. So the reader gets drawn in more. When the reader has to solve a puzzle, the story has a more personal connection. ",
