RESEARCH - Make sure to research what makes or constitute a \u201cgood\u201d article for a website. What variables or factors are taking into account in order to produce a \u201cgood\u201d article.LEARN - Master those variables or factors that makes an article \u201cgood\u201d.PRACTICE - Make sure you practice this until you drop dead. Perfection comes with practicing. I heard that in order to \u201cmaster\u201d something you need around 10,000 hours of experience on it and, to be fair, it makes perfect sense.REPEAT - Keep repeating these steps over and over again. Stuff that made an article \u201cgood\u201d 5 or 10 years ago might NOT be the case next year. Especially since search engines are constantly changing the rules of the game.",

            "answer_text": "Writing is a pretty nuanced skill. What you learned in school provides the groundwork for best practices, but in reality the rulebook gets thrown out a lot when you write articles for sites. It\u2019s because of the way we interact with content means we don\u2019t spend as much time reading it. Usually we skim through articles because we want to get as much of the key information as possible. Does this mean write with terrible grammar? Definitely not. But you have some liberty to be creative. A lot of bloggers and entrepreneurs who make a living out of content creation find a lot of success in writing in a conversational style. It reads as if they were talking, and how we talk in person is very different from the written word (and usually a grammatical trainwreck). If you want to learn how to create content, pick an area that you\u2019re interested in, otherwise known as a niche, and start writing about it. You can offer to write articles for free and submit them to relevant sites, or you could set up your own site and post your articles there. As you learn and research more about the niche, take note of what people talk about and the type of language they use. Is it friendly? Filled with humor? Maybe it\u2019s super formal and filled with technical jargon like the cryptocurrency niche. Invest in yourself in many ways. There are lots of free resources out there that teach you how to write. I like Ahrefs\u2019 content like this article teaching you how to write a blog post - How to Write a Blog Post in 9 Steps (That People Actually Want to Read). A lot of high-authority sites also have their own academies that provide free courses, like HubSpot Academy. Through your journey, you\u2019ll come across learning how to write articles that rank high in Google. After all, you want your content to be read by as many people as possible, right? That involves search engine optimization (SEO) and keyword research. Once you have experience learning how to do these basics, you\u2019ll be set to write awesome articles that get a lot of traffic. Hope that helps :-) ",
