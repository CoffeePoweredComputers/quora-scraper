First, it's simple shares... then simple words... then broken half-liners of comments... then tentative full liners... then more correct one liners... then more confident two liners... then almost suddenly a long para of angry blast:):) Internet has given us ready-to-use content; reproducible analysis; copyable style and a huge graffiti space to write on. There's a platform for every taste, intent, caliber and purpose.  Internet excites you, provokes you, tickles you, invites you, seduces you, angers you, and eggs you to come out of your shell. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Arthur C. Clarke made a wonderful case for dividing word-gatherers into two groups. There's writers, and there's Writers. The first, with the little w (and that's the majority population of the internet) are amateurs. The ones with the big W, though, they're pros; they write for a living. There's a whole spectrum of quality, not all are articulate. I've seen failures of grammar in professional work, and I've seen poetry in tweets. So, yes, from its need for us to communicate using text, the internet has made writers of us all. And, occasionally, it has made Writers. ",

I tend to agree for those attempting to write on mobile phones.  The LOL, BRB and BFF shorthand for everything is a step in the wrong direction.  Of course, as a writer, I enjoy the \"long form\".  Best wishes! ",
