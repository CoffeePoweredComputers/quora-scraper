            "answer_text": "First of all let me compliment you on your clarity of objective. It is essential to bear in mind that writing skills cannot be improved without you having adequate language skills, especially a good vocabulary. With enthusiasm, passion and self discipline, you can definitely make good progress over the next few months. However what is important is to keep up the learning process over your life time. Hence it is important that you also focus on your reading skills.Simultaneously you must also focus on your writing skills.I shall share my thoughts below on how best you can do both: My suggestions to make the best out of reading are as under:Reading is of course an enjoyable and fun way to expand your horizons whilst also enhancing your vocabulary. If your objective is to become an excellent speaker and writer, it is an excellent beginning. However, to ensure you leverage the power of reading, keeping in mind your larger goal, I suggest the following: \u2022 Read a wide variety of books - fiction, non fiction, poetry, biographies, humor etc. This will give you an insight into the varied genres of writing as well as expose you to style, language, development of thought, the art of writing etc. \u2022 Ideally sit at a desk and read. Keep a dictionary, a thesaurus and a note book and pen handy. Look up the meanings and synonyms of new words and usage. Jot down some key learning, fresh insights, practical tips etc. Reading for relaxation is a lot different from reading with a focus. \u2022 Try to use the new words in your conversation with others. You can also try and use it in any writing that you do. This will help reinforce the meaning and usage of the word as well as widen your vocabulary. 2. To test and improve your writing skills try and do the following: \u2022 Summarize the books you read - it could be in the nature of a book review or alternatively an outline of the key learning's or a 20 point summary etc. Choose your own style and ensure you write a minimum number of words e.g. 500 -1000 words. \u2022 Look up the net and participate in various writing contests. It could be essays, short stories, poetry, science fiction etc. There are plenty of contests open for youngsters like you and there is always a possibility of winning or getting an honorable mention which will be a great motivator for you. More important is the fact that you are putting your language skills to the test and there is a motivation to do so. \u2022 You could also write out some speeches. These will come handy for you when it comes to practicing your speaking / oratory skills. \u2022 Attempt writing different genres of prose and poetry. Humor, fiction, features, limericks, haiku etc. will help you identify the style that you are most enamored and comfortable with. To enhance your oratory / speaking skills you should attempt the following: \u2022 Join a club where you can learn to be a good public speaker club e.g. Toastmasters International or the Junior Chamber (Jaycees) or Round Table \u2022 Prepare a few short speeches and practice it a few times ( visualizing an audience) and also try to record it, preferably video-graph it. Study the outcome and note the changes you have to make. If possible take the help of an expert or at least a third party who can give you objective feedback. \u2022 Use every opportunity to face an audience. It could be simply reading out a notice at school or reading a passage in class or introducing a speaker or proposing a vote of thanks. A speakers biggest challenge is to find and face an audience. Hence create opportunities to address an audience. \u2022 Pay attention to feedback. Do not feel threatened or dispirited by negative feedback. Perhaps there is some merit in the feedback and you can try to overcome the faults / limitations brought to your attention due to the feedback. \u2022 Try different styles of content and delivery of the same topic. Assume your audience is different for the same topic. e.g. school children / youth / adults / senior citizens / critics of your idea etc. \u2022 Learn to engage the audience. This is the test of a successful speaker. Use humor / examples / exercises / stories / props etc. \u2022 Look up Ted Talks and You Tube to see how speakers effectively engage an audience. Make jottings of key points that catch your attention. Try to emulate them. Be careful not to merely copy them but imbibe their style and spirit in your talks.
