            "answer_text": "I think you may need to modify your question to explain what you mean by \"IR\". Does IR stand for Institutional Research, Infrared Radiation, International Relations or even Information Retrieval?  Edit: Well then, it so happens that in addition to a PhD in Wireless Communication, I have a Masters degree in International Relations.  My answer would be quite generic though. It is quite normal for a potential PhD candidate to have wide ranging interests or be \"undecided\". In such a situation, it would be wise for you to have a proposal crossing 2 to 3 of your interest areas. Do some preliminary literature review on a few of the areas of interest and if possible take note of the leading authors/authorities in these areas. Certain research databases allow you to follow trends in the area by alerting you to new publications in the area or by the authors.  The key is not to worry too much about the actual research at this stage, because you will have loads of opportunities to pivot or narrow your focus once the PhD has started. However, be sure to prioritise your interests and restrict to only the top 2 or 3. ",
