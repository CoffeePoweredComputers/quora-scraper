            "answer_text": "Book answer here.  I have to say, Tyrion\u2019s arc has impressed me pretty deeply as a quality of GRRM\u2019s writing. Jaime is a man who does horrible things who turns into a good man. Tyrion is precisely the opposite. Where Jaime puts all blame on himself for his actions, where Jaime is introspective, Tyrion has always tended towards blaming others and thinking quite highly of himself. And, it just impresses me on re-reading. that GRRM has dared to turn his favorite character, a person who seems so obviously disenfranchised, to end up rather wrong in his interpretations. Compared to both of his siblings, Tyrion is no worse for ware. His greatest complaints against his father are, obviously, the fact he defiled a peasant that Tyrion believed genuinely loved him, and that Tywin denied Tyrion his birth-right, and his passions. Tywin, however, is a bit more complex than that. He treats Jaime and Cersei with as much contempt, and I might even say more contempt, compared to Tyrion. He shares with Tyrion some smug and knowing conversations. Often tells him what he approves of in Tyrion\u2019s actions as well as where Tyrion could do better, and rarely is Tywin necessarily \u201cwrong.\u201d Cersei, meanwhile, he literally sold off as though she were a brood-mare, and Tywin constantly vocalizes his disgust for Jaime\u2019s choice of profession and his hopes and dreams. Upon rereading, I don\u2019t see Tywin as a guy who despises Tyrion, but a hard man who constantly grooms him for leadership in spite of his vices. Let\u2019s be real here, an heir to Casterly Rock should not marry out of love or be prone to revelry. In Tywin\u2019s own, warped, way, I think he felt Tyrion was smart, but was ironically too entitled. A lot of Tyrion\u2019s victories and successes are due to an over-reliance on the superb resources he has at his disposal, his family name, and his wealth. A lot of his failures are when people genuinely outsmart him or when he fails to foresee what others do see. Tyrion revels in his intelligence, but is not as smart as he claims to be. He claims to be disenfranchised, but is the son of a Lord who marries him with Sansa Stark, which, all things considered, isn\u2019t a bad deal for him. Of course, Tywin never shows any affection for him, and many characters see it, not just Tyrion, as Tywin despising his son. Myself being a cynical asshole who struggles to show affection, I feel well qualified to say I can easily see Tywin\u2019s actions contradict this. Tywin often compliments Tyrion on certain successes, while also constantly reminding Tyrion that the only reason he recruited the Mountain Clans was his superb wealth, the only reason they prevented King\u2019s Landing from being stormed and manned by Baratheon forces was the fact that Tyrion had access to an extremely potent explosive, an explosive Cersei probably would have thought to utilize anyways. In spite of this, Tyrion has good ideas. He contributes. But he overestimates his strengths greatly in the grand scheme of things. This is why Tywin made him Hand in his absence, and why Tywin keeps trying to tell him he is a Lannister who is worth more than a peasant girl, who Tywin would rather groom to have a place in the Lannister Dynasty than send him off into the world in revelry. Even seeing that Tyrion was being targeted by Cersei, perhaps Tywin thought Tyrion would be happy at the Wall, serving a purpose away from the politicking and disaster that had brought him low? In his own warped, medieval, way, I think Tywin loved Tyrion, but Tyrion just couldn\u2019t see it through the steely, often violent, disposition. I see Jaime Lannister as the introspective son who believed he was in an evil system where he had no control, who grows to see he can make a change and that being a fundamentally good person matters, whose father held him in contempt, even told him *Jaime* was not his son, because Jaime refused his birthright. I see Tyrion as the cynical son, the one offered prestiges by his father, who often took them as a slight. Tyrion goes on to think rather highly of himself as the \u201cintelligent man rejected.\u201d He feels rejected, and small, therefore he is, even as the evidence suggests otherwise. This rejection turns him into a rather bitter man more reminiscent of a petty bully. He despises most company he comes across. He bullies a fellow dwarf for being just too cheery and hopeful. He takes free sex from a slave girl with little hesitation. He fantasizes about revenge and debauchery. In short, Jaime is the stereotypical asshole knight, turned hero. Whereas Tyrion is the stereotypical plucky minority, the sympathetic reject, who may just turn into a villain. I find Tyrion\u2019s arc, and where I *think* it is going, far more fascinating than even Jaime\u2019s. I think both arcs will rhyme in a disturbing, yet rather meaningful, way. ",

To convince her, I told her about how there is a character who throws a child out of a window, and he ends up being your favorite character  Jaime Lannister\u2019s arc is incredible. Especially since half of it is actually already happened. We starts the series with Jaime Lannister as an arrogant, evil bastard   Already we get this great reading of Jaime via Jon, one of the best in the whole series, I think. We later hear a lot of negatives about Ser Jaime, from Eddard, Bran and Arya. And than we get this:  He really is an evil dickhead. A man with Shit for Honor. But than we learn about Why. This is when we get the first half of his story. About how he was once a young, idealistic boy ready to join an ancient and honorable organization. And than we get the early bit of cyniscism. About how Aerys raped his wife and could do nothing. This retroactive character arc is actually really interesting and the best version of it I can find. Now, however, he\u2019s moving forward. It\u2019s Jaime actually being better, who despises his sister and ran off with Brienne to help Sansa Stark. He\u2019s working to be Gold Hand the Good. But he still has too much Tywin in him.  These confusing and often opposed characterizations make Jaime incredibly fascinating. Now, Tyrion and Cersei have great Arcs as well, don\u2019t get me wrong. Cersei\u2019s descent into Madness and Tyrion\u2019s twisting into a villian is fascinating, but none of them them have moved half as far ",
