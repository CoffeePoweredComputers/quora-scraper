            "answer_text": "No, however, I always wanted to. I even went to a website that had lists of prisoners and their crimes, so that you could pick one and write to them. However, I did remember a movie that I saw once about a convict who left prison and went after the person who wrote to him and raped her. I do feel that some people do repent for their crimes and I hate to think of them in a cell alone, with just my thoughts and regrets, I thought maybe a prisoner would benefit from my writing to them. I think that unless I know someone who has written to a prisoner or has found a pen pal another way, then I would be inclined to do it. I did try to learn Italian with a pen pal service, but that did not go well, as the first thing men asked were if I had a boyfriend, how tall, how much I weighed, it was annoying. It lasted about 3 days and I deleted my account on that website. ",

            "answer_text": "I have had one pen-pal in my life. When I was five years old I started corresponding with a lovely lady of sixty-plus years who was a friend of my maternal grandmother. Grandmother had just been widowed and moved out to California to live near us. She wrote regularly to her dear friend Hazel, still back in Upstate New York. She told Hazel, who was a cat lover, about my love for cats. So Hazel sent me a letter with some adorable pictures of kittens. I wrote her a thank-you note. She wrote back, a chatty letter, perfect for a five-year-old to read. We wrote back and forth for about 3\u20134 years, until her death. We talked about our cats (I had a real kitty by then), and the beach here, the fall color and winter snow there. I always felt bad that she was too frail to travel here, and I, of course, was far too young to travel there. So we never got to meet. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, you bring back sweet memories with your question. I had two lovely German pen pals who gave me a lot of insight into life in Germany for teenagers. I was a 14 year old teenager in India, and romance was only kept within the heart. I couldn\u2019t have thought of having a partner at that time. Anja and Petra who were the same age as me, would write about going for weekend trips in the mountains with their boyfriends. I happily lived their lives vicariously in my heart. I learned about how they had household tasks to complete at home, while I didn\u2019t have to move a finger at home. I learned to appreciate what they did, and became a more mature teenager as a result. They wrote about their pets and what they fed them. I loved reading this, as I didn\u2019t have pets of my own. Every month, I would eagerly await their letters. Seeing the German stamps and their unique handwriting on the envelopes would make me jump with joy. What lovely times they were. Truly had fun reminiscing about those times, and writing this answer. ",
