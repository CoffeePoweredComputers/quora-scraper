            "answer_text": "For me, essays are all about being creative. All you need is a statement on a certain topic and then to support it with legit arguments. My favorite thing is to form a question out of the topic and answer it negatively. This way, I\u2019m teasing my readers, and if I manage to actually support this argument, it always makes a great essay. For example, let\u2019s take this topic \u201cThe way to dress for success.\u201d Think of it as a question - \u201cDoes success depends on the way you dress?\u201d and then answer that question with a big \u201cNO, it doesn\u2019t!\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure there are plenty of successful people that don\u2019t really dress properly. If you are into music, you can check out Mac DeMarco - the guy looks like a hobo, and he loves it when the flight crew, for instance, redirects him to the second class and he complacently waves his VIP pass card in their faces. You don't necessarily need to believe in what you are writing! You just need to find the right arguments that support your weird statement. My advice - get as weird as possible and research how to support your unusual thesis! ",

            "answer_text": "By following two simple rules Use the Ws - Whenever a topic is given, ask What, Why, Who, When, Where and How. Answering these questions about the topic, about every word or phrase in it will lead to multiple answers. What seemed like a narrow topic to write on, suddenly has multiple possibilities.PESTEL analysis- This is the second easiest thing to do when you have to write about anything. PESTEL stands for Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal. Whenever a topic is presented to you, try to analyse it from these perspectives. It helps when the topic is broad and technical.Hope this helps! ",
