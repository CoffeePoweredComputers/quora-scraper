            "answer_text": "Of course you get paid but when you work out the hourly rate its generally on par with the custodial staff lol. You are mostly cheap, highly qualified labor. I understand not paying you what a fully trained physician may make but as a resident what you get paid only compounds the insult of medical school costs. I know PA\u2019s who make 100k+ a year and most residents I know are at least as qualified as a PA early in residency and more qualified later on The general range of resident salaries is about 35k-75k. I was lucky enough to train at one of the highest paid residencies in NYC and during my last year of residency made about 74k base and then I had moonlighting on top of that. Something to consider during residency is if they allow moonlighting and are there in house opportunities. I had friends making 40k a year in residency and they had to take out loans on top of there medical loans just to get by. Going further and further into debt in a noble profession where we are helping others. I believe a residency should pay you a salary at least on par with what they would pay a PA and have it be a salary you could live off of without having to give up essentials and cut corners in your life just to get by. If you look at the medical system and all its inefficiencies especially in the hospital i could save a TON of money by making changes getting rid of so much admin, people not working hard, paper work, scut work and take those cost savings and pay the residents appropriately ",

            "answer_text": "Residents get paid, depending on their rank, in the vicinity of $50-$60k per year. Enough to get by on. Probably not enough to start paying off loans. Definitely not as much as they could be making if they got a job straight out of undergrad and did not incur medical school debt. This is one of the reasons why, contrary to the belief of many, doctors don\u2019t make an exorbitant wage. Their wage is commensurate with the amount of training and the job they do, and it can take 10\u201320 years to close the income gap that develops because they don\u2019t have income in medical school, they incur educational debt, they make only enough to live and not enough to save or pay off debt during their residency (and fellowship) which can be anywhere between 3 and 10 years, their debt compounds while they are unable to pay it off, and they come up for air in their 30s with $200k in debt, no assets, and no retirement savings. Don\u2019t even get me started on the whole having kids and saving for college bit. ",

Eventually we were given an extra week of  \"vacation\".    We could not take it without being fired because there were only 3 residents at each level so including interns (who are not really working with us but were in a categorical internship) there were 12 to cover 3 hospitals full time and 6 months of the year one was off at a total joint center.  So extra vacation meant nothing, it  could not be taken as pay.  When I started moonlighting I made $60,000 dollars a year.  Of course I was working quite a number of hours, but the moonlighting kept me afloat.   Now they make $50,000 a year in the surgical sub-specialties.  With inflation they are getting approximately 50% more using inflation CPI values. ",
