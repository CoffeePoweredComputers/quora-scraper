            "answer_text": "As a strong proponent of education as the pipeline by which our culture, industry, language, and knowledge passes from generation to generation, I was once extremely idealistic about the future of education. However, as my time at UCLA ended (where I minored in education) and my career in education began, I came to become somewhat disillusioned by the realities of life. In 2009, the year of my graduation from college, I still saw business and education as distinct and separate entities. However, as capitalism and the privatization of\u2026virtually everything that has anything to do with money\u2026serving the privileged and elite, I watched the public schools increasingly serve private interests, private services such as extremely expensive consultation services expand and grow, widening the gap between those who can afford the services and those that must be resourceful to the point where no page of no book is to be unturned. In order to write an essay about why education is important to YOU, you must be able to conjure sensible, logical, rational, and effective reasons to back up your claims that education in fact, is important, and worthy of our funding as opposed to more carriers and warheads. According to the writings of Sir Ken Robinson, a leading proponent of education, states that there are essentially three functions of education: individual (development of self)cultural (understanding of how to function in society)economic (providing you with the skills to make money and hold down a job)Through my tutelage and upbringing, the meaning of education has transformed many times, and I predict it will continue to as long as the world evolves, which it will. I originally thought education was about learning and the sheer passing on of knowledge. For example, how to do arithmetic, read, and write, basic skills like that. Then, when I hit middle to high school, it took on a social darwinistic type of nature where education had strong elements of the survival of the fittest. There are the top 10\u2019s, the ones with the highest GPA\u2019s, the battle for the highest SAT scores, and the desire to scores as high as possible and to do as many community service hours as possible to bolster that application package. THEN, at UCLA, the education minor came in the upper divisions, and now I understand why. Even during my junior and senior years the courses of \u201cRace, Gender, and Inequality\u201d and \u201cEducational Policy\u201d went right over my head. I thought it was all about pedagogy (teaching methodology), but what the education program at UCLA was trying to instill was a sense of social justice. By that point, it wasn\u2019t simply about the transference of knowledge, or the three components as proposed by Sir Ken Robinson, but SOCIAL PARITY or social justice. In our society, there are the haves and the have nots, the privileged and the underprivileged, the ones that can and and those that cannot afford it. A capitalistic and darwinistic society, by nature, will drag the poles of society farther and farther apart unless it is controlled by some kind of force\u2026namely education. It could be politics, government, economics, or any other powerful societal factor, but education was my weapon of choice. Instead of widening the achievement gap, education can keep this gap close enough so that the marginalized, the impoverished, and those that will end up with the undesirable jobs and undesirable lives can at the very least, have a chance\u2014through education. I don\u2019t know where I am anymore in terms of education because I was once so passionate about it, then I became disillusioned and now I\u2019m in a position where in my own eyes, I\u2019ve sort of made it out of my previously impoverished state into a position where I can affect the next generation through my mind. However, what about the rest of society? How can I reach those that don\u2019t know how to access the resources or simply don\u2019t believe that they can? How can we inspire them and help them believe that yes, it is possible to ascend out of this poverty and into a world of greater good? The answer is\u2026I don\u2019t know. I am only one person and I\u2019ve discovered I work best alone. So I write and I write and I write because that has always been my means to my ends. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll get there or what the \u201cend\u201d even looks like, but we must continually strive for progress, like what Obama represents, what Bernie Sanders represents (although he\u2019s a bit too idealistic), and what even Martin Luther King Jr. represented. That one day, we can truly be equal. ",

            "answer_text": "A 5-step Plan to Write an Essay on the Importance of Education 1. Open your essay with a strong hook, a human-interest story about what happens to people when they do not have a good education. Get the readers\u2019 attention and impress on them in a visceral way why this is an important issue that they should pay attention to. Engage their emotions from the very beginning, but do it quickly, in a single paragraph. Don\u2019t let them go to sleep! Make them sit up and take notice. 2. Summarize the various views, models, theories about the importance of education, about the outcomes of education and how it impacts other variables like income, longevity etc. Point out why they are not good, or as good as you\u2019d like them to be as an expert and thought leader in the field. State their shortcomings and the contradictions and paradoxes that they cannot explain. 3. State your own thesis \u2014 the more controversial the better, provided you can support it with evidence and argument. For example, you can perhaps argue that (this is just a hypothetical example) small countries necessarily have a better education system and so it\u2019s not surprising at all that Scandinavian countries have such superior education levels. 4. Compare different subject, countries, persons etc. with data. Provide graphs, tables, charts, photos, illustrations, and references to books, interviews, web sites, recorded interviews, your own personal experiences and anecdotes, etc. Support and prove your thesis with all the evidence you can bring to the table. 5. Wrap it up by concluding how your evidence has supported the thesis that you laid down in the very beginning of your essay. Declare the direction of further research, what needs to be or can be in the future along the same lines, and more importantly, what needs to be done to FALSIFY your thesis. What is the counter- or alternative-hypotheses that if proven true would falsify your thesis and findings? It\u2019s important o spell that out as well. That will further bolster the scientific status of your essay. Good luck! ",
