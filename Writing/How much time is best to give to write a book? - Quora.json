            "answer_text": "The answer is quite subjective. It completely depends upon your writing experience, your speed, and your discipline. For experienced authors, it can take a few months to maybe a year. Some even finish a book within weeks! For new authors, generally, it takes about one or two years. I would advice you to not hurry and finish the book as quickly as you can. This is not how writing is done. If it's the first book, it takes well deserved time, and that time should be given to it. Spend a minimum of one year on your first book. You will learn as you write. ",
