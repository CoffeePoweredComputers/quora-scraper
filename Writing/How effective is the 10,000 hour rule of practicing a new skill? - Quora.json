            "answer_text": "Very effective . . . But 10,000 hours is not really what you should be thinking about. Most people who have heard of this \u201810,000 Rule\u2019 and think that is what they need to be come an expert at something. However, the underlying study is discussing what it takes to be absolute world-class and top of the top. This covers so few people and that is why they are the exceptions. In our \u201cnormal\u201d lives, what you should be striving for is excellence and above-average skills. This can be achieved in a time line that is WAY SHORTER than 10,000. In fact, there is a great TED Talk where he shows that, in an little as 20 hours, you can become fairly proficient in a new skill. I highly recommend you guys watch this video from Josh Kaufman where he goes into more detail:  Do you want a Nobel Prize or be the next Wimbledon champion? Well, then you might need that 10,000 hours of practice. Do you want to be very successful in your career and have all of your needs more than met? You can do this with steady and focused practice, but in way less than 10,000 hours. I hope that helps you have a better understanding of what is really needed to succeed and not to think it is way out of reach. All the best, Sol PS.
