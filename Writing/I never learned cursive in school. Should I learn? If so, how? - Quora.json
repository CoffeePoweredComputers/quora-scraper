            "answer_text": "Yes, you should at least learn to read it. That will take you no more than an hour or two. Then you\u2019ll need to practice occasionally for a while to keep it in your head. Be aware that writers vary greatly in legibility. Also, the formation of some letters has changed over time. You sometimes need to bring a lot of flexibility to what you expect to see, but learning to read cursive is really not a big deal. You have a gaping hole in your education if you cannot do this. Learning to write cursive takes more effort and may not be worth your time. I gave it up because my cursive was never pretty, but I can print well. Done well, cursive is very nice to look at. Most women seem to do it better than most men. How to learn? Google \u201clearn cursive\u201d and go from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Learning cursive is fairly easy. It is not as if it was a lost art. The library has a number of books on cursive and graphology. You can also ask someone who does know cursive to show and drill you. Once you know the alphabet you can move to workbooks. My teacher taught us by writing various words on the chalkboard. A small board, hand-holdable, is a great tool. No wasting of paper. Once you know how the various letters join up with any other given letter, that is always going to be the same. Basically they connect mid-height or connect low. Think of a hoop rolling across the ground. Some letters like I or L execute like an up and down wave. Yet they still finish connecting mid or low. The same is true of letters like j or p. Only in the downward direction with them. I know it may sound confusing just having it explained, but it really just comes down to practice. Any skill is worth learning. ",
