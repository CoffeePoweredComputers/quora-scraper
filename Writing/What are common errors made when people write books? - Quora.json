            "answer_text": "Do you want to know the most basic errors people make when writing a book? Would you like me to count the stars in the heavens above while I\u2019m at it? Seriously, writing well isn\u2019t a matter of luck or desire. It\u2019s a matter of studying, learning, and practicing\u2014just as with any profession. I\u2019m going to bet that, if someone removed your appendix without ever having taken a single medical course or observed a solitary operation, you wouldn\u2019t be very happy with the results. The same is true for every profession, including writing. Here are only a few of the pits novice writers tumble into. Failing to outline. If you don\u2019t create a synopsis followed by a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of your book (fiction or nonfiction), you\u2019ll find yourself winging it until you flat run out of gas or trip over your own thoughts. When that happens, getting your writing back on course becomes far more of a chore and less of a joy than it should be.Using passive voice. If it can be written in passive voice, it can be rewritten in active voice, which reads SO much stronger. So, get in the habit of learning the difference between the two and concentrating on powering up your choice of verbs. Instead of this: He was being hit by John, write this: John hit him or John began hitting him or John pummeled him. It\u2019s the difference between weak and strong writing.Using adverbs. Nine times out of ten, an adverb merely succeeds in greatly weakening (see what I mean?) a sentence. Better: Nine times out of ten, an adverb ruins a sentence.Saying it instead of showing it. You should SEE the scene in your mind, evaluate it, play with it, and explore it before committing it to paper. Ask yourself what you see, what images are projected in your mind. Explore the sensory triggers such as taste and feel and smell. If you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019re simply stringing empty words together. Words don\u2019t create thoughts in people\u2019s minds; images do. Instead of this: The sun rose in the sky, try this: The sun exploded across the horizon. Same thought, different results. One enables the reader to see absolutely nothing; the other paints a mental image he may well remember for days, weeks, or even years to come.Failing to revise. Revisions to most writers are a waste of time. Beginning writers, especially, want to keep charging forward. Unfortunately, a single look into the rear-view mirror would show them a world of inadequacies. Every writer must take time to re-read, revise, and edit. If you don\u2019t know how to edit (it\u2019s not a God-given, inalienable talent), take some courses, read some books, or go to work for someone who does. Like your weekly newspaper or a local blogger in need of content.Not realizing there\u2019s more than one way to filet a trout. If the way you write something sounds \u201cfunny,\u201d take the same thought and rewrite it. Use a different word order, or create the same thought using different words that mean roughly the same thing. Writing isn\u2019t about putting words \u201cout there\u201d and walking away from them. It\u2019s about combining words into phrases, clauses, sentences, and paragraphs and then honing them to near perfection before trying to make them still better.Failing to read out loud. You heard me. OUT LOUD. Effective writing for inspiring reading requires a strong literary voice. You\u2019ll never develop one if you don\u2019t read your material out loud so that your ears can actually \u201chear\u201d the cadence and rhythm of your words, the alliteration, the poetic meter\u2014all those things that happen when a writer puts words together. If your literary voice is weak, you\u2019ll never know it by reading to yourself from a typewritten piece of paper or, worse yet, a computer monitor. Instead, lock yourself in a room somewhere, and read your work out loud, noting weak spots that need revising. If anyone overhears you and questions your sanity, refer them to me. Believe this: If you ever want to be a great writer (forget merely \u201cgood\u201d), you\u2019ll need to develop a strong, literary voice\u2014just as you need a strong spoken voice to become a great speaker. So, read your work out loud, and hone in on the \u201creal\u201d you. End of subject.Writing differently than you speak. Going hand-in-hand with finding your literary voice, beginning writers often turn to \u201cWriterese\u201d when they sit down in front of a typewriter or keyboard. Writing to them suddenly becomes an exercise in displaying their innate brilliance. Believe me, whether or not you really are brilliant, no one will ever know it if you write in a stilted, unnatural voice. Leave the Writerese home, and \u201cdance with the one what brung you.\u201d That is, use your real voice whether speaking or writing.Relying upon the advice of amateurs. Yes, that includes most writing group members, literary reviewers, self-annointed \u201ccritics,\u201d and even many writing \u201cinstructors\u201d or coaches. The best writers write. If you happen to find one who also teaches, count your blessings. Otherwise, taking advice from an untrained, unqualified, unskilled writer is like deciding what pill to take based upon your plumber\u2019s personal recommendation. You may get lucky now and again, but I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on it!Not writing. By this I mean not writing regularly. I don\u2019t believe in regulating the number of hours you write in a day or a week or a lifetime or whatever unless you absolutely need to do so to become more disciplined. I do believe in writing everything you can, in all different genres and for all different grades and educational levels, as often as you possibly can. Easy enough for me to say: I write for a living. When I sit down at my desk every morning, I have two things to do. Check my e-mail and write. I understand from a previous life, though, that not everyone has the luxury of concentrating on writing. But everyone does have the luxury of writing as often as circumstances allow, and that\u2019s all anyone can ask of you.There you have it. My top ten tips for becoming a better writer and avoiding those mistakes that beginning writers most often make. These, as I said, are only the tip of the iceberg. But learning from them will take you a long way toward becoming a better, more consistent, more successful writer. So, what are you waiting for? Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Although, we\u2019re living in an age of increased transparency, driven by Internet communications and the rise of self-publishing, several common errors remain. These include: The myth of unlimited income opportunities. Too many authors view book publishing as a practical alternative to winning a lottery. Yes, celebrities with familiar names, like recent presidents (or their wives) continue to get 6, 7, or 8 figure publishing contracts, but they\u2019ve already \u201cpaid their dues.\u201d For everyone else, book publishing is a hard way to generate short-term income. It\u2019s possible, of course. But, it\u2019s not easy.When does the income show up? One of the problems involved in self-publishing is that many nonfiction authors are creating ebooks that sell for ninety-nine cents on Amazon, or are given away for free! If you don\u2019t want to master the power of ebook pricing, and work with a trade publisher, you might encounter more delays and issues than anticipated. After you\u2019ve negotiated a reasonable advance, you must remember that you won\u2019t receive additional funds until your book has earned-out the cost of your advance. If that\u2019s not a problem, you might be disappointed by the fact that copies of your book on display are on consignment from the publishers, and the book stores charge extra for prominent display\u2026.which, of course, comes out of your royalties. Book store returns also are deducted from your earnings.Writing is not the only work expected of authors. Whether you decide to self-publish, or work with a trade publisher, writing is just one of the tasks expected of authors. Other tasks involve strategically planning your book to appeal to an existing market, differentiating your book from competing books, and identifying who has purchased your book, so you may stay in touch with them. You have to know who your ideal readers are, what their problems are, and what types of entertainment, or\u2014in the case of nonfiction books\u2014what types of information they\u2019re searching for.You have to decide between self-publishing and trade publishing. You have to quickly learn about the pros and cons of each alternative. Both can earn comfortable primary or secondary income streams. But, you have to know the questions to ask, the research you need to undertake, in order to decide what\u2019s best for you.You have to be willing to learn. There are numerous tasks, besides writing, that you have to master. Webside design and copywriting, blogging, lead generation, book cover design, time management, and self-editing are all tasks that may not be overly difficult, but all detract from your writing time. And, they all have to be done months before your book begins to earn money. And, even if your first book enjoys very healthy sales, you have to pretty-much begin writing your second book as soon as possible.You really have to be marketing-driven entrepreneur! For many, that\u2019s the hardest lesson of all. No matter how fast you write, or how quickly your respond to questions on #Tweetchats, success requires more than good ideas and fast typing. At every point, you have to be a strategic marketer, able to balance multiple tasks while making endless decisions and providing relevant, helpful entertainment and/or advice to your readers. This is not said to discourage your desire to write a book! Writing remains one of the best tools to advance your income and your personal brand in the field of your choice. Plus, it can open doors of opportunity on both a personal and professional level. But, your financial rewards will probably originate from your ability to use your book as a marketing tool. Your book is an excellent way to bring you to the attention of potential clients, event managers, and proof of credibility. But, the bulk of your income will likely originate from from sale of your branded information products and training videos, rather than from sales of your book. Hard-earned knowledge I quickly learned this from my first book, Looking Good in Print: A Guide to Basic Design for Desktop Publishing. It was a highly successful book throughout the country and in over thirty countries. From the start, I was earning more in one day conducting an all-day workshop, than I was earning from monthly royalties from my book! Granted, if I hadn\u2019t written the book, I wouldn\u2019t have been invited to speak. Yet, it\u2019s important to maintain a realistic perspective. Cautionary tale. My first publisher shared a great story with me: Two publishers are talking after a long day. Publisher A asks: \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to make a million dollars publishing?\u201dPublisher B admits he doesn\u2019t know the answer.Publisher A responds: \u201cStart with three million dollars!\u201dAgain, this is only to there is a lack of predictability in publishing. And the best way you can protect yourself as an author is to identify how you are going to use your book as a marketing tool, building your profits by serving your \u201cideal clients.\u201d ",
