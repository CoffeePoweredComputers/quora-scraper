            "answer_text": "You mean college application essays? Here are some to avoid: How much you learned from going on a mission / volunteer trip to a less wealthy countryAnything written in the style of a short story or any other creative writingAny non-narrative, like creating a full page advertisementAnything composed in the \u201cpreacher style\u201d: I am going to talk about x, y, and z; paragraph about x; paragraph about y; paragraph about z; I just talked about x, y, and z.What you learned from someone else going through cancer (or any other disease)The person you most admireWhat you learned from athleticsAnything that looks like it could be sent to any college you might care to apply toA \u201cshopping bag\u201d essay which is simply a container for all your accomplishments to fit intoA humbling experienceLet me tell you about my faith\u2026How I overcame this one problem this one timeYour struggle to adapt (as a migrant / newbie / stranger / etc.)Boyfriend / girlfriend storiesIf you want to write a useful essay, ask yourself why you want to go to this college or university. If the answer is \u201cbecause I think I can get in\u201d, do some more research and figure out what you want to do. What programs interest you? Are there profs doing research you\u2019d like to do someday? Some better topics to try: How did you discover your passion and where do you want to take it?What is your relationship with the university or how did you find out about it, and what do you expect to gain from it and how do you expect to contribute?A high school course or summer / part-time job that totally changed your mind about what you want to do with your life, and how that led you to apply to this schoolA moment when you felt you suddenly \u201cgrew up\u201d, in a way, and how that led you to pursue the course of study you\u2019re interested inDo you see the common threads? When I\u2019m reading that essay, I want to see more than I can see in your transcripts and other documentation. I want to know why you want to be here, what you want to do here, and where you want it to take you. I want to feel that you are being you on the page, that you are sincere and not just blowing smoke because you think it\u2019s what I want to hear. I want to come away thinking, this person will fit in great here, will thrive here, and will go on to become a lifelong supporter of the university. (But don\u2019t try to insert that last bit into the essay \u2014 let me make that call.) It\u2019s great that you used to help your dad rebuild old cars before he died unexpectedly and that memories of those experiences taught you to think creatively and to persevere and treasure every moment. But it doesn\u2019t make you a good fit for this university. I\u2019d rather read how you came to understand that your father was showing you the joys of engineering, and after he was gone, you realized that you could turn that passion into a lifelong pursuit, and our mechanical engineering program headed by Dr. Jones is the best in the region for the type of ME that really excites you, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re applying. Keep it honest, make it real, proofread it and have a couple other people proof it as well, and show that you understand why you\u2019re writing it \u2014 to tell me why you want to be here and why you should be here. That\u2019s what makes a good application essay. ",

            "answer_text": "As I wrote in 5 Well-Known College Essay Tips That Are Actually TERRIBLE Advice: There are no bad essay topics. There are only bad essays. Just because some people can\u2019t write an interesting essay about the most meaningful experience they\u2019ve ever had in their life, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t. Anyone who tells you not to write about your summer abroad experience \u2014 run away! This is not a good writer. This is not someone you should be taking writing advice from. Anyone who tells you not to write about community service \u2014 they don\u2019t care enough to ask questions that will make the essay compelling, so they obviously can\u2019t help you make it better. Anyone who says not to write about sports\u2026 clearly never played a sport. There are all kinds of meaningful lessons and experiences you can only have through sports. There are no bad essay topics. Only bad essays. ",
