And even within those, audiences will have vastly different expectations and taboo subjects. Of course, part of comedy may be knowing when one should put a toe over the line, when to rush so far past it you don't even see it, and when to stay clear. A comedian who cannot \u201cread the room\", literally or metaphorically, will not be a comedian you've ever heard of. ",

You can joke about whatever the fuck you like. And some people won't like it and they will tell you they don't like it. And then it's up to you whether you give a fuck or not. And so on. It's a good system.\u201d ",
