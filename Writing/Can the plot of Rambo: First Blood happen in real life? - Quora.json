            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Meaning that yes, of course a sheriff might harass a vet for no reason, and that vet could create a lot of problems while using his training while trying to flee the police. But\u2026  My personal no, is the way Rambo wounds many police officers without killing any. In the real world, making prisoners is FAR more difficult than simply killing them. Also, you can continue the killing until they locate you, and no more. Because once you are located, the game is simply over. That said, if you watch the movie carefully, you find out that Rambo is trying to avoid the enemy by hiding (which is correct) but he is then located multiple times such as: over the cliff, at the bottom of the cliff, in the forest (when the old man set his dogs free), at the mine\u2019s entrance (where he is basically screwed up, which is correct) and again, inside the city, where his is screwed up for the second time. In the real world no SEAL, DELTA FORCE operator nor SAS soldier would have survived none of those encounters with some larger, well armed and searching-for-your-ass forces once the enemy have successfully located you. No way. Don\u2019t let what hollywood says about special forces let you think otherwise. Despite these very small issues about \u2018realism\u2019, I consider FIRST BLOOD extremely real. Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s absolutely much more real than ANY other action flick coming up to my mind.Which is the reason I spent so many years of my life working on the character.  ",
