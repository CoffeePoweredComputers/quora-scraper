            "answer_text": "Why don\u2019t parents respect teenagers\u2019 privacy? I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t know. I do have a few theories, but we\u2019ll never truly know why parents enjoy invading their children's space and making them feel violated. Actually that\u2019s kind of immature of me. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t enjoy it, unless they\u2019re sadistic, but it still ain\u2019t cool, am I right? Times have changed, and this is something most parents nowadays don\u2019t seem to understand or want to accept. With the arrival of mobile phones, advanced technology and whatnot, people have changed. I suppose it\u2019s your decision if it was for better or for worse. Good or bad, parents need to start giving their children more privacy. And yes, I understand the whole, \u201cYou earn it, it\u2019s not given to you\u201d aspect of all that. I\u2019m not a brat, and can respect that. But parents invading their kids space unwarranted, simply because they feel like they can, is not okay. I\u2019m still a teenager myself, and let me tell you, my parents have put me through hell because of my phone and things related to that. I don\u2019t know how it was when my parents were kids, but it seems to me that everyone knew each other, people called friends on the house phones, everyone was always outside..you get the point. Things are very different now. Neighborhoods aren\u2019t as closely knit, friends are contacted via SnapChat or iMessage, and days are spent inside more than outside. Even more importantly, due to the internet (and this is more of a con then a pro, and this especially applies to me and my friends) kids are losing their innocence much sooner. That includes virginity too. No, I have not yet had sex (I actually want to wait), but I know a great deal about drugs, alcohol, sex, sexual toys, and interactions from the internet, my friends, and personal experience. Not to brag, but I feel like I\u2019m going to be a pretty decent parent if I ever am one, not because I have the most amazing and chill parents ever, but because I know what NOT to do when it comes to raising children. I have experience with what\u2019s annoying and the things I hate, and I\u2019ll apply that to how I raise mine. I won\u2019t take away their phone every five seconds for talking to their friends or just to show them that \u201cI\u2019m in charge.\u201d (My parents do this so much, seriously just to demonstrate that they\u2019re in charge). And no, I\u2019m not going to let them have sex at age 12, you\u2019re not mentally prepared for that type of relationship then, but I won\u2019t flip if I heard they tried weed at a party when they\u2019re 16. Some may disagree, but most relationships between parent-kid are screwed up because parents are too strict and remember how they were raised, and expect their children to be \u201cjust like them\u201d; completely accepting of the many rules that they had laid down as kids, getting good grades, etc. Now that we\u2019re in the 21st Century, some of those expectations still apply, but not all. It\u2019s especially annoying when my mom compares me to her. My mother is extremely intelligent and gifted in reading, writing and now mathematics. I am gifted in the art region, but still am smarter than average in reading and writing. She always says she\u2019s so disappointed in me whenever my grades are low (low to her are C\u2019s, when most of my grades are A\u2019s and B\u2019s), or that I\u2019m not \u201clike her\u201d at all. She\u2019s referring to her absolute angel of an attitude when it comes to anything, how she was always sooo respectful and obedient. It makes me so mad sometimes, and it honestly hurts my self-esteem when she says I\u2019ll never amount to much if I\u2019m not as successful as her. No one\u2019s perfect, but she certainly acts like she is sometimes. So to recap: Parents don\u2019t respect their teenagers privacy either because they truly aren\u2019t trustworthy enough for it, or because they have a hard time accepting that times have changed and kids need their space in order to grow and thrive. The human brain needs to make mistakes and hit walls in order to expand it\u2019s knowledge, not just in school but in the real world. If teens spend their whole childhood sheltered and then are suddenly released into the world, when will they make their mistakes and experiment? We need to be able to grow now, before we turn 18. And, if you want to have a relationship with your kid, for the love of God, just give them their space. I promise, if you let them be, they\u2019ll be more willing to come to you when a problem in their personal life arises. If you want to be their go-to, someone they trust, their best friend, and you want to show them you care, leave them alone and let them come on their own time. Thank you and goodnight. ",

            "answer_text": "Teen agers only deserve the privacy they have earned. Teens run the homes and that\u2019s not the way it should be. Teens are the offspring of those who have had cortus and produced them. Teens don\u2019t need privacy because they will do things which are unnatural, sexual, or other perverted things. Why don\u2019t parents respect teenagers\u2019 privacy? Because teens can\u2019t handle it. They will tell you what ever you need to hear, then without thinking about it, they have gone against their word to you. Many times, I really don\u2019t feel the teens understand the importance of their actions and the learning curve all humans must tolerate. They are no different. Yes, I believe the teen should be able to close the door. Lock it? I don\u2019t think so especially if someone of the other gender is present. Yes, there is nothing wrong with knocking before entering. It is the parents\u2019 home and they have the right to look in every drawer in their homes, behind every door, and out each and every window. Many a teen has gotten pregnant because mom and dad gave so much privacy they didn\u2019t know what was happening right in front of their faces! Parents only give the privacy to a teen who has shown responsibility and the ability to do as they are asked, ordered, told to do. ",
