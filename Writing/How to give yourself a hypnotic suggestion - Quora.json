If you have a particular issue you want to deal with, think of several suggestions that will help. Put yourself in a mild trance and repeat the suggestions a few times. Deepen the trance and repeat. Don\u2019t try to go very deep before giving yourself the suggestions or you might go to sleep before you start. ",
