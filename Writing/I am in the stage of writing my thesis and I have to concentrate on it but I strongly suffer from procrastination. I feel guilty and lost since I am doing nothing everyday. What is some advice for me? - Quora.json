            "answer_text": "THE CURE FOR THESIS WRITER\u2019S PROCRASTINATION This question was asked five years ago and I wonder if that thesis ever got written. To put off until tomorrow what you ought to have been done yesterday is a behavior rooted essentially in fear, usually fear of failure, sometimes of death, or worst, humiliation. Because the subject is writing and as a writer I know the feeling, I\u2019ll offer some experienced advice. First, honestly examine what you are most afraid of as related to your thesis or to your personal promises and reputation. Most of the time, procrastination of writing projects is to avoid humiliation, the morbid fear of being seen as you truly are rather than as you wish to be seen. You may be humiliated to be seen by others as full of shivering trepidation in the face of having to assert and prove your command over a subject and situation. To earn your doctorate you are going to have to assert supreme command at least once: in your trial-by-fire thesis. If fear of humiliation by rejection plays into your life story, you are lucky since there is a cure for humiliation: humility. Are you, were you, humble enough to treat your thesis as a test of your ability to understand and tell a compelling story? If you still haven\u2019t written that thesis five years hence, why not immediately clear the decks for action, buckle yourself into your desk chair, face your screen or your note pad, and start transcribing your thoughts until you need a respite, nurture your body, and get back to your desk to work some more. Only innate laziness can stop you now, which is too bad because innate laziness is un-curable by any worthwhile means. ",
