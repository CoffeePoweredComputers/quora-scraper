            "answer_text": "Over 100 billion bulkmail messages are sent every day. You may know them as spam, junk mail, unsolicited email. Whatever you call them, they\u2019re annoying. At the least, they clutter your inbox and present the risk of you missing important emails from family, friends, and coworkers. At the worst, they put your computer at risk for viruses and make you susceptible to identity theft and costly or time-consuming processes to keep yourself and your contacts safe. There\u2019s no simple way to eradicate spam entirely, but there are a few things you can do to drastically reduce the amount of spam you receive. Catch-all: If you own your own mailserver domain, set up a catch-all email address to bounce phishing emails with an undeliverable error. SPF Records: Request your host set-up rules on the mailserver to block messages that don\u2019t have an SPF record. SPF records require mail be authenticated from the sender domain. Research: Find an email provider you can trust. Yahoo! has suffered an unprecedented number of data breaches recently. Apache Tomcat makes a business out of sharing user information. Try to find one that\u2019s known for having strict security and protecting user privacy. Filters: Find an email provider with strong spam filters. Gmail\u2019s built-in spam filtering is fairly aggressive. Hosts that incorporate blacklists (like Spamcop) dramatically reduce the number emails that slip through spam filters. Burners: For contests, polls/surveys, and single-use applications, give recipients a temporary email (or burner) instead of your real email address. Forwarders: For online services, retailers, and non-family members, give recipients an email forwarder instead of your real email address. Forwarders simply relay messages to your inbox. They\u2019re free, and can be blocked/deactivated if they start to receive spam. Safe-guarding: Never give your email address to people you don\u2019t entirely trust. Family members aside, even banks, mortgagers, credit card companies, and reputable retail outlets suffer breaches/hacks or offer user private data to third parties and marketing partners. Check their privacy policies, typically found in the footer of web sites, and keep in mind that they change frequently. In most cases, give these institutions a forwarder (see above) or opt for paper statements/receipts instead of email. Block: Never click \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d links in email. While there are a number of mass-mailing services that claim to have your best interest in mind, clicking the opt-out link notifies the sender that your email address actually exists and the inbox is being actively checked. In most cases, it\u2019s best if you simply block the sender. Report: While you\u2019re at it, never click links in emails, particularly suspicious ones (e.g., those where the subject starts with \u201cre:\u201d which you know you never wrote before, those with tracking numbers for orders or shipments which you know you didn\u2019t purchase). Hover over them and you\u2019ll see the link at the bottom of your browser or under the cursor in your mail client. If it doesn\u2019t start with \u201chttps://\u201d (note the \u201cs\u201d) and include a fully-qualified domain name (e.g., Send Money, Pay Online or Set Up a Merchant Account - PayPal, Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more, etc.), it\u2019s a spoofing email and should be reported to the website they\u2019re spoofing (e.g., spoof@ebay.com, stop-spoofing@amazon.com, etc.). You can easily find the addresses to forward spam to by searching. Disable: If possible, turn images/links off on all messages in your inbox until you verify that they\u2019re not spam. Images often use beacons, or tracking pixels, that are loaded from the spammer\u2019s server. Simply loading the image notifies the spammer that you\u2019ve viewed the email. These are often used for marketing mail analytics, but can obviously be used for more nefarious reasons too. Assemble: Join a club. There are a number of online spam prevention services that harvest the power of the group to drastically reduce (or even eradicate) the spam in member inboxes (e.g., Bulc Club). Conduct a search and choose the one that best suits your needs. Password: Change your password at least semi-annually, and make it something that\u2019s difficult for bots to guess. In most cases, a longer phrase of seemingly unrelated words is stronger than one word with added characters. For instance, use \u201c21 Spotted Lemurs 1978\u201d for a password instead of \u201cNicolas1\u201d. Separate: Consider setting up a second email account for non-personal usage (e.g., my-bulkmail-address@somemailprov...) that you\u2019ll check less frequently and don\u2019t mind the spam. This could be used for online purchases, receipts from digital POS systems, and mail that\u2019s not time-sensitive. Simply separating out your personal mail from this account prevents the spam from getting into your mail email\u2019s inbox, but will still require you to wade through spam on your secondary account. Because of this, it\u2019s much easier and less annoying if you just use mail forwarders (see above). These are a number of techniques you can use to reduce the spam in your inbox. Keep in mind, no one technique is flawless and oftentimes a combination of the above can severely cut down on the bulkmail you receive. Hope this helps! And keep fighting the good fight! ",

            "answer_text": "Spam messages are like a curse to the Email account. No matter what you do, what you try, Spam emails are like pests that somehow manage to get into your Email account. Although it is really a task to keep your email account free from spam emails, there are some workarounds that can help can help you minimize such unwanted emails significantly.  To know how to prevent your email account from getting flooded with Spam emails, follow the below-mentioned suggestions. Guide to Stop Getting Spam Emails 1.) Report Spam Today\u2019s email service comes loaded with a smart Spam filter tool that automatically filters out most of the suspicious emails and prevents them from making way to your Inbox folder. All such suspicious emails get stored in the spam folder of your email account. If you find any suspicious email lingering in your Inbox folder, you can mark it as a spam. The next time you receive spam emails from the same sender; your email service will automatically forward them to the Spam folder of your email account. 2.) Unsubscribe from The Service You Don\u2019t Use Anymore Most of the spam messages you receive in your email account are from the newsletter, applications, websites, deals, offers etc. you have subscribed to. If there are some services that you don\u2019t use anymore at present, you can simply unsubscribe from them to stop receiving emails in your email account. 3.) Use an Alternative Email Address Sometimes when you order a product or subscribe to a mailing list, you accidentally allow companies to send promotional emails to your email account. In such a case, it is best to use a separate email address for all your shopping and subscription requirements. This way you can easily keep your primary email account clear from unwanted emails. Some email services also provide the option to create aliases. So, you can use such aliases instead of your actual email address when you need to sign up anywhere online. 4.) Create Filters to Block Spam Emails Most of the email services are known for providing an option to create a filter in your email account. Simply, configure a filter and create a rule in it to prevent unwanted emails from getting into your inbox folder. You can easily create multiple filters and configure them to move spam messages to either Trash folder or Spam folder in your email account. 5.) Use Third-Party Extensions Another way to prevent Spam emails from getting into your email account is by adding a third-party extension app. This type of applications helps in catching messages as they move between an email server (where your emails are stored) and email client (where your emails get displayed). You can choose from different third-party applications such as Mailwasher, SpamSieve, SpamCop etc. Following these practices will surely help you minimize the frequency of spam messages in your email account effectively.

            "answer_text": "Learn how to report it. Spammers go away when they go out of business. Learn how to view the actual source code, both the body and the headers of your spam emails. There are good lessons online so I won't elaborate the how-to of that. When you can view the source code, you can see what servers sent the mail. You can see what servers host the pictures. Most importantly, the followup, in order to make money you have to contact them so find that reply address, or web page, or what in the source. When you have the source server, the web hosts, and such, use sites like network-tools.com to find the abuse address for those names and IP addresses. If the spammers claim to represent honest companies (like Microsoft, or a grocery chain) get their abuse addresses too. Copy all the source code, headers and body, into a new email address. Address the email to all the abuse addresses you found. Explain to each abuse contact how they are connected to the spam. Demand they shut down the spammer from using their service. Honest internet providers will disconnect the spammers from abuse complaints. The big names that the spammers fake have big time lawyers and don't like being used in fraud. Some of the internet providers will drag their feet. Some will end up being controlled by the spammers themselves. Doesn't matter - the spammers will see that you're a threat to their continued ability to get services from the honest providers. Eventually they'll give up, some of them will remove you from their lists as a threat; which they do not do from \u201cunsubscribe\u201d requests. I only report spam that ends up in my actual inbox after several layers of filters but I've managed to keep spam at a very reasonable level for years. I also jealously guard any email address I actively read, and only use disposable addresses for any site that requires useless registration. The combo of prevention, filtering, and raising hell serves me well. ",

            "answer_text": "I sue (or threaten to sue) the sender. I\u2019ve successfully forced multiple senders of unwanted email solicitations to take me off of their mailing list with the threat of litigation, and actually went through with it once, getting a payday of over $2,100 CAD (~$1,700 USD). Here\u2019s how I did it, copied from another answer of mine (Maxwell Arnold's answer to What is the most ridiculous way you have seen someone make a lot of money?)\u2026 I used to belong to the Ontario Real Estate Association as a licensed real estate agent. However, my membership ceased (naturally) when I didn\u2019t renew my license because I was moving onto other things in my life.Since I was not part of the association any longer, I shouldn\u2019t be receiving any more newsletters/emails/communications, right?I sure thought so. But yet somehow, they kept on sending me emails for some reason. No problem. I\u2019ll just click on \u201cunsubscribe\u201d. That\u2019s supposed to work, right?But somehow\u2026 the emails kept on coming! That\u2019s not right. So I sent cease and desist notices - and in the last one, told them that they would be billed $160.00 per email sent in the past and in the future, if more emails were to be sent to me, against my clear instructions to stop sending them, in violation of provincial and federal privacy laws.No response to that - and inevitably, another email came through, this one was the eleventh email. Invoice issued for $1,760.00 for \u201cTime, inconvenience and resources consumed to process unsolicited email messages, after specific requests to unsubscribe\u201d. Due in 30 days, 2% per month interest on overdue balances. No response.Then, another email got sent. Looks like someone\u2019s not paying attention. Another $160.00 billed. They now owed me $1,920.00.The 30 day period elapsed, so it was time for a formal demand letter sent by registered mail. They now owed me $1,958.40 with interest.Now, suddenly, their lawyers actually were interested in talking, trying to stifle my claim and make me sign a confidentiality agreement, and a waiver of claim against their conduct, in exchange for a $200.00 lump sum settlement. I had no interest in accepting less or keeping quiet, so I told them to pay me as they were instructed to, or I\u2019ll sue them.No response. Off to court we go. Claim filed, and now their legal counsel got really interested. They tried to offer me the full amount with a confidentiality agreement, and I told them I would sign no such agreement, full-stop. They now had two choices\u2026 pay, or file their response (which couldn\u2019t really consist of anything, as they were clearly in the wrong).With additional interest accrued, they cut me a cheque for $2,037.52, plus my costs (filing fee, process server, etc.).I then pitched it to the local branch of a Canadian national TV news station, they loved it, and featured it on national TV. A link to the video is here: Consumer Alert: Costly unwanted emailsThe rest of the time, I\u2019ll just click on \u201cunsubscribe\u201d. It usually works\u2026 but with some exceptions, as you can see. Don\u2019t bother trying to tell me this is overkill. I respect my time, and I expect others to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: You can't. But there are things you can do to keep it from getting too annoying. First you need to determine whether something is really spam or not. For instance, you may have purchased something at a a store (online or otherwise) and they asked for your email address. A few weeks later, you start getting email from them, even though you don't remember signing up for their mailing list. In these cases, there was probably something on the page that said by entering your email you are automatically signing up to receive their mailings. In these cases, the best thing to do is to click the unsubscribe link, usually at the bottom of the mailing. This will take care of the problem in most cases. If a mailing doesn't have an unsubscribe link and it's obviously a sales promotion, you should treat it as spam and click the Spam button (sometimes referred to a junk button). If you identify mailings from a specific source as spam more than once, after a while, the mailings from that source will go directly to the spam folder. When you identify something as spam, you are doing two things. First, you are giving the mailbox provider information about what you think is spam, and second, you are contributing to the overall database of what is considered spam by most people. If a certain company, even a legitimate company\u2014has a tendency to send emails that most people automatically think is spam even if it isn't in the strictest sense of the word, then they are going to start having trouble getting into the inbox. Some mailbox providers are better than others when it comes to identifying spam. I agree with Andrew that Gmail has the best spam filters. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few things you can be aware of to ensure you're less susceptible to spam (unfortunately, you'll never rid yourself of it completely)... These are taken from an article I published recently titled \"Still Getting Spam? 4 Email Mistakes to Avoid Today\"... You\u2019re Clicking UnsubscribeYour first instinct is to click the little unsubscribe button that\u2019s hidden at the bottom of your email subscriptions and most spam messages. All it does now is inform the pesky spammer that they\u2019ve found an email address that\u2019s in use. Delighted at his success, the spammer lets the rest of his spammer entourage know about you. Do This Instead: Hit delete or if it\u2019s definitely spam, flag it as such (Report Spam in Gmail, Spam in Yahoo), so your email client knows to filter future emails from that address. You Replied to The SpammerWhen you reply to a spammer asking them to give you a break, you\u2019re doing two things that could slide your inbox into email hell. First \u2013 you\u2019re whitelisting the spammer\u2019s email. With that reply, your email provider thinks you know the sender and will have no future problem with new emails. Second \u2013 you just informed the spammer\u2019s system of an email address that\u2019s being used. Automatically, your spam levels will rise. Your Friends are CCing You Into MessagesWhen friends or colleagues CC you into messages, every other recipient in the group can see your address. If any of their email accounts are hacked, your email address will be found and harvested, making you more susceptible to spam. You Didn\u2019t Read The Small PrintDisreputable sites (or dishonest employees of those sites) that you sign up to can illegally sell your email address to other companies and spammers. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much you can do about this, other than only sign up to sites that you trust. ",

            "answer_text": "Good Morning! 1 Stop signing up or going into crap websites that have more than 20/30 cookies. that is why your spam filter is unable to stop them. 2 By law they must have an unsubscribe message at bottom of email. Most of them do not work, some will work. Still a waste of time to do so\u2026 more since with this question\u2026 I know you are getting a load crap of spam emails in your inbox. Still recommend flagging them as spam instead of block. I believe you have the wrong understanding between block and spam. 3 Since not specified what email provider you use, open up a G email, now with Chrome, marking them as spam will not only stop them but also unsubscribe automatically. If you would like more privacy than G Chrome I recommend Protonmail. 4 Once again spam emails that go into inbox is due to the \u201ccrap\u201d websites you visit with most likely over 100 cookies each. If you sign up for any other platform almost in all of them you are signing into their 3rd parties as well. Either stop going into them or do so in incognito mode. The Internet will still monitor what you do but the site will have no access to put cookies into your PC. Have a great day! ",

            "answer_text": "10 tips on how one can protect his email address to minimise the risk of getting spammed.  Spammers in most cases need to know your email address before they can spam you sokeep your email address to yourself as much as possible and use it only for work purposes.When posting on a forum do not include your email address as part of your signature.Guest books are a prime source for the harvesting of email addresses that spammers use. Some guest books automatically hyperlink your email to your username; avoid posting in such forums andnever include your email address in the post itself. Do not use your work email for this kind of personal use. If you do not have an alternative email address consider using free services such as Google mail, Yahoo! mail or Hotmail.When signing up for forums, offers and other public services never use your work email address; if it doesn\u2019t break the terms of use, consider using disposable email addresses. If terms prohibit the use of disposable email, use free email services that include spam filtering.Never click on links in a spam email; in some cases clicking will result in you confirming to the spammer that the email address is valid and the user is likely to click on links thus making you a prime target for more spam and phishing attacks.Always review the privacy terms on sites before registering. You need to know that whoever you\u2019re signing up with will not give away your email address to third parties who might actually end up selling your email address for money.If you use IRC and chatrooms ensure that you\u2019re not displaying your email address publicly (some IRC clients do this by default).If you have a personal website, do not publish your work or personal email on it. Spammers use scanners that harvest such emails as well. Use free email services for this purpose.Do not use the unsubscribe links in spam emails, in some case that will actually confirm the email address is valid to the spammer.Do not open attachments in spam, you could get infected with Trojans that will send your email contacts to a spammer as well as entrap you in a spammer distribution chain i.e. your computer might be the one that the spammer uses to send spam emails.",

            "answer_text": "1. Train your filter When you find spam in your inbox, don\u2019t just delete it. Select it, and tell your mail client that this particular message is spam. How you do this depends on your client. For instance, if you\u2019re using Gmail\u2019s website, click the Report spam button in the toolbar (the icon looks like an exclamation point inside a stop sign).  You also need to train the client about your false positives. Once a day, go through your spam folder looking for messages that don\u2019t belong there. When you find one, select it and tell the client that it made a mistake. In Gmail, you click the Not spam button. [ Further reading: The best antivirus for Windows PCs ]  If your mail client is halfway decent, it will learn from these mistakes\u2026but only if you train it. 2. Never respond to spam If you recognize something as spam before you open it, don\u2019t open it. If you open it and then realize it\u2019s spam, close it. Do not click a link or a button, or download a file, from a message that you even remotely suspect is spam. If you opened a spam because it appeared to be coming from a friend or co-worker, contact them immediately and let them know that their account has been compromised. 3. Hide your email address The more people who have your email address, the more spam you\u2019re going to get. So keep your address close to your chest. Don\u2019t publish it on the web unless you absolutely have to. (I have to, and it\u2019s not fun.) And if you have to, use a different address for that purpose.  Use disposable email addresses when you\u2019re not comfortable sharing your real one. I use Blur, a free Chrome and Firefox extension, for that purpose. Other options include spamex and mailshell. 4. Use a third-party anti-spam filter Most of the major security suites come with an anti-spam filter that can augment the one on your client\u2014but only if that client is local. In other words, they can work with Office\u2019s Outlook program, but not with Outlook \u2013 free personal email and calendar from Microsoft. Back in April, AV-Comparatives published an Anti-Spam Test report to see how well these tools worked. ESET Smart Security 9 got the highest score for catching spam and integrating with Outlook. 5. Change your email address This is a very drastic option, but if you\u2019ve responded to spam in the past or haven\u2019t hidden your address, and are therefore overloaded with spam, it may be your best option. Of course you\u2019ll have to inform your legitimate contacts about the change, and you\u2019ll probably have to keep both addresses for a few months. But once you can get rid of the old address, your spam count should plummet. You may want to read my article on changing your address.

            "answer_text": "Unless it's a reputable sender, like a newsletter sent via Mailchimp, don't click on unsubscribe. All that does is confirm that the email the spammer randomly sent to is a valid email address. The more spammy it sounds, the more likely the spammer us fishing for addresses to sell to more spammers. I have several email accounts, and I have noticed that my Gmail account seems to be the cleanest. Google has aggressive spam filtering. For the stuff that gets past Google, I have filters set up for sonethings I don't want to see. Those are set up in Gmail. I use Mailwasher in concert with the Thunderbird email client. Mailwasher downloads the header of emails and learns which emails are spam by your marking them as such. I get over 200 emails per day and Mailwasher already knows that 85% are spam or things that don't interest me, like newsletters that I get when I have purchased something in the past. Thunderbird is great because I can add even more filters. For example, I have a filter for receipts so when I get a receipt from Uber, it automatically gets moved into my receipt folder. Free online network tools - can help you get DNS information If you want to get proactive about a particularly bad spammer, like someone who is trying to defraud, you can take a look at the headers and try to find the real original ip address. Take that ip address and run a DNS scan to find their Network Whois information. From there, you can complain to their abuse department, local and federal law enforcement. What I'm doing isn't perfect, but it works well for me. Good luck. ",

(Many unethical sites share private data for the money.)Never provide your address to anyone. (Then why have an email account?)Avoid interactions with shady people who may wish to harm you. (Don\u2019t be so naive as to presume political rivals won\u2019t stoop to signing you up for unlimited harassing emails and/or phone calls. Stupid criminal types do really stupid, nasty things to others. Also be careful to avoid blaming anyone without clear proof.)A near-final few words to the wise: it\u2019s your responsibility to protect what\u2019s yours. Expecting others to behave themselves is a losing strategy in 2018 on Earth! Make responsible choices and don\u2019t even leave dozens of printouts with your email in the trash bin. People cull and sell current emails from trash, too. Learn how to report abuse and to use unsubscription methods. Don\u2019t hesitate to report abuse, but do so with reasonable decorum. Webmasters, network admin folks, and business managers by and large aren\u2019t the culprits, so don\u2019t abuse or disrespect them, either. Rather, try to persuade them to help you stop spam. (I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a few bad apples in such jobs have created endless havoc, however.) Finally, the BEST way is to fully implement IPv6 network addressing (globally). That will stop it in short order, as the bad guys can no longer hide behind WWW anonymity with full impunity. ",

            "answer_text": " You are probably used to being bombarded with junk emails offering fake pharmaceutical products, dodgy loans and various adult services. But you can stop these junk emails \u2013 or \u2018spam\u2019 \u2013 by taking a few simple precautions and by using a spam filter. Andrew Stucken | 9th September 2010 An estimated 90% of all emails sent are spam and deleting them is a big time-waster. Spammers are, unfortunately, getting ever more sophisticated and producing very plausible-looking messages which can fool even the wary. It looks like you don't have Flash enabled on your computer. To view all the videos, tools and games on this website you will need to install the Flash player. Spammers use databases holding vast numbers of email addresses. You could get spammed because you: Post to a newsgroupSign up for an internet service that asks for an email addressGive out your email address on your own websiteGive your address to an online retailerWhy \u2018spam\u2019? The term derives from a Monty Python sketch where a couple in a restaurant try to order something other than spam, the once-popular meat product. A group of Vikings in the background start singing the praises of spam and soon the only word you can hear in the sketch is \u2018spam\u2019. The idea is that the same thing would happen to the internet \u2013 it would be totally overwhelmed by large-scale unsolicited emails. How to stop spam emails The best anti-spam measure is to be a bit savvy about the way you use your email account! Try to avoid opening spam emails and clicking on links in spam messages.Don\u2019t buy anything from a spammer. Not only do you risk comprising your security and infecting your computer with malware - viruses and so on - you also reward and encourage the spammers.Don\u2019t be tempted to reply. The mailbox is probably unread.Don\u2019t threaten the spammer. Some mails will be seen and spammers have rights too. Threatening messages could expose you to legal action.Avoid \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 options. Cynically, spammers often include an \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link. Far from removing the menace, clicking it will confirm that your address is active and probably attract even more spam.Use a disposable email address. You could use this account especially for buying online or writing to newsgroups. If you find that you are getting a lot of spam at this address, you can simply delete it and set up another.Be wary about giving out your main email address. If in doubt, it is a good idea to use a disposable address (see above).Never reveal your email address on your website. If you have a website, putting your email address on it will be easy fodder for a \u2018spambot\u2019 that is harvesting addresses. You could use a web contact form instead.Munging. A simple but effective technique where you present your address in a way that people can easily work out but which will fool spambots. They will look for a pattern, such as a@. Writing the address as \u2018a at b dot com\u2019 would probably evade them.Spam filters Many of the remaining messages can be blocked using a spam filter. ISPs (internet service providers) are increasingly providing the service, as well as some email programs. Be aware that some filters operate a \u2018whitelisting\u2019 system \u2013 in other words, you have to actively mark an email address as \u2018not spam\u2019 or messages will go straight into a folder entitled \u2018Spam\u2019 or \u2018Junk\u2019. I have seen people overlook important emails because of this, although they could still retrieve them from the junk folder. Be sure to mark known email addresses as \u2018not spam\u2019 from the outset! Remember that if an account becomes overwhelmed with spam, despite all these measures, you can always delete it. ",

            "answer_text": "1] Block Email Addresses The most basic way to get rid of spam is to block email addresses. Notably, if someone is constantly pinging you with junk emails, tap those three dots on the top right corner of the email window and click on Block \u201csender\u2019s name\u201d from the available options. This method works best when a spammer is continuously disturbing or trying to scam you. 2] Use Filters Most email clients, including Gmail, Yahoo Mail, MS Outlook, and iCloud, offer the ability to create custom email filters. Using it, you can set specific parameters, including email sender, subject, and body keywords for an email to be categorized separately, away from your primary inbox. For instance, you can set rules to send newsletters that you\u2019ve subscribed to directly to a designated folder.  To create a filter in Gmail, enter the keyword, and tap the down arrow given besides the search bar. After that, click on Create Filter at the bottom of the dialog box and choose what you\u2019d like the filter to do. Once you\u2019re done setting parameters, finish by clicking the blue Create Filter button. Majorly of email services also have a built-in spam filter on offer that automatically detects potential spam from incoming messages. These emails are then sent to a Spam folder where you can delete, block or even report them as not spam. 3] Unsubscribe from Mailing Lists You might have subscribed to mailing lists in the past while accessing certain services on the web. And this is likely to be the main reason behind recurring promotional messages and newsletters. To unsubscribe from mailing lists, open an email from the sender and click on the Unsubscribe or Change preferences option. It\u2019ll then take you to the page where you can confirm your settings.  Generally, the sender doesn\u2019t want you to unsubscribe, and hence this option is given at the bottom of the email. Anyways, clients like Gmail and iCloud automatically detect if there\u2019s an unsubscribe button in the email and display them on the top. Anyways, make sure not to click the unsubscribe link in emails that look like a scam or are suspicious as you might end up landing on a malicious site. That said, you can also use third-party tools like Cleanfox and Unsubscribe from emails, instantly. that help unsubscribe newsletters in bulk using AI. 4] Report Spam as Spam! As noted, email clients have built-in automatic spam filters to separate potential spam. However, sometimes a spam message can land in your inbox without being filtered. In that case, try to report the mail as spam instead of just deleting it. This will improve the spam filter, and it\u2019ll work a lot better for the next time.  To report an email as spam on Gmail web, open the email and click on three dots given on the top right. Then click on the \u201cReport Spam\u201d button, and you\u2019re good to go. You can alternatively use the report spam button given on the header. Outlook users, on the other hand, can right-click the email and click on \u201cMark as junk\u201d while those using Mail for Mac can follow the same steps and tap on \u201cMove to Junk\u201d to mark the email as spam. 5] Use Temporary Email Addresses for one-time verification   At times, you might be required to signup using email for a one-time check. In such instances, if you cannot manage a secondary email account, we will suggest using the free temporary email services. There are a lot of temporary email clients available on the internet, such as Temp Mail, 10 Minute Mail, Nada, Guerrilla Mail, and more that provide you with an email address that expires after a set amount of time. During that period, you can use the provided email address to receive emails and interact online while avoiding spam. 6] Tips for further reducing spam Emails Don\u2019t Publish your Email Address Try to keep your primary address as secret as you can. This may also include email addresses that you\u2019ve used as credentials or given to your bank and other authorities. If you have a page or website, revealing email addresses publicly will make it easy to be harvested by spambots and thereby inviting tons of spam. Try using web contact forms instead. ",

            "answer_text": "This guy on Quora who doesn't even follow me... Sumantra Mukherjee decided to send me an unsolicted message.     Let's break down why this message is spam. A.  He doesn't address me by name. B.  He doesn't say anything about me at all. C.  He just talks about what he wants to.   D.  He uses bold typeface.  I can't read that.   E.  I don't want to stay tuned to something I know nothing about. I can go on.   However, I have come up with a response to solve all these issues.    Dear sir,  Did you know that your message is spam?  You need to stop spamming people with your unsolicited content.  You need to read this book The Etiquette of Social Media - Leonard Kim Is a troll condemning you?  Is a guy coming onto your looks?  Are they trying to make unwarranted advances?  Are you feeling pressure from people who are belittling you?   With a few slight modifications, this same message can be used to address these people. Etiquette is becoming lost.  Poor form is becoming an epidemic.  People feel that they can say whatever they want to others.  However, this can not continue.   These people need to be educated upon the consequences of their actions.   They need to be stopped.   If not, we will continue for decades dealing with people who are promoting their myopic viewpoints upon us.  In order to stop them, we need to eliminate the problem at the source.  We need to stop the people who are sending these messages.  We need to do this through education. What kind of education? The education of social media etiquette.   I have thousands of messages in my inbox.  I have only responded to about 100.  The rest, I ignore.   Why? Because poor form just pisses me off.  If you don't know how to say something the right way, then stay out of my inbox.  Or go educate yourself on the proper guidelines of etiquette before sending me another message. ",

            "answer_text": "I have answered this question dozens of times \u2026 it\u2019s not easy, and it\u2019s never fool-proof. One answer is explained here: I get regular spam from a server. I have contacted and reported it many times to the server owner, but there is no effect. How can I complain to the datacenter? How can I force them to stop spamming? Probably the best answer I\u2019ve shared is THIS : Do you want the truth? Select ALL -> Delete . . . of course you don\u2019t want to do that because some important email might be in there. The fastest and easiest won\u2019t come until you\u2019ve done a little home work, and spent a little time developing a system. 1) Get a REAL email client, with features and functionality. Get rid of Google, AOL, Yahoo, LinkedIN, or any of those other \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cthrow-away\u201d email services. That's where most of the junk comes from. 2) White list all the IMPORTANT email addresses you get mail from, and 3) Build a filter, or set of filters that moves THOSE important ones out of your IN box and into a folder at the TOP of your filter list \u2014 your \u201cA\u201d folder so to speak. As you obtain more \u201cimportant\u201d addresses, do the same with those. 4) Build a \u201cTrash\u201d filter. Into this filter put any \u201csender\u201d who seems to send more than one or two spams. Read the docs for your email client and learn how to make filters based on strings of letters, it that feature is available. Make this filter move the spam into a folder called spam. You will still have to look through it from time to time to get any mistaken emails out. (false positives) If your email client allows foreign characters, then filter for Chinese, Japanese, Russian Romanian, German and Brizillian \u2026 or \u201cany language except english\u201d . . right there, you\u2019ll get rid of a huge bunch of spam, right up front. Periodically you can DELETE ALL once you\u2019ve checked for false positives. Then you can trash them all \u2026 or if you are a SpamCop, report them. In no time your IN box will get less and less cluttered. You can go directly into your \u201cA\u201d filter to see the important stuff. Once you learn how easy it is to generate new filters and new folders, you can start your filing system to actually \u201csort\u201d your email for you. Put all the kids into the kids folder, but work into the work, travel, shopping, and so forth. It\u2019s easy and fun. I\u2019ve got probably 60 different mailboxes and a hundred filters. I put mailboxes inside of mailboxes so the list doesn\u2019t get to long requiring scrolling. I make a point to use the HORDE client \u2014 because it allows me to move, delete, or even export whole folders at a time. I have 20 years of email archived as searchable ascii text files on this computer, and it\u2019s only a couple of gigs. Many providers use HORDE. ABOVE ALL : stay on top of your email IN box. Never let it get so many emails that you have to scroll. Put the good ones away and delete the rest. Every quarter or 6 months or what ever dating you chose, move the contents into an archive folder within an archive folder named the date. Use year, month so they\u2019ll sort correctly : 1809 or 1809\u201316. Later you can scroll down the list and find the date easily. Once you get the hang of it, it will be fun and you\u2019ll be able to quickly lay your hands on that email you got last winter from an important person! Then you\u2019ll thank me! What\u2019s the fastest and easiest way to dejunk my email box? ",

            "answer_text": "How to Bypass Spam Filters for Better Email Deliverability Deliverability is a crucial email metric to consider as it tracks the number of email messages that make it to the subscriber\u2019s email inbox. As the rules for sending emails are getting more and more stringent, it is of paramount importance to stay in sync with the different laws and keep the spam filters away. Thanks to laws like the Canadian Anti-Spam Law (CASL) and the recently launched GDPR! Inbox providers such as Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo! Mail take help of spam filters so that random unsolicited (SPAM) messages do not flood the user\u2019s inbox. These spam filters work as defense to assess every email and make sure that only \u201cgood\u201d emails (You\u2019ll get a clear idea about what good emails are, as you read this article further) make their way to the inbox and spam emails are sent to the spam folder or entirely rejected. Here are some simple ways through which you can enhance your email deliverability by overcoming the spam filters. Never buy email lists It is \u2018legal\u2019 to buy email lists to send emails to people who have consented to receive promotional emails. However, these subscribers have not opted to hear from your brand and chances are that they don\u2019t even know you. Therefore, you should refrain from purchasing email lists or drawing out emails from different websites. Try to build email lists organically through gated content and email sign up forms. Once you build a sizeable email list, make sure you keep it healthy. Set up double opt-in to confirm that the subscribers want to hear from you. You should keep your list free from unsubscribed email addresses and try to send re-engagement emails to the inactive subscribers. If they still don\u2019t engage, you might as well remove them from your email list. A prominent unsubscribe link with your physical address is a must in the email footer. Remember, it is better to be unsubscribed, than to be marked as spam. Pro Tip: Take into consideration GDPR for your subscribers from EU. Avoid sending emails with attachments Many a times, marketers are tempted to attach an insightful resource to the emails they send to their list. This can activate the spam filters. Instead, it is recommended that you create a landing page for the same and include a relevant CTA button in the email for better campaign performance. Maintain the text to image ratio Too large and too many images work against your deliverability. You should maintain the text: image ratio at 80:20 to have best results. Here\u2019s an example of a pretty email by Travelocity that includes proper proportion of text and images.  Pro Tip: Owing to the dwindling attention span of the readers, your email should not take too long to load. Ask your subscribers to whitelist your email address When a subscriber adds your email address to his or her address book, you can be sure that your email would end up in the inbox and not the spam folder. This is known as whitelisting and it is an effective way to get rid of the spam filters watching over your emails. Give a look at how SHEFINDS asks the recipient to whitelist their email address towards the end of the email.  Include the View Online link in your emails The email clients that your subscribers use block the images and animations by default. As a result, if you want to ascertain that the purpose of the email is served, you should include the View Online link in the emails. By clicking on this link, the subscriber will be able to view the web version of the email in a way you would want it to be displayed. Check out the witty copy UncommonGoods uses to highlight the View Online link.  Alt-text should be included with the email images Add suitable Alt-text with the images you use in your emails, so that the recipients can understand what the image is about, even when the images are blocked in their email clients. It is simple to add the alt-text in the rich text editor of your email service provider by right-clicking the image or add it manually by using the code below:  Pro Tip: Have an HTML and plain text version for all your emails. Write concise and error-free email copy Grammatical errors and spelling mistakes trigger spam filters and increase the possibility of your email landing up in spam. Keeping this in mind, write concise and error-free email copy. Long emails act as a stimulus for the spam filters and of course, everyone likes to read shorter stuff these days. It\u2019s the time of micro-content. Don\u2019t forget to test the emails before hitting \u2018Send\u2019 Testing your emails is mandatory before hitting the \u2018Send\u2019 button. Here\u2019s a micro-checklist to make things easy for you. Sender name should be recognizable with a familiar email address.The subject line should not have too many exclamation points or words written in CAPS LOCK. You shouldn\u2019t shout at your subscribers.Proofread the email in detail.Images and text should be in the optimum proportion with proper alt-text.Follow the email footer best practices like unsubscribe link, as discussed earlier.Check for the loading speed.Make sure it renders well on every email client.The emails should be mobile responsive to warrant correct rendering regardless of the screen size.Assuming that your email marketing is aligned with all the points discussed above, last but not the least, you should monitor your email metrics. Watch out for sudden fall in the open rates or increase in bounce rates, as this could mean that your emails are not reaching the subscriber inbox. Final Thoughts The world of email marketing is progressing with leaps and bounds and therefore, it is always a good practice to follow the best practices\u2026 For your email marketing strategy to be successful, your emails should consistently reach the inbox. That\u2019s possible only if you can get the better of spam filters with proper infrastructure setup, list hygiene and strategically placed content and images. ",

They were needed to sign up for the service and confirm the registration on that service. After that, they either become the login name for that service, or are left to never be used again (by me). But the key thing is, I have no reason to ever log into that email account. That service can send email to me every day. I don\u2019t care. I won\u2019t ever see it as I don\u2019t log into those accounts. For my two accounts, they are used for my private email or certain services for which I do need to see the mail. On those accounts, I try to set up rules to sort incoming mail. If one of the companies sends too much mail, it gets its own rule and then I rely on the \u201cunread email\u201d count associated with the folder that those emails are being sent into. These two primary actions keeps my daily encounters with spam to a minimum. (If I ever need to log into one of those email accounts, which I do from time to time, like when I get bored, or need to do something and get validation email, I have a password manager that keeps track of them for me.)

These services devote far more resources to the problem than any individual customer ever could. They have the ability to spot spam trends across a much wider set of emails drawn from across their huge customer bases, and they are constantly refining their filters and other counter-measures based on their analysis of the big data that they collect. Google and Microsoft both offer anti-spam services as part of their cloud app offerings, but allow you to manage your own email servers if you prefer. There are other companies with cloud-based solutions that intercept your inbound email and filter it before delivering it to your servers, while some others (e.g., Barracuda and Sophos) offer appliance-based solutions that keep all the data within your network and connect to their cloud services for the filtering, and still others just put their software on your hardware and connect to their service in the cloud for the filtering data. Your ISP may have a deal with one or more of these services. ",

            "answer_text": "How to Avoid Spam Filters: Save Your Emails from Going to Spam Few things can put a dent in the success of your email campaign like spam filters. Although they save you from countless hours wading through junk mail over time, spam filters can only be so precise, and that means that many legitimate emails get mistakenly marked as spam and never reach their intended recipient\u2019s inbox. According to ReturnPath, over 20% of marketing emails never reach their intended target, instead ending up in the graveyard known as the spam folder. To put that another way: for every five emails you send, one will disappear into the Bermuda Triangle of emails. Spam filters pose a serious problem for businesses that rely on email as part of their marketing strategy \u2014 losing over 20% of your target audience isn\u2019t acceptable. Thankfully, spam filters sort through emails using specific criteria, so it\u2019s relatively easy to learn what the filters are checking for and make a concerted effort to rid your emails of any suspicious content. In this article, we\u2019re going to teach you how to avoid spam filters and craft emails that will make it to your recipient in one piece. But first, let\u2019s get a little more context, and learn a bit more about spam itself. Keep your friends close, but your junk mail closer, as they say. What is spam? Spam is one of those amorphous phenomena that few have a clear definition for, but everyone can immediately recognize \u2014 you\u2019ll know it when you see it, in other words. Unfortunately, the spam filter built into your email doesn\u2019t have that same intuitive sense of what constitutes spam that you do \u2014 if it did, legitimate businesses wouldn\u2019t be sending a fifth of their emails into the abyss. To better understand how email services filter out spam, we need a definition clear enough that even a computer can understand it. According to Google Dictionary, spam is \u201cirrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of recipients.\u201d Most of this definition is pretty self-explanatory, but the word \u201cirrelevant\u201d could probably use a bit of clarification. Overall, in the context of spam, \u201cirrelevant\u201d means either that the user didn\u2019t request any email correspondence with the sender, the messages have nothing to do with their interests, or both. For example, if you\u2019re allergic to peanuts and receive an email from a website called Peanut Planet saying that you\u2019re the lucky winner of ten truckloads of peanuts, then you\u2019ve just received spam. The fact that you\u2019re allergic to peanuts means that you (likely) didn\u2019t sign up and (hopefully) don\u2019t eat any, so this email is completely irrelevant to you. How do emails get flagged as spam? Now that we have a solid definition of what spam is, we can start to unpack that to figure out what email filters are looking for. In other words: how can a computer tell when something is irrelevant, inappropriate, and sent en masse to tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of addresses? Some parts are easier to catch than others. When it comes to inappropriate messages, for example, spam filters can simply scan emails for certain words or phrases that would be inappropriate for most general email correspondences. These could include swear words, sexual terms, or even phrases like \u201cyou\u2019ve won.\u201d That said, nothing is ever so simple. Spam filters account for many different factors and weight them to varying degrees. This way, they can ensure that the email alerting you that you\u2019ve actually won a Tesla in the sweepstakes you entered a few weeks ago doesn\u2019t end up in your spam folder hanging out with all the other free cruises you\u2019ve \u201cwon.\u201d Overall, spam filters check for a few different things: Personalization: Spam filters want to see personalized emails flowing into your inbox \u2014 this falls under the \u201cirrelevant\u201d part of the definition. If an email opens with \u201cDear entrant\u201d or something equally non-personalized, it\u2019s more likely to be marked as spam. Clean code: Messy code can look suspicious to spam filters. Make sure that all your code is clean and well written, with no unnecessary tags. Trusted IP addresses: While spam filters don\u2019t have a registry of all the trusted IP addresses out there, they do have a record of certain IP addresses they don\u2019t trust. If a filter catches someone sending spam, they\u2019ll mark down that IP and flag all their future emails as junk mail. Clear formatting and appropriate content: Spam emails are less likely to be clearly formatted and are often designed in a confusing way. If a filter sees an email coming through that looks like garbage, it\u2019s going to assume it\u2019s garbage. As mentioned above, certain types of content are also more likely to get your email flagged as spam. What are the risks of spam to your business? Spam can affect your business in two ways: as the sender and as the receiver. According to a survey conducted by Nucleus Research, spam costs companies $712 per employee each year. Its effect on the US economy is enormous: across all US businesses, spam costs $70 billion. That\u2019s nothing to shrug off. So why is spam so costly? According to the same survey, participants reported that they spent about 16 seconds on average deleting spam messages. That means that you only need to receive about 19 spam emails daily to reduce your productivity by 5 minutes each day. While that may not seem like much, that ends up coming to about 22 working hours spent just filtering through spam over the course of a year. Over a typical 43 year career, that\u2019s about 39 entire days spent just looking through spam. Receiving spam is a big problem for businesses. But what happens if you get caught sending spam, or if your emails are mistakenly flagged as junk? To start: sending spam is illegal. Under the US CAN-SPAM Act, businesses caught violating the law are subject to fines of up to $42,530 per email sent. That means that if you send spam to a mailing list of 1,000 different addresses, you can be fined up to $42.53 million. That\u2019s quite a bit more than many businesses can handle, so you could risk losing your business entirely. However, even if you\u2019re not sending anything that directly violates the FTC\u2019s regulations, you still need to be careful that your emails don\u2019t look like spam to the filters. A single email that gets mistaken for spam can get your IP address flagged, which means that all emails you send in the future could end up in your recipient\u2019s junk mail folder. If you\u2019re investing in email marketing, you definitely don\u2019t want to be spending money on emails that never make it to their target recipient. Even if you\u2019re not spending money, you\u2019re still spending time crafting emails, and drastically lowering the potential return on the time you\u2019ve spent. What are the current spam laws? Spam laws vary depending on the country and region from which the emails are being sent and received in. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most relevant laws for businesses sending English marketing materials: USA As we mentioned, the main spam law in the United States is the CAN-SPAM Act. The seven major tenets of this law are as follows: Header information must be accurate: All routing information must accurately detail who is sending the email. Deceptive subject lines are not allowed: Don\u2019t send an e-blast informing the receivers that they\u2019ve won a cruise unless you are actually prepared to send every single person on your list on an all-expenses-paid trip around the Carribean. Make it clear that your email is an ad: Recipients should be able to quickly differentiate advertisements from personal and business emails in their inbox. Include a physical address: All marketing emails must include a valid physical mailing address. Provide opt-out instructions: All emails must have clear instructions detailing how the recipient can opt out of your mailing list. Process opt-out requests promptly: You must remove a recipient from your mailing list within ten business days of their request. Additionally, all emails must have unsubscribe links that are available for at least 30 days after the email was sent. Keep a close eye on contractors: If you hire a marketing agency that ends up sending spam on your behalf, you\u2019ll still be held responsible. You can\u2019t shift the responsibility onto your contractors. Canada Canada\u2019s anti-spam legislation (CASL) was instituted on July 1, 2014. The law focuses almost entirely on consent, which is broken down into two types: implied consent and express consent. Implied consent means that you can reasonably expect that the recipient consents to receiving your emails due to an established prior relationship. Express consent means that the recipient has explicitly asked for emails to be sent to them, usually by signing up for a mailing list. The main points of CASL are as follows: Ensure that you have consent: Implied consent is valid for up to two years, but it\u2019s only valid for six months following an inquiry or application. Do not include misleading or false information: Once again, don\u2019t tell your recipients that you\u2019re the prince of a small country unless you really are and are actually about to give millions of dollars to everyone you send that email to. Include accurate contact information: Your email must include your name or business name, a valid physical mailing address, and either a phone number, email address, or website address. Include unsubscribe instructions and process requests quickly: Your emails must contain clear instructions that explain how recipients can unsubscribe from your emails. All unsubscribe requests must be processed and fulfilled within ten business days without charging a fee. European Union The EU has two laws that regulate email marketing: the E-Privacy Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation. The latter builds off the former. Here are the main points you need to know: Recipients are required to opt in: Explicit consent is required before sending a marketing email. Implicit consent is not sufficient. Include clear identification: You must identify yourself and provide contact information in every email. It must be easy to unsubscribe: Every email must have clear unsubscribe instructions. Data collection requires explicit consent: You cannot collect a user\u2019s data through implied consent. That means no pre-checked opt-in boxes when filling out a form or other similar tactics. You must state what the data you\u2019re collecting will be used for: You cannot add someone to your mailing list just because they entered their email to sign up for your free trial unless you explicitly stated that they would also receive marketing materials. How can you avoid your emails being marked as spam? Now for the juicy part of this article: what can your business do to avoid your emails disappearing into the void? Overall, the process isn\u2019t too complicated. You can never be 100% sure that your emails are making it through unscathed, but following these guidelines will help you get as close as possible. Here\u2019s how to avoid emails going to spam: Evaluate your data source: Did you buy the list you\u2019re sending to? Or did every person on the list manually opt in? If it\u2019s the former, you need to proceed with more caution, as you likely won\u2019t know precisely how all these addresses were procured. If it\u2019s the latter, you can be very confident that everyone on your list wants to be there, and you can tell your subscribers to unmark the email as spam in case it does end up in the junk pile by mistake. This will prevent your emails from being filtered out in the future. Address your subscribers by name: Don\u2019t send out an email where the first line or subject is \u201cHi subscriber.\u201d Make sure that every email is personalized to some extent and is personally addressed to every subscriber: i.e., \u201cHi Dan,\u201d not \u201cHi user.\u201d Include your physical address in the footer: Under US and Canadian law, all marketing emails must include a valid physical mailing address somewhere in the email. Adding your address and contact info to the bottom of your emails is the best and least intrusive way of doing this. Double opt-in your subscribers: Every time someone signs up for your mailing list, make them confirm their email. This means that after they\u2019ve entered their email address into your signup form, you should send them another email asking them to click a verification link to confirm their subscription. Process unsubscribe requests instantly: Even though the US and Canada allow for up to ten business days of processing time, it\u2019s best to immediately unsubscribe anyone who requests to be removed from your mailing list. If someone unsubscribes from your list and continues receiving your emails for ten days, they\u2019re more likely to mark your address as spam. Make it clear why the recipient is receiving your email: Don\u2019t make them guess. Clearly state that they are receiving your email because they signed up for your mailing list, ordered a product from you recently, filled out an application, etc. It\u2019s a good idea to add this right next to the unsubscribe link. For example: \u201cYou\u2019re receiving this email because you\u2019ve subscribed to the Peanut Planet newsletter. To change your preferences, click here. To unsubscribe, click here.\u201d Remove subscribers that haven\u2019t interacted with your emails in the past ten months: If a subscriber hasn\u2019t opened your emails or clicked any links in 10 months or more, remove them from your list. You\u2019re unlikely to convert them, and you run the risk of getting your emails marked as spam eventually. You may even want to consider removing subscribers that haven\u2019t opened your emails for as little as 30 to 60 days. Remove inactive emails from your list: Periodically comb through your list and remove any addresses that aren\u2019t active and are nearing abandonment. Sending to a large amount of abandoned or inactive addresses is a red flag for spam filters. Avoid spam traps: Spam traps are email addresses that look like they belong to a real person but don\u2019t. They are a tool that internet service providers use to help uncover IP/email addresses that are sending out spam. Since there isn\u2019t anyone behind the email, there\u2019s no way for these emails to opt in to your list. If you end up sending an email to one of these addresses, it indicates that you\u2019re not verifying the emails on your list and are sending to people that don\u2019t want your communications. Never send to an email that\u2019s been marked as spam: Never send an email to a suspicious address. If you already have, remove that address from your list and make sure you never send them anything again.

If you have hundreds an hour, there\u2019s usually some common characteristic, like they\u2019re all from the same address from your smart fishtank which is too hot. You can either fix the problem, or create a filter rule which stops accepting them, or deletes them. You don\u2019t want to have anything that actually replies, that just makes everything worse. One time I had thousands a day from all over the internet because some stupid Windows virus was finding my email on web pages. If you get mail with list management footers, unsubscribe. It won\u2019t make it any worse, but it might well fix it. It\u2019s illegal now not to have a working unsubscribe mechanism, in Canada and many other places. I believe the \u201creport junk mail\u201d button in Hotmail now does this automatically. As a list operator, it\u2019s extremely annoying if you sign up for a mailing list, forget that you did it, and start reporting it as spam when in fact it\u2019s something you actually asked for and I have a record of that somewhere. If all else fails, you can switch to a new email address. Over time, servers are hacked and user lists end up on the dark web or black market, no matter how careful you are at your end. Every spammer worth their salt has my email I\u2019ve been using since 1985. See e.g. Have I Been Pwned ",

There are two kinds of spam : those illegal, sent by \u201cout of law\u201d people;email marketers sending unsolicited advertisements. These are worse as these people will always tell you things like : \u201cthis is legal\u201d, \u201cmaybe you by mistake accepted to receive our messages\u201d, and other untruths of the kind\u2026For me, both kind of unsolicited messages are in the same category. Behind spam and advertisements sent by email marketers are a business of many billion dollars. So, no matter what you do, you\u2019ll continue to receive both kind of unwanted messages. To get still worse is that most commercial spam filter providers will tell you that advertisements aren\u2019t spam. They are wrong because in a good spam filter, no matter what the spam filter provider thinks, it\u2019s up to the email recipient to decide what he wants to receive in its inbox. One reason they say this is that illegal spams are easier to be detected than usual advertisements. The other reason is that it seems to me that there are some kind of hidden agreement between marketers and spam filter providers. ",

Once you open the email - the sender\u2019s system knows you\u2019re a \u2018real\u2019 person - ad you get more mail from them. Just moving stuff to your trash folder - and deleting without reading - stops their system knowing if they reached a real person or not.

Then I open up the rules for my email program and paste the section after the \u201cat\u201d sign (it won\u2019t allow me to use the symbol here) and make a new rule. Any email from that address is sent to a special folder, one that I never have to open\u2026 Then, I make up another rule. Every email that is in that folder gets forwarded back to that address even if the email wasn\u2019t originally from them. Then I make a third rule. Every email that is in that folder is automatically deleted every few days then scrubbed from my accounts (I have a total of 5 public emails addresses and 3 private ones.) Final rule I make is to automatically delete any daemon email messages caused by the bouncing. Rules 3\u20134, I only have to set up once. Rule number 2, I do it based on how many junk mail emails I get from them. Trick is, you need an email program that allows you to set rules. ",

Unsubscribe from any emails you consider junk or spam emails.Whenever you enter your email address for any offer / give-away / etc. your info goes onto a list that gets sold and resold many times.Sometime it gets sent over to whatever \u201cthird party entity\u201d the list builder is affiliated with (who in turn sell or share your email with other lists)When you open that email - scroll down to the bottom. Most times you will encounter 2 different options for unsubscribe. One is to unsubscribe from the person who sent you the email\u2026 and the other is to unsubscribe from the company that happened to have sold that list.Understand that this does not unsubscribe you from other lists.Email filters : you can set up some filter that will shuffle email having certain words, phrases, or sender info to your spam / bulk mail or trash folder (whichever you select)Report it as Spam / Junk / or phishing email (depending upon the type of email it is). For most email providers this option sits among the delete / move / mark as options just above the email itself.Alternate email\u2026 I also set up an email account that I only use when entering my info for getting a free report or something - but don\u2019t necessarily want my personal email to get buggered up with spam.I hope you find my response helpfulI still get email - just not anywhere near the amount I used to get!

Lately I have been getting hammered relentlessly. MS Outlook used to be my primary email program and still serves as primary storage for emails I keep, but now my celaphone serves as my primary conduit these days. Before I pull emails into my Outlook, I go online to the Juno website and delete the spam there. I've never had to spend inordinate amounts of time before dealing with spam. What are my options? ",

That doesn't mean you will be Permanently secure\u2026right? hackers and many other kids are finding new ways on a day to day basis to hack and spam your inbox. so as long as Google and Gmail address these new problems, you will be safe. make sure that you update Gmail without fail! thanks!!

This works very well. To find it, just search for \u201cThunderbird download\u201d. Depending on the email host you\u2019re using, ask them if they offer SpamAssassin at no extra charge. Or you can send all of your email through spam-filter.com. That service works very well at a cost of $19.95 per month. You can switch to Gmail which has a good spam filter. There are more ways to decrease the spam in your mailbox, some free and some that incur charges. ",

If you have a web-based email account that is now swamped with spam, there may be little alternative but to change your email address and be very careful about who you give it out to online. ",

I religiously mark them spam, upto the level that for 2-3 days no unwanted email land in my Inbox. When I donot do it for a week or so, my Inbox get spammed.  The 3 things I understand for keeping your inbox clean  Never signup to any e.comm or any kind of seevices with your primary email, you can always use a disposable email id for that.Never write mails to people who are not in your inner social or professional circle. Never give your email id at fairs or product launches or hotels.Spam is like an incoming call which makes itself heard. ",

Certainly this spam message serves as a great example for Lenoard's goal of teaching manners to the internet. Mainly because a lot of people write messages that look like spam (and get filtered by my email spam filter). So if a person does not want his/her messages to be ignored, then follow Leonard's advice. But in regards to spam, report, then delete. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: How do you avoid spam emails? The short answer is don\u2019t expose your address in a publicly accessible way. This is a very sweeping statement and covers many scenarios. HaveIBeenPwned has shown that email addresses are harvested from many system breaches and collated so it\u2019s increasingly likely than an existing email address that has been used to register for something will be on a list somewhere. In addition the growth of large scale email providers has meant that common names on these providers are used speculatively so its quite possible to create an account in Gmail and find mail at least in the Spam folder. The large providers use a variety of methods to keep spam out of inboxes so for many users this is the best option. If you need self-hosted mail or small scale hosting there are systems such as Mailcow or iRedMail which will provide an open source system with well supported tools that will at least reduce the instance of seeing spam in your inbox.

If you do that with a few mails, the detection rate of spams should get better. If your mail service does not support training your spam filter you can do it by using a mail client like Mozilla Thunderbird which allows training a local spam filter that downloads the mails and then checks them for spam. This will still show you the mails, but mark the ones that are detected as spam so that you can delete them in one go. ",

If you use a work email address using your company\u2019s domain, ask your Email Administrator to enforce policies to block and filter spam. If configured properly, a sizeable percentage of spam mails can be blocked and rejected by the server receiving emails.

So, there is no way that you can stop them. Although, Gmail have some rules for identifying if an email is spam or not. And, if these rules are violated, that email is dumped into spam folder. Although you can mark your important sender as starred or add them in your address book. It will automatically highlight those senders. So, it will be easy for you to find them. If you get any spam in your inbox label it as spam and that sender will never land in your inbox (You can see those emails in spam) again. Hope the answer will be helpful. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Is there a way to easy way to unsubscribe to spam emails? A2A: No. Don\u2019t try. Some spam is designed to fool your spam filter. Some attempts to give you malware. Some is intended to track you. Any spam that has an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link should not be clicked. Good rule of thumb:If you started receiving the messages without signing up,\u2020 don\u2019t trust their unsubscribe link. \u2020 If you bought something online and gave your email, check their terms. Did you leave a box checked like \u201csend me offers and discounts\u201d or similar? That goes a long way in establishing whether the sender is trustworthy. Because technically even though you only wanted that guitar or the pair of shoes, you did opt in on those messages.
