            "answer_text": "I\u2019m very successful on Medium, which is to say I\u2019ve made over $7,600 from the platform and over $1,000 in a single month. Very, very few people on Medium can say that. And I\u2019m Joe Schmo. I\u2019m a decent writer with broad experience and education. But I\u2019m not internet famous, I\u2019m not a YouTube celebrity, I don\u2019t have a staff writer position for the New Yorker and my dad isn\u2019t a former Navy Seal, retired United States Navy vice admiral and the current Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. I don\u2019t write tell alls about famous people, I don\u2019t do gossip and I rarely write about Silicon Valley start up secrets, especially nothing that starts with \u201cSeven things startups always do wrong!\u201d My most recent media appearance was BBC World Services radio, talking about high-voltage direct current transmission, which I managed to make sound interesting. Before that I was on Germany\u2019s public broadcaster in their 60 Minutes equivalent for 10 seconds as part of a longer segment on an air carbon capture venture which I\u2019d published a damning report on. Before that, in CBC\u2019s print web site quoted on a hydrogen perpetual energy scam that the New Brunswick government had thrown good money away on. Yeah, HVDC, carbon capture and hydrogen scams. Sexy! My most recent book length non-fiction works are a 150 pp report on global use of machine learning in clean technology, the aforementioned case study of the deeply wrong-headed air carbon capture company and a big report on global blockchain in clean technology uses. Sexy! My podcasting includes 90 minute deep dives with Mark Z. Jacobson on 100% renewables by 2050, 30 minutes with Michael Mann on why we are in bigger climate trouble than we realize, 90 minutes with a cognitive psychologist on patterns of disinformation related to climate change and 90 minutes talking about the future of autonomous delivery vehicles in cities with a PhD on the subject. Oh, and 90 minutes talking to a PhD of economics about behavioral economics. Sexy! Okay, I\u2019m a global energy wonk who may not be Joe Schmo in that tiny niche, but really. My top read Medium stories are: Tesla Is Doing Much Better Than Headlines Suggest - 63,000 reads - Tweeted by Maye Musk, and then her son, whose name you might know, retweeted itWhat does it mean when someone calls you a unicorn? - 41,000 reads - Retweeted by nobody, but it\u2019s awfully cute and very briefConservatives Hate Postmodernism, and Liberals Don\u2019t Understand Why - 37,000 - And why the heck this one went off, I have no idea, but Jordan B. Peterson is one of the people who hates postmodernism while being absurdly inaccurate about it and conflating it with Stalinism, which it\u2019s an opposite of.Jordan Peterson Is Divisive Because of His Weaknesses, Not His Strengths - 30,000 - Peterson was always good clickbait.Jordan Peterson: climate change denier and faux science-lover - 30,000 - And there\u2019s Peterson again.Hmmm\u2026 Tesla/ Elon Musk and Jordan B. Peterson. Oh, and unicorns, which does actually have a side helping of Silicon Valley startups in it. Yeah, clickbait. Down at the sank-without-a-trace end: Peak oil is coming but of demand not supply - wonkyBlockchain and immunizations have no adverse effects - wonky and nicheBenign warmists: the next wave of climate change deniers - assessing climate denial driftPatchwork regulation slows low-carbon transformation - wonkyUniversal basic income isn\u2019t universal or basic - very wonkyNotice a difference? And to be clear, I didn\u2019t intentionally write the first five to go off big, I just wrote stuff that was interesting to me that happened to intersect to what people care about. Most of my stuff is equally well written. I do completely adequate writing very rapidly. I don\u2019t agonize over sentences to craft them into the literary equivalents of this hummingbird.  Some of my sentences are, in fact, clunky. Sometimes I fix them. That\u2019s as true of my most viewed pieces as my least.  Want to make $40,000 a month on Medium? Write about celebrities.Write clickbait.Be famous for other reasons and leverage that for this platform.The top 5 by followers on Medium are  Vanerchuk is a serial entrepreneur in a celebrity-focused industry worth an estimated $160 million, and a complete hustler and shmoozer. Williams co-founded Twitter and runs Medium. He\u2019s worth an estimated $2.3 billion. O\u2019Reilly is so entrenched in Silicon Valley and technogeek culture that it\u2019s kind of absurd. O\u2019Reilly Media technical manuals were on every computer nerds\u2019 bookshelf and he coined terms that seem completely ubiquitous today. Clinton. I mean, c\u2019mon. Stone is a co-founder of Twitter and is worth a billion. If they have monetized their Medium accounts, I can pretty much guarantee that they are getting easily $40,000 per month, not that they need it, but it does pay for the occasional sushi dinner for a family of 500, one supposes. #10 on the list? Bernie Sanders.  Yeah, that\u2019s the competition on Medium. And I haven\u2019t even mentioned Tim Wise (follow him, read his stuff) or umair haque with his dystopic and dyspeptic views of the failure of the American experiment. Could I make $40,000 in a month on Medium? Maybe, by being something I\u2019m not, intentionally and with malice. But I\u2019d be bored so quickly I\u2019d probably give up. Medium is something I do in my spare time, something I do as an outlet for certain ideas, something I leave as a bread crumb trail of a subset of my thinking. Like all bread crumb trails, sometimes it allows other people to find me and engage me in interesting conversations. That\u2019s how the PhD economics and senior fellow of the Niskanen Center and I connected, for example. But if you want Medium to be a business, write a lot of short clickbait about celebrities and startups. Expect most of it to fail and some of it to go viral. You\u2019ll make all your money off of the viral, but you\u2019ll also get a long tail of occasional love to your smaller pieces that will be base revenue. Until the platform changes, of course. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019d have to write something popular, incredibly popular. Or, on the flip side, write a lot of stories that generate a reasonable amount of traffic. Medium works by paying its writers a percentage of their readers monthly subscription based on the amount of time they spent reading your story. The monthly subscription is $5. Assuming all of this subscription goes to paying the authors of the story(It obviously doesn\u2019t, Medium needs to make money some how) this means you\u2019d need 100% of the view time of 8,000 people. That\u2019s a lot, especially when you consider that this is a very generous estimation, but it\u2019s not impossible. In Septemeber 2020 the highest earning author earnt just shy of $50,000[1] . This is more an exception than the norm, espcially when you consider only 6.4% earnt over $100. The stories generating that much money attract huge amounts of traffic and the authors writing them are pumping out multiple per day. As to how they\u2019re genearting this traffic, that a marketing question. Though the answer is pretty boring. A lot of medium posts are generally higher quality than normal, especially those that are written well, but they\u2019re not free from the general trends of the internet. Clickbait titles genearte clicks and people will usually stick around to see if it\u2019s backed up. Politics, espically that that already agrees with the general views of the demographic using the site get a lot of attention, remember, this is based off reading time, not just clicks. That being said, as long as what you write is interesting and you post often enough to gain traction, there\u2019s a decent amount of money to be made.
