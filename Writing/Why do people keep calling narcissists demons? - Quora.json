            "answer_text": "\u201cHell is empty, all the devils are here.\u201d Sounds like an accurate statement, especially after you have been a victim of narcissistic abuse and had your life turned upside down! People call them demons, because the things that they do and say are without a doubt, demonic. They are evil, mean, cruel, sadistic and will stop at NOTHING to see you hurt, destroyed, heartbroken and beside yourself. They lack all morals and don\u2019t even have a conscience. They take every ounce of love & kindness you have and shit on it. They throw it back at you and treat you despicably! It comes as a complete surprise when this happens, because when you first met this person and started to get to know each other, it felt like you had found your soul-mate, lover and best friend all wrapped into one! You spent so much time together sharing your secrets, your hopes & dreams, and felt comforted being with them. Then out of nowhere, the mask starts to slip. This is when the true monster starts to reveal itself - during devaluation. You will start to be put down, you will be compared to other people they have been with, they will openly start telling you how attracted they are to other people, you will stop hearing any compliments from them, they will disappear for days at a time and you won\u2019t get any answers as to where they\u2019ve been, they will demand you do things for them and will do nothing back for you, they will take your money that you work hard for and spend it on themselves or on their other supplies, they will stop wanting to hear about anything you have to say, they will lie about anything and everything, they will constantly cheat on you, they will spend all their free time watching porn, scrolling through social media hunting supply sources, partying, drinking alcohol and doing other drugs, you will feel worthless, you will feel devastated, you will feel confused, and you will become so depressed you won\u2019t even recognize yourself. Instead of wanting to spend time with you, they would rather ignore you while they spend time with their friends or random people they want to have sex with. They won\u2019t want to hear about any of your accomplishments or celebrate any good things happening in your life. If they see that you are happy, they want to take that away from you and have you feel like they do about themselves; empty. Their ultimate goal is to just deplete you of everything you can give them and before you know it, you are abruptly removed from their life and a new replacement that they have been conveniently talking to behind your back will take your place. That\u2019s when you will be blocked, cut off, shunned, and turned away. If you reach out and ask for closure, you will be met with someone who won\u2019t give you any of that, but instead they will make you feel like complete crap about yourself. They won\u2019t give you any of the answers your\u2019re looking for wondering how this all happened. You chase them only to be turned away, so it makes you look desperate, pathetic and weak in their minds. They keep you in a state of panic, grief, and unimaginable pain. They left you there to bleed out and didn\u2019t care at all about how you are suffering. They go on about their lives as if you never existed and seem to be happy with their new supplies. All of their promises to you about having a future together is now all but a distant memory. The person you thought you would be sharing your life with is now off sharing their time with someone else, and giving them all the loving attention they once gave to you. These constant mind games take such a huge toll on the victim that you literally begin to unravel and lose yourself. You begin to ask yourself all sorts of questions such as: \u201cWhy am I not good enough? Why are all my efforts being rejected? Why is he treating me like this when I\u2019ve been nothing but nice? When will the pain end? When will I feel happy again? What could I have done differently to fix things? How did I miss all those signs about this person? Who is this new woman he\u2019s with? Why did he have to block me? Why did he take advantage of me? When will I hear from him again? Was I not pretty enough? Was I not skinny enough? Am I too needy or clingy? Was it my fault he disappeared?\u201d You drive yourself crazy just replaying every single minor detail trying to figure out just what in the hell happened, and even blame yourself. Then out of the blue, they may randomly decide to take you out of the discard pile. This usually happens once you started to move on, and they will work their way back in like a snake showering you again with the love-bombing, only to turn around and just do all the same things to you but even worse than before! They may even become physically violent if they weren\u2019t in the past, they will threaten you, they will yell and swear at you, and will become more sexually agressive by coercing you to partake in acts you normally wouldn\u2019t, and you reluctantly agree because you want to keep them satisfied. They just increase the amount of abuse over time, and it progressively gets worse while never getting better. To anyone who defends the narcissist and says \u201cthey are just people who don\u2019t deserve to be called evil, or demonic\u201d; I\u2019m sorry, but ACTUAL good, kind, loving, caring and nurturing people do NOT deserve this kind of abuse. It leaves them with nothing but the broken pieces of their lives left. This type of trauma can lead people to severe depression, addiction and in some cases even suicide. Some may also say \u201cThe narcissist was abused as a child and can\u2019t help being this way which is why they are like this. It\u2019s out of their control.\u201d Well, let me add by saying that in no way am I diminishing the abuse, pain and trauma that some narcissists endured when they were children. I empathize with that entirely, and I tried so hard to heal & understand the pain my ex was dealing with that caused him to behave this way. However, not all narcissists were abused, and some were raised as spoiled, golden children who were never taught any accountability for their actions. Let\u2019s see it from another perspective; would you defend a sex offender who repeatedly molests children? Does it make their offenses any less monstrous because they were abused too? Would you call out their victims and shame them by telling them to forgive their perpetrator because they were abused as children? Of course not. The acts that they commit are still vile, unforgivable and abhorrent, regardless of how bad of a childhood they had! They are still demonic predatory monsters at the end of the day that traumatized their victims for life. All you have to do is look at the amount of people here on Quora that have had their lives shattered into complete oblivion after dealing with a narcissist. We come here desperately seeking answers because we have been utterly mind-fucked over what just occurred. Overcoming the devastating trauma that is left is not something that comes easy. Some people need to undergo years of therapy just to even feel remotely okay about themselves again. The damage and scars that narcissists leave are long-lasting, and forever change how the victim is as a person. Don\u2019t underestimate the power this type of abuse can have on someone else, and don\u2019t defend it, especially if you haven\u2019t endured it first hand. If you can\u2019t call it evil, then I don\u2019t know what else to call it. The worst nightmare of my life didn\u2019t happen in a bad dream, he is a Malignant Narcissist/villainous demon disguised as a person I loved, cared for, cherished, trusted, admired, respected and valued. Never in my life have I felt such unbearable pain. I cried my eyes out, and begged God to take it away, because I just couldn\u2019t even breathe. I felt like I couldn\u2019t go on and live another day feeling so heartbroken. I gave that man all the love, compassion and affection I ever gave to anyone else. I gave him my heart, my soul, my time, my body, and he casted me out of his life without a second thought. I poured my heart out to him, and he told me to go \u201cfuck off and die\u201d. I told him I loved him, missed him and he told me he doesn\u2019t love me. He told me to move on with my life without him, and never talk to him again. He said all this, after all the memories and \u201cgood times\u201d we shared. None of it mattered. None of it was real. All of it was a lie. This is the hard devastating truth that we are left with. It\u2019s not a joke, and it\u2019s not something that someone can just easily \u201cmove on\u201d from or get over. The kind of evil that they unleash onto good people is catastrophic and causes lasting, permanent damage. ",

            "answer_text": "If you do the research on the victims of narcissistic abuse and type \u201cNightmares and narcissists\u201d or \u201cNarcissists and soul-ties\u201d thousands, maybe in the millions of people worldwide write about how they all eerily experience the same thing. Many people have had recurring dreams of the narcissist appearing as actual demons in the dream, feeling a putrid demonic negative energy emanating off of the narcissist (aka impending doom feeling), dreams that foretold them premonition where it unfolded exactly what was going to happen (I dreamed it, and so have many others upon speaking to them). Does this mean demons, spirituals, angels, or God, Satan or Lucifer exist? I don\u2019t know, nobody can concretely tell you the answer I guess. However, I will say this. How is it possible that people of all backgrounds, and ages, transcending the span of time, have had almost the exact same experience and go through all of the things I just mentioned above? Actually feeling a demonic presence, dreaming of the narcissist appearing as a demon, feeling like being around this individual will actually KILL you, is an entirely different thing. I thought I was truly the only one, and I did not know just what the fuck was happening to me, until I have read hundreds of forums and articles talking about how people had these paranormal spiritual experiences regarding the narcissist that they could not explain. People who have not undergone this are probably those who aren\u2019t very spiritual, or they have not endured the full force of severe narcissistic abuse. Those who are not very empathic also will not be prone to experiencing this. This is also why many people are alarmed at how intuitive I am, because I am extremely good at picking off energy and can generally tell how things will play out before they happen. Being around horrible people is one thing, and enduring narcissistic abuse is another. I have endured literal hell growing up, been around horrible people but what I endured with narcissistic abuse was on another level. It wasn\u2019t simply what was just done to me, but it was an indescribable form of a horrible feeling I had never felt before. I truly cannot put it into words how negative this was, it was as if being around this individual was enough to destroy life around them. I always ended up getting ill the more I was around the narcissist, and I also have a strong feeling that he deliberately planned to give me his illness. He would time his illness carefully, and would tell me that he would have gotten over the flue, only to come meet me where I\u2019d get violently ill the next day. Even when there was no visible illness, it was as if I was being poisoned from the negativity alone and would always end up feeling sick. It was not a coincidence. There were many other signs. I would never see this happen to others around him, yet it would happen to me because I was a target to his sick game. Even if one is not religious, the description of the Jezebel spirit is eerily similar to what describes narcissists. Perhaps the people in the ancient world were trying to dictate what a narcissist was given with what they endured at the time. Jezebel, also spelled Jezabel, (died c. 843 BC), in the Old Testament (Kings I and II), the wife of King Ahab, who ruled the kingdom of Israel; by interfering with the exclusive worship of the Hebrew god Yahweh, disregarding the rights of the common man, and defying the great prophets Elijah and Elisha, she provoked the internecine strife that enfeebled Israel for decades. She has come to be known as an archetype of the wicked woman. Through her seduction, she influenced those around her to indulge in the creation of her whorehouse. Jezebel spirit demands: pride of manlust for fleshcovetousnesscontrol/manipulation/liesselfishnessrebellionbetrayaljealousyrageinsecurityfear of abandonmentvictimhoodIrrational fear and insecurity.Elijah had just killed 850 prophets and turned the Israelites back to God. He had a great victory! However, when Jezebel said she'd kill Elijah, he ran for his life. Her threat of his life was not a real threat because he could easily defeat her, as he had just defeated 850 false prophets. So this fear was irrational. You may be under the influence of a spirit of Jezebel if you are dealing with irrational fears that make no sense in light of the reality of your life.The spirit of suicide.Elijah wants to die when he comes under the influence of the spirit of Jezebel. Let's think about where else this happens in the Bible. When Jesus met Satan in the wilderness in Matthew 4, one of the temptations was to throw himself off the pinnacle of the temple. Suicide is actually a spirit. How do we know this? Because self-preservation is one of the most common drivers of creation. So what causes a person to want to take their own life? I propose to you that this desire is not human. Your innate desire is to live, but the one (Satan) who hates you wants to see you die.Confusion.Elijah doesn't want to live and ends up in a cave, isolated and alone. When he recounts to God the story of what had just happened, he brings up a story that is many years old about a time when everything was going wrong. Yet, the most recent story, of 41 days prior, is about his victory. All he can remember is what went wrong. He is confused and forgot his recent breakthrough. If you can't see clearly, feel foggy in your spirit and are confused about where God has brought you from, you may be under the influence of this spirit.Isolation.Elijah said to God, \"I alone am left\" (1 Kings 19:10b) but God responds that He has 7,000 other prophets who had not bowed their knees to Baal. When you're under the influence of a spirit of Jezebel, you feel alone and think you're the only one left. It's as though the world is coming to an end. But it's important to remember the truth is that the world has dramatically improved in the last 100 years. You are not alone, and God is moving on the earth.There Will Be a Charismatic Type Energy on the HostLikes To Attach to Sharp, Intelligent, and Attractive People When It CanWill Always Seek to be the Center of AttentionWill Seek to Infiltrate, Attack, and Undermine EverythingWill Go After Anyone in a Leadership PositionRuns in Tandem With a Mocking SpiritEspecially Hates Prophets, Prayer, and Spiritual WarfareWill Occasionally Expose Itself on a PhotoThe Host Usually Will Not Know They Have This Kind of Spirit in ThemPure Evil and HateMaximum PrideHighly Lustful and SeductiveHighly Self-Centered and NarcissisticVery Judgmental, Critical, Condescending, and DemeaningOverly Demanding and ManipulatingCold, Ruthless, Cunning, and CalculatingVery Combative and ConfrontationalVery Good at Lying and CheatingCannot Stand Any Type of Constructive CriticismHates All Prophets, Prayer, and Anything to Do With Spiritual WarfarePeople influenced by a spirit of Jezebel have fear issues of rejection. They control others so that they will not be hurt. Generally, there is a history of trauma or abuse.They make commitments and promises quickly and use recommendations from others to impress others.They seem super-spiritual in an exaggerated way to gain acceptance and attention. They have their own agenda. They are looking for disciples of their own. They whine until they get their way.They isolate and pit people against each other privately and individually behind closed doors. (Triangulation)They play the victim. They are never wrong. They blame everyone else. They play on compassion to block discernment.They use false humility and feel entitled or owed something.They are not accountable to anyone and often accuse others of being a Jezebel.They look for others who are hurt and wounded to mentor them.They accuse people falsely.They operate with insecurity.They initiate witchcraft prayers based on selfish motivation.Will Be Capable of Giving False Prophecies, Visions, and Dreams (future faking)This is quite a long list but I really want people to see why people would be calling narcissists \u2018demons\u2019 after experiencing these things. It can be also due to the feeling of demonic energies and the overall feeling one gets from being around the narcissist rather than referring to the narcissist directly as a demon themselves. The overall encompassing feeling of extreme chronic negativity and unending shame. The level of greed, vanity and unbearable confusion that often lead many victims to their grave even before they know of what is happening. The power of having the capability to destroy people this way, even for those that have never been like this before, is what many refer to as being a 'demonic' experience when dealing with narcissists. The very nature of all of these things combined is no other than the definition of EVIL.Similar to Elijah, victims experience feeling suicidal and felt complete hopelessness if not death coming upon them just being around this individual. Many experience the feeling of doom and complete and utter darkness even when that is not their actual reality. They are unable to distinguish between the truth and the lies due to the narcissist\u2019s manipulation and end up losing themselves in painful confusion. Narcissists like the Jezebel spirit are unbearably sexually alluring, even without the gift of physical beauty. This is reported by people who have been involved with narcissists who found themselves sexually lusting after them even without any logical reason. Similar to a Jezebel spirit, sex is by far the most powerful tool they use to destroy a person and they use it to get people to bend the knee for their self gain. If people have read this far, thank you for your patience. In conclusion regardless of the existence of actual demons or the spiritual realm, I think it poses a powerful question in regards to what may be there beyond only the physical things we see. ",
