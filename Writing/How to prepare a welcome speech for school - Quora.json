            "answer_text": "Ask yourself this question first: what is it your students value most? The answer should be your topic (or a significant portion of it) in order to get a shot at full attention from the group. You can do Anonymous surveys to find this out. A great speech that is of no interest to the audience has zero influence! Now that you have an effective topic here are some tips. 1.Do not speak longer than 10 minutes. Opening statement should be short and to the point. \u201c Raise your hands if you're hoping what I'm going to say doesn't take too long\u201d  2.Be very clear and remember who your audience is and speak to them, not to impress your peers. 3. Have one main point and a couple of sub-points clearly and directly related to the main point. Use relatable current examples and make sure it does not resemble the curriculum that they are learning in school. 4. Be funny if you're funny\u2026 but don't if you're not. Make a point tell the story or be funny and then solidify the point. Formula of the most influential presenters: Point- story- point 5. Make sure you are close to the audience (within 5 feet of the front row) and that they are close to each other (seated togther and not spread out over a large area). Makes a huge difference in the impact who I have in the energy in the room. Nicely packed rooms are great for energy \u2026big spacious rooms are not. ",

To begin our assembly today, Let me start by giving you this quote by Aristotle, The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet. Sometimes we think it would be nice but the truth is we would be lile boats withoit sails if we didnt have school, without any sense of where we are heading. I would like to invite my friend _________ to say the prayer. Please welcome. Thank you for the prayer. To continue our assembly, let us stand straight and sing the National anthem and School anthem.-National Anthem-School Anthem That was the National Anthem and the School Anthem.
