I write so bad answers but still I'm trying. One day, I'll be better at it. Start with quora if you want to. If you'll start after 2 years, you'll have to start from zero. It's better to start now. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "I love answering questions like this. First, I suggest reading fiction such as sci-fi fantasy like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Wicked, Edgar Allen Poe, books on vampires, witches. Also poetry like in my book: Don't Judge Me By My Cover Read to inspire. If you don't write well, my best advice for you is to learn from the experts! Once you've inspired yourself by finishing some short stories and poetry then Google search freelance writing. You'll be better prepared for it in the long run if you do it that way. Also, check out the film \u201cRomancing The Stone\u201d it's about a romance novelist who struggles in her own love life. Inspiration at its finest right there! Good luck with your endeavors. Don't think about if others are better than you. Work on your own achievements. ",
