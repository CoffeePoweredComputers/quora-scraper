            "answer_text": "Please be more specific with your question . How is the person you want to describe ? What do you want to describe of that person ; their charakter traits , their physical appearance or their feelings towards something ? There are many Metaphors to describe someone , but do you really expect me to list all of them ? I don\u2019t think I have time for that . Besides : Metaphors don\u2019t follow any complicated rules . You can easily think of some , if you know the person well enough . For example you could think of a theme , that represents your thoughts the best , and choose a role that puts their character in perspective . compare your person to other things in the metaphorical environment.
