            "answer_text": "Well, for an argumentative essay you need a subject. Your question is not clear. Do you mean \u201ca sociology topic?\u201d Short answer is, pick a topic, then research the evidence for a particular point of view, then the arguments for and against it. If you frame it like a question, as we do on Quora, you can find a start to your topic. For instance, \u201cBecause of the high asthma rates among children living in a downtown area, should cars be banned from downtown?\u201d There is actually research on this, and places where they have done just that. Premise: High traffic increases asthma in children living downtown. (Show the research that confirms that). Premise: Reducing or eliminating traffic will reduce those asthma rates (Prove that with research). Show the evidence for and against. Having said that, I suggest you don\u2019t use that as a topic. This is a red herring for city planners with downtown traffic problems. Its great to have a mostly walkable downtown, but the truth is that many many more people living too close to freeways and on major streets (the poor) are affected more by exhaust from traffic. ",
