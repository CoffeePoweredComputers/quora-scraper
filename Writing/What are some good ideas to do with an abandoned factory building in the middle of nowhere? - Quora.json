            "answer_text": "Use it to make a MOVIE. When English horror writer Clive Barker wrote the short story \u201cThe Forbidden\u201d in the mid-Eighties, he set it in Britain \u2013 but when it begat a movie, its location was understandably switched to America. This actually made it MORE ghastly, since much of it was set in an abandoned public housing block. In Britain, \u201ctower blocks\u201d are merely depressing \u2013 but American \u201cprojects\u201d are DISTURBING. Add to that a minimalist score by Philip Glass and you have a movie many called the most frightening of all time. It certainly scared the crap out of me. If you HAVE seen it \u2013 I defy you to go into your bathroom alone afterwards, look into the mirror and say \u201cCandyman\u201d five times. But when you think about it, what really SOLD the piece was its LOCATION. Now \u201cCandyman\u201d was made in 1992 \u2013 and as is usual with these things, it took Hollywood several years to realise its potential. In fact it took the 2008 crash to galvanise the location scouts into action. You see, there are traditionally three places to shoot a movie\u2026 In the studio. In the old days, pretty much ALL movies were shot in studios \u2013 with exterior scenes shot by Second Units (using doubles for the actors) and static ten-minute film-loops made for back-projection in the studio. On the backlot. These were tacked on to the backs of studio lots and featured anonymous, neutral city blocks \u2013 which could be decked out with props to look like most anywhere. And on location. However, now that money is tight, all three of these places are problematical. Studio time \u2013 particularly in the West \u2013 does not come cheap. Hence the number of studio-bound movies that are shot in Second-World countries (Eastern Europe, Mexico, etc.) And while backlots have enjoyed a revival of late \u2013 film-fans are no longer fooled by the flat, trackless roads, sharp-edged kerbs, featureless upper windows and obvious \u201cplanted\u201d street furniture. Meanwhile, thanks to bureaucracy, Health & Safety and sheer GREED, filming on location is simply out of the question for all but the biggest-budgeted extravaganzas. And thanks to ever-falling attendances, THEY are becoming as rare as unicorn poop. Enter the \u201cghost town\u201d. The thing is, over the last couple of centuries \u2013 particularly the last one \u2013 natural disasters, man-made disasters, ecological disasters, financial disasters and even NUCLEAR disasters have caused not only towns, but a number of CITIES to be abandoned. These days, there are a whole SLEW of them. And they contain some of the most bizarre, creepy and unsettling backdrops imaginable. For instance, Pripyat, Ukraine \u2013 abandoned after nearby Chernobyl blew its stack. Only built in 1970, it has been deserted since 1986. After being flooded with lethal levels of radiation, the population cleared out in two days flat. They even left the Ferris wheel behind (it still stands today). But with radiation levels now reduced to a safe level (provided your shoot is reasonably short) a number of films have been shot there. Then there is Hashima Island. Developed in 1887 for coal mining, it was abandoned in the Seventies, when oil began to replace coal. \u201cSkyfall\u201d was intending to shoot there, but problems arose and in the end, most of the shots used CGI and mock-ups of the place. But then again, the Bond budget could afford it. However, the original intent was there. The fact is, many people are FASCINATED by these places. There are even tourist companies who specialise in organising trips to them. And for film-makers who can get unfettered access, the possibilities are extensive \u2013 you can even DESTROY some of them. Of course, those possibilities are not unlimited \u2013 you could not shoot \u201cThe Sound Of Music\u201d in one. But for a certain kind of movie they are tailor-made. Then again, like all new Hollywood trends \u2013 these locations will have a limited shelf-life. In short order, people will tire of post-apocalyptic movies shot in obviously real, abandoned cities. Then Hollywood will have to think of something else. But over the next few years, expect to see MORE of these derelict places finding their way into your movie fare. ",

            "answer_text": "Well it depends on a lot of Factors Is the Building Structurally Safe to Be Used?Is there any Hazardous & Dangerous Materials That Need To Be Removed ?Cost To AguirreCost & Time To RehabInfrastructure - does it need water, electrical etc.Now when comes to a modern use that will depend on the size of the building; is it 5,000 sqft, 20,000 sqft  or 500,0000 sqft?  However lets says its 120,000 sqft and it was an old ammunitions factory that was cleaned up. Well you could make furniture, or even be rebel and start an American version of Dyson vacuum cleaner manufacturing company. Let\u2019s say  it\u2019s 5,000 sqft you could even maybe convert into a house, or depending on the size once again maybe even a Corporate Headquarters location.
