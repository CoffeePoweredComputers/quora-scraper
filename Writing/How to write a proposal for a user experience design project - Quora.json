            "answer_text": "I would focus on a key few proposal elements and structuring them in a way that\u2019s user-friendly. If it\u2019s tough for potential clients to get through your proposals, they aren\u2019t going to give you a chance. The UX of your proposal reflects on your ability to help clients improve their UX. Key things to include (no matter the size of the UX project): 1. Problem Statement  Potential clients aren\u2019t just looking for you to improve UX. That just scratches the surface level. What potential clients are really after: the valuable benefits that come from a better UX. Start with that in mind.Do some digging to see where the client\u2019s coming up short. What are the effects of their poor UX? Problems keeping customers? Low conversions?Pinpoint the problem(s) that drove them to offer the UX project, and you\u2019ll show them you understand them better than your competitors.2. Proposed Solution Once you show potential clients you understand their problems, how could your services solve them? Businesses are becoming more aware of the value of UX, but to a lot of people, it\u2019s still vague. Take a moment to lay it out for them. How will your services give them the outcome they need in their business?The idea of a \u201cbetter user experience\u201d is nice, but it\u2019s fuzzy. Your client might have a different view on what that means than you. What will be the key metrics for the project? Define them upfront so you\u2019ll be on the same page.3. Recommended Services In this section, break down your services and describe them individually. Don\u2019t assume the client understands: 1) what your services are, or 2) their benefits.Explain services in terms even non \u201ctech-savvy\u201d clients will understand. And tie the features of your services to tangible business benefits (increased average order value, higher customer lifetime value, etc.)4. Pricing The key to effective pricing sections? Clarity. Stick to one price tag for your entire service package. It makes it simple for clients to understand.Frame this as the solution your client needs. Instead of saying \u201cUX Design Services,\u201d you could say \u201c Increasing Customer Engagement and Average Lifetime Value Solution.\u201d This makes your services appear more valuable.5. Project Timeline  Spell out which parts of the project will happen at which times.Most UX projects have 3 phases: 1) research, 2) design, and 3) testing/validation. You can use that as a guide to help break things down.Breaking down large projects clues clients in, creates realistic expectations (an important part of keeping people happy!), and empowers them to plan.6. Next Steps If the client gets through your proposal and likes it, what should they do next? Don\u2019t leave this open-ended. Otherwise interested people will set it aside for later\u2026 except \u201clater\u201d never comes!Give 1 action step for people to take after they finish reading. Make it as easy as possible. The less work someone has to do to continue the relationship with you, the better.You\u2019ll have to spend some time researching the client (and their users) before you can tailor this to suit each specific project. But this should give you a user-friendly, persuasive structure you can follow to save time and land more clients. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I have a specific view on brand/consumer interactions and that is: The more they have in common in terms of values, the more potential for a successful transaction for both sides. Design becomes the vehicle to get them to 1- strengthen overlapping values and 2 - build new common values.  So, why is this important? In pitching a user experience, it's important to set the context for a design's value. If you can show  that you understand what's important for the brand, that you understand what's important to the consumer,how you can connect what's important to both of them through design...then you have a successful argument for the project. In proposals, I lay out how I plan to discover the brand's and user's values. On the brand side, I want to learn: their business goals,the project's business objectives,the unique selling propositions (their Purple Cow -- Purple Cow by Seth Godin)the mitigating factors (e.g. what has the marketing and business done to this point to achieve the business goals + objectives, are there dates they need to hit for this project? what is the scope of the need -- web site? app? direct mail? ads? all of it?)On the consumer side, I want to learn: Who they are and what their goals are in life (e.g. is the consumer a parent of toddlers? If so is their goal to simplify the everyday tasks in life?)What would the user want to get out of this project? How will it make life easier for them?What are the mitigating factors that contribute to the problems that the consumer experiences? What is/are the contexts they are in when they are in the dilemma?What do they have access to in order to try to solve the problem?Are they even aware that they have the problem?Throughout this process I stress that coming to a conclusion on these questions is work. I firmly believe that what people say they want isn't what they really want. To further muddy the situation, what they really want isn't what they really need. But if you can determine the elements that are what they want and need, then you have the values. The Want guides the emotional/aesthetic dimension of your design strategy while the Need guides the practical/user flow dimension of your design strategy. (See About Me on my site for more on my philosophy.) I may have gone a bit farther than you wanted by going into my philosophy on design, but it's important to state your point of view on design. It will be what will set your proposal apart from the rest. ",
