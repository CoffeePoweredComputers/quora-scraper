I\u2019d suggest spelling out \u201cfour\u201d; the general rule is that we spell out numbers up to at least twelve, perhaps through twenty. The word \u201csiblings\u201d is used much less often than \u201cbrothers and sisters,\u201d but among college-educated, professional people, \u201csiblings\u201d won\u2019t sound strange. The hard-working, friendly person who bags your groceries isn\u2019t likely to say \u201csiblings.\u201d ",
