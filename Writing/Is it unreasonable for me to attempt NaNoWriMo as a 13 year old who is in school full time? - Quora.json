You can certainly try. It's not like you lose anything if you fail. You can also decide to modify the challenge for yourself, for example writing 60 min a day, or 500 words a day or 15 min a day. Whatever seems attainable to you. Let me just say this, school is not going to get easier and you probably won't ever have fewer responsibilities or more free time than you do now. There is no magical date in the future where you will just \u201chave time\u201d. If something is important to you, you make the time. That's how life works. So go for it. There is no \u201cfail\u201d here. If you want to be a writer, you need to write. Writers write. Any words you get out is better than no words, even if it's not the full 50 000. ",

Adults, and I guess kids who want to, are expected to write 50,000 words in the month. But youth can set their own goals. NaNoWriMo\u2019s Young Writers Program My son didn\u2019t complete it when he tried it a few years ago but his goal was 100 words a day. He was around 8 at the time. Set a high goal and simply be satisfied with trying it. Or set a lower goal and be ready to adjust it upward as you go. I wish you luck. ",
