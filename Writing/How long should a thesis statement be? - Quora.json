            "answer_text": "Because I think that your apparently simple question reflects a fundamental, widespread, and critical misunderstanding about the nature and import of thesis statements, I have taken the trouble to provide an obnoxiously long-winded answer. Take from it what you will. As your English teacher hopefully told you, a thesis statement is not merely a rhetorical convention intended to repeat an idea that occurs throughout your essay. Your reader is not a captive ape being trained to associate bananas with the ASL gesture for \"hungry.\" Therefore no universally correct length is possible (not even an approximation), and attempts to impose one do immeasurable damage to students' ability to write coherently, to think through the language of argument. All the bananas in India couldn't spring you from that cage. The closest response I can offer is a rule of thumb: the more general a thesis (and the fewer moving parts it ties together), the shorter it should be. Conversely, as one's professional writing becomes increasingly embedded within an ongoing intellectual conversation, good arguments inevitably acquire meta-discourse, which is to say a discussion of how a thesis relates to other, more established arguments. For example, one could make two comparable arguments about Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, which might produce the following two theses: In Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, gossip is an important but morally ambiguous tool for shaping characters' opinions of each other.As the aforementioned critics have noted, the prevalence of gossip in Jane Austen's oeuvre does indeed reflect the growing prominence of an explicitly-delineated private sphere in nineteenth-century British society. However, in contrast with these critics' general conclusions about Austen and class, which tend to identify her authorial voice directly with the bourgeois mores shaping her appropriation of the bildungsroman, the ambiguity of this communicative mode in Pride and Prejudice suggests that when writing at the height of her authorial powers, at least, Austen is capable of skepticism and even self-critique. For what is the narrator of her most celebrated novel if not its arch-gossip par excellence?Although the second argument seems far more convoluted, its central claim is essentially compatible with the first thesis: gossip is a prominent feature of Austen's fiction, and its ambiguity has consequences for our interpretation of Pride and Prejudice. Indeed, we might even say that the second thesis presupposes the first; we can easily agree that gossip is important to Austen even if we differ as to how and why it matters. What generates its added complexity is the presence of additional moving parts, each of which specifies the basic claim by providing additional information (exposition) about how the thesis relates to various conversations that are of interest to its author (and hopefully her audience). Many beginning writers sense or have been taught the importance of engaging a conversation with their arguments, yet they lack the necessary depth of understanding about a topic to produce authentic meta-discourse. In order to evade this difficulty, much high school writing instruction generally teaches expression or reflection, not argument. That's why even very good high school essays often begin with a clunky, sometimes patently absurd generalization, such as the following: \"Many people argue that cigarettes are sexy or cool; however, I will claim that their health risks far outweigh these social benefits.\" Such a writer knows perfectly well that nobody genuinely believes that the social benefits of smoking outweigh its health risks, but the horizons of her understanding prevent her from reaching her writing goal -- to explore the detrimental effects of smoking -- via an urgent, live question. Thus she evokes a spectral (purely rhetorical) opponent merely to be able to contend with someone. Yet having taught many a beginning writer, I'd say that such artifice is preferable to the standard 5-paragraph essay model, which slices through a vacuum that is equally artificial, if not more so. After all, doesn't your teacher count as someone whom you'd like to inform, if not amuse? For me (and a number of writers more brilliant than myself), mastering this dance with other minds is the most daunting aspect of academic writing. Too much exposition, and your argument becomes muddy; too little, and it becomes trivial or obvious. Frequent and consistent practice is imperative to getting it right. As an undergraduate, you will encounter a network of interrelated texts about your course topic, which presents an opportunity to engage with multiple sources in a controlled framework. You should make every effort to begin connecting your writing to these sources and, perhaps more important, to connect them to each other at the level of the paragraph (as in my example above). Pay especial attention to footnotes, even in your textbooks, and you will begin to get a sense of how academics collect and position arguments within their own writing.  For what it's worth, the scholars (and even some students!) whom I admire and seek to emulate are those who know how to invite other sources into their argument in a way that challenges basic assumptions, such as the idea that Jane Austen is synonymous with bourgeois morality, thus forcing them to innovate or explore new approaches to connecting fresh insights to established ways of understanding. Treating writing as a continuous act of discovery means that sometimes a poor thesis becomes the premise of a great one -- so long as you continue to mull it over, leaving room to change your mind or surprise yourself. Thus my closing advice is to think of your thesis statement not as a sentence or two, but as the culmination of a paragraph that is itself the map of an exploration (even if, for the reader, the details of that journey emerge subsequently). Like the paragraph form in general, its length will be elastic depending upon your needs. It could be as short as one sentence, but that doesn't tell us much. What this paragraph should accomplish it to limn any connections between minor claims whose connection to each other is not transparently obvious. Of course, this is easier said than done, because what counts as transparency depends upon your audience, the venue, and the context of your argument as a whole. Is it the thesis of a chapter within a book-length manuscript? If so, then framing might be done in a more cursory way, because your introductory chapter will likely present these connections in greater detail. Is it the thesis of a spontaneous essay written for the SAT? Then you'd likely have little to no framing whatsoever, because neither time nor the test parameters would permit you to situate your views in conversation with others. ",
