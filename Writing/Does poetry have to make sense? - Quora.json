            "answer_text": "As much as it pains me to say it, no, it does not. I don\u2019t like saying poetry doesn\u2019t have to make sense because it reminds me of abstract art.  Take a good look at this painting. I first saw it on a Spongebob Squarepants episode, and I thought my mom was insane when she said it was a famous painting. For those who aren\u2019t too familiar with the painting, take a good guess as to how much it\u2019s worth. I bet you\u2019re thinking no more than $10 million, since that is quite excessive. I hate to burst your bubble, but that artwork sold for $140 million at auction in 2006. The only reason I can even fathom why it is so wanted is because it is by artist Jackson Pollock, a very famous abstract artist. But still, keep in mind that most, if not all, of his paintings were abstract pieces, meaning they were roughly the same as the painting I presented. I don\u2019t like it, but it is still art. And that is how I feel about poems without meaning.  To me, poems have to have meaning. It\u2019s almost like a requirement. Who would want to read something that literally means nothing? But, it is still poetry. I\u2019m sort of what you\u2019d call a stickler when it comes to poetry. I like it when poems rhyme and I don\u2019t like when they don\u2019t. But poetry is much more than rhyming. It\u2019s about expressing yourself, telling a story, or even the lack of such expression. That is my view. ",

            "answer_text": "The poem has to make sense in the way that taking any meaningful action makes sense. The product of the action - the poem , not the poetry, if that distinction works - does not itself have to make sense. It certainly doesn\u2019t have to make the same sense to a reader or listener as it does to the poet. The act of making poetry is sensible, whether the poem that results is or not. ",
