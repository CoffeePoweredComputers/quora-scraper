            "answer_text": "I\u201dm going to assume you are not interested in self publishing because that\u2019s easy to Google. Okay, so I'm going to also assume you have taken writing classes and seminars and have written a spectacular, sharp novel that contains no grammatical errors, has no cliches, has a fresh plot, compelling characters, hooks where they are supposed to be, that you have inserted twists, that your pacing is perfect, and you wrote killer dialogue. I'm going to assume you know the market, what is expected in your genre, and have written the correct number of pages according to the guidelines. I'm going to assume your chapters are the correct length for the type of story you wrote, that the scenes are stellar, and that there are no POV problems. If you haven\u2019t done all of that \u2026 don\u2019t bother reaching out to a publisher. Remember your competition is every known and successful author in the world who are also contacting publishing houses and pitching their books. How can you compete with them if your book isn\u2019t up to par? If your book is really ready, here's what you do: There is a difference between an agent, who tries to find a publishing house to take on your book, and an editor at a publishing house who also might offer a book contract. Let's start with the publishing houses. In the publishing world there are five major publishing houses: Penguin Random House (Penguin, Dutton, Putnam, Random House, Alfred A. Knopf, Doubleday, Crown, etc.) , Simon & Schuster (Poseidon, Pocket, Threshold, etc.), HarperCollins (Harlequin, etc.), Macmillan (St. Martin's Press, Tor, etc.), and Hachette (Little, Brown & Company, etc.) Very few of the Big 5 publishers and their subsidiaries accept unsolicited transcripts. You must query them first, which involves you knowing how to write a killer one-page letter asking them if they are interested in reading more of your novel. If they are, they will request 3 chapters and a synopsis of your book, which requires you to know how to write a synopsis. Then you wait. I waited for 18 months once (and I had an agent) for Harlequin to send me a rejection letter. There are many, many smaller publishing houses. Yes, they don't have the power and reach that the Big 5 does, but you have to start somewhere. My suggestion is to scout around the Internet and find an agent that represents the type of book you have written. Query him/her and see if you can get a contract with an agency. Then let the agent do the job of shopping your book around to publishers. They have the contacts and the knowhow. Yes, you pay them a fee from your sales. But you wouldn't have had any sales without them. And they don't market to the 'little publishers'; not enough money in that for either of you. Also make sure your book is ready. Have it read by other writers and take their comments seriously. One good site to try is querytracker. com. That is a free website that lists agents and publishers and tells you which ones take which genres and what their requirements are and how to submit to them. Not every agent in the world is listed here but there's around 1400 of them on this site. Do your homework and find publishers on that site that take on new writers that don't have an agent. Query them. If you don't know what a query letter is Google it...there are many sites that show you how to write that letter. Smaller publishing houses may be more willing to take a chance on a new writer than one from the Big 5. To get the attention of an agent or editor you MUST write a book they want to represent. With that said, only query the ones that represent the genre your book is in. The query letter is the industry standard. Learn to write a killer query that hooks the agent and makes him/her want to read your work. I always (even though it says not to) include the first 5 pages of my ms (manuscript) along with the query. If they are interested, they will read them. If they read the first few pages and I can hook them, I'll get a request for a partial, which is 3 chapters. So there's your in... a killer query and a grab-em-by-the-throat first five pages. Just make sure the rest of the ms is as good as the first 5 pages... lol. The other way to get the eye of an agent is to attend local writing conferences where agents are setting appointments. Most times, unless your book is just awful, they will ask for you to send the first 3 chapters as a courtesy because you attended the conference. There's your in. Make sure your chapters are sharp and fresh. The conference has a fee, but if you can fit it in your budget it is well worth it in just the lectures and knowledge you are going to gain. ",
