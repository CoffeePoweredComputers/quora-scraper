            "answer_text": "Your question is ambiguous\u2026 how do you describe a SINGLE action or how do you describe an ACTION SCENE\u2026 these are vastly different things.  Assuming you want to do an action scene you need to story board it much the way they do for a movie. It just requires a small outline of the things you want to show happening. This will become the choreography. Most people will associate choreography with dancing. Dancing is essentially rhythmic movements or movements to music. For us as writers, choreographing a scene has multiple layers of meaning. It is the movement of characters, movement of the plot, and even the movement of narrative itself. One thing you never want your narrative to be is static. You want it to move and you want your reader to be moved by it. As the creator, your story is little different than a stage production, you have the stage, the cast, the script and the audience. The differences lay in the particulars of how they all interact.  So when you approach an action scene you divide the elements up, just like comic book panels. So here\u2019s a prose example of some action (some combat training) : He pushed himself to his feet. He knew he wasn't going to get out of letting this woman pound on him. She would have to be able to. She was ancient, with a body honed for battle. As pleasing as her curves might be, she was all steely muscle underneath. He picked up the jo-sticks and spun them to find the best grip. \"Are you afraid of me, Bannor?\" Senalloy asked. \"Of what you can do, yes,\" he responded. \"I don't think you want to hurt me--much.\" She grinned. The woman was very casual, sweeping the sword from left to right and then in circles. ~When she thrust, it was with a lazy sway of her body, the tip of the weapon snaking erratically as it came at his chest. Though the weapon didn't come fast, the way it spiraled made it hard to counter. Forcing him to twist, guard and step back. Senalloy didn't even seem to be focused on him, her eyes seeming more intent on something off in the distance. Her sword continued to fan the air in sweeping curves as she circled him. \"You know,\" Bannor said. \"This wasn't how I envisioned how you'd fight.\" The woman smiled. \"If I just flailed you, that wouldn't be a test of your skill--\" Her sword flickered in, syrupy slow but insistent and almost impossible to avoid. She wasn't moving that fast, why was it so hard to get out of the way? \"That would be a test of strength and endurance.\" Bannor decided that waiting for one of those ~slow-moving thrusts to gouge out a rib was not going to prove anything. As she pulled back for the next attack, he whirled into her with both sticks. Again, Senalloy barely seemed to move, her body swaying more like fluid than steel. Ducking around his chops, shouldering aside one wrist and flicking aside the other weapon with the sword. With startling suddenness, his face was quite unintentionally stuffed between her ample breasts. She smelled nice--a musky flower scent. The Baronian shoved him back. \"No no, Bannor, those are for Corim. I'm flattered, but you're already engaged.\" He staggered back, feeling the heat of embarrassment rise in his cheeks. She did that on purpose. She must have. At the edge of the yard, Corim frowned. Wren scowled at him hands on hips. \"It was an accident!\" he protested. \"It helps if I trip you,\" Senalloy grinned. \"Watch your feet.\" ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going to assume you're talking about writing an action scene. Here's the best piece of writing advice I've gotten on this: Your scene moves as fast as your reader reads. You usually want action scenes to be fast paced. Short sentences, don't linger, use words that pack a punch; if your reader can read the fight in thirty seconds, that fight has lasted in their imagination for thirty seconds. If they read the fight in three minutes, that fight has lasted in their imagination for three minutes. If your fight is supposed to be three minutes long, that's good. However, if the fight is only supposed to be thirty seconds long, a three minute read is going to feel like it's happening in slow motion. That can be a good thing if you want a slow motion effect, but if you want a high paced scene (and you won't want every fight to be completely in slow motion) then you need to cut your word count. Compare \u201cI swung my fist out with all my strength, and my knuckles collided with his cheekbone\u201d with \u201cI punched him\u201d. That second line reads a lot faster than the first line. Fights are fast. \u201cI punched him\" is perfectly fine; straight to the point, snappy, and all the information the reader needs to envision your character punching their opponent. So Longer sentences are a slower fight and shorter sentences are a faster fight. Use that information as a tool to write your fight scenes at the speed they need to be at (or any action at all for that matter). ",
