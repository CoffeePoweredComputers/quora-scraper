            "answer_text": "By writing every day. 90k book / 90 days = 1000 words a day. 60k book / 90 days = 666 words a day. The trick is writing more or less the same amount every day. Of course, a lot of authors write faster. Some a lot faster. But mainly because they do 1000ish words an hour, and write for 5 to 8 hours a day, like a real job. And before anyone says 1000 words an hour is impossible, it\u2019s just 16 words a minute, which by typist standards, is very slow. It doesn\u2019t matter how fast you type, but that you allocate time each day to write, and you spend that time writing. Slow and steady writes the book. Fast and steady writes the same book, only faster. ",
