But I\u2019m sure BTS love Lithuanian AMRYs just as much as any ARMY from Korea to Australia (where I live). Obviously I\u2019m not any of the BTS members (Or maybe I am\u2026 just kidding I\u2019m a girl so that doesn\u2019t work out) so I wouldn\u2019t know for sure but BTS loves anyone who supports them. BTS loves us and we love BTS. <3 ",
