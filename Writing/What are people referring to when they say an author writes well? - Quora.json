            "answer_text": "Everybody thinks they know when an author writes well, and they can point to good and bad examples. But it\u2019s difficult to produce a definition. In this way, good writing is exactly like everything else, because most things in life are very hard to pin down or produce simple rules that cover the subject easily. I have some rules for a good writer. Some are to do with style, and some are to do with my experience when reading their work. I expect them to write consistently within their own style. I don\u2019t care if they use different conventions for speech, or punctuation, or even spelling, as long as they\u2019re consistent. I don\u2019t feel comfortable if there are random styles in there. I would make an exception of books written from different viewpoints and refer to emails and letters and other documents, which can all have different styles, as long as emails are always going to look the same and can\u2019t be confused with telegrams, etc. That feels sloppy. I expect them to be careful with environmental things, as in the environment of the story. You shouldn\u2019t see a rifle before it has been invented, and if your hero drives a brand-new Triumph Vitesse it had better be the right colour and in the right year. Similarly with word and phrases that are not in use at that time. English people don\u2019t say \u2018look out the window\u2019 or \u2018gotten\u2019, and Americans don\u2019t say \u2018actually\u2019. Etc. Otherwise a good writer is someone whose book I read with pleasure. If I enjoy reading it, then it ticks my boxes. I don\u2019t have a row of boxes ready for each writer, but they arrive as I read, and each box becomes ready for the thing that the writer has added to the story or the narrative, and the ticks arrive when the writer brings each of these to a successful and satisfying conclusion. There are ambitious books and simple books, and each has a set of boxes. A good writer will tick them, and I\u2019ll remember the pleasure they gave me. But if there are loose ends and a lot of unticked boxes, then I\u2019ll be frustrated, and even angry. Style is talked about a lot, and it\u2019s very hard to pin down. If it feels right to the reader, and all the pieces contribute to a world that\u2019s believable, and if it\u2019s managed with the comfort of the reader in mind, then it\u2019s good writing, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I often use this metaphor here. If I\u2019m swimming breaststroke across a lake, I want to make steady strokes, and I don\u2019t want my pleasure interrupted. If I\u2019m reading, and something doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s clumsy, I have to stop and read it again to understand it. I lose my concentration and my rhythm, and then I have to start again, and get back in my stride, and that puts me off, just like restarting breaststroke in the middle of a lake. I want my writer to make sure I don\u2019t have any of those moments. ",

            "answer_text": "This is highly personal. Some readers will be referring to the style the author writes in, some will be talking about the way the author grabs the attention and you\u2019re \u2018in the story\u2019 and some will be talking about technical points. Often they may be talking about all of those and more. One person\u2019s idea of a genius author can leave others cold. The good news is, there\u2019s something for everyone. ",
