I have had many friends who would chase after a girl, pine after her for months and years even and then, as soon as they talked to her and got to know her a little, they stopped being \u201cin love\u201d and most times didn't even like her anymore. Those friends are rude, selfish people - they put someone on a pedestal without knowing them and then throw them aside as soon as they get to know reality. ",
