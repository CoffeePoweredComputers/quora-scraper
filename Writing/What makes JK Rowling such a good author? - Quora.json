            "answer_text": "I have read the other comments with great interest, but must say this: The ones I have read so far are true of any really good writer of fantasy. They are all brilliant at creating worlds and are all hard-working, resilient, etc. But . . . as a professor (I have taught full-time for 44 years) I have taught Rowling\u2019s work. Most of what she \u201cinvented\u201d was invented long ago. Her writing is good but not brilliant. As Stephen King said, \u201cRowling never met an adverb she didn\u2019t like.\u201d It\u2019s true. What Rowling did was apply business principles. She gave the potential audience what they wanted, rather than what as a writer she wanted just for herself (which is what most writers do, including me). Most young readers are nerds. That\u2019s harsh to say, but I think it\u2019s true. As a youngster, my primary interest was sports. My secondary was reading. But most of the students in my school who loved to read kept to themselves and would rather read than play football or tetherball. Rowling did something simple but BRILLIANT: She made the readers Wizards and everyone else Muggles. And I applaud her for it. But struggles? Sure, she had some. But they pale in comparison to what other writers have endured. Yes, she wrote the books while sitting in a fast food place and watching her baby. I admire her for that. But she had enough money coming in to be able to do it. L. Ron Hubbard, who went on to become a zillionaire by inventing Scientology, survived by trapping and eating city pigeons. Stephen King\u2019s mother often went a day or more at a time without food so as a young adult he could have $5 to eat. There\u2019s a bestselling writer of fantasy romances (sorry, I can\u2019t remember her name) . . . I attended a romance writers conference once \u2014 I was thinking about writing some romances, at my wife\u2019s request, but decided against it. She was the guest of honor. She told her life story, and my mouth fell open. Literally. I can\u2019t go into all of it here, but she was so poor that she STOLE two stamps from her husband\u2019s wallet (he became very angry with her) and sent her manuscript to a publisher. They were so poor that they could not afford the postage. It was to be her last attempt, after years and years of rejection slips. Now she\u2019s a millionaire. As she said, \u201cYou can\u2019t make this shit up. If you put it in a novel, no one would believe you.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience as a reader in the modern day world where anyone can self-publish a book on amazon and the overall percentage of books self-published in a year is about 65%, many writers are capable of coming up with a good idea, but only a few can execute them well. However, though JKR has produced some exceptional literature, she is not devoid of errors. Let\u2019s start with some English Language-y features. The grammar and syntax is virtually flawless. Of course, some of that could have been edited in write up by publishers, but we\u2019ve got to assume JKR was responsible as there are many books out there lacking this basic skill. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong (if I may have missed an example that contradicts this), but JKR\u2019s style of writing intrigued me as well. It used standard English, no elision or abbreviation, out of speech, reserving the more phonetics-y, spoken dialect for inside quotation marks, yet her use of sentence structure still made the text read conversationally for moments when Harry was thinking, etc. For a reader, the books read like a dream. There was only one sentence in one of the books that I\u2019ve ever said was clumsy (though unfortunately I cannot tell you where it is). This sentence used the same word (I\u2019ve got a feeling it was \u2018hippogryff\u2019, but seriously, don\u2019t hold me to that) twice in one sentence, which isn\u2019t nice to read. A good writer can always find a dozen diffeeent ways of saying a word to avoid this situation, but as only one slipped through JKR\u2019s eagle-eyed editing process, we can forgive her. The world building was phenomenal. Hogwarts, the Ministry, Diagon Alley \u2026 all the spells, potions and traditions \u2026 and even foreign wizarding communities were touched upon in the original series. The wizarding world is up there with C.S. Lewis\u2019s Narnia, Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland and J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Middle Earth. Every detail was described, but not in an over the top or irritating way (I\u2019m looking at you, Mortal Instruments) However, there are a few times JKR didn\u2019t think about what she was doing, and these can be found in questions throughout Internet forums. How many students went to Hogwarts? Logically, since there are only five Gryffindor boys, it would make sense that there are also five Gryffindor girls and the same in the other three houses. That makes forty students in a year, and with seven years at Hogwarts, that means there should be two-hundred and eighty students at the school in total. However, JKR has replied to this question saying there are \u2018thousands\u2019 or students, which begs the question, why have we never seen more than ten students in a year in a house and if there are more Gryffindor boys in Harry\u2019s year, why is their dorm labelled \u2018first years\u2019, etc., if there is another dorm of \u2018first years 2\u2019? Why do the students start school on a Saturday in OotP? This is a fact that the students go to school on a Saturday morning, and then the books pretend that timetabled day was a Monday from then on. The fifth Harry Potter book is set 1995\u20131996 and the Hogwarts Express always sets off on September 1st, with the welcome feast taking place in the evening, 1st September 1995 being a Friday. I have read the text over and over to find some sort of loophole that means it doesn\u2019t state that the day they get their timetables is 2nd September, but there isn\u2019t one. Seamus dresses at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before Harry has even put his socks on. \u2018Does he think he\u2019ll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long?\u2019 asked Harry loudly, as the hem of Seamus\u2019s robes whipped out of sight. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it, Harry,\u2019 Dean muttered, hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder, \u2018he\u2019s just \u2026\u2019 [\u2026] Professor McGonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables. \u2018Look at today!\u2019 groaned Ron. \u2018History of Magic, double Potions, Divination and double Defence Against the Dark Arts \u2026 Binns, Snape, Trelawny and that Umbridge woman all in one day!\u2019 \u2013 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Chapter Twelve \u2018Professor Umbridge\u2019, beginning page line of the chapter, quoted from Kindle. Why didn\u2019t Harry see the Thestrals when he first arrived at Hogwarts or, at the very least, at the end of GoF? \u2018For the plot\u2019 is the only real answer to this. Harry did see his mother die when he was a year old, and regardless of the fact he was a baby and later forgot about this, it still happened and he acknowledges that in the books. This doesn\u2019t bother me overly, but a lot of people do get wound up by the Thestrals. There are a few more questions like this flying about, easy to find if you google \u2018Harry Potter plot holes\u2019. JKR actually read back through her own book while she was writing it to make changes. You cannot bang out a first draft and expect it to be good. Writing takes time and most importantly editing. However, I said \u2018book\u2019, because she has claimed that she never read past work, meaning once she finished one book and moved onto the next, she wouldn\u2019t look back at the previous. Now, this is both reasonable and a fatal error on JKR\u2019s part. As a writer, I know it\u2019s very difficult to go back over your own work and not want to change it. But, it is often necessary to the plot and characters to make sure where they are now is in keeping with the earlier portrayals and settings, or at least that the arc they are taking is realistic. This is where JKR messed up with HBP and DH versus Harry Potter books 1\u20135. When she originally devised the idea of Harry Potter (a story we all know of how she sat on a train when suddenly it came to her and she wrote everything down on napkins), she had everything planned out. Ron and Hermione would end up together because Hermione was a young JKR and Ron was a boy she used to have a crush on, and so she wrote the ending first and locked it away. Jump to OotP, and while there have been a few subtle indications to Ron and Hermione (though mostly Ron fancying her rather than the other way round), many readings, the cast and crew of the HP movies included, are left believing the story is progressing towards a Harry and Hermione ending. So far, they have been the closest throughout the books and some have argued that Hermione was often a better friend to Harry than Ron even, while Ron and Hermione in themselves were only really friends with each other through Harry, leaving Harry frequently in the middle when the fall out, while the same isn\u2019t said for Ron or Hermione when Harry falls out with one of them. Instead, they side with Harry wholeheartedly and avoid speaking to the other. Then, in HBP, we are met with two unnecessary intro chapters before we get to Harry. We have seen an example of one of these in GoF, where instead of going to Harry upon the start of the book, we went to a man called Frank who was the groundskeeper of the Riddle house, and we \u2018watch\u2019 a scene of a Wormtail, reunited with weak Voldemort, and a man Harry does not recognise (as this is also a dream sequence, hence why we see it in a book written entirely from the title character\u2019s perspective) who later turns out to be a character very crucial to the plot, David Tennant\u2014 I mean, Barty Crouch Jr. In HBP, we see two scenes that we shouldn\u2019t, basically. Neither are from Harry\u2019s perspective or dreams, but are there purely to waste two chapters of our time doing some \u2018world set up\u2019. Now, world set up in books, especially in the opening three chapters, will not be considered by publishers today because it is dull to read. But JKR was already established with Bloomsbury, and so at this point, she could literally write whatever she wanted. If it was Harry Potter, it would sell. And now we are at the part where, because JKR can do whatever she wants, she has decided she wants to pull the story arc, that has progressed naturally on its own for five books, back round to head towards her original ending that\u2019s locked away somewhere. This results in Harry suddenly being infatuated with Ginny, who he\u2019s never looked twice at before other than as a sister figure or an acquaintance, Ron and Hermione suddenly both being head over heels in love with one another but not telling anyone, and because there is now so much to alter to make everything fit and sort of make sense, Harry does not grieve for his godfather who was murdered in front of him before the summer, even though he spent an entire book mourning an older kid from his school he competed against in the Triwizard tournament and who beat him once at Quidditch. JKR is a phenomenal writer. However, as an author, she leaves a bit to be desired. While her writing will go down in history, many fans are already growing impatient with her for announcing \u2018regrets\u2019 and amending parts of her books through interviews and social media. If she had not said any of this, perhaps plot holes and arc alterations would be a lot less scrutinised, but I cannot see her stopping any time soon. Expect the annual regret of a character\u2019s death again next year. ",
