            "answer_text": "As a professor, I agree with Anne.  I often get requests to write letters of recommendations from students I \"really don't/barely remember/recall\".  Why?  Because they sat in the back, texted during my lectures/discussions, didn't speak up in class, didn't see me during office hours/after class times, didn't ask questions, didn't get involved in the course topics, scraped by with a B-/C+, and were in a class of 40 to 100 students.  Then, all of a sudden, they send me an email out of the blue and \"hate to bother me but need a recommendation in less than a week to get into law school/grad school\" and wonder if I'd write a \"quick letter\".No.  No, I won't.  And if I did - it would be a very poor letter, and a \"non-recommendation\".  Do I actually write those?  Yes, occasionally - I have written a \"no-I-really-can't-recommend-this-person\" letter - I admit it, when pushed and shoved and \"I won't take no for an answer\".  Fine - you'll get a letter, but it's not really one you want.  SO - find a Professor that KNOWS you.  That respects you, the way you respected them.  That you TRUST.  A Professor that obviously remembers you the way you WANT to be remembered.  And while you're at it, go out of your way to MAKE a few of them remember you.  You never know when you'll really NEED that letter, do you?  I've needed a few recommendations in my career, too.  Make yourself noticeable in a good way, and keep those \"friendly recommenders\" in your pocket.  It will pay off. We like writing those letters, and will gladly help you out - some of us write a mean letter that can actually \"tip the scales in your favor\", believe me! ",

            "answer_text": "We had to submit three letters - so this assumes that is the case. Ideally at least one is a person you worked with on a research project (e.g. in their lab if in science). If you have more than one person like that then both of them. Another option at that level for a second letter is a professor in whose class you did well and then were an undergraduate teaching assistant, or a job supervisor if you did an undergraduate work study in your major (e.g. lab tech type). Next best is someone who had you in a year long class (or more than one semester long class) with a small class size, advanced course in your major or related area. If you don\u2019t have more than one letter in the first category, then this makes a good second letter. A couple of letters like this, particularly if you accomplished something particularly great in each class, might be sufficient for two letters. Next best (but not particularly great) is someone who had you for a semester in a large lecture class in a lower level course in your major, an upper level course in a large lecture class in a related subject, or a job supervisor for multiple years (unrelated to your major). This is fine for a third letter, if they have something to say about you. If all you have is this type of letter, do not hold out too much hope for a top program in biology, anyway (my field). You might not be ready for grad school, and ideally would take a year or two in a paid position (e.g. lab tech) in your career area to generate a great letter in the first category. If you have a great letter or two in the first category you can get a third letter from a long term job supervisor (unrelated to your major) or professor whose small class you took in an unrelated subject (hopefully with a high course number), particularly if they are very and exceptionally enthusiastic about you. A coach who had you for multiple seasons or sports might also fall in this category, if they can speak to your grit, persistence, or leadership (or there is a specific circumstance or achievement to report there). None of these are sufficient for the first two letters though. As a personal example, I had two professors I had done research with (one in behavioral science and one in reproductive physiology - neither in immunology to which I applied). In both cases I had done at least a semester equivalent of research (the former a semester plus two summers, the latter a full year for my senior honors thesis) and they had me for at least one (the former) or two (the latter) semester long courses (physiology for the former, reproductive physiology and a reproductive physiology grad/undergrad seminar for the latter). I also had two additional professors with whom I was an undergrad teaching assistant (one in communication and the other in comparative anatomy). I had another professor with whom I took a comparative reproduction course that had fewer than twenty students and with whom I\u2019d had many personal conversations. Finally, I had my major adviser with whom I met regularly and who also had me in a semester long swine management course (I was an animal science major). I don\u2019t remember which of these I picked but each of them knew me very well (I kept in touch with two until their death in recent years and am still in touch with a third and visited her within the past year). My husband had worked in two labs, one over a summer (maybe two summers) and the other one at his university as a senior. His senior year project was with a biochemist who was just passed over for the Nobel prize in 2009. Recognize that gathering recommendations takes some forethought and relationship building. However, this process is also the best one to prepare you (through intensive contact with professors and work in your intended or closely related field) for your future studies and career. ",
