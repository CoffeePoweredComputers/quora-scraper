            "answer_text": "I'll try to deal with this in a logical step by step manner. So, let's begin with the preparatory thought work: Firstly, it is important to understand that short is a relative word, and may be used to define both a short autobiographical book or a similarly oriented  paragraph. Since you have not provided any details about how short is too short, I am going to assume that you need to write a simple one page introductional biography. So, we have established how much we want to write, or in other words, how long the content is going to be.The second thing is to analyse the purpose of your bio, because the content will obviously vary depending upon it's use. For example: you do not want to put the same information in your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and your marriage profile, because their spheres of relevancy do not concur. Here, you might want to think about who you are writing the bio for, and what is the level of personal information that you want to disclose. So, we have determined the purpose of our essay, and it's target recipients.The next, and relatively philosophical, step is to understand that your personality is reflected not only through the content of your bio, but also through it's presentation. Are you slovenly? Perfectionist? Do you enjoy writing tasks? Are you good at them? These are the kind of questions that give an insight into your personality to anybody who's reading whatever you wrote, so you need to sit down and think about what you want to project through your work, and obviously, whether you want people to know if you've given this any thought at all (which, you very well might not). Hence, we now know who we want to write as, and have decided what the way we write if going to say about us.As far as the content goes, your objective is to keep them interested, and be informational at the same time. So don't write everything in a hurried, listed manner, but mix things up a bit, and infuse some quotes, references, lyrics or humour, while remaining relevant to the topic at hand. Overall, remember that this essay is about you, and just be honest.After this, it's hard to elaborate generically, so I'm just going to give you a few points I like to see in a stranger's biographical anything-that-is-intended-to-keep-me-interested-in-that-person, viz:Name (duh)Likes and dislikesHobbies (not the same thing)Accomplishments (does not mean college, career etc, but whatever you have done that makes you proud) Contact info (optional)I know this was pretty long, so thanks for bearing with me, and hope it helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s been scientifically proven that talking about yourself makes your brain happy . Then why is it always so hard to write a bio for yourself?  Don\u2019t sweat it! You can write a bio that sends the right message and sounds like the true \u201cyou.\u201d Here are four things to keep in mind: (Note: If you\u2019re looking for a specifically professional bio, here\u2019s a template! 1. Know Your Audience When you\u2019re writing your bio, you\u2019re likely thinking about, well, you. But a better starting point is to think about who will be reading it. When you approach the process from the standpoint of what people will want to know about you\u2014not how to condense your life story into two paragraphs\u2014things tend to get a whole lot easier. 2. Know Yourself Your bio shouldn\u2019t be a laundry list of accomplishments; nobody likes laundry lists Instead, use it to show the person behind the facts. You are more than your job role, place of education, or family, so think about the strengths that make you good at being you. Knowing yourself also means knowing your voice. Be authentic. Write about what you know best and write the way that you talk. If your bio readers ever meet you in person, they should feel as if they already knew you. One note of caution though: unless you are a comedian on the side, avoid using humor in your writing. If you can confuse tone when reading text messages, missing tone when reading a joke can be just as bad. 3. Know Your Limits The person requesting your bio will require a certain length. Whether it is two sentences, two paragraphs, or 200 words, respect the limit and challenge yourself to write just 50% of what is asked. Why? Two reasons. First, if your bio is noticeably shorter than the others but still packs a punch, it is more likely to get read (and remembered). Second, because everything needs a second draft . Don\u2019t just throw something together and send it off. Write it, sleep on it, then come back to it and ask: \u201cWould I want to meet me?\u201d 4. Know Your Clich\u00e9s Use your bio to share facts and impact in plain English. It\u2019s the only sure thing. If you\u2019re still having trouble after trying these tips, give the Twitter Bio Generator a spin. You may not be a \u201cFuture teen idol\u201d or \u201cFreelance bacon nerd,\u201d but you can get some good inspiration (or pretend to be one and get folks interested that way!). ",
