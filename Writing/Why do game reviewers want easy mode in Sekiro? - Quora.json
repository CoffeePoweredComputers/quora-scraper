            "answer_text": "Simple Answer: They suck at the game and don\u2019t want to spend the time to get better. Complex Answer: Some journalists want to get their reviews out faster so they can earn ad revenue. Others are self-entitled and think that the game should cater to their needs. Sekiro is a Souls title from From Software, the makers of the Dark Souls series and Bloodborne. They\u2019re known to make their games incredibly hard for players and that attracts a specific audience. Some reviewers just aren\u2019t cut out to review the game if they are complaining about how hard the game is. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Sekiro is harder than Dark Souls Many DS players had a hard time with Sekiro. Anyway on PC, players can use a save trick to make the game easier, and save at any time.  You can't save during a boss fight of course, but at least you can use that trick to never lose items, experience, or retry a boss endless times, after having already cleaned the place of all other enemies.
