            "answer_text": "Well, they exhibit avoidance behavior to pain as well as having an endorphin response to pain just like mammals including me and you. Basically pretty much anything that is alive has/needs a pain response in order to stay alive. Otherwise the organism would be doing things like keeping their hand/paw/or whatever in a fire and not moving away. There is a condition \u201ccongenital insensitivity to pain\u201d in which people do not feel pain. Children with this condition can do things like leaving their hand in scalding water, scratching gouges into their bodies, injuring their eyes and basicly sustaining serious injuries without them or anyone noticing and have to laboriously learn what not to do. \u2026congenital insensitivity to pain ; Meet the Child Who Feels No Pain Some argue that in fish and other non human animals this (the pain response) is simply a reflex without any actual perception of pain. As in \u201cOuch that hurts\u201d. However, to me, one big flaw with that theory is that animals, including fish exhibit avoidance to subsequent similar unpleasant stimuli as well as signs of stress and anxiety. If they did not perceive the experience as unpleasant/painful they would not be learning/trying to avoid it. Just because something or someone does not or can not contort its face or cry does not mean that they can not feel pain. For example, lets say someone, or you yourself, had a stroke and can not move or speak, this definitely does not mean that they or you do not feel pain. Personally I feel that if anything one should err on the side of at least considering that they (fish/animals) or the hypothetical patient can feel pain. It certainly does no harm, other than perhaps some additional effort for thought and consideration, and can minimize much suffering. If I was not able to show pain I would definitely hope that people would not automatically assume I can feel none. here are some fish pain studies links: Fish may actually feel pain and react to it much like humans Do Fishes Feel Pain? http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D13672.PDF -Pain and stress responses in farmed fish, this one is more thechnical ",

            "answer_text": "For almost half a century, all species had to hold up to two qualifications to be eligible to feel pain. First, get a neocortex, Second, build those highly specific pain sensation nociceptors. Successful..!! Congratulations, welcome to the \u201cWe\u2019ll try to give a damn about you\u201d club. If you\u2019re cute enough to howl in pain, we will throw in complimentary Animal Rights in the package.  Unsuccessful.. !! Not to worry.. I will have a smoked salmon for dinner.  Pain is an evolutionary adaptation that helps individuals survive. While Fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and many other aquatic species have long been categorized not to feel any pain and emotions, some research proves otherwise. According to recent studies (Braithewaite et al, Sneddon et al, Devor et al, Brown et al) , fish not only feel pain but also react in ways to avoid previous painful injuries. Rainbow trout injected with painful acetic acid or bee venom into their sensitive lips, stopped eating, rocked back and forth on the tank floor, and rubbed their lips against the tank walls.Fish who are exposed to painful heat show signs of fear and wariness\u2014illustrating that fish both experience pain and can remember it.Stress that fish experience when they\u2019re pulled from the water into an environment in which they cannot breathe may even exceed that of a human drowning. Unlike drowning in humans, where we die in about 4\u20135 minutes because we can\u2019t extract any oxygen from water, fish can go on for much longer. It\u2019s a prolonged slow death most of the time.Fishing is nothing more than a cruel blood sport. When fish are impaled on an angler\u2019s hook and yanked out of the water, it\u2019s not a game to them. They are scared, in pain, and fighting for their lives.  ",

            "answer_text": "Pain evolved when brain size got big enough to feel it. Lobsters react intinctively to being cooked as its nervous system is destroyed but there is no pain that is generated because there is no part in its brain to feel it.. All forms of life have the will to live. To kill a life form is to deprive of its Will to live. Yet because a life form has Will does not mean it has a brain capable of feeling pain. A bacteria or a plant has the Will to live but has no brain to feel pain. Incects and crustations, do not even have skin. We have a very large brain that is connected to a body that sends signals of pain to the brain. But the brain itself does not send signals of pain to itself. The brain does not know it's own pain, it only knows the pain of the body. .Brain surgery is painless. So if a life form has a very small brain it has no centers in its brain in which to feel pain. A worm does have eyes in which to see, a lobster has no skin in which to feel anything in the form of pain. The Pain center in the brain evolved with brain size. A surgeon can disconnect the the pain center in the brain and the feeling of pain will not exist. So pain is something the brain evolved in birds and mammals. Fish and incects do not have the evolutionary condition in their brain to feel pain even though they have the will to live. A plant has the will to live and will evolve defenses to insure its survival but does mean the plant has a brain to feel pain. A person can walk into the street and jump out of the way of an oncoming car in fear of their life without feeling pain. ",

Fish (pretty much any vertebrate) can \u201cfeel\u201d noxious stimuli, or nerve responses to injury. They will show avoidance reactions, have a fight or flight response, and in every sense, show that they are aware of the injury. Is that the same as feeling pain? Pain is defined as both a physiological and a psychological response to injury. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage.[1] Pain is not just a physical sensation. It is influenced by attitudes, beliefs, personality and social factors, and can affect emotional and mental wellbeing. Do fish have all of these? Probably not. So, depending on how we define \u201cPain\u201d, we could say that fish feel/are aware of injurious stimuli, but probably don\u2019t experience what we think of as pain. Footnotes[1] What Is Pain?",

They have all the basic bits to feel pain just like the rest of vertebrates: developed nervous system and nociceptors. So the bits are there\u2026 but they really feel pain? At least, they behave as if they did feel pain and as if painkillers relieved them of it: Zebrafish given access to a barren, brightly lit chamber or an enriched chamber prefer the enriched area. When these fish are injected with acetic acid or saline as a control they still choose the same enriched chamber. However, if an analgesic is dissolved in the barren, less-preferred chamber, zebrafish injected with noxious acid lose their preference and spend over half their time in the previously less-favourable, barren chamber. This suggests a trade-off in motivation and furthermore, they are willing to pay a cost to enter a less preferred environment to access pain relief.[32] ",
