            "answer_text": "Because as with any TV show, they take a whole week of writing, preproduction and rehearsal. In the case of SNL it is a live show but the timeline is similar. One show a week. In 1974 Johnny Carlson requested that NBC stop airing The Tonight Show reruns on weekends. He wanted to save those reruns for extra vacation days he wanted to take during weekdays. To fill those weekend slots, NBC hired Lorne Michaels to develop a show. SNL was originally called NBC\u2019s Saturday Night because there was already a show called Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on ABC. The ABC show ended in 1976 and Michaels changed his show title to Saturday Night Live. ",
