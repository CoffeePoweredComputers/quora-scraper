            "answer_text": "This gives me the perfect opportunity to tell a very dear friend of mines story. He does not know I am writing this, so I won't post any pictures of him. The story is also based on my experience combined with logic and the things he has told me. My friend (let\u2019s call him K), and I met in high school. We quickly became good pals, we played a lot of video games and did a lot of pranks. Once we grew a bit older, K and I always partied together and tried to impress ladies. K was a tall skinny guy, and he hated it. Often commenting on how annoyed he was with his looks. He became fascinated by tattoos at the age of 19 and even got some text on his neck. He was easily recognized at our school for being a tough guy due to his tattoos. K and I started working out in our spare time, he started using steroids and became really big. Soon he started to drink every weekend and ended up in all kinds of fights. He was often bruised, and ladies, yes they liked him for it. K often found a new girl to impress, and ditched the others. He was never together with the same girl for long periods of time, always moving, always \u201chunting\u201d as he used to say. K dropped out of high school at our last year, and I kept in contact with him. He was in between jobs constantly, and he was still living with his mom at the age of 21. I lost contact with him, cause he ended up in prison and I started focusing on my company. Approximately 5 years later, I saw him online playing an old game we used to play heavily together. I was surprised and texted him, we played some games together and that\u2019s it. We only spoke to each other occasionally, and it was via Skype. One day we decided to meet up, like in the old days. Drink some beer, and eat some pizza. We decided to meet at my place and decided on a date. I had images of him in my head, that he must be this tall, muscular guy covered in tattoos. Probably a prospect in some gang or something, I felt a little intimidated I must admit. Anyway, the day came and he knocked on my door. I had a bit of a butterfly, not because I was nervous to see him, but I was afraid that we had grown apart. That we did not have anything to talk about. I opened the door, and in the door is this tall skinny guy with fake nails. My mind exploded \u201cWhat the hell has happened!? Is this even the same guy?\u201d sure was, he still had his infamous neck tattoo. He was not bad looking, he looked very feminine and stylish and wore makeup. I said hello, and he laughed and said: \u201cYeah you are probably wondering what has happened\u201d, and I said, \u201cEhm, a bit yes.\u201d He then proceeded to tell me. He told me that being he had realized one day that he could not run from who he was. He told me that he had always felt feminine, and liked makeup and was jealous of women being able to wear their \u201cfabulous\u201d clothes (yes he used the word fabulous). I asked him if he was transitioning to a girl, and he said no absolutely not. He is a male 100%, but he just likes to be androgynous. I then asked if he had a boyfriend, to my surprise he said: \u201cI am not into guys\u201d. He told me that he felt more like a lesbian if you can say that. That he knew that he was SUPER weird, but what could he do. He had so much trouble getting to terms with it. So much in fact, that he tried to by hyper-masculine, he tried to be so tough and \u201cmanly\u201d that no one would ever take him for a gay person or feminine guy. I asked him if that was the reason why all the ladies he had been with, never became his girlfriends. And he said yes, that he tried to open up, but how could they accept that when they had been \u201cloured\u201d in by the complete opposite. He decided to rework his entire life and started with himself. He knew that he may never find a girl who would find him attractive, but at least he was true to himself and when he looked in the mirror he felt beautiful. I was baffled but amazed by it. We still play computer together, we hang out and go out together (he is a girl magnet!). He eventually graduated from HS and is currently studying medicine. And guess what? He has after a lot of work found a beautiful girlfriend who loves him, for who he is. Damn, this is a long text. But what I wanted to tell you is, no you cannot change your personality. But you can suppress it for a long time, but eventually, it will come out. And to all people out there, who are fighting with their \u201cinner demons\u201d don\u2019t give up. Be controversial, be authentic and stay curious! ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve changed in some significant ways more than once in my life. I will go with a more recent change. Approximately three years ago the puzzle pieces fell together and I figured out a core reason why I\u2019d been so ill my entire life: dental amalgams had given me chronic mercury toxicity.Before someone comes along with the ADA\u2019s unscientific nonsense about how amalgams are safe, you can look at this or THOUSANDS of pieces of research that lead us to those facts:Mercury Poisoning Symptoms and Dental Amalgam Fillings The science IS clear that Hg a known neurotoxin has no place in our bodies. So I determined I needed to get those out and detox my body. I ended up going to Tijuana, Mexico, to the only Huggins dentist in the country, Dr. Lagos, who freed me from those amalgams and a couple of root canals and did two cavitation surgeries as well for a fraction of what the work would have cost here in the States. I had immediate health improvements and came home and have worked hard to get the chronic metals out of my body. I am making progress but after a lifetime of exposure there is more to come out. The removal of the toxic amalgams helped, but we live in a polluted world and we all likely have more than mercury that needs to go (lead, arsenic, cadmium, etc.) and the body takes time to get those things out and do the repair work. But one effect of removing the little poison factories (amalgams) was I was finally able to start to lose weight and keep it off. I was getting healthier, which was the number one factor. Then I was able to tolerate some exercise. I began doing a lot of health research and have hit on things that do work. So in addition to having lost more than 130 pounds from my highest weight, I am no longer diabetic type 2, and I am off a significant dose of thyroid medication with better numbers than ever. (Yes I\u2019m writing a book. Yes it has scientific research and yes a physician has read it and it\u2019s safe. When it\u2019s all ready to be viewed I\u2019ll have a link.) However when you lose that kind of weight, you have a LOT of skin that makes you look fat and disgusting. So I was blessed with finding the most amazing surgeon who did several surgeries on me so I now look normal instead of like a semi-deflated Santa. I admit it changed my attitude about myself far more than I expected, but it absolutely changed the way that others act towards me. Apparently MANY do believe that being rude to fat folks will somehow \u201csave them\u201d as they\u2019ll finally notice they\u2019re fat and fix it! Wow! Doesn\u2019t work like that at all. But now, in any case, my interactions with others is a lot better. As I did something hard to do (my doctor never expected I\u2019d get this much better) and lost that much weight, people are a bit more inclined to listen to some information. As I know I\u2019ve hit on many of the right things to do, I\u2019m willing to share the info as well. HOWEVER, I am still ill and continue to research. Another BIG piece of the health puzzle was revealed to me when a very smart person I know on Facebook referenced an amazing book I\u2019m NOT finished reading yet: The Potbelly Syndrome. Good news, bad news situation. The good news is this is an extremely well-researched book with a lot of great information; the bad news is the authors made a compelling case for the fact a lot of illness is owing to INFECTIONS in our bodies. So my book is on hold as I do additional research AND try out some ideas I have as well as what is in the book (not quite done yet so can\u2019t speak to that part yet) so that CRITICAL factor can be noted in MY book. Because, and this is NO disrespect at all, other works by people I do think highly of are still incomplete. They have huge parts of the puzzle of being healthy/getting healthy but NO ONE has put it ALL together so far and I think I\u2019m being guided to find the assorted bits. So it IS chronic heavy metal toxicity. AND endocrine disruptors. AND genetics and epigenetics (STRONGLY recommend reading Ben Lynch\u2019s Dirty Genes). AND chronic infections (The Potbelly Syndrome book is CRUCIAL information). There may be some more (by the way, we are all agreeing that APPROPRIATE EXERCISE and QUALITY SLEEP and a PROPER ATTITUDE are also health factors. That\u2019s not in dispute.) I am trying to incorporate as much as I can of the best info and devise some particular protocol choices so that people can educate themselves AND work with A DOCTOR to get themselves well in a safe fashion. The smorgasbord of taking a little bit from this expert and something off the Net and here\u2019s a bit of typical medical advice and let\u2019s not forget to add in something I\u2019ve heard is NOT getting people well. When we read people with actual expertise, too often there are CONFLICTS in their advice, sometimes from the expert himself over time. So, we need a better way to figure it all out and I believe we\u2019ve finally found the best use of my curiosity, reading addiction, lifelong ill health, personal experiences, and desire to help others. I think I\u2019m rounding up the info we need. If you have a massive problem (and we do) and you fix 50% of it, that is an improvement; if you fix 75% of it, that is a MAJOR improvement; but if you can enable people to work WITH doctors and improve what they can do because legit info is provided to them (you have no idea about the tsunami of medical information that pours out EACH WEEK. NO ONE could possibly keep up with it all, but we can find missing puzzle pieces that will help to guide what to look for and stay on top of), we can get that up into the 90+% improvement and that would be pretty healthy. It\u2019s not necessarily optimal health and some of us are likely because of the severity of issues for the decades to never be amazingly healthy, but we can make such vast improvements that there is no reason not to go for it. So yes, I\u2019m changed. I\u2019m not going to be shy about what I\u2019ve learnt. I\u2019m not going to have the goal to make JUST me or me and a few folks healthier. I\u2019m going for huge changes because I KNOW that doctors DO want their patients to be well and they WILL work with LEGIT info and patients who are willing to COOPERATE to get well. We have growing problems with the elderly: dementia to name one horror. We have children who OFTEN have major health issues, like the explosion in autism numbers. The adults SANDWICHED between the very real needs of their parents and their children are being stressed and have their own personal issues to deal with as well. The current mess is TOO MUCH to contend with. We\u2019ve got to figure out ways for ALL of us to be healthier. So yes, on a mission. And no, not looking to charge people huge sums. Besides all the research left to do and working on improving my health which is STILL NOT GOOD (I was beginning to be far closer to dead than alive) I have to make the time to learn tech things because there WILL be YouTubes and more. I\u2019ve got people who will provide very useful info lined up. I invested in the equipment. I\u2019m trying to juggle too many demands and be able to present info that stands up. While I\u2019m still working on all of that, asking everyone to try to have a positive attitude, try to get sleep issues resolved, get their environments as clean as possible (if you have mold, for example, that needs to be remediated). If you have dental amalgams, get them removed safely. I would also get root canals removed: the tooth is dead. See what options you have to get that out already. Root Canals Contain Toxic Bacterium Yes I know that not all dentists respect Hal Huggins\u2019 work. There are FEW things if any in dentistry or medicine where EVERYONE is on the same page. So as it\u2019s our body and only we pay the true consequences we need to do our homework, select a doctor (and a dentist) we trust, and work it out for ourselves. What must NOT be acceptable, however, is the notion that there is NOTHING wrong with amalgams or root canals just because dentists use them. That\u2019s illogical. Go back to the advertising of the 1940s for cigarettes and see doctors actually ENDORSED smoking: Throwback Thursday: When Doctors Prescribed 'Healthy' Cigarette Brands You may think, That\u2019s just ads and that\u2019s BS. Do some additional research, my friends. SERIOUSLY cigarretes WERE ENDORSED. This is BEFORE my time but was NOT before my parents\u2019 time and trust me, when I found these old ads as a kid, I asked if that were for real and they said ABSOLUTELY. So EVERYONE makes mistakes. Some are just way more serious than others. Dental amalgams: 100% a mistake. Cigarettes: 100% a mistake. Learn it, correct it, LET\u2019S GET HEALTHY.So yes, I have changed. ",
