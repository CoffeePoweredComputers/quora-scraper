But, as a former composition (college level) instructor I\u2019I\u2019ll take a stab at it even though my answer may come across as a bit snarky or unkindly flippant. Basically, the answer to your question is, yes. But! If your teacher/instructor is in any way worth their salt, it would be quite clear to them that the work isn\u2019t yours. So while another person could write your essay for you, it would be unwise in the extreme. That is something that comes under the heading of \u201csomething that will come back and bite you on the ass\u201d. ",
