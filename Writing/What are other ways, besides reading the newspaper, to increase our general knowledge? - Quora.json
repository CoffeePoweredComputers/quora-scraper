            "answer_text": "General knowledge is so vast that even a lifetime would not be enough to get hold of it. As a general knowledge enthusiast, I would recommend you to read magazines namely Pratyogita, Darpan, and yojana, If you find reading to be a bit boring, Thanks to the modern technology you can stream millions of videos on youtube that would help you to improve your knowledge. I have to admit that I hugely benefitted from the videos of STUDY IQ on general knowledge and current affairs and hoping the same for you. ",
