            "answer_text": "Your handwriting is a subconscious activity. When you write you are focusing on the content, sentences words and spellings. You are not aware of how the handwriting formations are being made. So who is writing? Who decides how the letters will be written? Can you do the act of writing without thinking? It's being thought by you, but you are not aware of this thinking. This is thus a subconscious activity. A subconscious activity is something about which you can be aware but if you are not aware it will still happen on an auto mode. Now if your handwriting which is happening on an auto mode needs some fixed instructions so that it can keep happening automatically. If your handwriting keeps changing very frequently, it means that your behavior keeps changing very frequently. It means that you are not very sure about what you believe is right and wrong. It means that your values keep changing. Thus, it shoes that you are unpredictable and unreliable. It shows your moody behavior. People whose writing keeps changing a lot are very talented but they are unable to utilise their talent to the fullest due to their moodiness. ",

            "answer_text": "From my own experience, I have observed that handwriting is about how your mind operates at a given point in time. Calm and composed times you will be able to write rather neat.If it is a gift and your focus is on the wish then the handwriting may not be all that great but the words you write would be beautiful in its meaning.If it is a home workbook, handwriting may not be good if you do not have an interest in it,If you are writing for a record to keepsake the writing will look good.If you are hungry, angry, hurried, and lazy handwriting generally is not great.Haste makes waste is so true for writing.There are experts who can say about the personality looking at handwriting too. Handwriting in school changes when we go to college and that changes when we go to the office with less handwriting based jobs. less stress more peaceful minds and more beautiful handwriting. Its all in the mind! :-) ",
