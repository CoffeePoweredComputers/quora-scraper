            "answer_text": "You'll want one from a math/science teacher and another from an English/humanities teacher. Check to see the requirements for the third, as to whether it needs to be from a teacher or simply from an adult who knows you well enough to comment usefully.  Try to identify asap which teachers (that you'll have from February) you will eventually ask. Do brilliantly in their courses. Go above and beyond. You really want teachers to say you were one of the greatest students they've ever taught, so give them reason to say so, if possible. Talk to them about your study plans for college, and let them know what projects and activities you are working on outside of class. If you learn something in class that helps your outside project, be sure to let them know your appreciation.  Then when it's time to ask them, do so, and let them what aspects of your character you are proud of, and remind them of what work you did in their course that taught you a lot. Update them on your projects/activities if relevant to their field (ie math teacher should know about coding because both require logical cognitive skills). Some American colleges offer guidance or examples for how rec letters should be written, so find those now and give that guidance to your teachers.  Asking teachers you had a few years ago is only really useful if you did something extremely evocative and memorable, which would probably be things related to your personal character rather than specific in-class efforts. Those should be your backup options. ",

            "answer_text": "The main thing here is to let people from whom you intend to take recommendations, know that you are willing to pursue education abroad.  Secondly, talk with your head start university professor on the projects you can get involved in. You can do some great work for him/her and get a second letter. Let that professor know that you need his/her help in completing the admission requirements. I am sure that if you perform well enough in the program, you can get one there.  So now the third one can be from the instructor/peers in any advanced/extra curricular course participation you have had. It will be better to ensure that your letters come from people related to the major you are applying to. If not, they need to highlight what outstanding skills and traits you showed during the time with them! Achievements in any projects you did as part of your interests also count towards this.  So dont hesitate to talk with your school teachers and headstart program professor to take their help and suggestions along the way!! Good Luck!! ",
