It establishes the location of the actionWuthering Heights \u2014 the scene of the action, but the name is chosen to convey the mood of the bookDo androids dream of electric sheep? \u2014 filmed as \u2018Blade Runner\u2019, the title is tangential to the bookThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe \u2014 another candidate for \u2018best book title ever\u2019, because of the intrinsic rhythm and uniqueness of the titleThe three musketeers \u2014 a famous title. The book is actually about four musketeersThe Hound of the Baskervilles \u2014 taken with the name of the author and the principal character, this book was destined to be a best-seller from the moment it was printedThe War of the Worlds \u2014 right at the beginning of science-fiction, this book title was probably the scariest ever up to that point, and has defined about \u2153 of TV science-fictionAround the World in Eighty Days \u2014 this would seem incredibly slow now, but the title was completely intriguing at the timeThe Other Boleyn Girl \u2014 everyone who knows about history instantly knows what it\u2019s about, and realises that they don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s about.The Da Vinci Code \u2014 fantastic title for a dreadful book, this had everything to draw in pseudo-historical, conspiracy-theorist readers and turn it into a massive best sellerAnd Then There Were None \u2014 Agatha Christie\u2019s best selling book, it had to be retitled twice because the original titles were offensiveMurder Must Advertise \u2014 the title spells out the genre and the premise, and demands to be readTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy \u2014 a third candidate for the greatest title ever, this referenced a popular children\u2019s rhyme but also announced its cunning and its intentions.",

It could be symbolic of a theme in the story, or a phrase evocative of a certain atmosphere. Believe it or not, the plot is not always the most important thing about a story. That said, it\u2019s true that most fiction does refer in some way to the plot it the title: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (We know Harry will find a chamber that has secrets), Murder on the Orient Express (Someone gets murdered on a train), and so on. Other fiction naming conventions may have only the name of the protagonist, or the name of the place where the story takes place. ! ",
