I started collecting novels when I was barely 13, so now let's come to your question, it depends on what you have read till now, I mean if you are into Indian authors then go for Chetan Bhagat\u2019s The girl in room 105; basically this one contains criminal, thriller story . And if you understand high class English go for Agatha Christie's Murder on the orient express. This will definitely amaze you! Happy reading :) ",
