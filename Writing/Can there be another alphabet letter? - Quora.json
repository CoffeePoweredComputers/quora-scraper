            "answer_text": "Yes. The current English alphabet added three letters to the 23-letter Latin alphabet (I became I and J; V became U and V; and W was created from VV). Other languages using the Latin alphabet use extra letters. German adds \u00c4, \u00d6, \u00dc and \u00df. Icelandic adds \u00d0, \u00de and \u00c6. Spanish adds \u00d1. English used to have more letters, but they fell out of use, the last to go being the long s (\u017f), sometimes confused with f, but which was used for initial and medial s. Long s - Wikipedia It fell out of use in the 18th century. It would be most useful for those sounds that are currently written with two letters, e.g., ng, sh and th. However, alphabets are very conservative, so change is unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no law against it. But we are incredibly locked in, today, to keyboards with a certain number of letters on them. And ASCII and other electronic alphabets which expect 26 letters. Sure, you can find a unicode slot free for a new letter. But it would be a massive amount of work to upgrade all our IT infrastructure to handle it. Waaaaay worse than the \u201cmillenium bug\u201d or the end of Unix time. I can\u2019t imagine a need that is compelling enough to convince us to do all that work. I think we\u2019re stuck with a 26 letter alphabet for the next few thousand years. Update : Of course, we are adding new \u201ccharacters\u201d to our everyday electronic conversations all the time, in the form of Emojis. There is infrastructure to handle that. But people don\u2019t consider them part of the alphabet. If you want to make your mark on our writing, you might be better off trying to invent a compelling new Emoji. ",

            "answer_text": "The following sounds exist in English, but do not have a separate letter: /\u00f0/ = this or that /\u03b8/ = thick or thin /\u0283/ = fish, profession /\u02a7/ = chocolate, connection /\u014b/ = singing In principle, we could use a separate letter for all five of those. In particular, the first two. Arabic has two separate letters for \u201cdhul\u201d and \u201cthaa.\u201d In Greek, the letters are called \u201cdhilta\u201d and \u201ctheta\u201d respectively. It makes little sense to use the same pair of letters (th) to represent both sounds. Of course, it is possible. Unfortunately, getting others to go along with your program will be an uphill road. ",
