            "answer_text": "Foreword, preface, and introduction--they all come at the front of the book, and even writers are not always clear about which is which.  I just did some research on this to clarify it for myself.  Here's what I found. A foreword is a  kind word (often several pages of them) placed before the book.  It is written about the book by someone other than the author.  That person might be an expert in the book's subject, an author of similar books, or some other celebrity.   It is meant to enhance the author's credibility and to encourage the reader to start reading the book. A preface is also placed before the main body of the book, and it is written by the author of the book.  It contains background material about the author and the writing of the book.  Why did the author choose the subject?  What expertise does he have?  How did he become interested in this subject?  Did he use any special resources, perhaps some that were not used by other authors in this field?  These and similar questions are the material of the preface.  It also may contain thanks for help received from other people, though such acknowledgement is often given its own section at the end of the book.   An introduction is about the subject matter of the main book.  It is most often the first chapter of the book, though sometimes it is included in the preface, and sometimes it is called the preface.  It lays out the basic plan of the book.  It may define specialized terms, describe what will and what will not be covered in the book, state the author's viewpoint or philosophy on the subject, etc.  Teachers have a saying:  \"First tell them what you're going to tell them; then tell it to them; and then tell them what you just told them.\"  The introduction covers the first part of that. I hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "THE FOREWORDA foreword (one of the most often misspelled words in the language) is most often written by someone other than the author: an expert in the field, a writer of a similar book, etc. Forewords help the publisher at the level of marketing: An opening statement by an eminent and well-published author gives them added credibility in pitching the book to bookstores. Forewords help the author by putting a stamp of approval on their work.THE PREFACEA preface is best understood, I believe, as standing outside the book proper and being about the book. In a preface an author explains briefly why they wrote the book, or how they came to write it. They also often use the preface to establish their credibility, indicating their experience in the topic or their professional suitability to address such a topic. Sometimes they acknowledge those who inspired them or helped them (though these are often put into a separate Acknowledgments section). Using an old term from the study of rhetoric, a preface is in a sense an \u201capology\u201d: an explanation or defense. ",
