            "answer_text": "Take your supervisor out for coffee or lunch and ask your supervisor to advise you on higher education.  For example state the following, \"I am thinking about gaining additional education that would help me in my role.  What are your thoughts on it?\"  Then listen (do not reveal that you are thinking about returning to school full time at this point).  If the answer is positive, wait a week or two and then state, \"I've been thinking about what you've said regarding additional education and I believe its a great idea.  Would you be willing to write me a great recommendation?\"  If the answer is negative, thank your supervisor for his/her input and let your supervisor know that he/she gave you a lot of information to consider.  Do not ask that supervisor for a recommendation.  Find another person at work who can offer an unbiased viewpoint and explain why you did not ask your supervisor to write the recommendation (in your case it would impact future projects/assignments).

            "answer_text": "Why do you need a recommendation letter from your boss?  This is risky and I would never recommend it.  Managers will likely answer a different question when you ask for the letter; that is, what is the impact to him/her  when you leave?  It unlikely to be viewed favorably.  The best choice is to find other managers in your organization to write a letter for you, maybe someone you know well.  If you don't know anyone, take the time to identify someone, then seek their advice several times about your career path.  Maybe even ask them to be a mentor.  Interact with them at least 12 to 14 times before asking for the letter.  It's a worthy investment of your time.  I've attended grad school a couple times (PhD and MBA) while I continued working and found the companies to be supportive.  Of course, I wasn't surprised to find no changes in upward mobility after I graduated.  They viewed my college education as self-improvement. ",
