            "answer_text": "I think that\u2019s a good goal! You can also try setting a twenty or thirty minute timer and writing for that amount of time. I always found that writing to a timer works best for me than trying to aim for a certain word count, but it depends on what works for you. If you have trouble coming up with ideas, try going online to find writing prompts to get you started. Also, the way that I normally write just for practicing, I just start writing the first thing that comes to mind. It\u2019s called \u201cintuitive\u201d writing, or \u201cwriting into the darkness.\u201d Don\u2019t let yourself think twice about it as you write. Don\u2019t go back and edit until you\u2019re done. If its in the middle of a conversation that you start writing, and you don\u2019t know how those characters got there or why, don\u2019t worry! Just keep writing. It\u2019ll really wake up the innate writer inside you. Trust it and ignore your inner critic. Because that way of writing sometimes leaves your story a little jumbled or confused, you can alternate writing that way and this: come up with a goal to pursue. Like, get popular girl in school to go to prom with [character]. Or get to airport on time or something. That way, you can write how those characters achieve those specific goals. It can be any goal. Doing it that way will just get you to practice writing to a goal, and having a specific direction in mind to go. It will also keep you on track, especially when writing stories, because when you\u2019re in the middle of a novel, it\u2019s so easy to forget what the whole point of the story is, haha. If the goal of the character in your story was to get someone to go to prom with them and you have them fighting crime in Spain, then something doesn\u2019t quite click haha. But practicing writing both ways, without thinking about pretty much anything and just writing, as well as having a clear goal or idea in mind, are super important. They are equally important. Lots of people might push outlines or won\u2019t push outlines, but honestly they are both just as vital. Hopefully this helps, and I\u2019m glad you started writing! Writing is awesome. :) ",

            "answer_text": "That is not how you learn to write. It may be how you learn to write crap, but it\u2019s not how you learn to write anything you will take pride in. You do need to commit time to writing. Carry a notebook around. Jot down fragments of conversations, observations, sketches, thoughts. Describe a pretty girl, a car wreck, whatever.Either read or write something each day. Chandler said you don\u2019t have to write, but you can\u2019t garden, wash the dog or reload your gun. Soon enough you\u2019ll get bored and write something.There\u2019s a really stupid saying that you should write what you know. That will last you about 5 minutes because most people don\u2019t know jack (I will say that reading or listening to a true expert is wonderful, whatever the subject). But for our purposes, write about what you care about. Passionately. It can be sea turtles or getting the waitress at the shake shop to go out with you.Don\u2019t read junk except for the specific purpose of genre research. Read the giants. People taller than you for a start.Don\u2019t get caught up in too many \u2018creative writing\u2019 courses - yes you need to learn structure, but don\u2019t get your voice strangled before you even find it. Stay away from Dead Cats. NOTE: Screenwriting is a different story, I\u2019m talking about novels and stories. You do need a copy of Strunk & White\u2019s Elements of Style. Memorize it. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s thin.Read Hemingway\u2019s memoir, A Moveable Feast, it\u2019s a wonderful tutorial on many things.Finally, the actual writing. Just write like you are sitting in a bar with a good friend telling him a story. Avoid situations that might get you in trouble until you are more experience. For example in my new YA novel (Dash, 2018) EDIT: Dash & Laila Aug 20, 2020 Black Rose Writing - decided on a main setting (Morocco) the time frame (about 2\u20133 months) and structure (linear). It is deliberately not a thousand year saga with time travel and other dimensions. Keep the structure simple until you are more experienced.Don\u2019t even think about writing a novel until you written at least a dozen short stories.Once you start a novel, and this is critical, DON\u2019T BACK UP. You have to move forward until you have a draft. 60\u201380k is the commercial length. THEN you go back and edit and re-write it. Most people NEVER get this far.Back up your files on more than one thumb drive. Obvious right? Eat fibre. Be kind to puppies. Help seniors reach the high up packages in the grocery store. Good luck.",
