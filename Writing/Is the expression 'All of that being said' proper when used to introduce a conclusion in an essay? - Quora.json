            "answer_text": "I am not an essay writing authority, but this almost sounds like my grade-school daughter's final paragraphs, so I will make two comments: Avoid cliche phrases to introduce your conclusion. A simple, direct worded sentence is actually less distracting.\"All of that being said\" is usually an introductory phrase to a paragraph or speech in which you are now about to contradict everything said up to that point. So, in reality, it would be the opposite of a conclusion!All of that being said, I am not an expert in essay writing techniques and you should feel free to disregard my advice. (Example of using that phrase). I've discussed the improper use of the cliche phrase \"all that being said\" in my short Quora answer and have offered two points demonstrating why it is a poor choice. (Example of directly worded conclusion.) ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not proper. \"All that being said\" is typically found in spoken language, and not in formal written language. And its usual function is to introduce something that is contrary to what the previous information seems to indicate. If you have spent most of the essay giving evidence that A is true, when you write \"all that being said,\" it signals to your audience that you are about to claim that A is not true. That is not the way to end an essay, because you would then need to explain the reasons why A is not true, and why those reasons override all the reasons you have already given for the opposite conclusion. The phrasing could be used as a rhetorical advice much earlier in your essay--for example, to introduce your thesis sentence at the end of the first paragraph. But if you are not a native speaker of English, I would not recommend this approach. ",

Something else you should know is that \"All of that being said\" is used when we want to add something more that is different from or opposite to what was said before. So it is not the best way to conclude an essay, unless your conclusion is such that it contradicts what you said in the body of your essay. Your best choices for concluding a formal essay would be \"In conclusion\" or \"To conclude\" or one of the other traditional phrases used for conclusions. ",
