            "answer_text": "If you're white, or Non-black, I suggest you avoid writing female black characters (or characters from minority ethnic groups you don't belong to) from their perspective altogether. As in, do not write a story that features a black female character as a protagonist and the story was told from her POV. DO NOT DO THAT. That kind of stories, stories told from the POV of minority characters, should be told by minority writers. Let them write their own stories. You don't get to tell their stories because you don't know what it feels like to be a black woman, you'll never know. I'm a minority. I know what's like to experience racism. But I don't know how Black people experience racism. But but but, you say, I\u2019m a writer, I write what I want, no censorship! OK, that\u2019s fine. If you absolutely must write a Black woman as your protagonist, DO YOUR RESEARCH. I'm a minority woman. I'm from China. My first published novel is a historical novel based on the Medici Family during Renaissance Italy. How did I do it? I studied art history back in college, specialized in Early Renaissance. I've read everything every biography published about the Medici Family, specifically about Lorenzo de'Medici (one of my protagonists). I've read, researched, extensively on Renaissance. I've visited Rome, Florence, and Milan (the primary locations of my story). Later on, the story will move to Constantinople, I don't plan to write it until I've visited Istanbul. (As far as historical novels go, what I did is kind of the bare minimum). Mind you, I'm writing about a historical character with an extensive contemporary record, an autobiography and many later biographies for the past 500 years. We know how Lorenzo saw himself, we know how other people see him from many letters, memoirs by people who knew him. We know the choices he made, we know (to some extent) his mannerism and character. We know how historians saw him, and we know how such opinion changed over centuries, which in and out of itself, is telling. The story was set in a time where we have an extensive historical record. Many historical sites are still standing today. I'm writing a white man in the position of power, a type of character that has been written so many times before. The entire history was filled with white men in the position of power. I have exceedingly rich references to draw inspiration from. Black women? Not so much. Unless you have lived in a Black community, has extensive interaction with black women of all kinds, listen to their voice, observe them for years\u2026 you have almost no real life/historical references to draw from (thanks to racism and misogyny). That's why such stories must be left to be told by black women. They alone know what's like living as a black woman. So as a white person (especially if you're a white man), unless you're willing to do years of research, I strongly suggest you do not write a story from the POV of a black woman.  But if you're white, and you're writing a story that features a white protagonist and diverse ensemble of supporting characters of all skin color, religious belief, gender identity, and sexual orientations\u2026good for you! There are a few things you can do. First and foremost, once again, DO YOUR RESEARCH. I can't stress this enough. DO YOUR RESEARCH. Read novels written by black people. Observe black people around you in real life. Keep note of your own bias, that could be something you write about for your white protagonist. Talk to black people, befriend them, tell them you're writing a story and you want to include characters of all skin color, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Tell them you have much to learn and ask them to help you out. Second, avoid lazy stereotypes. There are some tired stereotypes for black people. If you have only one black female character in your story, do me a favor, don't write them as the sassy housekeeper who doted on her white mistress (see Mammy - TV Tropes) or a Sassy Black Woman - TV Tropes. If you want this black woman to be a romantic interest of your white protagonist, please don\u2019t make her into a Jezebel. If your black female character is \u201csidekick\" of your male protagonist, don't make her into a Magical Negro. There are so many\u2026 SO MANY black tropes that's stupid, boring, lazy, racist and damaging. You should read through TV tropes and avoid them. Instead, think of an actual black person you know, in real life. What does she do? How would she handle this fictional situation you drafted for your story? Model your character after a real person or a combination of real people, is probably the safest way to do this, which, of course, requires you to DO YOUR RESEARCH first. Alternatively, unless her skin color is crucial for your plot, you don't even need to make it an issue. Write a computer genius who, just so happen, is black, female, immigrant, have 5 siblings, have 3 cats and a parrot, and loves ramen noodle. Let her do her computer genius thing, and casually mention her family, life before moving to the US (or whatever country you set your story in), complain about her asshole cats, and demand an endless supply of ramen noodles. Your black female character doesn't need to revolve her character development around her blackness or her womanhood. Your gay character doesn't need to get character growth from coming out, he might already have come out and be happily married to a human rights lawyer with 2 kids. Write about normal people, do normal things, in your story. And it just so happens, they're diverse. It helps in normalizing minority people and their existence. Have trans people just exist in your story, and everyone just accept them as who they are, that nobody makes a fuss about it can be enormously powerful. Both ways can work. And if you are really determined, by all means, write a story from the perspective of a black woman, after research. And hire a sensitivity reader. ",

            "answer_text": "There will be people who tell you you can't write about black females, period, if you are not a black female, but writers constantly write about characters who are different from them. Men write about women, straight people write gay characters and vice versa, perfectly nice people write through the eyes of serial killers, young people write about old people. Imagination, empathy, and research go a long way. Assuming you are not black, there are two main things to avoid: Treating your character as a stereotype or special (in either a good or bad way) because of her skin color and gender. Regardless of color, gender, sexual orientation or what have you, she is human. Well, unless she's an alien or fantasy character--but even those characters usually act like humans. Writing from a perspective where race is a primary factor in the story. There's no way a white male writer is going to be the next Alice Walker. If the black woman is your protagonist, the main focus should not be on her race and gender. For example, she's a top scientist trying to save the world from Armageddon who happens to be a black woman. As FeiFei points out, research is critical. Read novels and articles by black women. And have a black woman look over the finished manuscript to make sure you're not accidentally doing something cringeworthy with that character. For a good look at writing varied characters well, I recommend Alyssa Cole, an author in my genre (romance) who's also written quite a bit for online publications. She's a black woman whose protagonists are black women, but the love interests are males of various ethnicities, and in one book, the love interest is female. All that said, there are no writing rules, only guidelines. If there's a black woman character in your head demanding that you write her story down, do it. ",
