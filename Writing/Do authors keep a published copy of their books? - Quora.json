            "answer_text": "Fascinating question. I\u2019ve written over a dozen books. Unfortunately, if you have a lot of books by others in your shelves, and you frequently move from apartment or house to another, it\u2019s difficult to keep track of books. Over time, your copies of your books may gradually disappear. There are several good reasons to keep copies of your own books, even if you have to buy them at reduced prices from your publisher. (Publishers can be very parsimonious about distributing copies to authors, as I\u2019ve written elsewhere.) It\u2019s amazing the marketing power of carrying a copy of your book around with you. You might be in a coffee shop and you make the acquaintance of a stranger. It might be that they share your interest in the topic of your nonfiction book, or genre of fiction book. In this case, you have two choices:You might give it to them if you consider them a potential client for your services.Otherwise, you might sell them a copy at a reduced rate. In either case, you might collect their business card and, with their permission, add them to your email mailing list.Use your book as a business card. Bob Bly, author of The Copywriter\u2019s Handbook, has always said that the most important use is to validate your competence. It differentiates you from your competence in face-to-face meetings.A published book provides tangible proof of your talent and willingness to see projects through to completion. is as a business card.Even if you have to buy books at about $9 a copy, isn\u2019t it worth it if your potential revenues are $100, $500, or $1,000, or more, in potential revenue?Needless to say, the above techniques require a printed copy of your book. In other circumstances, like when being interviewed, a link to your book on Amazon will suffice. (That way, interested readers can choose the format they prefer.) Note: when buying copies of your own book from a publisher, you may be required to purchase them in case lots, typically 20 or 25 copies. You may also be required to pay shipping costs (Boxes of printed books are heavy\u2014when in doubt, check shipping costs in advance.) Hint: In the event your publisher doesn\u2019t provide you with a glossy photograph (or .jpg or a .png file) of the cover, be sure to request one from your publisher\u2019s publicist. Save it in either a permanent \u201ccover file\u201d folder in your file cabinet, or in a separate folder of your computer. You never know when one will come in handy for your resume, an upcoming event where you\u2019re speaking, or updating your website. Roger ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I\u2019ve written two novels, and am primarily a writer of short stories or novellas. So someone will look at one of my bookcases and see three shelves of books that say \u201cedited by\u2014-\u201d without my name on the spine. Many times, the publisher will send you a copy of the book. One specific book (I\u2019m not promoting anything) has appeared in four different versions in the last decade, so I was automatically sent copies of those before I even received payment for the reprint. And their are foreign anthologies and my first novel is reprinted in German and in Russian. I have a copy of my novel that I bought on eBay because it had been a library edition from Port Huron, Michigan. I\u2019m in Chicago and so that was pretty neat, seeing all the date stamps and markings. I have a literary executor, so he\u2019ll have fun with my bookshelf, figuring out if they really belong anywhere. I\u2019m joking. Sort of. ",
