You\u2019ll build the content around them,Next, look at the content objectives. What do you want this content to do for you? Should it help you increase search engine traffic? Do you want people to take a certain action? Are you trying to increase brand awareness, social proof or engagement?If you\u2019re creating content for someone else or SEO isn\u2019t important to you, skip 4 and 5.You\u2019ll need to do some keyword research so you can build content around primary and secondary keywords.You also need to do a competitor analysis. Look at the top 10 websites who are targeting the same keyword. find out the length of the content, what words their targeting, and the overall quality of the pieces. If you want to outrank them, you have to create something better than theirs. As your own website rank goes up, you\u2019ll be a contender on the first page.If you don\u2019t already have a topic, you\u2019ll need to develop one. Choose a topic that your target audience is looking for. It should generally be helpful and/or help a person meet specific goals.Invest some time in creating the perfect title. It\u2019s the first and sometimes the only thing a person sees. If it\u2019s not an attention-grabber, they won\u2019t see how great your content is. Your title shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought.Start the content off with a hook. You have about 3 seconds to get someone lured in.Realize that the vast majority of people scan content for what they\u2019re looking for. They don\u2019t read it top to bottom. Make the content very scannable with ample left-aligned, short, descriptive headings. When you finish creating content, read your headings straight down the line. They should align with the title and tell a progressive story about whatever you\u2019re talking about.Use a lot of white space. Write in short paragraphs. They\u2019re easier to read on mobile devices.Edit. Seek out and destroy awkward phrasing. Tighten up your prose where you can. But it should still be conversational and easy to read. Be selective.Use Hemmingway App to check your readability score. It will highlight long confusing sentences in red. Those usually aren\u2019t good for web reading. Shoot for a 5th to 6th-grade reading level. If you\u2019re writing for experts in the subject you\u2019re writing, then 8th or 9th grade isn\u2019t bad. But try to get it down if you can.Use Grammarly to check for mistakes. I proofread manually and use Grammarly. It\u2019s very hard to proofread your own work. But realize that neither Grammarly nor Hemmingway should be the final word. Sometimes they get it wrong. As a writer, you need to take good suggestions and leave the bad.Create some amazing social media headlines and metas using best practices. These will help make the content more visible to your target audience.If you find this answer helpful, please upvote it and share with someone who might find it useful.

            "answer_text": "Content is king, right? If you believe this to be true (and you should), you understand the importance of creating high-quality content that converts. But how does one create amazing content? There are certain situations where traditional marketing is effective, but this isn\u2019t nearly as powerful as it was in the past. In today\u2019s digital era, it\u2019s all about content marketing. Once you have content, you need to effectively push it out on social media expanding social networks to grow your captive target audience. Not only does content marketing cost less than traditional marketing, but 80% of B2B marketers have a strategy in place to attract their target audience. If you don\u2019t make a concerted effort to implement a sound content marketing strategy, you will continue to spend more money than you have to, while also slipping further behind the search engine competition. You may have a great content strategy, meaning you know who your target audience is. From there, you need to implement a \"creating great content strategy.\" But, what if you don\u2019t have the experience, knowledge or time to create high quality content that converts? This isn\u2019t an excuse to give up and go back to your old ways. It\u2019s time to turn your attention to the tools and services that can boost your content creation efforts, despite your shortcomings.  5 Content Creation Tools 1. Evernote In an overall sense, Evernote is a powerful tool used by entrepreneurs, for a number of reasons. For the sake of this article, we\u2019re going to examine how it is used to create better content. Evernote makes it simple to keep track of all of your ideas.

Once you create a note, it\u2019s accessible from now until the end of time (as long as you don\u2019t delete it, of course). From a content creation perspective, here\u2019s why you should be using Evernote: Create posts in Evernote and then transfer them to your content management system, when the time comes.Take notes related to future blog posts. This is preferable to recording your thoughts on paper, because paper is more likely to go missing.Share your thoughts with others to develop great content. Maybe you want to share a blog post idea with one of your writers. Or, maybe you need to share a draft with an editor. Evernote makes this simple.Through a variety of tools and unique features, Evernote will forever change the way that you create content.  2. Portent\u2019s Content Idea Generator It\u2019s called writer\u2019s block and it\u2019s a serious problem that can stop you dead in your tracks. Even worse, some people run into this before they ever reach the first sentence. If you struggle to create blog post titles, this tool will change your writing strategy forever. Getting started is as simple as entering your keyword. For example, \u201ccontent writing.\u201d Upon running a search, you are presented with this:  Best yet, if you don\u2019t like the first suggestion, you can continue to hit the \u201cgenerate\u201d button.

Hemingway Editor This is a nifty tool that pushes the quality of your writing to the next level. In addition to identifying problem areas, it also categorizes each one so that you know how to fix them. Here is an example that shows a variety of errors.  The color coding shows you the mistakes, with each one outlined on the right sidebar:  Get into the habit of using the Hemingway Editor to review all of your blog posts. Not only does it help you repair content, but it also trains you to avoid the same mistakes in the future. This allows you to save time down the road being more efficient in creating great content.

Approximately 50% of marketers say that photography is essential to their marketing strategy. Furthermore, content with relevant images attract 94% more views than content with none. With the help of Infogram, you don\u2019t need to be a professional designer to create eye-popping online charts and infographics. There is also no reason to spend thousands of dollars hiring a professional. Here is the tool\u2019s tagline: \u201cCreate and publish beautiful visualizations of your data. Interactive, responsive and engaging.\u201d Making a chart is a simple three step process: Choose a template.Visualize your data by adding charts, images, maps, videos and more.Publish and share through one-click share buttons or a simple embed code.Here is an example of a chart, created by Bleacher Report, using the Infogram tool:  Every aspect of the image was personally customized by the client, including the title, colors and chart data. Also, pay close attention to the bottom left corner, as this is where the social network \u201cshare\u201d button is located. With this, readers have the ability to quickly share your chart with their audience, thus driving traffic and helping you generate backlinks to your blog post. Every content marketer eventually understands that backlinks to your blog post is the currency of the search engine. Content with high quality, data-driven images will keep visitors on your site longer. Infogram makes it simple to create visualizations of your data, all in a fast and affordable environment. 5. ilys Using Portent\u2019s Content Idea Generator, you will never again run into issues generating unique titles. But, that doesn\u2019t do you any good once it\u2019s time to create the actual content. If writer\u2019s block continues to hinder your progress of creating great content, a tool like ilys can be useful. First, it asks you how many words you want to write. Since 2,000+ words gives you the best chance of a page one ranking, this is a good place to start. From there, the tool gives you little choice but to work towards your goal. It is not until you reach your goal that you are permitted to edit the text. Since there is nothing else that you can do, you are encouraged to just keep writing. There is no editing, for now. There is no deleting, for now. There is plenty of time for that once you reach your word count goal. I suggest that you experiment with this tool for many reasons, including the fact that it will train your mind to write more consistently and efficiently in the future. By tracking your progress over time, you can examine where you are succeeding and failing. Consistency is key, when creating content and blogging in general. You can use ilys to improve in this area, thus putting writer\u2019s block behind you once and for all. You can now focus on creating great content for your target audience.  7 Content Creation Services 1.

Problogger Job Board Many of the top freelance writers in the world spend their time combing the Problogger Job Board. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that a variety of companies and individual bloggers post high quality jobs here. The Problogger Job Board puts your ad in front of thousands of writers, all for a small fee of $50 for 30 days. Through the first couple weeks of April 2016, almost 50 jobs have been posted on the site. Here are some tips for finding the best freelancers through this method: Create a clear and descriptive title.Share all of the necessary information in the job description, including the exact responsibilities.Don\u2019t be afraid to request detailed information, such as a resume, past samples and pay rate requirements.Here is an example of a well crafted job post:  It's straightforward and it requests all of the necessary information that the company needs to make a hiring decision. I particularly enjoy the \u201cHow to apply\u201d section. For example, the part that says \u201cwe are NOT looking for part-time writers,\" makes it clear that the hiring party is only interested in full-time writers, thus weeding out everyone else. Sure, you have to pay to use the Problogger Job Board, but you won\u2019t be disappointed with the number or quality of the responses. 5. Content Boxed I personally know of many companies that get into the habit of outsourcing content production, just to slip at some point in the future. They are on board with the idea, but soon go back to their old ways. Content Boxed is a service that protects against this. Here is how it works. Get started by choosing from one of three packages. The two most affordable include:  While there is another option for $675 that includes 10 posts per month, one of these two packages is the best place to start. Once you subscribe, Content Boxed will provide you with the appropriate number of posts on a monthly basis. You can \u201cset it and forget it,\u201d meaning that you will always have the fresh content that you need for your blog ready to share in social networks. The subscription model is just one of the many benefits. Another one worth noting is that each post is a minimum of 1,000 words. This ensures that you never get stuck with short, meaningless posts that provide no value to your readers while hindering your search engine rankings. If you like the idea of receiving high quality, affordable blog posts on a schedule, Content Boxed can be your savior. 6. Freelancer Here is what Freelancer has to say about its service: Millions of small businesses use Freelancer to turn their ideas into reality. The service is not solely for connecting companies with writers, but it is a big part of the Freelancer platform. Here are a couple of statistics that show the power of Freelancer: 18,816,901 registered users8,735,981 total jobs postedWith the Freelancer platform, you gain access to a large workforce of writers. As with other, similar services, some writers will suit your needs, while others will not. The first step is providing information about your job:  From here, you have the opportunity to set a budget and choose from optional services, such as \u201cfeatured\u201d or \u201curgent.\u201d Freelancer often takes a back seat to other similar services, including Upwork, but the company has worked hard to change its reputation to one that connects quality freelancers with companies and individuals. 7. Guru The writing category on Guru is robust, to say the least. There are more than 150,000 jobs in the general writing category alone. This means one thing: companies know they can use the service to find quality writers. Not only is it free to post a job, but the thing I like best about Guru is its ease of use. Getting started is a simple process, as creating a job post is as easy as providing these details: Choose the type of work you need to be done, such as \u201cblog post creation.\u201dProvide in-depth details on the project.Choose a category.Add keywords.Set a budget.Set a deadline.Post the job.Since quality is important, here is a suggestion: take advantage of the option to receive better quotes.
