            "answer_text": "If he were to win the election but the Senate remains in Republican hands, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pass any legislation whatsoever, nor would he be able to get a single judge confirmed. No Republican would play ball with him. If Democrats held the House and took the Senate, and abolished the filibuster rule, he might get a liberal Justice on SCOTUS to replace a current liberal justice on SCOTUS, but the majority would almost certainly remain Republican, and thus would overturn pretty much anything he passed. But most Democrats are moderates, and they wouldn\u2019t roll over for Sanders like the Republicans did for Trump. They would pass moderate legislation and he would have to sign it. He might be able to repair the foreign alliances Trump has trashed, but since he\u2019s as hostile to trade agreements as Trump is, I dunno if that would change. Mostly he\u2019d sit in the White House and fume that he can\u2019t\u2019 make any of his agenda happen. ",

            "answer_text": "We might not yet have universal health care, because that would depend in large part on Congress, but the people of America would know that, after many years, it was their interests that were again being put first, and not those of the rich and powerful. The Trump tax cuts of 2017, which aided primarily the wealthy, would have been reversed, and the payroll tax would have been raised both to strengthen Social Security and to prepare for universal healthcare. Speaking of Social Security, all income would now be subject to being taxed for it, whether it came from honest labor or stock options. People on food stamps would no longer have to worry about having enough to eat. America would no longer have to worry about having a president it was ashamed of. ",
