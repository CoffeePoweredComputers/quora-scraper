            "answer_text": "I started writing fanfiction when I was around 14 or 15. And for years, I thought that\u2019s all I would do. Over time, I became more comfortable with writing. As that comfort level increased, so did my confidence level and I started branching off into writing original works. Now, I\u2019ve written over twenty novels. I still have the occasional fanfic itch that I like to scratch when I have time because it\u2019s fun, but most of my writing time these days are focused on writing my original works. So yes, you can start with fanfic. Use it as a way to build up your skills as a writer and play around with characters and worlds you\u2019re already familiar with. Then, when you\u2019re confident, write something original. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely! A writer writes. William Faulkner, I believe, once said, Don't be a writer, be writing. So tap away at your battered laptop keyboard, let the words take you (and your readers) to places unseen and live a life less ordinary. Back to the point. Do write. Write sequels. Fanfiction. Tell yourself you can write it better than the author who wrote the original book. What would you want the characters to do? And how would you have ended it? Read a drama and give it a proper ending. Read a mystery and make the character you dislike the culprit. Prove his guilt. Read a thriller and save the hero's best friend, even if the city dies. Read a biography and\u2026. well, you can always improve the sentence structure, right? Write fanfics for Game of thrones and don't kill everyone. Please don't. Pretty please? ;) Write fanfics for Twilight. On second thought, don't. All the best to you! Write away. ",
