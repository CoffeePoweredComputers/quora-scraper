            "answer_text": "Dear Daddy, First off thank you for instilling in me a strong love of family, forgiveness and being non judgemental. You asked me to go to spend time with your grandmother who was in her 90's and bring her Sunday dinner. I did for almost 2 years until she passed. I patiently listened to her tell me the same stories over and over never interuppting her. One Sunday I was on my way, a relative who became upset that I was going to see her, asked you how could you let your child go to feed that evil woman. You told them that's our grandmother and I forgave her for what she did. Your mother married an alcoholic and lived next door to your grandmother. Your grandmother would lock the gates to her home so none of you could get food or anything from her. I can't imagine my grandmothers doing this. I can understand the pain that caused you but you showed me love, forgiveness and lack of judgement by feeding the person who had done that to you and your siblings. You and Mama gave me 4 brothers of which I am eternally grateful. It was hard growing up as the oldest and only girl but as time went on I realized they were gifts that keep on giving. Everyone of them has shown various examples of good men because they had a strong male to guide them and lead them to manhood, you. I remember when a young woman got married and she had a child. She decided to wear white. People in your circle said it was wrong. You said, if God forgave her who were they to judge. You sang in a men's choir and would have the group over to our home for dinner. At least 2 of the men were gay. You did not treat them any differently. You never told us anything negative about their sexuality. In fact, I remember you telling some of your friends they should stop making fun of homosexuals. You instilled in us a strong love of knowledge. You went into the Navy the day you made 17 in order to help your mother who worked hard to provide for your family. You never finished high school but you were always learning something. You would read and share your new found language with us. You bought encyclopedias and taught us how to write, mathematics and science. When most people met you they thought you graduated from college. You taught there was no such thing as a stupid question. You were a champion of causes. You would see young men who needed a guiding hand and take them under your wing along with my brothers. You wrote to ask for your forty acres and a mule to the president. You wrote up papers demanding fair treatment on the job through your union representatives and not just for you but all of the men of color who were experiencing unfair treatment. You instilled in us a strong sense of fairness, that there was always room for improvement, give your very best, learn from our mistakes, a great work ethic, stand up for what you believe, and be honest. You gave us unconditional love, I know we all made mistakes and disappointed you but we always knew you would always love us no matter what. You only wanted the best for each and every one of us. You also gave us the gift of watching you and Mama. The love that you shared as a married couple set a wonderful example. All children need to see how their parents love each other. When you were dying you talked to each of us and said, \u2018 if I have ever hurt you by my words or actions, I am sorry. I only wanted to take care of you and love you.' I will never forget this. Your final gift to me was when you were in the process of dying. You were a very spiritual person and you loved God so much. I believe you were talking to God, looking upward, smiling, nodding and responding. I did not understand the words but you were happy and at peace. I said, \u201cDaddy, I love you.\u201d At that moment you looked straight at me with so much love and said, \u2018 I love you too, Baby.\u201d Then went back to communicating with God. I will cherish that moment for the rest of my life. Daddy, I believe you are in a better place with the love of your life, Mama and with many friends and family BUT you must know you left a beautiful legacy on earth which will always be loved and appreciated. Thanks so much. With so much love, Your Pudding (Amentria) ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Dad, It\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been 22 years since you left. I am so glad we were able to meet up three months before that. The chance we then had \u2014 and took full advantage of \u2014 to bond, to express our feelings for each other \u2014 comforts me to this day. I see so much of you in myself \u2014 more even as I close in on your \u2018closing\u2019 age (78), as a dialysis patient, as you were for the last five years here. I interact with my caregivers there (so young, in the 20s and 30s) as you would have \u2014 generously, patiently, curious about their lives. As you did, I\u2019ve mellowed with age! (I remember you teaching me The Serenity Prayer when I was still a teen. In today\u2019s crazy world, things that I cannot change way outweigh the ones I can, and I\u2019m fortunate to be able to tell the difference often enough to stay (barely) sane,) Much as I didn\u2019t much seek your counsel over the years, I often feel I could use it now. As mom\u2019s dad used to say, quoting an old Dutch (he thought it was PA Dutch) proverb: \u201cWe grow too soon old and too late smart.\u201d And the older we get the more we see the truth in that, right? There are many things we could never have seen eye-to-eye on, thanks to the fact our generations, truly era-bridging ones, grew up with such different experiences: When we moved to Mt. Sterling KY in the late 1940s, I remember you and mom trying to explain why people with dark skins \u2018had\u2019 to live in a poor-looking area way outside town. Your explanation was, at best, inadequate, because, in those days, there was no acceptable explanation for that \u2014 and we were decades away from nominal integration of the two races that have, truly, grown up side-by-side in this country since the 1600s. (Yes, really: The people you came from have long ignored the fact that is, in fact, so.) And now, low and behold, I am married to what we now call a \u2018woman of color\u2019. If you had a grave, I\u2019m sure that fact would make you roll in it. (BTW, I am following your excellent example and willing my body to science \u2014 in my case, to the University of Virginia. Maybe in accepting it they\u2019ll clear my the bill I\u2019ve been accumulating for unaffordable dialysis treatments!) Since our family first had a presence in this state in the 1600\u2019s, I reckon this is a good place for me to end up. Full circle, and all that. A country music called Diamond Rio had a hit a few years back called \u2018One More Day,\u2019 expressing \u2014 as you\u2019d expect, a wish for one more day with someone. I\u2019d like that with you. But, as the song says, \u201cI know what that would do: leave me wishing still for one more day with you.\u201d Another day fishing, or on a road trip like that one we took through southern Kentucky in the mid-\u201890s. The best, most peaceful few days we ever spent together. I am so thankful for memories of times like that with you. It\u2019s great to have those memories. I do wish, though, that we\u2019d had time to make more. I love you. Doug ",
