            "answer_text": "If you need to reword article fast but you have no idea how to do that, first of all, do not panic. Paraphrasing isn\u2019t that hard if you know in what sequence it should be done. Being aware of the most effective paraphrasing strategies is your key to a well-written and successful article. If your text is 700-words long, the time spent on its rewording depends on how fast you type or write and whether you understand your topic clearly. For someone, it may take the whole day, others will need more time to finish paraphrasing the article.  If you\u2019re having troubles with rewording your article, read the following guidelines below to fasten your writing process: Read the original abstract which you want to paraphrase once again, look at any unknown words until you fully understand their meaning and what the author meant in the passage that you\u2019ve used.Hide the original text and try not to look at it, rewrite the author\u2019s idea in your own words (imagine that you\u2019re explaining it to your classmates or teacher).Now, compare your paraphrased text with the original source; while you\u2019re comparing those two, think about whether you\u2019ve accurately expressed the author\u2019s ideas in a new manner if it\u2019s unique to your writing style and whether you\u2019ve simply changed the words in the author\u2019s sentence or tried to replicate him.And the last but the most important one: put a citation with the author\u2019s name, the year and the paragraph or page number that directly follows your paraphrase.
