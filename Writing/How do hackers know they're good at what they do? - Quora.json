            "answer_text": "It\u2019s simple. The time you\u2019ve breached a system without leaving any footprint. Hacking requires a lot of skills and the act itself is exciting. The marvelous accomplishments of these hackers were delineated by Charles Arthur on his article \u201cHow computer hackers do what they do ... and why\u201d on the The Guardian saying: The initial lure of hacking \u2013 getting past the security hurdles on computers that are intended to turn the vast majority of people away \u2013 is simply the achievement. There's also the attraction of the fact that machines will do what you tell them, without argument, again and again. Once mastered, it's a delicious power. Hacking knows no national boundaries: China, the former Soviet states and eastern Europe all have produced dangerously effective hackers. The US, Germany and Britain do so as well. Some of the better hackers may be persuaded to work for governments. The suspicion is that in China the most successful are given no option. Hacking is possible because modern computer systems are so complex that there will always be a flaw to be exploited somewhere. That is where the road forks. The commercial hackers do not go to conferences, and keep out of the public eye as far as possible, which can be hard when you are making serious money from it. They are the ones who the security and police services try very hard to keep their eyes on by any means possible, including infiltration and coercion. Yes, hacking may be amazing but it is also tragic. Just like what happened to Jonathan James. The story of Jonathan James, known as \u201cc0mrade,\u201d is a tragic one. He began hacking at a young age, managing to hack into several commercial and government networks and being sent to prison for it \u2014 all while he was still a minor. What did he do? James eventually hacked into NASA\u2019s network and downloaded enough source code \u2014 assets equaling $1.7 million \u2014 to learn how the International Space Station worked. NASA had to shut down its network for three entire weeks while they investigated the breach, costing an additional $41,000. Where is he now? In 2007, several high-profile companies fell victim to numerous malicious network attacks. Even though James denied any involvement, he was suspected and investigated. In 2008, James committed suicide, believing he would be convicted of crimes he didn\u2019t commit. ",
