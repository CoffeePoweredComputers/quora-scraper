I've given many medical entrance Exams & have tried many pens But For me --- BK427 Pentel Bolly -- worked Best :) for all my entrance exams.  And another thing to be cautious about is some pointy pens may get the answersheet torn, but Pentel has a broad point. It has a very comfortable smooth-Rubber-grip as well. It's specifically designed for OMR sheet marking, Broad,and smudge free marking. Also it has been used by CBSE Board for AIPMT 2015. As i've also appeared i personally liked this pen & since then I started using pentel . I've used in both colours Black & Blue its all same Perfect For Us ,so I'd prefer u too. :)                                ",
