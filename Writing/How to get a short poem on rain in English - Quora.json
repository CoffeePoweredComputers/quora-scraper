            "answer_text": "Here is my poem on rain Raindrops Tiny droplets of water falling from the skies above. You can\u2019t hold them with streched hands nor collect them in your closed palms. You either soak in them or see them disappear into the ground. Their touch will induce a chill and makes you cringe as you get drenched by the waterfall. The tiny raindrops coalescence and impart onto you a positive charge. They wash away your inhibitions, making you bold and carefree of staring eyeballs. The falling raindrops let you experience the joys of nonchalance in an otherwise over conscience existence of yours. These little droplets of rain incite you to live by listening to your heart rather than for pleasing the eyes of all. ",
