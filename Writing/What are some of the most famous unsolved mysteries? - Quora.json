            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve written Wikipedia articles about a lot of these popular unsolved mysteries, particularly missing-persons cases, but one that I didn\u2019t write (although perhaps, based on what you\u2019re about to read, I shall expand some day) still gives me the creeps: the Oklahoma Girl Scout murders. Just from the title alone, it would make a memorable horror film, and I\u2019m surprised no film has even attempted to even loosely base itself on the case. I mean, it\u2019s got everything: innocent childhood victims who died horribly, possible supernatural involvement, racial tensions, a single suspect who was never convicted of the crime because of conflicting physical evidence, persistent rumors that he was either completely innocent or had help that was never even charged for some reason despite being known to the police, an ominous foreshadowing of the murder and some evidence the killer was Still Out There Somewhere afterwards. Our story begins in May 1977 when the staff of Camp Scott, a facility in eastern Oklahoma owned by a local Girl Scout council and used by Girl Scout troops from all over the state, came to set it up for the season. One of those nights, someone working in the kitchen came back after a bathroom break and found a note left in the bowl she was using saying something like \u201cThree girls will be murdered at the camp this summer\u201d. Naturally she freaked out; the whole thing was regarded as a tasteless prank and everyone moved on. On June 12, several busloads carrying practically every Girl Scout from the Oklahoma City area arrived for a week of camp. Most of the girls had grouped up into fours as tentmates (it was one of those camping situations where the campers sleep in tents set up over wooden platforms with beds and mattresses on which they unroll sleeping bags). Three who hadn\u2019t\u2014Lori Farmer (8), Doris Milner (9), and Michelle Guse (10)\u2014were assigned to a tent with each other as leftovers. The tent they chose was in a group of tents (like the others, with the counselors\u2019 tent in the middle) in an area just a little apart from the other ones. Their tent was, perhaps significantly, the only one in that group that couldn\u2019t be seen from the counselors\u2019 tent. The first evening at camp passed uneventfully, as excited campers gradually settled down and fell asleep looking forward to the next days of friendship and fun. But that night, some of the campers, and the counselors, in the tent group with Farmer, Milner and Guse, reported some Strange Occurrences: some tents being brightly lit hours after bedtime for short periods from an unknown source outside, and weird guttural sounds, not recognizable sounds of animals in an eastern Oklahoma forest but almost but not quite human speech either. In other areas of the camp, some people who got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom also reported later seeing small dim orange lights floating around in the woods. The next morning one of the counselors\u2019 in the three girls\u2019 tent group got up to take a shower. In order to do so she had to walk past their tent. Shortly past it, she found Guse\u2019s body, still in her sleeping bag. She had been beaten and strangled. The counselor no doubt literally screamed bloody murder, and other staff quickly found that the other two girls, still in their tent, had also been killed the same way. Forensic investigation would show that the two in the tent had been raped as well. Camp Scott shut down almost immediately. It never reopened that summer, or since. All the girls were loaded back on their buses and sent home by the end of the day. Their waiting parents were told that three girls had been killed, but not which ones, meaning they had to go to the buses to make sure their daughters were alive (Why the Girl Scout Council wasn\u2019t sued over this negligent infliction of emotional distress, I\u2019ll never know. Perhaps because the families of the victims sued (unsuccessfully) over the killings as well). Naturally it was huge news and the police investigation was intensely followed by the media. It was not a smooth story either. At first the police said they had tons of evidence and would make an arrest soon. Then they backed off that, but said there were fingerprints everywhere. Then just two, and finally one\u2014at which point the local sheriff got mad at the media for allegedly interfering with the investigation (how, he didn\u2019t explain) and said he wouldn\u2019t be holding press conferences anymore. Why the police account of the case went from so optimistic to so pessimistic is not known yet. The police did, however, bring in some specially trained search dogs from Pennsylvania who the media dubbed \u201cthe wonder dogs\u201d; supposedly they had some evidence that the dogs could use to trail suspects with. A local rumor had it, however, that some Cherokee medicine man had put a curse on the dogs. One of the three died of heat exhaustion after a day of searching\u2014understandable, perhaps, in an Oklahoma summer. But another, one day, suddenly and inexplicably walked into traffic in the middle of a busy highway, with predictable results. Other dogs brought in did not die, but did weird things like, while following trails into clearings in the woods, suddenly look directly up and start indicating that was where the trail went. Even today, some people walking their dogs on the camp site have claimed the animals start acting strangely around the spot where Guse\u2019s body was found. Later in the summer, a private security guarding the camp, gathered at the dining hall at the time, jumped up and went into the woods when one of them reported seeing what looked like a man in the distance (the whole place was officially off-limits to the public pending the investigation\u2019s outcome). When they returned, they found one of the dead girl\u2019s sneakers in a plastic bag (and not the kind used for evidence, either) along with a newspaper clipping about the case where they had been sitting. Later in the year the police finally announced they had a suspect: Gene Leroy Hart, a Cherokee originally from the area who had escaped from state prison in the late 1960s, where he was serving time for several rapes in the Oklahoma City area. He was arrested at the home of a local medicine man soon afterwards. Despite a strong belief by local law enforcement (one of the state investigators, who later got himself elected to the state senate, wrote a book about the case stating his belief that Hart, and only Hart, committed the crimes) that they had their man, he was acquitted. Many of the prosecutors believed that was because the jury was allowed to know that he would be returned to his long prison sentence no matter what the outcome of the trial, in violation of a judge\u2019s pretrial order that that not be mentioned. But it might also have been because the jury was local and believed that it was all too easy for white law enforcement to just scapegoat a Cherokee for the crime and be done with it. And the case had some problems. A military-style boot print at the scene, on one of the steps into the tent, was too large to have been left by Hart. Also, evidence at trial established that someone had tried to clean up bloodstains on the tent floor with one of the girls\u2019 bags \u2026 not really consistent with the crime of opportunity the prosecution presented the case as, a theory further confounded by Guse\u2019s body being outside the tent and still in her bag when discovered, and also raped less severely than the other two (or not raped at all \u2026 I can\u2019t remember the specifics). Was something more going on? Were more people than Hart involved? I can see a jury getting to reasonable doubt that way. (And regarding the military boot print, some people have noted that the \u201cdim orange lights\u201d reportedly observed on the night of murders are consistent with a technique taught in the Army of putting duct tape over a flashlight to make it harder to see at a distance). Shortly after being returned to prison, Hart (who by some accounts had been in his youth instructed in some ancient Cherokee technique of \u201cskin-walking\u201d, i.e., shapechanging) died in prison of a heart attack while lifting weights. He was 35. DNA tests were done on the semen samples from the case 30 years later, but the evidence had so degraded by that time as not to yield anything usable. I am still getting chills down my spine writing about this one. ",

            "answer_text": "The Circleville Letter writer     In 1976, several Circleville, Ohio residents began receiving strange letters detailing personal information about their lives. Bus driver Mary Gillespie was accused of a supposedly non-existent affair with the superintendent of schools. The writer told Mary that he/she had been observing her house and knew she had children. It was postmarked Columbus, Ohio, but had no return address. Within eight days, Mary received a similar letter. She kept the letters to herself, until her husband, Ron, received one as well. The letter stated that if Ron did not stop his wife's affair, his life would be in danger.After two weeks, the writer threatened to go public with the affair allegations, broadcasting it on TVs, CB radios, and billboards. Mary and Ron only told three people about the letters: Ron's sister, her husband Paul Freshour, and Paul's sister. Mary had some ideas about who might be sending the letters. They decided to have Paul write letters to the suspect, claiming that they know who he/she was. The plan seemed to work; the letters stopped for several weeks. That changed on August 19, 1977, however, when Ron received a phone call from the alleged writer. The call seemed to confirm Ron's suspicions on the identity of the writer. He grabbed his gun and then left in his pickup truck, even though the writer claimed to be watching the truck. A few minutes later, Ron was found dead in his pickup truck, crashed into a tree. Investigators later learned that Ron had fired at least one shot from his gun before crashing. Sheriff Dwight Radcliffe questioned and eliminated at least one suspect in the case. He then ruled Ron's death an accident, claiming that he had lost control and crashed while driving drunk.However, several residents soon received letters stating that Sheriff Radcliffe had been involved in a cover-up. According to Paul, Sheriff Radcliffe initially agreed that the death was a result of foul play. However, he allegedly changed his mind when the suspect passed a polygraph test. Ron's blood alcohol level was .16, which was twice the legal limit. However, many of Ron's friends and family were surprised by this; they did not think that he was a heavy drinker.Mary and the superintendent later acknowledged a relationship, although they claim that it did not start until after the letters were sent. In February of 1983, Mary was harassed along her bus route; the letter writer apparently began placing threatening signs next to the road. One day, Mary had enough and decided to go and rip the sign down. When she did, she discovered a booby trap designed to kill her. The trap had a box which contained a small pistol; if Mary had pulled the sign off a certain way, the gun would have fired.An amateurish attempt was made to rub off the serial number on the gun. When lab tests were able to raise the number, it was determined that the gun had belonged to Paul Freshour, who had recently separated from Ron's sister. Paul, however, claimed that the gun had been stolen. On February 25, 1983, Sheriff Radcliffe asked Paul to meet with him and take a handwriting test. He asked Paul to try and copy the handwriting from the letters. Sheriff Radcliffe also had him write the letters while repeating them verbally.After the test, Paul took Sheriff Radcliffe to his garage and showed him where he kept his gun. Afterwards, the two returned to the courthouse, where Paul was arrested and charged with attempted murder. On October 24, 1983, he went on trial for the attempted murder of Mary Gillespie. Although he was never charged with writing the threatening letters, they became a crucial part of the evidence against him. A handwriting expert testified that Paul was the letter writer. Mary also testified that she believed that he was the writer after his wife visited her with the same suspicion. Paul's boss also testified that he was not at work on the day that the booby trap was found.Paul had an alibi for most of the day; however, he never took the stand in his defense. Proclaiming his innocence, he was convicted and was given a seven to twenty-four year sentence. While there, he himself received letters from the writer, determined to keep him there. Others still received letters, postmarked from Columbus, even though he was in prison in Lima. Even though he was in solitary confinement, letters kept arriving.In December 1990, Paul became eligible for parole. He was denied parole due to the letters, even though there was no way that he could be sending them. In May 1994, Paul was finally paroled; he continues to maintain his innocence. However, the author of the letters has never been revealed.Journalist Martin Yant has investigated the story and found another possible suspect that could be the writer. He also discovered that twenty minutes before Mary found the booby trap, another bus driver on Mary's route had seen a suspicious man standing next to a yellow El Camino. The man was at the same spot where the trap would later be found. Yant found that the possible suspect's brother owned the same type of car. The description does not match Paul and he had a solid alibi at this specific time. While Unsolved Mysteries was filming this story, they received a postcard, apparently from the letter writer. It read \"Forget Circleville Ohio: Do Nothing to Hurt Sheriff Radcliff: If You Come to Ohio You El Sickos Will Pay: The Circleville Writer:\" The original airdate for this episode is November 11, 1994. Sheriff Dwight Radcliffe and Mary Gillespie declined to be interviewed for the story. Again. the Circleville Writer did write a postcard to the Unsolved Mysteries P.O. Box after he/she was broadcast. Their identity remains unrevealed.Since this case has been broadcast, however, Paul Freshour, who maintained a blog for several years, passed away in 2012, never knowing the identity of the Circleville Writer.However, recent information uncovered by Martin Yant and others has suggested that there were at least three letter writers involved in the case (none of whom were Paul). One was believed to be the son of the superintendent (whom Mary had an affair with). The second was believed to be a co-worker who was infatuated with Mary. The third was believed to be Paul's ex-wife (Ron Gillespie's sister). It is believed that the ex-wife's boyfriend was the man seen next to the El Camino on the day that the booby trap was discovered. One of her relatives had owned that type of car at the time. Despite the evidence, the police still maintain that Paul was the Circleville Writer.This case was eventually parodied in the series \"Drunk History\" along with the D.B. Cooper and Agatha Christie cases. However, the comedians in the case speculated that Mary Gillespie might have been behind the letters, getting the stories about her neighbors from the kids on her bus route and stealing Paul's gun to use in an attempt on her life to throw off investigators. As yet, there has been no known follow-up on this theory. circlevilleletters The Mysterious Circleville Letter Writer - Unsolved Mysteries (all credit for articles & photographs to Unsolvedmysteries.Wiki.com - Circleville Writer) ",
