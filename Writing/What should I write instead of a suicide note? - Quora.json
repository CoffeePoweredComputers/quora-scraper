            "answer_text": "Instead of writing a suicide note, you should write a novel. Your novel can be based on your life, if you'd like. If you write about your own life, then you can choose to either include or exclude any or all of the details that have made you consider writing a suicide note. You can tell your own story however you like except for one rule: if you decide to make your 'you' character commit suicide in the novel, then that has to be where the book ends \u2014 regardless of how good of an ending that would make. Don't write any more plot beyond the death of your 'you' character in a story about your own life\u2026that would be poor storytelling. If you want to write about your own life but feel you'd prefer to draft a better conclusion for yourself, then by all means get creative and do that! Finish your story with a proper conclusion that allows 'you' to imagine a future that takes your story wherever you'd like. If you would prefer not to write about your own life, then you have lots and lots of alternatives. You can write a novel that's completely fictional, for example. Or you can write a nonfiction book. You can write a comic book or a graphic novel, if that suits you best! You can write pretty much anything your heart desires; that's one of the greatest things about writing. But no matter what you choose to write, I guarantee it'll be more satisfying, interesting, enjoyable, and fulfilling to complete than a suicide note. ",
