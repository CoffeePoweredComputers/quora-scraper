            "answer_text": "Remember that acrostics don\u2019t have to use the first letter of each line, but can simply have the letter you want somewhere in the line. You can then Boldface or otherwise highlight the key letter. You should be able to write virtually anything you need to with that opening, I should think. You can try five lines, with the intention of finding one letter that you need - C, H , &c - on each line somewhere. Good luck! ",
