            "answer_text": "Yes, three dots, or rather an ellipsis (which is actually a single character), is often used to indicate that a sentence is not finished by the speaker, for example: \u201cI\u2019m not going to\u2026\u201d he said, but suddenly he realized that he had no choice and had to do it regardless. Note that an m-dash (\u2014) can also indicate an unfinished sentence, but I prefer to use the m-dash to show that the speaker did not finish the sentence because he was interrupted by someone else.
