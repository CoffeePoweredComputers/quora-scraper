            "answer_text": "Very unpopular opinion ahead (seeing as Hunter x Hunter is sooo highly rated by everybody), but here goes nothing. I do really wish I could have liked it. I got about 85\u201390 episodes in (about 10\u201315 episodes into the chimera ant arc) and I just could never come around to it. The hunter exam arc was fun, and I enjoyed Greed Island, but everything else\u2026 I donno. I see lots of people say there isn\u2019t much power creep, but when I was watching, I couldn\u2019t help but think how ridiculous all the power creep really was haha. This is most notable with the phantom troupe, and the power creep that follows after them in the story. I was very annoyed with the one guy singlehandedly crushing the Mafia Shadowbeasts (seriously wtf was even the point of those guys). It just made the troupe feel very cheap and lame to me. I prefer to see \u201cgood guys\u201d at least kind of be able to stand up to bad guys, otherwise it just makes the bad guys (and the good guys) look needlessly weak when everything\u2019s said and done. For what it\u2019s worth, as a Naruto fan, the fight that annoyed me the most by far in the series was Madara vs the 5 kage for pretty much the same reasons. I\u2019m actually not a huge fan of the Pain arc either, again for the same reasons (it gets better when Naruto shows up, but man are the previous however many episodes terribly boring and annoying). Anyways, we later find out more about stronger nen abilities and infinitely stronger hunters. Why tf is this super rich man hiring no-name shitty hunters (honestly, Kurapika is included, because how could he have known of Kurapika\u2019s power, he got lucky). The power creep simply got to be wayyy too much for me, and I found that watching HxH actually made me mad, and I couldn\u2019t continue it. The bad guys (or ants, whatever) were just wayyy too strong for pretty much no reason, and I don\u2019t see any reason some 12 year old boys can come save the day (since I\u2019ve read stuff from the future, I know they do get strong enough to fight the ants, but that\u2019s kinda exactly what I\u2019m talking about). Maybe it gets better, but from what I\u2019ve read of what was still to come, it just all sounds too ridiculously painful for me to watch, and I don\u2019t really regret not continuing. I\u2019m okay with dark anime, but I just classify this as annoying. I know I\u2019m the only one in the world who doesn\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ve come to terms with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Im gonna assume you are referring to the 2011 series and not the 1999 series. Hunter x Hunter is really great. If you like anime like Naruto or Fairy tail you will love Hunter x Hunter. If you hate anime like Naruto or Fairy tail you will probably still love Hunter x Hunter. Hunter x Hunter does a lot of things right that most shonen anime do wrong. Hunter x hunter has no filler episodes minus 2 recap episodes. Hunter x hunter is likable and well written characters. Hxh doesnt have the ridiculous power creep most shonen anime have. The main characters gon and killua arent the most important or powerful people in the world which makes their adventures more fun and exciting. Gon is a somewhat typical anime protagonist but killua is a very interesting and unique character. Almost all the other major characters are fun and interesting as well. The dub hs also veru good as well if you prefer it. The only major problem with the show is that the last season was in 2014 and there is no reason to think a new one will be out anytime soon. ",
