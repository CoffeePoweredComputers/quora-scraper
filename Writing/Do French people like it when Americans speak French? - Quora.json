            "answer_text": "Yes, it is nice when an American makes an effort. I will assist if they need it. And if they need to revert to English, no big deal. I have an erstwhile colleague who speaks very good French, and does so with facility, but he was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, and he has the most astounding California accent in French that I have ever heard. If I let myself dwell on this, it can be distracting\u2026 Nevertheless, if he wanted to speak French, I was happy to oblige. It showed that he had made an effort to learn the language, and it showed that he cared enough to try to learn something about the culture and the people. Bravo for him. Every language we learn opens a door. ",

My husband, whose French is quite faulty (sometimes hilariously so), and who speaks it with a very broad midwestern American accent, has also gotten appreciative reactions from French people. That\u2019s natural, I think. As an ER nurse, I often care for patients who don\u2019t speak English. When they\u2019re discharged, many of them manage an English \u201cThank you,\u201d often heavily accented but intelligible. I always appreciate that effort, however limited, to communicate with me in my own language. I think that\u2019s probably a universal feeling, don\u2019t you? ",
