            "answer_text": "I recently interviewed Anne Fleshman, Director of Marketing, Autopilot and Devin Bramhall, former Director of Content, Help Scout for HERstory, a newsletter that helps women in tech grow their careers in just 5 minutes per week. They both had some great tips for negotiating a higher salary! Anne Fleshman negotiated a 30% higher salary when switching jobs. \u201cAny smart hire should know what they\u2019re worth and be straightforward about what will make them happy. The last thing you want is to be in a position where you are unhappy with your pay. That\u2019s a distraction from your work that will foster more resentment over time,\u201d she argues.  So how did she do it? \u201cI prepared. I wrote a list of transferable skills and interpersonal qualities I\u2019d bring to the table. I researched market data on the average compensation for my level of experience in my role, industry, and location. I considered other parts of the compensation package beyond my base salary, like health care, a bonus plan, stock options, and a flexible work schedule. I understood my BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. In other words, I knew my walk-away point. I had a back-up plan if the hiring manager didn\u2019t play ball.\u201d  \u201cYou have the most negotiating power after you\u2019ve received a written offer. At this point, you know they want you, and you\u2019ve got a small window of time to accept or deny. While it\u2019s tempting to celebrate and just say \u2018yes\u2019, negotiating your salary during the initial offer is much easier than having the conversation after you\u2019ve started. I recommend a verbal conversation with the hiring manager rather than email. Make your ask as clear as possible. Don\u2019t ramble, lie, or lose your cool. Be open minded and see what happens. You\u2019ll never know if you don\u2019t ask.\u201d To learn about how Anne broke into leadership and combats sexism as a woman in tech, read HERstory. Devin Bramhall made similar arguments: \u201cI always go into a salary or raise conversation knowing what I want, and I say no to a job when they lowball me. Typically that leads to them coming back to the table with a middle ground that I negotiate up with things like options, bonuses, and services (like insurance, travel expenses, etc.).\u201d  \u201cI talk about accomplishments that can be pointed to, quantifiable professional development, numbers improved, etc. Basically, I never feel or want anything\u2014I have a practical discussion that is centered around tangible accomplishments, growth, and corresponding role and compensation, both of which have industry standard minimums you can use as a baseline.\u201d To learn about how Devin broke into leadership and what she would do differently if she could go back in time, read HERstory.

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe number 1 rule in any negotiation is don't take yourself hostage. People do this to themselves all the time by being desperate for \u201cyes\u201d or afraid of \u201cno,\u201d so they don't ask for what they really want. Instead, they ask for what they can realistically get. I've heard many people say, \u201cWell, that's a non-starter, so we won't even bring it up.\"\" \u2015 Christopher Voss Arm Yourself with Preparation To be ready for the negotiation, you must do some work and obtain the necessary information. Criteria may include the following: Understand the other person\u2019s needs and wantsIdentify the parties involved and the decision-maker(s)Have a clear comprehension of your main interests. Examples include:Price pointSalaryVacation timeDefine your timeline - when would you like to start the job or have the promotionKnow your best alternativesDetermine your threshold - this is the minimum requirement(s)In any negotiation, the first rule to apply is this: Never give the other party a baseline. When asked about your expectations, you can simply answer with the following: \u201cI\u2019m currently looking at multiple opportunities and I can\u2019t give you a number. But I\u2019m interested in seeing what you have to offer. Thank you very much.\u201d This will allow them to give you a starting point. However, if their initial proposal is not close to what you want, you can be creative and generate other possibilities. For example, if job salary is not negotiable, you can perhaps discuss having more paid-time-off (PTO) instead. Another potential option may be increasing work performance (two or three) reviews per year. That way you can have more chances to ask for raises and promotions.  During the process, it\u2019s imperative to only discuss one item (salary, PTO, health benefits, etc.) at a time. If the offer doesn\u2019t meet your key needs, you must be willing to walk away. This simply means it\u2019s not a good fit. You can decline it knowing you have other opportunities which are more aligned with what you\u2019re looking for. Don\u2019t ever settle. Go for \u201cNo\u201d After given an offer, you should first show appreciation and ask if it\u2019s negotiable. You never want to accept the initial offer. That\u2019s because it shows personal disempowerment. Rather, you want to demonstrate you\u2019re someone who wants more out of life and goes after your desires. This is especially critical if you\u2019re in sales. To handle the situation professionally, you can say something like this: \u201cHey [name], I appreciate the consideration and offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and the company. I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I\u2019m looking at. I will get back to you shortly. As I\u2019m doing that, it would be helpful to know if there\u2019s any flexibility in the base? I look forward to your response.\u201d They will most likely do one of two things. 1. They\u2019ll say their offer is reasonable but will ask what you had in mind. Or 2. They would like to have a conversation. Regardless of the response, you can now start the negotiation process. The following works quite well. \u201cHey [name], I appreciate the consideration and offer. I\u2019m very excited about the team, product, and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. Based on other opportunities I\u2019m looking at, I feel X (and X is their offer plus 15%) is a fair number for what I can bring to this role. If you can match that, I\u2019m ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. I look forward to your response.\u201d Your counter offer may be more depending on the position level (chief officer, vice president, etc.). This shows two important things: You already have an offer that\u2019s better than theirs.They can see the deal being complete as soon as they give you your asking amount.In addition, getting a \u201cno\u201d is a great sign in a negotiation. This means you\u2019re pushing the envelope. Otherwise, you\u2019re not getting the best possible deal.  For example, if a hiring manager has $120,000 in his budget for your salary and you asked for $90,000, he would gladly agree to that. But if you had asked for $130,000, he would have said \u201cno\u201d because it was out of his allowance range. You can do this through email, over the phone or in person. The ladder two options will be more effective since most people find this type of conversations uncomfortable. Hence, you can use that to your advantage by leveraging your emotions. You can express your excitement if they can make \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cthat\u201d happen. Let them already envision you as a valuable member of the company. The other party wants the negotiation to end by making a deal. To avoid disrespect and resentment after the deal, don\u2019t exceed more than two counter offers. Maximize Your Earning No matter what position you hold in an organization, you are replaceable. Your needs and wants aren\u2019t the company\u2019s highest priority. Rather it\u2019s to maximize profit and its shareholders\u2019 happiness. To achieve that, your employer makes certain to get the most out of you. Therefore, it\u2019s in your best interest to do the same in return. Even if you\u2019re satisfied with your current role, you should try to increase your income through negotiation. To gauge their commitment to you, say something like this: \u201cI\u2019m really happy the team is performing well. I\u2019ve been passively looking at other opportunities and people also have reached out. There are other openings which are monetarily beneficial for me outside the company. I was wondering what\u2019s going to be in the budget. Do you think there\u2019s a possibility for me to progress here?\u201d Another option is this: \u201cI like working here. But I want to feel as I\u2019m moving forward in my career. I want to make sure I\u2019m getting as much as I\u2019m putting in. What can you offer me?\u201d  Being loyal is good, but don\u2019t underestimate your own true worth in the workforce. Therefore, always be open to other job opportunities. By simply exploring those options will give you more leverage in your negotiations with your current employer. It also gives you the reassurance of your true value given your talented skill set. This reinforces the abundance mindset that there are numerous choices for you outside of your existing job. Closing Thoughts Most things in life are negotiable. Even though they might not be common practice, you can still ask for it. An example would be requesting the waiter at the restaurant for free dessert in a trade with a boosted tip.  By exposing yourself more to daily situations where you can practice your negotiation skills, you\u2019ll be more comfortable during the necessary times such as asking for a raise or promotion. Make it a constant practice to implement your negotiations skills. I hope this helps. I am on a mission to help 1,000,000 people, but I can't do that without your help.
