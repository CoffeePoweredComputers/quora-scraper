The answer: One^^^^^doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s^^^^^five^^^^^circumflex^^^^^marks. Exception: This does not apply to Japanese. For example: \u3053\u306e\u6642\u8a08\u3092\u4e00\u4e07\u5186\u3067\u8cb7\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002 kono tokei o ichi man en de kaimasita \u201cI bought this watch for 10,000 yen.\u201d You see? No spaces, hence no place for circumflex marks! By the way, 10,000 is a large number, so there is no objection on stylistic grounds in this case. Theological question: Can God put infinitely many circumflex marks after each word in a sentence? Hypothetical practical question: If God can put infinitely many circumflex marks after each word in a sentence and elects to do so, can one get through the entire sentence before lunch? Real-life question: What are you talking about? ",

            "answer_text": "That.. would.. look.. like.. this. It would also be wrong. There is no grammatically correct reason for one to do that, in English. (I cannot speak for what practices may occur in other languages.) If one is writing informally, not for any academic or business purpose, and wished to indicate a person speaking slowly, with pauses between each word, then one might choose to use two periods after each word. The standard practice, still informal but slightly more acceptable, for this kind of indication would be to use three periods after each word, a form of punctuation known as an \u2018ellipsis.\u2019 There are various schools of thought as to exactly how to compose an ellipsis. Here are some examples: Ellipsis . . .Ellipsis. . .Ellipsis \u2026Ellipsis\u2026 For the sake of taking up a tiny bit less space, I prefer the last one. Using that example, the original sentence of this answer would look like: That\u2026 would\u2026 look\u2026 like\u2026 this. ",
