The closest is, \u201cEvery picture tells a story\u201d, which is nowhere near to this. It must lose something in translation because I can make no sense of it in English. Why is it two pictures, why not one or three? What type of question? If I wanted to make it sound more idiomatic I would rephrase it as something like: Every two pictures gives rise to a single question. ",
