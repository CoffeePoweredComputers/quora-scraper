Although I am starting to suspect it might be ghost-written\u2026\u2026 Really I suppose it depends on the person - someone could have achieved more at the age of 11 than I have in my mid 40s. And even if their autobiography is ghost-written, it would still be a more interesting story than my life story would be. So I think providing they have done something, no - I don\u2019t think you are too young. I mean - maybe you graduate pre-school first, but after that\u2026.. ",

            "answer_text": "If you want the public to read your autobiography, you probably have to get famous first. There are only a few exceptions (like Frank McCourt). However, it is never too early to start work. In fact, if you don\u2019t write stuff down when you\u2019re young, you will forget a lot of it as you grow older. My advice is not to worry about the overall structure at first (if only because, like David Copperfield, you can\u2019t even be sure who the real hero of the story is going to turn out to be) but to record what happens and what you remember and what you think. Don\u2019t throw it away when later you reread it and it embarrasses you. The time will come when you see that, like a sculptor\u2019s block of granite, it has a shape hidden inside. ",
