            "answer_text": "I\u2019m with you. I consider myself left handed as that\u2019s the hand I write with. I throw, but not well, with my right, probably because that\u2019s how I was shown and I bat (baseball) right handed. I\u2019m a left handed tennis player. My left eye is dominant. I shoot basketball left handed and fenced left handed. Most scissors are made to use right handed, so they are easier to use that way. Table utensils: fork/spoon in left and knife in right. I play piano with both hands and the right usually has the more complex parts to play. I imagine most of us could learn to use the other hand if we had to, but writing would take a lot of practice. I have tried and it\u2019s like going back to kindergarten. ",
