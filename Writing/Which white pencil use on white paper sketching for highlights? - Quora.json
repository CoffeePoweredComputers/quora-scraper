            "answer_text": "My personal favorite is the Caran D\u2019ache Luminance white. It\u2019s a very opaque white. In addition, the luminance pencils are lightfast and layer really well (I can get over 20 layers with the Luminance pencils). I buy them single-stock because these pencils are pricey. I also like the Derwent drawing pencils (chinese white). It\u2019s another pencil that sticks on top of pencil layers. Another method for getting a strong highlight is to use Brush and Pencil products, which were designed specifically for use with colored pencil. You can mix Titanium White (a very opaque white) with the Touch-Up Texture. Touch-Up texture is used to add tooth to your paper so you can add more layers. By mixing it with the titanium white, you get a nice bright white highlight that you can layer over with pencil if you need to. Alternatively, you can use a white gel-pen or white acrylic paint, but I don\u2019t know if they are archival, or if they would fade or flake-off. I would recommend testing them on a scrap piece of paper before using them on a finished project. ",

            "answer_text": "I really like pencil. I've done over three hundred dogs including a few cats. I usually erase down to the paper for the white highlights. Sometimes I whittle an eraser to a narrow shape for the sharpest highlights. I also use adjustable erasers that are like a mechanical pencil. I have used white Conte Crayon in a very few drawings. Over the years these begin to look chalky. The texture of the highlights seem to stand out from the rest of the drawing, at least to my eye. Sometimes I draw on a primed birch plywood panel. These drawing are fairly large like 30\" x 40\" inches,(sorry Quora readers who don't live in the past - I live in the south.) The primer isn't very forgiving erasure wise. The graphite tends to turn to clay and smear. When this happens I paint the highlights on using acrylic paint and a fine brush. So I guess my answer is Conte Crayon, but I don't like it. ",
