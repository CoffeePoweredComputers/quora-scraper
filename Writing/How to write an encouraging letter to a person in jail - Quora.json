            "answer_text": "Be very positive and upbeat. Don\u2019t ask questions about prison or prison life. Remember, they\u2019re going through it and living that each day. Talk about things that make people happy, be complimentary and just converse as if you were meeting outside. These people live a very insulated and regimented life of sameness. They are taught to forget the outside and everyone out there. Also, that they will be forgotten and are worthless. If you can show genuine concern and maybe through your words, bring life on the outside to them, you\u2019d do a great service and touch a life in a positive way. Similar to what a good book can do. It temporarily gives the inmate another world to live in and look at. When I write to women in jail/prison I NEVER write anything sexual. They\u2019ve been violated and humiliated enough and don\u2019t need to read that. Be romantic, sweet, kind. The qualities that women on the outside appreciate in a man. Treat them with respect and as a gentleman. If your religious, and you feel they may benefit, talk about that a bit but don\u2019t be forceful. Always remember, you\u2019re writing to ease their suffering and give them encouragement and strength to endure that situation. Have love in your heart and you\u2019ll make a difference in their lives. :) ",

            "answer_text": "WRITING TO PRISONERS I must caution you. There can be complications. Never send your prison pal money. They may request sexy photos or ask for 'dirty' talk. Once your new pal gets out of prison, you will be one of the few persons he/she knows and you may find a guest at your door. Your pal may send his/her friends to your home when they get out. Be very careful and examine 'why' you want to correspond with inmates. They do not want to play a game of mail chess with you... trust me... their lives are very different, their code of conduct is very different, and their moral compass most likely will not match yours. I have worked in the criminal court system for many years. I speak from experience. Writing to prisoners may seem exciting, they\u2019re bad boys, but it\u2019s not. Think about the victims of these people. What if your mother was a victim. Would she want you writing to her rapist? Just don\u2019t. ",
