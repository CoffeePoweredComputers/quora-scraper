            "answer_text": "I have also been on a search for colored gel pens that work well on black paper. I haven't tested out much, but there are a few I've discovered that look great on black. The colorful pens are at the end. Uni-ball Signo Broad White - this is my go-to white pen, as the ink is very opaque on black paper. As the name suggests, the line weight is a bit thickerGelly Roll 08 White - this is the pen I used before I discovered the Uni-ball Signo. The 08 is the roller size, and that equate to a medium point. There are two other sizes as well \u2014 05 and 10. The white is slightly translucent, but still pops on black.Uni-ball Gel Impact Gold/Silver - these are great metallic pens. My silver one works incredibly well, and the color and shine pops on the page. The silver leans more towards white. I use this one as my main silver pen. My gold on the other hand looks diluted. It doesn't have as crisp a line quality compared to its silver counterpart. The gold leans more towards yellow.Gelly Roll Gold Shadow - colored pens with gold flecks. There is a silver version, too. I might have the black-gold one, so I can't comment on how the colored ones show on black paper, but I do like the look of the gold. The line weight is about as thick as the Uni-ball Signo Broad. It's a completely opaque dull gold. I use this as my primary gold pen.Pentel Sunburst Silver - my silver pen won't write for the life of me, but I'm putting on here because the silver is stunning. The ink is very opaque, and the color is exactly what you'd expect. Stay away from its gold brother. The gold is the complete opposite; it's an utter disappointment.Now for the actual colors: Gelly Roll Moonlight - the Moonlight line is only available in 10 colors, but the ink is matte and opaque on black paper. Half of the colors are fluorescent. This also works under blacklight!Gelly Roll Souffle - like a souffle, the writing is raised. These also come in 10 colors, but they are all pastel. They are opaque and great if you need light colors.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been seeking an answer to this question myself. I use silver or white with good results\u2026but\u2026there are times when I want to add a bit of color to a drawing or emphasis on a special word. What a coincidence that your query should appear just at the exact time I am trying many gel pens to see if one works. Sadly, most of the colors seem to lose their vibrancy as the ink dries and many times it seems as if the paper has absorbed it, leaving only a faint impression on the page. Frustrating as all get out! (#smile) I\u2019ll let you know when/if I am successful in my quest\u2014for now, I\u2019ll leave you with silver or white\u2014the silver works well, but I am more satisfied with the result when I use the white.
