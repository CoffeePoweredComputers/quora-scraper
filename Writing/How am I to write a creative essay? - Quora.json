            "answer_text": "On behalf of this question, there are 7 skills with the help you can improve your essay Writing please read till the End. Writing an essay can be challenging, especially when you have multiple assignments at the same time. It is hard to manage all the assignments that you receive at the university. But some tricks can make the whole process easier. Here we present some essay writing skills which helps you to get good grades. 1. Before You Start Writing An Essay, It Is Essential To Know What You Want To Say. First of all, pick a topic and plan the essay before you start writing it. Start your first line with the catchy exciting topic. One of the most crucial Essay writing skill is not to use unnecessary words. Academic essay writing is a style that one can learn to write once they know the basics of writing essays. An academic essay should provide a reliable, debatable thesis that is then supported by relevant evidence \u2013 whether from other sources or one\u2019s research. Most research guidelines follow a standard set. Memorizing some basic principles for academic essay writing will give you valuable, inspiring papers, even if you are under lack of time. 2. Understand Your Readers While writing your academic essay, always keep your main argument in mind. Try to make your essay audience-friendly. Also, pay full attention to the tone and style you use; Not only to come appropriately for your audience, but also develop flexibility in your writing to communicate with a variety of audiences successfully. 3. Original Content Original content means that the material was never said before i.e., content that was never published online. Everyone knows this is hard, but it\u2019ll be right for you, and it is also a good practice. Do your research and make your content. Do not follow the way of others or don\u2019t try to write from the web. Try to make all the content by yourself without taking help from the internet. 4. Acquire A Solid Understanding Of Basic Grammar, Style, And Punctuation. Without the use of proper grammar, the essay is meaningless cause a little comma or full stop can change the meaning of the whole sentence. So, please be careful with the punctuations. Don\u2019t write too long, complex sentences your sentence shouldn\u2019t leave your reader. They need a high-stop sign with constant shallow breaths. Nor should they gasp long, at the end of any sentence. 5. Use The Right Vocabulary. Find Out Exactly What The Words You Are Using. The most valuable part of the essay is the vocabulary. Vocabulary means the body of words used in a particular language. Don\u2019t repeat the words again and again in the paragraph. Read your essay again and again and make changes where you are repeated words and try to bring the new words in life. Your main argument should be obvious. Don\u2019t leave the topic without explaining it. 6. Last But Not Least Essay Writing Skill; Writing A Conclusion In Conclusion, try not to make too much longer but must include a brief summary of the paper\u2019s main points containing all your primary thoughts. Don\u2019t copy and paste your thesis itself. The conclusion presents the entire essence of the essay. Your conclusion of the paper should remind the reader of the meaning that was contained throughout the essay. 7. Expert help Don\u2019t get stressed if you can\u2019t do it by yourself just hire experts because they have huge knowledge about to create effective essays. like Calltutors, and Coursementor. ",

Mix some diverse facts together to make something more interesting than the individual parts. Like a man pummeling his ketchup bottle to get the red stuff flowing, I think I tortured my metaphor above. But my point was that you need to bring your information to life. The simplest way to share information concisely is to make a point form list. Brian: Intelligence: Very High Height: 177 cm Weight: also very high \u2026 But these numbers don\u2019t really mean anything on their own and if you are writing an essay for a class, all your classmates will have the same numbers to work with. I\u2019ll let you in on a secret: I am overweight. That\u2019s not much of a secret I guess. But the way I would prefer this information to be shared is in describing me as similar to a bear in Autumn. The reader would correctly conclude that I have a lot of body hair, and carrying a lot of fat and might either be cute or ferocious - either one would be cool for others to believe of me. In English class, anyone can say Macbeth was too ambitious. It would be more memorable to compare him to Donald Trump. It might even be cooler to compare Trump to Lade Macbeth as the truly ambitious one. Mike Pence, as Macbeth has no choice but to be dragged along and cannot separate himself from Trump because the way behind is as filled with blood as the way forward. Ah, I\u2019m reaching here. Such comparisons require some creativity but make the essay more interesting and maybe even fun. ",

            "answer_text": "In my Creative Writing course at the University, one of the assignments was a Personal Essay. Now this is different than a Personal Essay that you would write as an entrance requirement for a university. The former falls under Creative non-fiction where-as the latter is generally referred to as just a narrative essay. Picturing the Personal Essay: A Visual Guide The difference is how you handle the narrative, because you want to use a plot guide. Do you want to build to a climax? do you want to circle on reflection? etc. This is a good article because it shows a visualized structure of what the plot should feel like to the reader. I struggled long and hard on this. Do I build to a climax with the abuse in my life? That\u2019s generally what led to my suicide attempts. I thought that would be too painful for the teacher to read. So I did a spiral of reflection. The idea came to me when I was ordered to clean the ponds midsummer. There was a scorpion trapped in one pond. I was on a strict deadline, my wife hates interruptions, or excuses, so I, \u201cdanced with danger.\u201d Something I learned as a child. I distracted the scorpion with a gloved hand as a target, while speed snatching stones from all around him. I could have killed him, but it wasn\u2019t his fault he got trapped within my task, he shouldn\u2019t pay the price either. So my essay became a reflection, the spiral reflection on other events where I, \u201cdanced with danger.\u201d Even how it all started: under a streetlamp with a stuffed raccoon whose throat had been severed and clumsily stitched back together with bandaids as a child would. This is how it is done. You chose a plot profile, a plot style and you frame your narrative around a non-fictional subject. It has all the creative writing narrative methods, plots, characterizations (perhaps), certainly mood and scenes, emotions. ",

First, you must think of a topic for the story you are about to create. What do you want to write about. Stay creative. Secondly you must identify your main theme. How do you want the reader to feel? Is there a certain point you want to convey in your essay? Third, you must develop a good outline. You want to create all the characters and develop a plot etc. Most importantly, try not to over think it. The main things you want to focus on is how you will draw the attention of the reader and what do you want the message to be. What will the characters do, how will everything fall into place? I'm almost certain you are already aware of the basic principles when it comes to writing, sentence structure, punctuation, paragraph structure, introduction, body & conclusion. Most of all be creative and do not over think it. Hopefully this sums it up for you :) ",

Are you required to have a certain structure? all those things aside, here are a few suggestions to perhaps get you started. What point of view are you writing from? Try to pick a unique character to provide your narration. in my own writing, one of my favorite creative essays was one which I used a mouse as the narrator and described a certain string of events through the mouse's eyes. Start out with a hook! It often intrigues both the writer and the reader if the first sentence starts out with a bang. Such as : \"The day struck me as one that should have felt lazy and carefree - with all the sunshine and fluffy clouds - but 46 children were missing\". (Not the best example, but what I came up with off the top of my head). You want to keep up a quick pace. Give the reader something to look forward to, and then work your way backwards through the events leading up to the grand finale or big twist. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I think most instructions about how to write an essay are either very complicated or just confusing. You can just follow about 2 steps. Step #1 Gather all of the facts that you can. Step #2 Arrange all of the facts into an essay. I think that if you look through a library or bookstore you can find books with Creative Essays in them. You may also want to research \u201canthologies\u201d which are collections of essays. Also, searches on the Internet can show you websites with examples of Creative Essays. I can suggest that you pay particular attention to the verbs that creative writers use in their sentences. The verbs are the driving power in any writing. The verbs will establish the foundation for all over your writing. The other practical technique to drive your Creative Writing will be to research the Synonyms for any powerful verbs that you find in a Creative Essay. In fact, many of the answers on http://Quora.com are \u201cessays\u201d.

Make the essay connect with them at a personal level, even when you do not know them in person. The other thing i would suggest is go visual. While you still have to give your explaination in writing, there is no harm in presenting the numbers visually, see what infographics or visual information is about Good luck ",

My main recommendation for word choice is to use as precise language as possible. I try to avoid phrases along the lines of \u201cvery [blank].\u201d Now, as to sentence length\u2026 there\u2019s no problem with using longer sentences. Nor is there a problem with shorter ones. Both surely work. See? The length of the sentence helps give a flow to your writing. Just like how the tide comes a little differently each time it comes in, your sentence length shouldn\u2019t be all the same, as it needs flow. Thanks for reading\u2026 Have a wonderful day (every day)! -Zachary Smith ",
