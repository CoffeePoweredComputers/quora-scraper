            "answer_text": "A dedication and an acknowledgement are two different things. The dedication describes the people, things, events etc. that inspired the author to write the book. This could include people that contributed to the book, but it doesn't have to. I can dedicate my book to God or Nikola Tesla without their permission. If I dedicated my book to Taylor Swift (not likely, but for the sake of argument), I wouldn't have to get her permission either, but could find myself in a difficult position if Ms. Swift's management felt I was unreasonably borrowing her celebrity to promote my book or create confusion about her alleged connection to my book. An acknowledgement, on the other hand, recognizes all who contributed to the book. If these acknowledgements are factual and the contributors did not specirfically prohibit the author from disclosing their role in the creation of the book, no permission is needed. ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is no, you do not need to get permission if you are simply thanking or citing people, living or deceased, who had a direct effect on your work.  However, if your work is more of an academic nature, and you have a lot of quotes or reprinted material that require extensive permission citations, the Acknowledgments section is usually the place to run these. Perhaps that gives the impression you need permission to run names in Acknowledgments (Acknowledgements if you're doing UK English). See Chicago Manual of Style 15e, sections 1.52 and 4.95 - 4.96 Although not legally required, if there is any doubt in your mind regarding a dedication, you should address it openly with the subject of the dedication. The person or group may not be able to do anything legally but it's hard enough to publish a book without any surprise objections to what you're doing. ",
