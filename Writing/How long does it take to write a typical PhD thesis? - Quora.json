            "answer_text": "Original question:How long does it take to write a typical PhD thesis? It can be anywhere from 2 months to a year. You can finish in minimum time if you have already written papers and yearly reports during the course of your PhD. It will take more time if you are writing everything from scratch. I finished mine in 3 months (out of which I procrastinated for 1.5 months writing the Introduction chapter, so frankly leaving me just 1.5 months to finish). My thesis had 4 chapters - 1. Introduction (including literature survey) 2 and 3 - Results and Discussion 4 - Experimental Before I started writing, most of my Chapter 2 and 3 were already written as I had a detailed report on the results which I had to submit as part of my MPhil to PhD transfer viva and yearly reports. Also, I didn't have to worry much about my Chapter 4 as I had compiled the experimental data (spectral details mainly) already while submitting the papers. The main part was the introduction, which took me quite a while to write. I was consumed by the humongous amount of literature, and just couldn't decide what to include and what to leave off. I used to search and collect the relevant papers and just continue reading them, making mental points to include certain portions of it in my introduction chapter. I had the overall picture, but none if it was on paper. I just kept on reading and procrastinating when it came to the original writing. And with procrastination comes guilt of not having written enough as days just passes by. I started avoiding seeing my fellow grad school mates as I feared I would be asked about my thesis progress, and instead used to go to the library. I didn't have much to show to my supervisor as well, who was pretty confident I would well be on my way to finishing writing. Going to Oxford to present my research work in between did help lifting my spirits up, but it vanished after a few days of returning home. After 1.5 months of this cycle, I realised I wouldn't be able to finish on time, considering my fellowship would be ending soon. Plus, I had not touched my other chapters. Even though they were written, but they still needed to be moulded to become a part of my thesis. I realised I had almost isolated myself from people for the last 1.5 months, which was not at all healthy. I just couldn't find a way out of the procrastination-feeling guilty cycle. One fine day, I just came out of the house, went to a counsellor in the university well-being centre, just talked out everything which I had been accumulating within myself. Venting out everything helped me to take stock of the situation and gave me some courage to meet my supervisor whom I was avoiding for some time now. I am sure she was dead worried as to me being able to finish on time as a lot weighed on a timely submission (my fellowship ending plus her going on maternity leave). However, she understood my problem, chalked out a plan for me to start focusing on other chapters which I just needed to put together and connect the missing links and then focus on the introduction. Plus, she suggested me to work in our building with other people around. On retrospection, that helped. I found a spot in my building, where I started writing, and eventually did all of my writing there. We dedicated a week each for chapter 2 and chapter 3, and decided to finish as much as I can in that time. As soon as the allocated time finishes, I had to stop doing it, send it to my supervisor to correct and move on to the next one. As I did this, I was able to finish chapter 2 and 3 within 21 days. Remember, procrastination was still there so I was still struggling to write at a good pace. However, as more and more pages were being written, I was regaining my confidence a bit (internally I was still in a rollercoaster of varied emotions of guilt and anger). I moved on to the dreadful chapter 1, and just started writing even if it was not perfect. I realized later that the reason I was procrastinating was because I wanted my thesis to be perfect from the point I start writing. So foolish of me! If there are some words on the paper, then only there is a possibility of refining it further and polishing it to near perfection. Somehow, I had half of it ready in the next 10 days. I again worked on the chapter 2 and 3, which my supervisor had returned for corrections, sent it back again for further corrections, and again started working on chapter 1. As soon as all of it were ready, the next task was formatting with all the alignments, spacing, headlines, fonts, maintaining uniformity in abbreviations, captions for tables and figures, checking chemdraw structures for errors and citing references (a big phew especially for that). Mendeley made it easy for me when it came to references, as I had put all of my references in it beforehand. All of this accelerated activity had taken a toll on me, with me just going home for dinner. Some days I didn't go home and used to grab food from nearby store and get back to work. The last week before submitting was crazy, as I worked like a zombie, sleeping in the grad school office, keeping myself awake by regular doses of caffeine (coffee) and taurine (red bull). A lot of help came in the form of my post doc colleague, who used to cheer me up and also helped in some of the formatting stuff. I couldn't thank him more for it. And most of the credit for my timely submission goes to my supervisor who chalked out a fool-proof plan, encouraged me to write daily and gave immediate feedbacks on my writings. I have to say, I had everyone in the staff on their toes with the head of the school and the deputy head quite worried as well. I am sure all sighed a breath of relief when I submitted! Most of all, me and my supervisor! Those 3 months were the most difficult period of my PhD. All I can do now is share my experiences and hope it will help other PhD students if they are in a similar situation I was in. Some of the pointers which I would like to put out from my experience, Make a habit of writing reports since the start. It not only helps in getting more ideas for further approaching a problem, but also helps during thesis writing.Also, if you are in sciences keeping the experimental portion ready helps a lot. Also make sure you arrange your references in a software like mendeley as you come across them during the research phase.If you suffer from procrastination, it doesn't have a one-day cure, but try to find out why you procrastinate. For me, I didn't like writing that much plus I was aiming for perfection. I would suggest you to write anything, even if it sounds rubbish, but to write it nevertheless. Having something to improve is better than having nothing.If you find yourself isolating yourself and staying in the house, just get out immediately, and walk/run for sometime. Talk to a friend. Talk to someone who wouldn't judge you. Most of the time we don't talk fearing judgement from people. Talking to a counsellor at the wellbeing centre was deal-breaker for me, as it was a stranger talking to me. Moreover, they are trained not to judge but to just listen and direct your thoughts.Keep yourself surrounded by people who give positive vibes and interact with your supervisor regularly. They know how to tackle the writing, considering they have also gone through the same process some years ago.Take support if required from the grad school. Remember, you are not alone facing this situation. A lot of PhD students face this situation. There might be some writing seminars going around in the campus, attend those (I attended one after I submitted my thesis, only if I had attended it before!).After I wrote this answer, I realised it became a long personal rant on my experience of writing thesis. But, nevertheless I wanted to put it out as I realize many PhD students face this situation. Apart from my experience, I knew of a colleague and friend, who enjoyed writing so much that he wrapped up his writing in 20 days. Again, he had written papers for all his chapters beforehand. So all he had to do was fill in gaps. A few other colleagues could take a more relaxed approach, as they were home (non-international) students. They went home and wrote from there over a period of 4\u20136 months; some wrote while doing a part time job in between. Gauge the time beforehand you will have for thesis writing and strategise according to the time you have. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "My thesis had a five-year deadline from the start of the Ph.D. program to submission of the thesis. I met the deadline by about three months. The actual writing part took me three months of 9\u20135 work for six days per week; It was a full time job. I had left England and was living in Bangkok at this point. The internet was not as it is now, no instant communication. Only email with my professor across a 7-hour time difference. However, as a chemist, I had written all of my 400-or-so experiments and their duplicates, complete with calculations, observations, analytical results, and references to my secondary research notes, in my notebooks at the time. Secondary research went into another notebook detailing the library work needed to find out what was already known about a topic and thoughts of how to apply this material to my own work. All those school essays, Journals, notetaking skills, and homework assignments were worth the effort, I promise you! Text books were no longer any use, Quora, Yahoo answers and the like did not exist, but would have been of no use anyhow. All you needed was there already - your notes, original published papers, your background knowledge, experience and a brain. The writing became easier the more clear I was of what I needed to say; I needed a PLAN. I found that large blocks of my thesis were already written in the notebooks. The story was there. Over 4 days, I summarized the story as a mind map on many index cards and rearranged them into chapters in a way that connected them. This helped me to see different routes, connections, and conclusions that I was previously unaware. It was quite an exciting activity. I wrote the plan up as a poster on 4 sheets of legal paper, and started writing. This poster was my bible. Because so much could be copied (albeit with style corrections and clarifications), all I needed to do was find the right words to connect the ideas (index cards) to write the whole thing up. During the writing stage, I could think of nothing else, I dreamt about what to write next and I learned to use this to tackle writing blocks. The brain continues working on stuff while the body is resting. I slept 8 hours a night and two hours each day as well. I ate properly and made sure I walked every morning, and during the day. The thing that surprised me was that after I sat down and began work on the thesis, it was another week before I actually started to write! but that when I did begin, the words came easily. The power of planning. ",
