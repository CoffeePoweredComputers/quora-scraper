            "answer_text": "forget teenages anyone should love maths becasue after all there's nothing to memorise, the only thing you\u2019ve got to do is **practice, practice and more practice** so that's enjoyable.. to be honest for me Mathematics has always been the buzz of a new challenge, solving problems and getting to the next level. its buzz and a new \u201chigh\u2019 that all students can experience no matter whatever their level\u2019s of abilities are. been an expert in Mathematics (still couldn't make it to Med school though) or at least being a student who was able to somewhat master the art of Mathematics has always delivered that sense of achievement to me as a student across my curriculum motivating me to get to the next level at any cost before the rest of the pack does. i mean when i was in school i remember doing math sums even while boarding a bus just to make sure that i\u2019ll have an head's up before the neighboring kid who sits right next to me at school .. all in all when it comes to maths an individual should work hard to master the foundation of mathematics early in life ( at least commit genuine eagerness during early teens) beause then once you become a teenager you will most definitely start to enjoy the challenges and the competition that would pit you against one another. this is why teenage Pupils with additional support for learning should not be discouraged or fear maths but they must be fully inclusive when studying the subject because believe me which ever part of the world you are living in the Mathematics school curriculum challenges could be easily matched to suit different ability levels of the student, meaning there is something suitable for every pupil within every mathematical challenge, the only rule of thumb would be that presentation of questions and solving methods/steps need to be more or less differentiated based on the ability of the student, and believe me it could be done and when properly applied everybody would start to love Mathematics. If the teenage pupil could master the easier questions, then they could be challenged with harder ones by elaborating on easier steps of solving equations by highlighting similarities between sums. If the teenage pupil could not successfully answer the harder questions, they would be presented with the same hard one with easier explanations in order to help them grasp the subject. so finally this means that all teenage pupils could easily participate in mathematical challenges based on differnt skill levels because eveyone is good at something in maths and this will help all teenage kids feel a level of success and love for the subject. *game over* ",

            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s FUN! By drawing pictures, and playing around with the pictures, you can easily understand the Pythagorean Theorem  Also, by drawing geometrical pictures and playing with figures, you can easily see that Kepler\u2019s laws are true for a central force. http://ceadserv1.nku.edu/longa/classes/calculus_resources/docs/kep.pdf  You can apply game theory to do well at games like poker  or Monopoly,  and use logic, deduction, and memory to play a decent game of chess  If you like baseball,  you can use math to compute ERAs, batting averages, slugging percentages, and use statistics , as Bill James did in his \u201cBaseball Abstract\u201d series to show how a batter like Gene Tenace, formerly of the Oakland As who despite batting in the .240s, was a better hitter than Manny Moto, formerly of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who batted close to 0.400. Gene Tenace also walked a lot, and hit for power. Manny Moto did NOT hit for power, and seldom walked, That made up for the difference in batting average. You can apply statistics to figure out how great a part luck plays in winning a conference playoff berth, as \u201cTANGOTIGER\u201d did: The Tango method of regression to the mean -- a proof 1. First, figure out the standard deviation of team performance. For MLB, for all teams playing at least 160 games up until 2009, that figure is 0.070 (about 11.34 wins per 162 games). Second, figure out the theoretical standard deviation of luck over a season, using the binomial approximation to normal. That's estimated by the formula Square root of (p(1-p)/g)) For baseball, p = .500 (since the average team must be .500), and g = 162. So the SD of luck works out to about 0.039 (6.36 games per season). So SD(performance) = 0.070, and SD(luck) = 0.039. Square those numbers to get var(performance) and var(luck). Then, if luck is independent of talent, we get var(performance) = var(talent) + var(luck) That means var(talent) equals 0.058 squared, so SD(talent) = 0.058. 2. Now, find the number of games for which the SD(luck) equals SD(talent), or 0.058. It turns out that's about 74 games, because the square root of (p(1-p))/74 is approximately equal to 0.058. 3. That number, 74, is your \"answer\". So, now, any time you want to regress a team's record to the mean, take 74 games of .500 ball (37-37), and add them to the actual performance. The result is your best estimate of the team's talent. For instance, suppose your team goes 100-62. What's its expected talent? Adjust the record to 137-99. That gives an estimated talent of .581, or 94-68. Or, suppose your team starts 2-6. Adjust it to 39-43. That's an estimated talent of .476, or 77-85. ",
