            "answer_text": "Original Question: Do you have examples of misleading headlines posted by respected newspapers? Newspapers have subtle way of conveying \u2018their own message \u2018 to mass in order to shape a public opinion or to generate consensus in favour or against a person but it can never be contested in any forum. Indirectly, the newspaper also criticises the government in such a way that ruling regime would not realise it. It is a like \u2018killing softly\u2019. This is front page of major newspaper in Kerala on 30\u201303\u20132020. The situation at Kerala - Karnataka border has reached fever pitch as two patients died in two days due lack of access to medical facilities from Mangaluru in Karnataka, which is located at 18km from Kasaragod border while same facilities located 36km inside Kerala. It was an inhuman act and completely absurd in the way Karnataka has handled this situation while Kerala played subtle role of \u2018victim\u2019.  There are three pictures First picture is of a traffic police directing an ambulance to move into nearby service road.Second picture shows road blockade with sand dunes and barricade placed over the sand dune to prevent people from crossing over these blockade.Third picture is a straight forward - Prime Minister Narendra Modi with folded hands.Caption written on the top as headline reads - \u2018Border closed for ambulance; Patients died\u2019 Caption under PM reads as \u2018Sorry! I have not other way\u2019 When you read it together as highlighted, it is read\u2026\u2026\u2026  \u2018Border closed for ambulance; Patients died\u2019 \u2018Sorry! I have no other way\u2019 with a picture of P M with folded hands . What do you decipher from the headline? It is mischievous way a \u2018transparent\u2019 news media shaping a public opinion. Addendum: None of the information shared on this post are created nor photoshopped to vilify a respectable organization. ",

            "answer_text": "Misleading headlines are quite common nowadays. And it is either done intentionally to sell the piece better or just because the writer was too busy to leave for home early. You can see a lot of misleading headlines while reading news digitally which can easily be passed as a clickbait. You open it looking for something interesting and you are served an \u201cI-GOT-YOU-IDIOT\u201d news/article. Though it is time consuming to get those examples here right now, I found two very laughable things on the internet which may show how things are tweaked in the headline itself.   NOTE: Can\u2019t assure how genuine these news are! Though I will edit this part if I get a recent misleading headline. ",
