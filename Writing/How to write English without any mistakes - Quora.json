            "answer_text": "First and foremost, please consider your question for its grammar. Do you want to develop your English without ever making a mistake? The obvious answer to that is that it is not humanly possible. It is even counter-intuitive, since mistakes are actually rich sources of education. Hence, make mistakes, but be open to corrections offered by reliable authorities, which you are, obviously. Then again, provided you use the right resources and consult with the right people, you are never going to actually learn any wrong grammar. But obviously, what you mean is \u201cHow do I develop grammatically correct English?\u201d So let me state here that grammatical correctness is a relative term. That\u2019s because if you simply want to learn elementary grammar for practical purposes, that\u2019s one thing. If you want to learn it because you are a student of literature and are pursuing perfection, believe me, you are going to automatically develop it through reading the English classics. If you can tell me more about the purpose involved, I could shed more precise light on the matter. Since that aspect is unknown to me at the moment, I will offer some important, generic pointers: Read for pleasure - and no other reasonDevelop a habit of tinkering with words - write and speak some of your ownLook up basic rules of grammar every now and thenDon\u2019t make any conscious efforts to improve grammar, instead make efforts to read, write, speak and listen all you can. If you get too tangled up in grammar, there\u2019s a danger that you\u2019ll lose interest.That last pointer is to serve as a reminder that if you simply enjoy English via each of the four aforementioned basic skills, you will automatically develop flawless English grammar. In other words, flawless English is achieved through maximum enjoyment of the language through liberal use of those four skills. I have never said that achieving perfect English is easy. But then, what is achievement without hardship? If there\u2019s anything else I can help you with, do let me know. I wish you all the very best in your quest for perfection in English! ",

            "answer_text": "Some basic principles to remember: Speaking English provides much more room for error and innovation than writing it, even in the most formal settings. Languages mainly change from the street up, and only a little from the dictionary down. Therefore, you should distinguish between spoken grammar and written grammar, and use different methods to improve your mastery of them. To improve your grammar when speaking, LISTEN A LOT, LISTEN CAREFULLY, AND PRACTICE OFTEN. Watching subtitled movies at home is a good way to do this when you\u2019re not out being social, but don\u2019t be shy; the best thing for you to do is to participate in a lot of conversations with native English speakers. Be conscious of their geographic origin, their education level, their socioeconomic status, and the situation in which you encounter them, and try to take note of the differences these things make in the ways that they speak. When you have extended conversations, ask your friends and acquaintances to correct you when you make the kinds of mistakes that native English speakers never make. . . but don\u2019t worry about the errors that are common to conversational English. Again, languages mainly change from the street up, and only a little from the dictionary down, so people who use the language incorrectly end up being correct, if there are enough of them. Many, many usages that would be considered absolutely wrong in written English are acceptable in conversation, so just go with the flow. There is certainly no point in trying to fight it, because it would be like trying to stop the tide with your hands. Even the dictionary bows and receives the insistent lashings of the vulgar tongue eventually. In seeking out social situations in which you can practice your conversational skills, try to avoid bars. Even a light alcohol buzz can cause people to slur their words, and a drunk person typically has a very sloppy mouth that is not suitable for you to try to mimic. If you want to party while you perfect your English, stick with weed, kid. To improve your grammar when writing, READ A LOT, READ CAREFULLY, AND PRACTICE OFTEN. This should be mostly self-explanatory, but here are some tips: Read the kind of writing that you want to produce. If you want to write poetry, read poetry. If you want to write technical manuals, read technical manuals. If you want to be a journalist, may god have mercy on your polluted soul. Pick an appropriate manual of style, and read it cover-to-cover. Keeping it in the bathroom where you can read it while you use the toilet is a good way to both improve your written grammar in the area of writing you wish to pursue, and avoid hemorrhoids by encouraging you to take your time. I choose to believe that this is the main reason we have sit-down toilets in America. I\u2019ve already said to practice often, but don\u2019t just write and leave it at that; show your writing to people, preferably people who write well. Ask them to critique your writing without being nice about it. Accept useless criticism impassively; be grateful for useful criticism, and use it constructively. I hope this helps. For further improvement of your English beyond grammar, search for lists of quotations \u2014 with explanations \u2014 from the Bible and Shakespeare. Those two sources alone will arm you with a majority of the euphemisms, aphorisms, proverbs, etc. that are common in English. ",
