            "answer_text": "I'll start with the obvious, then move into my more subjective personal favorites. The obvious: Catch-22, by Joseph Heller  Here's how I like to explain it. 1) It's the ultimate \"fuck the man\" book. 2) You know how sometimes, you read a really good book, and it has a really great chapter that builds and builds and builds, until the last paragraph, and then you get to the last line and it's like BAM! and punches you in the stomach? That's like every single paragraph of Catch-22.   Cannery Row, by John Steinbeck.  Honestly, you'll be extremely satisfied with anything Steinbeck, and most people seem to agree that Grapes of Wrath  or East of Eden are \"better\" than Cannery Row. I could be biased, because I read it right before starting this research seminar in Monterey, CA -- but I thought this was one of the most charming stories ever. It's so quotable, and it's a relatively quick read. If you don't fall in love with the characters -- even the \"bad\" ones -- I will drink a beer milkshake.  For a completely different Steinbeck experience, check out my favorite travel book of all time,  Travels With Charly in Search of America, an autobiographical account of Steinbeck's cross country road trip with his dog, Charly. It's hilarious, fun, and amazing... and then he gets to the old South, and everything changes.   The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams.  Way too hilarious and amazing for a description to do it justice. Just go read it.   Farhenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury.   It's a classic, so everyone should put it on their reading bucket list. But what's interesting to me is that Bradbury basically predicted everything that's happening with free speech/hurting peoples' feelings on college and high school campuses right now.  My personal favorites: The Sword of Truth series, by Terry Goodkind.  Before I read this book -- and the entire 11-book series that followed it -- I had never successfully read a fantasy novel before. (I mean, other than children's classics, like The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and A Wrinkle in Time, which are fantastic books worth reading, even as an adult.) But this one was captivating.  People often complain that it's too \"republican\" or \"preachy,\" and the morals in the book are, indeed based on Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Other authors have written about Objectivism, of course -- but Goodkind is, by far, the most widely-read Objectivist novelist ever since Rand. Even if you want to just skim over the Objectivist stuff (and, err... the BDSM stuff), the series is still a thrilling read.  Argo: How the CIA and Hollywood Pulled Off the Most Audacious Rescue in History, by Antonio Mendez and Matt Baglio.  Because holy crap! Reality is more audacious, creative and unbelievable than fiction. They've since made a movie about this book, so you probably know the basic plot. But the book goes much deeper into the details and history of the conflict and rescue. Read it, and be inspired.   Island of the Blue Dolphins, by Scott O'Dell.  Yeah, it's a kids' book. But it's unforgettable, and it's got a badass female protagonist. (Ever noticed how hardly any books have a strong female character?)  Honorable mentions:  Water for Elephants: A Novel, by Sara Gruen  Station Eleven, by Emily St. John Mandel  The Martain, by Andy Weir   Four Past Midnight, Featuring The Langoliers, by Stephen King  ",

            "answer_text": "The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is hands down the best novel I have ever read! When this book was recommended to me, I had a very different opinion about it. I was like 'Ayn Rand?...Nahh!'. I mean I thought I could never connect to her thought process or that I would never understand it at all. I mean the same feeling you get when you meet a person for the first time and you feel that, that person is so great, and that why would he ever want to talk to me, but as it turns out, the two of you end up becoming the best of friends. Now coming to the actual experience of it. Well I had my winter break and didn't have much to do. So I thought I could probably start with it and finish it somehow, given it's size and my self-made apprehensions about it. But as it turns out, I completed it in less than a week. Initially it didn't interest me much. But after those 100 pages, it had become a part of me. I could find myself in it and that is why I could never stop reading it. I was completely awe struck by the character, Howard Roark. In fact I fell in love with him. But it stuck me hard every time I realized that it was all a fiction, a figment of imagination. It took me almost a semester to get over him (no kidding!). I would not like to reveal any detail about it. I want you to read it. But there is one damn thing I can't stop myself from mentioning. The fact that no matter what, never ever stop doing what you think is right or what you love. Some people lack the courage, some begin to lose interest because of constant suppression from everyone around them, but still never ever stop doing what you love because in the end it is not about them..it is about you. Because as Howard Roark's character correctly remarked, \"Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision!\". ",
