            "answer_text": "What we anoint as \u201cclassic\u201d often says more about our modern sensibilities than it does about the book itself. Thomas Hardy\u2019s Tess of the D\u2019Urbervilles is no exception. Tess is a damn good tragedy, full of pathos and cruel irony. I promise you many tears at the end, not just for poor Tess but also for the hypocritical society that inflicts so much suffering on Tess. Just being a good yarn (albeit a sad one) isn\u2019t enough, however. It is the continuing relevance of Tess that elevates it to its lofty position in the literary canon. Tess explores two issues we\u2019ve struggled with ever since its publication: the human encroachment on nature and women\u2019s place in society. Both of which are fodder for literary critics and English teachers. The Tragedy of Nature Overthrown Tess is perhaps the ultimate pastoral\u2014bucolic if you want to get fancy\u2014novel. It\u2019s a sad ode to the forgotten countryside. Thomas Hardy published Tess in 1891 as England\u2014along with much of the Western world\u2014had been upended by the Industrial Revolution. The massive urbanization has made its mark on the countryside in which Tess takes place. Even though there is little direct description of the cities teeming with people and machines, its presence is known through the description of how farm life bows to the needs of city folk. The one concession Hardy makes to farming\u2019s rapid industrialization is his portrayal of the grain fresher: Close under the eaves of the stack, and as yet barely visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to serve--a timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels appertaining--the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up a despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves. A little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black, with a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve. \u2014 Chapter 47 This beastly mechanical creature goes on to kill a man in a burst of poetic irony that Hardy loves so much. Through his mind-numbing depictions of farm life\u2014from milking to clearing the fields\u2014Hardy shows an intimacy and respect for nature. Farming and working with nature is hard but honest labor. These depictions forces the reader to ask: What happens to us as we lose touch with the earth that nourishes us? Hardy\u2019s answer isn\u2019t a happy one, since he\u2019s a bit of a Negative Nellie. How much can we forsake nature before we lose our connection to it\u2014maybe even our humanity\u2014is still a question we struggle with. So says the person who is typing this out on a newfangled computer and hasn\u2019t ever plowed a field in her life. The Tragedy of a Good Woman For a dude in Victorian England, Thomas Hardy has earned some serious feminist cred. Tess isn\u2019t just any woman. She\u2019s a damn good one. She goes to get work to help her family when their horse is killed in an accident. She stands up for her beliefs. She resists the lascivious advances of Alec D\u2019Urberville, a libertine to end all libertines, because she\u2019s just not that kind of girl. She confesses a dark secret that jeopardized her chance at love because of her innate honesty. She even prostitutes herself to save her family. Every single one of those ostensibly good deeds bite her in the ass. Every one. She gets raped, abandoned by the love of her life, and forced into becoming a man\u2019s kept woman. As such is the fate of a good woman in Hardy\u2019s Wessex. With his penchant for tragic irony, Hardy illustrates society\u2019s hypocrisy when it comes to women. Although Tess has been raped\u2014and therefore spoiled according to Victorian social norms\u2014she is still pure of the heart and the mind. The book\u2019s subtitle of \u201cA Pure Woman\u201d is no accident. We cannot say the same for the men in the book, especially Alec D\u2019Urberville and Angel Clare. This is enough to make a modern-day feminist squee. So much oppression. So much gender injustice. So much to discuss! As much of a downer as Tess is, it\u2019s still shockingly relevant today. That unto itself is the ultimate downer. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, what makes a novel a classical novel? It should introduce a concept that reveals a major truth about society or of human nature. Most authors don\u2019t do this because they write novels that blend in with others for the most part. Ex. Teen fiction, modern dystopian lit. etc etc. Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles is a classic because in it Hardy addresses several of 19th century England\u2019s more conservative beliefs about marriage and women\u2019s rights: that a woman was without virtue if she was defiled, regardless of circumstance, and that a man must not live with a defiled woman. I won\u2019t explain exactly how he does so because a synopsis is easily found on Sparknotes or Shmoop. Note that Hardy also adds, in his explanatory note to the first edition of the book, that \u201cI would ask any too genteel reader, who cannot endure to have said what everybody nowadays thinks and feels, to remember\u2026\u201d What does this phrase signify? Hardy believed the controversial ideas expressed in Tess were echoed privately in society. So, another reason Tess was considered a classic is because it reflected many people\u2019s beliefs that they were too afraid to say. There is no doubt that Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles is just as relevant today as it was in the 19th century. ",
