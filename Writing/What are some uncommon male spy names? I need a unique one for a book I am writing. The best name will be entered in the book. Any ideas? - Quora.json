The best spies would have such innocuous names that nobody would even notice them. If you\u2019re looking for something mysterious (that will be like having \u201cI SPY\u201d tattooed across their forehead), try names with X or Z in them. Sandor or even Zandor sound like somebody sinister out of Transylvania, and Xavier has that nice zzz sound at the beginning. Of course, Xavier was also a saint but we can\u2019t expect exclusivity of names. ",
