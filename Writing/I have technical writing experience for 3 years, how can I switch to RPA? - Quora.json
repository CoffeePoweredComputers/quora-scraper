I would recommend pursuing as many of the free courses that are available so you can be familiar with a wider variety of platforms. Despite RPA being largely codeless, you\u2019ll be at a disadvantage if you don\u2019t have basic coding background - especially in python/c# and some .net skills. These opportunities are a good place to start.
