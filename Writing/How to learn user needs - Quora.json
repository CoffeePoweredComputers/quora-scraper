            "answer_text": "The obvious advice is of course to do research, interview users and analyze trends. I would like to propose another way to learn user needs: Use your imagination, make a prototype and verify with tests om real users. You will be surprised how well this often works when trying to paint a User Journey, e.g. what is the user thinking about before, during and after the user has completed the Use Case and in what context is the user when having these thoughts? Start with thinking about what kind of person your user is, what is important to them. Just guess, google and recall meetings with persons in your own life.  Challenge your first thoughts with comparing with the opposite. When you got an idea of who your user are, imagine the situtation when and where they become a user and play that movie in your head while rethinking it from every angle then start to design a prototype of your service or product that you can test it on real users. Enjoy what test users liked but more importantly force them to think out loud, to not be polite but honest and fine tune your service or product based on the feedback and test again. ",

            "answer_text": "These are all good answers, but if you've never actually done user research, saying \"go talk to people\" will only get you so far! Depending on time and budget, here are a few options: Recreate the customer experience to feel their pain. For instance, when Facebook began launching apps in emerging markets like India, they created \u201c2G Tuesdays.\u201d For an hour each week, employees would experience connection speeds much slower than what they\u2019re used to, which more closely represented what their new market customers would experience when using their app. Use storyboards to construct a user journey. Visualize the process of a customer using your product step by step, from them realizing they have a problem to solving it. A good example of this is Airbnb, which created their own storyboards, imagining and illustrating what their guests and hosts experience while using their service. Those storyboards identified a missing link between their website and the real-life customer experience, and Airbnb shifted their focus to optimizing their now widely utilized mobile platform. You can also run the storyboards by potential customers and have them validate, critique, or add to the journey.  Most importantly, you can intercept the customer at the point of use or purchase. While this should feel informal, a successful intercept is the result of careful preparation:Develop a hypothesis to test. An intercept\u2019s limited timeframe means your questions must be focused, so come up with a specific idea to test. Your hypotheses will also guide when the intercept should occur: when the customer is engaged with a service or product; while they are exploring purchase options; mid-purchase; or post-purchase.Determine which customer(s) you want to intercept. Once you\u2019ve identified your hypotheses, you can estimate the type of customers you\u2019ll need to intercept. If you\u2019ve already developed several personas or archetypes of users, this is an excellent opportunity to test them against real-world customers. Five to six intercepts will give you a decent set of findings to explore, while 8-12 will show repetition in those findings but highlight the stronger ones to focus on first.Identify the key questions that you want to ask. Questions should be open-ended so you can modify and ask follow-up questions during the interviews, but keep it short\u2014you're taking up someone's time. Test the questions with friends. Does the intercept take up too much time? Do they find the questions confusing? Do the questions elicit the type of information you\u2019re looking for? A few dry runs will help you improve your questionnaire, as well as your delivery. Actually intercept the customer (finally). When you approach a customer, identify yourself as a representative of the company gathering customer input, and politely ask customers if they are interested in participating. Recording the interaction helps, as you can refer back to it, but if that's out of scope, try to have someone else taking notes.Recap after the intercept. Right after each intercept, take a few minutes to jot down the big take-aways from the interview. Capture interesting quotes, insights (pain points, what\u2019s working and not working) and new ideas. Analyze and share findings.  Look across your intercepts and group together common responses from customers. Summarize the results into broad themes and share with the rest of the team.We've created a Customer Intercept \"cheat sheet\" below; feel free to steal and modify. ",
