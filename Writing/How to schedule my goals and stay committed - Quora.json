            "answer_text": "With a notebook and a pen. This is a foolproof system. All it takes is self-discipline (which is easier said than done), but if you follow through on it, it works. Take yearly goals and break them into monthly goals. After that, take your goals for the month and work backwards to see what you need to do every week. After that, schedule your week day-to-day. Write out what you need to do every day if you are going to complete your tasks by the end of Saturday, and then stick to it. Then comes the fun part. For every \u201cweekly goal\u201d that you don\u2019t complete on time, put ten dollars in a jar for an organization whose cause you hate. This establishes the necessary \u201cpain of inaction.\u201d I can guarantee you by the end of the first month you\u2019ll be a goal-crushing machine. Dreams only become reality by maintaining a strictly disciplined commitment to self promises. Write out what you need to do, and then do it. Simple as that. ",

A simple goal without a reason, is like going on a trip with nothing in mind, but to simply get to some point to another. Having reasons will make you stay committed. ",
