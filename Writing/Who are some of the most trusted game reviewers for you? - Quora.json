            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t follow any game reviewers. Game reviewers can be biased, and often times are not good at predicting whether the community will like the game or not. I have found the best way to tell if I want a game is to watch a youtuber play the beta or the game itself. I personally like Mr. Fruit on YouTube.  Mr. Fruit logo I can more quickly tell from watching people play it because I can judge how I would play from watching. Dead cells, Tooth and Tail, sea of thieves, etc. are all games I decided to get because of watching him play. Now, I can also understand wanting to go into a game blind. Then if I can I ask friends what they know about the game, or also take a gamble. In short, I don\u2019t trust game reviewers. I instead trust seeing content creators play the game and interact with it. Mr. Fruit is especially great at just going into a game with friends and playing. This speaks much more to me than some potentially biased words on paper. ",
