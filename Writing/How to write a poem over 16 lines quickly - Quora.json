            "answer_text": "How do I write a poem over 16 lines quickly? If I were doing it, I\u2019d do eight pairs of rhyming couplets, each ending in words that are common rhyme sounds. Of course, one has to have a subject or theme of some sort. For instance, since one of my cats is sitting nearby, I might use him for inspiration: Feline spirit, black as night, Gleaming eyes, so gold and bright, Tell me what is on your mind. Share the secrets of your kind. Now your tail begins to twitch, Faster now, it starts to switch. What has drawn your keen-eyed stare? Though I look, there\u2019s nothing there. Pocket panther, wild and tame, Pouncing on your unseen game, Now you\u2019re going for the kill\u2014 Hunting is your greatest thrill. Now it\u2019s time to take a nap. Lightly pounce upon my lap. As you dream, you start to purr, While I stroke your midnight fur. ",
