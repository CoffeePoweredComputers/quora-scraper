            "answer_text": "Ask yourself how many English speakers would reply to comments made on their posts in another language? This is a bit of a side bar to your question, but I think it is relevant. The thing many don\u2019t realize is that French USED to be the international language of business, politics and technology. English diplomats spoke French. Treaties were signed in French. Scientists wrote their papers in French. It was the dominant language internationally, not English. And then the world war happened. Not the one in 1914\u20131918 we call the First World War. Rather, the original world war in 1753\u20131760. What North Americans call the French-Indian War, and the Europeans call the Seven Years War. In that war, France (and its allies) fought a worldwide conflict with England (not yet a United Kingdom) and its allies. Battles were fought as far afield as Manilla in the Philippines, Pondicherry in India, Prague, Berlin and Belgium, as well as Nicaragua in Central America and Senegal in Africa, Quebec and upstate New York and across the Caribbean. At the end of it all, France lost. France lost Canada, India, and it lost many colonies in the east indies and Caribbean. It went from being the dominant global power, able to extend its reach almost anywhere, to being a (more or less) regional power concentrated in Europe and northern Africa with some colonies in south-east asia and the Caribbean. The outcome of that war was some heavy taxation by the English to pay for it, which in turn led to a disturbance among some colonists in New England. Fast forward a few hundred years. Those colonists have built a country that dominates worldwide culture with its movies and music. It dominates business and it dominates technology. And oh yeah, they speak English. So French is no longer the language of politics or diplomacy. It is no longer the defacto language of all things cultural and it is certainly no longer the language of business. But it used to be. And most francophones know that. And being French in an English dominated world, that might be a little bit of a sore point, especially when someone just expects you to talk English. It isn\u2019t the only reason, but it may be a big indicator as to why French people (in general) are slightly reticent to speak English, especially when they are \u201cat home\u201d.And when you are commenting on their posts that they made in French, I cannot blame them if they can\u2019t be bothered to respond. Especially if you can\u2019t be bothered to post in French. ",

            "answer_text": "The tags applied to this question suggest that it\u2019s meant to refer to Canadian Francophones specifically, as opposed to Francophones worldwide. If this is true, then the starting assumptions of the questioner are incorrect: Statistics Canada\u2019s 2011 report \u201cLinguistic Characteristics of Canadians\u201d suggests that Canadian Francophones are far more likely to speak English, at least, than their Anglophone counterparts. Between 2006 and 2011, the number of persons who reported that they were able to conduct a conversation in both of Canada's official languages increased by 350,000 to 5.8 million. The English\u2011French bilingualism rate within the overall population went from 17.4% to 17.5%. The growth of English-French bilingualism in Canada was mainly due to the increased number of Quebecers reporting that they were able to conduct a conversation in French and English. Quebec accounted for 90% of the net increase in the number of bilingual persons between 2006 and 2011. In fact, 71% of the net increase in English-French bilingualism in Canada is attributable to the population with French as a mother tongue in Quebec, in particular to the population aged 15 to 49. In Quebec, the English-French bilingualism rate increased from 40.6% in 2006 to 42.6% in 2011. In the other provinces, bilingualism declined slightly. The largest decreases were recorded in Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia, where in each case, the bilingualism rate decreased by half a percentage point. Does this mean that Canadian Francophones are more likely to speak other languages generally than Canadian Anglophones? No. Canadian Anglophones still learn other languages if at a lower rate than their Francophone counterparts. More, immigration has been a relatively more important factor in English Canada than in Qu\u00e9bec for some time, and many people whose main or even native language is English may well have fluency in these non-English, non-French, languages. This does mean, however, that saying Canadian Francophones are reluctant to speak other languages is just not true. If the questioner is wondering about the language laws in Qu\u00e9bec, which (for instance) require prominent signage in the French language and which streams immigrants into the French-language system and generally places a premium on the French language, that\u2019s a different issue. Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Francophones overall have no problems with speaking English of their own free wills, but they just don\u2019t want to be forced to speak English. Although French has fared much better than other long-standing Canadian minority languages like Gaelic, Ukrainian, German, or nearly all First Nations languages, as a minority language that has been traditionally less prestigious than the majority language it faces extra risks. The gap that I described above, between Francophones being commonly fluent in English and Anglophones being only rarely fluent in French, is one of long-standing. Legislative action was judged necessary to try to close the gap and avoid a potentially destabilizing long-term slide of French, I think correctly, and it seems to have worked. ",
