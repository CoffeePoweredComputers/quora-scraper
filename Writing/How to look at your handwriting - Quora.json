He didn\u2019t comply, until the sheriff\u2019s deputies intervened for me, over and over. It took thirty-five days to get my home back all to myself, and two of my cars got smashed up, on purpose, in the interim. Because of him. They still are. My blue convertible, and my burgundy Thunderbird. Next-door neighbors! ",
