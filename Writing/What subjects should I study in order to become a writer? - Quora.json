            "answer_text": "If you're writing features, you won't need the fundamentals in expository writing or any of the developmental stuff, but a course in Novel Writing would be a great place to start. You'll get the basics on story structure, plot, narrative drive, etc.  and receive feedback you'll need as you move through early stages. That's the only coursework I'm going to recommend because there are other things you can be doing that will help you as a novelist. Of course, novel writing is a solitary endeavor. I would revisit your  favorite novel and do a close read. Look at structure and watch for what moves you. Break down the mechanics of the story. Watch the way your (unwitting) mentor handles dialogue attribution. Where do you see major transitions in the story? Where does she take it? What would happen if a pivot point went another way? Start your own writing right there. Write the rest of a paragraph or chapter or the whole book using what your mentor started for you. You will be building from your favorite writer's work. What better place to learn? Find a writer friend who will be honest about what you're doing. Write something and put it down for two weeks. Pick it up again and you'll see the flaws. You will have identified weaknesses and learned from them. When you've done this cycle long enough so that after you've picked up your work and it's perfect, take out another 10 words and maybe you'll be done. Ask your friend (or an editor ... or yourself) if you are. Be as curious about the world as you can be. Study faces, conversations, places, clothing, hygiene, pets, sounds, light reflections, the sound of rain. Sit in Starbucks, glance around and listen. The two people next to you are characters in your next novel. Who are they? What do they do? What clues do you get from their dialogue? Read online news. What's happening in Ukraine? Can you imagine a family sitting there wondering what is to become of them? Give them faces. Names. Google proper names for Ukrainians. Wave your novelist's hand and create a conversation in their kitchen. Write a happy ending. Read good quality expert opinion and guidance on novel writing. Get a copy of Alice LaPlante's The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Creative Writing ... it will transform you.  I would also recommend John Truby's The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller. You're in good hands with those two texts. I've been through this and can report the presence of a fair amount of  shallow and useless sources out there you'll likely wade through  (Writer's Digest et al). Resistance is futile for most of us because we want to self-identify as writers and to take those magazines, and the anemic books that drop off their vines, helps us feel we belong. But turn away \u2014 study with the masters. And write all the time. I think there are writer's groups online that you could join, and later, when your engine is running, you may wish to attend one or some of the many writer conferences that take place all over the U.S. (if that's where you are). I've been doing this a while but we are both on the same journey. I wish you well. ",

            "answer_text": "Like many others have said in the comments, language and grammar is the most important key to writing. However, aside from studying literature there are many other subjects that will help you in your writing (especially for novels) such as: Psychology : I think that if you want to write fiction, it is important to understand human psychology as it\u2019ll help in fleshing out their actions and reactions to situations. Psychology is the study of human behaviors. That is why this is a good subject for those who want to develop their characters more realistically.History : This subject is particularly useful for those wanting to write historical fiction or anything related to wars. Studying history will help you get a sense of how a chain of events come to be and their effects on society. You can even draw inspiration from it.Cultural anthropology/Sociology : If you want to write a story set in an alternative universe, these subject may be vital as those kinds of stories require world building. These subject helps in understanding how society and culture shapes people. Thus, world building might become easier.Screenwriting/Play writing : This subject will help you with the \u201cshow don\u2019t tell\u201d aspect of writing. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to rely on dialogue and symbolism to convey information rather than narration solely. It also helps you come up with better dialogues.Physiology : This subject can be valuable if you want to write realistic injury of illnesses\u2014 especially for a fight scene.Philosophy : You can scrap this off if you want to but I find that it sometimes helps in selecting a theme for your story.",
