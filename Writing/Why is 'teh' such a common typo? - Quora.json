            "answer_text": "I crossed out the typing \"teh\" on purpose reason because I have seen many people, including myself, type \"teh\" by accident in something where we will not intention type \"teh\" in (i.e. research paper, unless this is a research paper on \"teh,\" something everyone writes during their lifetime).I found this out by repeatedly typing \"the\" really fast over and over. It's really hard to coordinate striking \"h\" between striking \"t\" and \"e.\" A couple guesses: possibly something to do with must finish left hand before using right hand or the \"propulsion\" from hitting \"t\" makes striking \"e\" half complete while striking \"h\" requires a \"full propulsion.\"",

            "answer_text": "It is sometimes used deliberately. As a mistake, I think it happens because \"the\" is a very common word and we've become used to typing it really quickly. But, most people hit the 't' and 'h' with different hands but its hard to coordinate the right order at such high speed. ",
