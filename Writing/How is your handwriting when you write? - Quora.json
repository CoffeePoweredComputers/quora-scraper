            "answer_text": "My cursive handwriting is not quite as neat and tight as it was when I wrote out things by hand every day, but it is still quite decent and easy to read. Old habits of writing in a neat and legible hand come right back if I spend any significant time doing it, though. I occasionally jot things down using manuscript but I readily switch to using cursive for anything more than a couple of words because it is easier and quicker for me to produce and my cursive looks much neater. I went all the way through university (earning my B.A. in 1978) and grad school (MSW in 1983) in the pre-digital era. During the course of my post-secondary education alone I filled several thick notebooks with handwritten class notes and several reams of handwritten term papers every academic year. In that time I probably wrote enough linear feet, meters, or furlongs to stretch from the Earth to the Moon and back at least a few times, or so it felt. My cursive writing got lots of use. Like everyone else in that era, I had a large and prominent callous on the first knuckle of the middle finger of my writing hand, which was where the lower end of the pen would fit as I wrote. I attended a Catholic parochial school from grades 1 through 8 and another Catholic school for part of high school. The claim that former Catholic school students have much neater and appreciably more legible handwriting than their counterparts who attended public schools has definitely been born out in my experience. My wife attended public schools for all but a very brief portion of her K-12 education and my best friend never attended parochial school at all. Like me, both were raised as Catholics. My wife is a wonderful person in all respects, but her handwriting can be most charitably described as sloppy. Even after more than 40 years of reading it I still have trouble deciphering some of the words she writes. My friend\u2019s handwriting looks like it was produced by a caveman who had only just discovered that he could make marks on a piece of paper with this magical stick. I have never known anyone else who needed two or three whole lines and the entire width of a ruled sheet of notebook paper to scrawl out three whole words while writing out a long note. Yet he and I attended university together, after which he went on to earn a masters degree and then went on to have a successful career in human services as a therapist and later as an administrator. Meanwhile my sister who, like me, is the product of many years of Catholic school, still has cursive handwriting even today that is so beautiful and elegant it will make you weep. And I also have a sister-in-law who writes in a very neat but extremely petite cursive hand that you need a magnifying glass to read. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, my handwriting look like these 1st handwriting. I use it quite often, when I am not in a rush\u2026  2nd handwriting, I use when I am in a hurry  But this is when I am not rushing too much\u2026 Here's how it looks like when I am rushing  So as you can see it not all perfect. What I would recommend is, find the most comfortable way to hold the pen or pencil and the rest will be easier. Try to write write legibly if you can. That's about it. You just have to practice more and more to make it look as you desire. Thank you, Kusi, Ruben ",
