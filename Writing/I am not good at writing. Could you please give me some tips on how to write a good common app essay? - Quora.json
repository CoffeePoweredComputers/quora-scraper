            "answer_text": "I have some good news for you\u2014you do not need to be the best technical writer. Instead, you need to be a compelling storyteller. The great thing about storytelling is that anyone can do it. After all, storytelling is based on your personal life experiences (which makes you your own personal expert). Here are a few tips on tapping into your own storytelling abilities: -Start by brainstorming a trait, characteristics, learning, or growth that you want to share with the admissions officer. Your personal essay should reveal something important about you, so make sure you keep this in mind. -Once you generate a list of 5\u201310 different items, think about specific \u201cmoments\u201d or times when you demonstrated those particular traits, learnings, etc. For instance if \u201ckindness\u201d or \u201cempathy\u201d are characteristics that you want to highlight, perhaps you could talk about an experience sitting next to the new kid at school so they wouldn\u2019t sit alone at lunch or when you stayed after your soccer practice to help the team manager clean up. These \u201cmoments\u201d don\u2019t have to be the most amazing or incredible life experiences. Instead, they can be very every day types of situations. That\u2019s the beauty of storytelling. At this point, you should have a really solid list of moments to work with! I also wanted to mention that platforms like StoryBuilder are a great way to take these moments and turn them into powerful admissions essays. Best of luck! ",
