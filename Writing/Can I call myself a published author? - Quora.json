            "answer_text": "You can call yourself anything you want, but if you call yourself a writer and people find out you either haven\u2019t written anything or that you\u2019ve self-published it, they\u2019ll just roll their eyes at you. Let me change that a little. The whole business is massively in flux right now and if I were to give you the standard answer from just a few years ago, I\u2019d come off as a pompous idiot. Nowadays you can self-publish stuff and be considered a real published author, but your stuff would have to be read by a significant number of people and you\u2019d have to make some money in the process. Let me change that a little too. If your stuff is getting published by a university press or a small press you\u2019d be considered a real published author, even if you never see a centavo in earnings. A buddy of mine has published easily a dozen books by different university presses and other small publishing houses and yeah, he\u2019s a real published author. But somebody thinks enough of his writings that they spend their money putting his writing into print. But if you\u2019re doing it all on your nickel and nobody is buying and nobody is reading it, you\u2019re not really a published writer, you\u2019re just a fool and his (or her) monkey! ",

There are still a few authors(usually published through traditional publishing houses, who might take offense), but in my book you\u2019re a published author. My qualifications are I went the self publishing route(not vanity), so I\u2019m in the same boat as you, and may have to question my merits as an author. In the meantime I have 7 of them out there and even sold a few. If doing a book will make you feel better about your credentials as an author. You could put some of your magazine stuff in a print on demand paperback book, upload it to Amazon/Kindle at no cost, then turn around and do it again as an e book. Now you are a published author of at least 3 mediums! Thanks! Robert ",

            "answer_text": "If you have published something and in regular fashion, yes! One novel or one non-fiction book, whether or not you did it self-published then you are an author. When it comes to publishing in magazines, or on a blog, or even answering questions on Quora, then you can only call yourself a published writer. The mediums in which you write are the defining feature of whether you are a writer or an author. Publish books, short stories, poetry and you can say you are a published author. If you publish short stories in literary magazines and have a body of work to show, if you stipulate to short story writing then you can call yourself a published short story author, and same goes with poetry in magazines, although the term you would use would be \u201cpublished poet\u201d.

Does this qualify as \u201cpublished author\u201d or is this reserved for book writers? Nope. I got published long before I had a book come out, published for royalties. Only when I held a copy of that book was I an author. Those other clips were merely clips and meant f**** S*** regarding being an author. When someone calls him or herself an author, the next question is \u2018what books have you had published.\u2019 Heck, I was stunned that people who pay vanity presses could be called authors, and those who only have ebooks! Talk about stolen glory!  and this one I got for selling a magazine article, and magazines sorta are like books, being made of paper with ink on them, so I\u2019m an Author! ",

Published author, at least here in the U.S., is usually reserved for writers who have published a book, and it doesn't matter if it's self published or not. That said, what you could most definitely call yourself is a published writer because that's what you are. Good luck and congratulations on your success as a writer. I hope this helps:) ",
