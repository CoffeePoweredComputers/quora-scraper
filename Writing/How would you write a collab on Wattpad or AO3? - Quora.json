            "answer_text": "Speaking for myself, I've done a number of collaborations on AO3. My favorite, and I believe the most efficient way to do so is for one writer to create a Google document and share it with the other writer. Make sure to share it with editing privileges allowed. Docs has its own chat function and both writers can also add notes about their thoughts and plans on what they've added or plan to add as well as on what the other has written. It's by far the easiest way for multiple people to collaborate, communicate and edit all in one place. There are many free add-ons that help with writing, like spelling and grammar tools, foreign language translation, word count, thesaurus and dictionary, etc. Docs also uploads to AO3 very easily, which is an added bonus.
