            "answer_text": "Purpose in academic writing, first of all, is important for a writer. It is necessary to specify a purpose if you want your academic writing to be successful. The purpose provides writers with the question to which he or she has to answer on the pages of their academic essay. It is too easy to mislead and begin to write about indirect problems which are faintly relying on the main idea of your work. The clear purpose of your work is a key to make a deep research with ease as obscure purpose is the common reason of all failed researches. Furthermore, the purpose of academic work, as a rule, is a part of its title. Like a purpose, it needs to be clear. The main value of academic writing is finding the answer and sharing it with the scientific community, not thinking about something and discussing it with colleagues. To create a specific purpose, it is useful to pay attention to such words like \u201csummarize\u201d, \u201canalyze\u201d, etc. They help you to write a great essay because you will be able to complete your true purpose using them.

            "answer_text": "Purpose is essential in every kind of writing. There\u2019s something I\u2019ve written about in several of my books on documentation. When you\u2019re planning a writing project, you always need to know why you\u2019re doing it and what you hope to accomplish by doing so. (As a corollary, you also need to know who you\u2019re doing it for so you can best tailor your message to them.) This can be summed up rather neatly by something I call Magid\u2019s Law (after Paul Magid of the Flying Karamazov Brothers\u2014long irrelevant story): \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you get there if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.\u201d Always keep this rule in mind when you\u2019re planning a writing project (or any project, really). If you don\u2019t have a purpose, a goal, something to say, it really doesn\u2019t matter how you accomplish a piece of writing because by that criterion it doesn\u2019t have to accomplish anything. :) ",
