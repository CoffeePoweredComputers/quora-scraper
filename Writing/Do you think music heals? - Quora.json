            "answer_text": "Yes. For spiritual, emotional, mental and physical reasons. There is no argument that I have found that says that music does not have a profound affect on the spirit or the soul. It can be used for invoking courage, expressing extreme grief and anguish, as well as exuberant celebration, something that resonates with the depth of the human experience. This is very healthy because it creates a sense of connection and community, whether realized or not. Emotionally, it allows for a wide range if expression, and is necisary for the acknowledgement and acceptance of our emotions. Mentally, it creates pleasing and complex patterns or rythems that are immidiatly memorized and stored in the mind. Studies have shown that people who listen, memorize, and play music are less likely to develop altimers. Physically, music activates many parts of the brain - nurrons that are necisary for forming other connections. like a mucle, the more these pathways are used, the stronger they become. That is why doing activities to music such as dancing is so benifical to your health, and often improves things such as ballance, coordination, and speed at a faster rate than doing the same activities without music.
