            "answer_text": "Wring tasks are graded on the content, arguments used, clarity of ideas, flow, structure, and if you were able to answer what was askedThere are many links on Net with a list of writing topics. Pick at least 1 topic (Task 1 and Task 2) daily and write about itTime yourself on two aspects:After reading a topic, how much time you spend organizing your thoughts i.e. what to write before you start writingHow much time you actually spend writingWrite, write and write:You may think that some topics are too easy and just thinking about what you will write is enough. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. Write your thoughts and you will realize that the content which seems easy enough in mind isn\u2019t same on paperWriting more also helps you as you will not cramp yourself in the paper and your handwriting will be bit better (this is based on assumption that many of us don\u2019t use pen/pencil anymore. Don\u2019t sweat this if you are a student and write a lot)After you are done with your initial drafts, read them, and re-write. Edit them. Think of how the structure or flow could have been betterIf you have to use \u201cword checker\u201d a lot, try to improve your spellingsIf you have used a word repeatedly, try to find synonyms for itFor Task 1, it is a good idea to cover the 3 separate points in 3 separate paragraphFor Task 2, break paragraphs when you move to a different side of the argument or want to present another anglePractice with a target of words in each line so that by the time you have to appear for the test you have mastered writing 8\u201310 words in a line. This way you won\u2019t have to count your word limit and waste time in the actual testDepend on you comfort level, you can also write a draft first on the question paper before writing the final answer in the answer sheetUse pencil in the final exam. If you have make a mistake, you can correct it immediately and it doesn\u2019t look shoddy with words in ink crossed overWriting in \u201cAll CAPS\u201d is not requiredBe mindful of the time. I cannot stress this enough, time really runs out. I was able to finish my tasks with only 2 min to spareHope this helps.All the best!!!  Image source - RES ",

            "answer_text": "Your score denotes that you need to work on vocabulary, sentence formations and a little bit of grammar. First, get as many samples of 8 or 9 band writing you can find. Read all those samples, underline new vocabulary words, new phrases or idioms. Make notes of all the samples. Also pay attention to the formatting of the essay- length of paragraph, when to change the paragraph and how to effectively put your simple thoughts into writing. As you read more and more writing samples, you will get an idea where you are lagging behind. Another important thing- hire a good teacher to get your writing essay corrected, to help you with grammar, vocabulary and boost your confidence. ",
