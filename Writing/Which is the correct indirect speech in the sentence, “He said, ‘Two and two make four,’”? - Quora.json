( Indirect speech ) He said, \u201c Joggery was not sweet.\u201d ( Direct Speech ) He said that Joggery was not sweet. ( Indirect speech ) Note : In Modern English this rule is not strictly followed.

            "answer_text": "The choice is between make and makes on the one hand and make and made on the other. Taking two and two as one unit, the word 'makes' appears to be the correct verb. Since two and two makes four everyday-- today, tomorrow and yesterday, a phenomenon otherwise known as the universal truth, makes remains unchanged in the direct as well as indirect speech. The answer is: He said that two and two makes four. ",
