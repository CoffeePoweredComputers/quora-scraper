            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. The short answer is no. Apple does not give this kind of low level file access on iOS. If you\u2019ve activated iCloud Photo Library, it\u2019s possible to manually give titles to photos via icloud.com/#photos or the Photos app on a Mac. For more info on this, visit: Damien Schreurs's answer to How do I rename photos in iCloud?Third-party cloud storage solutions, like Dropbox and OneDrive will rename the photos and videos if you activate their automatic upload feature. For instance, Dropbox renames files using the date and time of creation with the following convention: YYYY-MM-DD hh.mm.ss.png So a photo taken on the 31st July 2017 at 10:30pm would be named \u201c2017\u201307\u201331 22.30.00.png\u201d Hope this helps!

I haven't attempted this in iOS 13 yet as that does have more file access than iOS 12 did and previous. Maybe someone with an iOS 13 iPhone can chime in with a better answer. ",
