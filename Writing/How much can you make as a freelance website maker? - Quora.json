            "answer_text": "As with all things, it depends. I think if I quit my job and did full-time freelance, I could probably make around $100k working roughly 40 hr weeks. That, however, is based on my personal skill and connections that I've gotten building websites over the past decade. Since you're asking the question, you probably do not have the experience to earn that much unless you're either very connected or very good at selling yourself. Your mileage will vary based on a number of factors: Skill & Experience: What you can charge clients is primarily based on your skill and their perception of you as someone who will \"get the job done.\" There a LOT of web programmers and web companies out there that are terrible. No one wants to get burned like that, so a solid portfolio, or open source work can go a long way to alleviate those fears.  Either Have a Team or Be a Team: What I mean is that no client is going to hire you to program their site, then go hire a designer separately. They want you to \"just build it.\" Actually, if someone does want to do that, turn the job down. Find a couple designers you like, get a feel for their rates, and just offer it all as one package. Or learn to design yourself, and pocket it all. Learn about different vendors, frameworks, and solutions, so you can offer their services as part of your package, even if you're just installing vBulletin or plugging into Amazon Payments. Getting Work: The key to freelance revenue is to stay working. Work begets work, and sometimes it's worth it to take a job on the cheap if the experience will help you get jobs in the future. I do not mean more work from that company, I mean experience with particular technologies that you can then add to your repertoire and portfolio. A company that wants you to do this project cheap on the promise of future work, is just promising future cheap work. Don't fall for it. Bill For Yourself, Not For The Client: I think most important thing to keep in mind is that not all work is equal. I *never* give hourly rates. I give project quotes with deadlines, and that's it. I charge more if I'm busy, or if I think the project is boring, or if I think the client is going to be \"one of those clients\" that micromanages or is going to require 1000 revisions. Also, don't be afraid to turn down work. It's really easy to burn out doing freelance, so sell yourself as a premium product (assuming you are), and stay sane. If you bill a big website as $30k, and the client says it's only worth $8k, turn it down. It's scary to turn down work when you're freelance, since you don't typically know when the next job will come about, but getting wrapped up in a nightmare project (and you probably will pull one or two) for shit pay is pretty soul-crushing. This was a pretty general question, but if you have more specific questions, feel free to hit me up. ",

            "answer_text": " HOURLY RATE Reasonably skilled freelance web designers make about $75 per hour. This figure can vary though, according to CSS-Tricks. Website Builder Expert estimates that the cost to design a website is $30 to $80 per hour and the cost to develop it is $100 to $180 per hour. Freelancers typically make a higher rate than in-house web designers because they don\u2019t receive health insurance and other perks that employees receive. Freelancers also have much less job security. They go from contract to contract. A higher rate compensates them for the lack of long-term commitment from clients. A few factors determine whether a freelancer will charge more or less than $75 per hour: \u00b7 Pet projects. A freelancer might offer a nonprofit, a friend or family a lower rate. \u00b7 Project length. Long-term projects might deserve a slightly lower hourly rate. \u00b7 Project difficulty. Will you need help from a programmer, developer or graphic designer? Charge more. Is the project similar to another one you did? If you can copy and paste much of your past work, charge less (unless you don\u2019t want to). \u00b7 Page count. More pages to design means more work. Extras like a blog or an e-commerce component can cost more, too. \u00b7 Commitment level. If you can only put in a few hours work here and there instead of committing to the project full time, consider lowering your price. \u00b7 New or old client. Some web designers will charge a new client less to land the project, though this might set a bad precedent. FLAT RATE Clients love paying web designers flat rates because they know exactly how much they\u2019ll pay upfront. Web design freelancers hate flat rates because you can never be 100 percent sure how long a project will take, especially if the client asks for endless changes, according to CSS-Tricks. It\u2019s a good idea to question the client extensively before providing prices to make sure you understand their budget and project requirements. Here\u2019s a basic web design price list: Setup: $160 Design and building: $5,000 Content creation: $500 Client training: $600 Maintenance: 500 Total: $6,760 Flat Rate The average cost of basic website creation by a freelance website designer is $6,760, according to Website Builder Expert. This cost only covers the first year. That said, each cost can vary. Setup can cost as little as $50 and go as high as $200, depending on the website domain cost and other factors. A custom website design will cost $5,000 at minimum and can go upwards of $10,000. Content creation varies from $500 to $5,000 depending on how much content the client wants. And the annual cost of website maintenance costs about $500 to $1,000. ",
