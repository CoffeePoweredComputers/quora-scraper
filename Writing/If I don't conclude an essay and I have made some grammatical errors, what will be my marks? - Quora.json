            "answer_text": "That depends on your teacher. Some may take off points for each error. Others distinguish between \"occasional errors\" and \"frequent errors\", and the latter will definitely impact your grade. Lack of a conclusion is a structural flaw and could cost you. Always try to at least include a closing sentence that restates the thesis, so that technically there is something there. Honestly, it all depends on your teacher, and whether your content is impressive enough to outweigh your errors. Ask if your teacher has a rubric for the class. That is a chart or list that tells you exactly what the standards are for each grading level. Here is the rubric for the SAT essay, a four point scoring system, to give you an idea of how these work: \u2014\u2014- One Point Demonstrates little or no cohesion and inadequate skill in the use and control of language May lack a clear central claim or controlling idea Lacks a recognizable introduction and conclusion; does not have a discernible progression of ideas Lacks variety in sentence structures; sentence structures may be repetitive; demonstrates general and vague word choice; word choice may be poor or inaccurate; may lack a formal style and objective tone Shows a weak control of the conventions of standard written English and may contain numerous errors that undermine the quality of writing Two Points Demonstrates little or no cohesion and limited skill in the use and control of language May lack a clear central claim or controlling idea or may deviate from the claim or idea May include an ineffective introduction and/or conclusion; may demonstrate some progression of ideas within paragraphs but not throughout Has limited variety in sentence structures; sentence structures may be repetitive; demonstrates general and vague word choice; word choice may be repetitive; may deviate noticeably from a formal style and objective tone Shows a limited control of the conventions of standard written English and contains errors that detract from the quality of writing and may impede understanding Three Points Is mostly cohesive and demonstrates effective use and control of language Includes a central claim or implicit controlling idea Includes an effective introduction and conclusion; demonstrates a clear progression of ideas both within paragraphs and throughout the essay Has variety in sentence structures; demonstrates some precise word choice; maintains a formal style and objective tone Shows a good control of the conventions of standards written English and is free of significant errors that detract from the quality of writing Four Points Is cohesive and demonstrates highly effective use and command of language Includes a precise central claim Includes a skillful introduction and conclusion; demonstrates a deliberate and highly effective progression of ideas both within paragraphs and throughout the essay Has a wide variety in sentence structures; demonstrates consistent use of precise word choice; maintains a formal style and objective tone Shows a strong command of the conventions of standards written English and is free or virtually free of errors ",
