            "answer_text": "In my book, Hello, Startup, I have a primer on equity that explains the basics of how it all works. Here are some excerpts: Equity primer Imagine two friends start a company. Each one wants to own 50% of the company, but how do they keep track of that? What they need is some sort of convenient mechanism that lets them track ownership of the company and how it changes over time as they sell parts of the company to investors or employees. For modern companies, that mechanism is stock, where each share of stock represents the ownership of a small fraction of the company. In the past, companies would print the stock information on paper, called stock certificates, but these days, most stock information is maintained digitally.  For example, the two founders can decide that ownership of the company will be represented by 10 million shares of stock, with each founder getting 5 million shares. The number of shares is completely arbitrary and the founders could have just as easily decided to represent the company with 1000 shares or 1 billion shares. However, you need to know the total number of shares (usually read as shares outstanding) to know what percentage of the company you own: in our example, each founder owns 5 million shares out of 10 million shares outstanding, or 50% of the company.  How do employees get stock?  Now imagine the two founders want to start hiring. One of the incentives they can offer employees is to own a part of the company. This is typically done by issuing new stock to give out as compensation. For example, the founders may create a pool of 1 million shares that they set aside for hiring. They create this stock out of thin air (like printing money!), but note that there are now 11 million shares outstanding, and as each founder still has 5 million shares, they now own 45% of the company instead of 50%. This reduction in ownership is known as dilution.  Existing stockholders get diluted every time the company issues new stock for hiring or to give out to investors. This may seem like a bad deal for the founders, but the bet is that hiring new people or taking on more investment will make the company more valuable and more than make up for the dilution. For example, let's say the company was valued at $500,000 before the co-founders start hiring, so each co-founder owns $250,000. After issuing 1 million shares of stock for hiring, they are able to hire 5 employees, who help raise the value of the company up to $1 million. Due to dilution, each co-founder now owns a smaller percentage of the company (45% instead of 50%), but the smaller percentage is actually worth much more ($450,000 instead of $250,000). In other words, as a stockholder, it's OK to own smaller slice of the pie, as long as the entire pie gets bigger.  [...] What is vesting?  You usually don't get all the shares up front, but instead, they are distributed to you over a period of time. This is known as \"vesting\" and a typical vesting schedule lasts 4 years: you get 25% of the shares after the first year and then the remaining 75% are evenly distributed over the following 36 months. The idea is to use the equity as an incentive to keep you at the company longer, so you can't quit on your second day and walk away with 100,000 shares. Typically, everyone at the company, including the co-founders, is subject to a vesting schedule.  What are stock options?  Even as you vest, the company doesn't just hand the stock to you. Typically, what you're actually vesting are stock options, which are the right to purchase (AKA \"exercise\") the stock at a fixed price called the \"strike price\". The strike price represents the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the stock at the time you got your offer. Where does the FMV come from? Usually, it is determined by the Board of Directors based on a process known as the 409A valuation.  For example, if the 409A valued the company at $1.1 million, the strike price would be $1,100,000 / 11,000,000 shares = $0.10 per share. After working at the company for 4 years, you will have vested all of your stock options, but you won't be able to do anything with them until you exercise them. To exercise all of your stock options, you'd have to pay 100,000 * $0.10 = $10,000. Only after exercising your shares can you actually sell them. Your goal, of course, is to sell them for much more than you paid.  How do you sell your stock?  Initially, shares of stock are worth nothing, since you can't sell them to  anyone (they are not \"liquid\"). There are 2 types of \"liquidity events\" (AKA \"exits\") by which the stock becomes valuable:   IPO: an \"Initial Public Offering\" is when the company sells its stock to the public. IPOs help companies raise money and allow the shareholders (the co-founders, employees, and investors) to sell their stock to the market. Acquisition: when a company is acquired, another company buys the stock from your company's shareholders (i.e., the co-founders, employees, and investors) for cash, their own stock, or some mix of both. For example, let's say after 4 years, you exercised your shares for $10,000  (100,000 * $0.10). If your company had an IPO and the stock price went to $10/share, you would be able to sell your shares for 100,000 * $10 = $1 million. Similarly, if your company was acquired, the acquirer may agree to pay $5/share for your stock, in which case you would get 100,000 * $5 = $500,000.

            "answer_text": "Equity can be structured in a number of ways. Typically, the articles of incorporation of the company will authorize that a number of shares can be issued.  Not all of those shares will actually exist, however; the bylaws will make the board of directors responsible for allocating those shares to key employees, the stock option pool, etc. Typically, founders receive common stock directly, and the company has the right to buy back those shares for their original price.  That right-of-repurchase then lapses over time (usually 4 years), which is called, \"vesting.\"  The vesting is usually structured so that after 1 year, the company loses rights to 25% of the issued shares.  This is a \"cliff.\"  After that, a portion of the shares (2.08%) vest every month, so that after 4 years, the company no longer has any right to buy back shares.  This structure is favorable for founders, as you own the stock outright, can vote the shares, and can file an 83(b) election with the IRS so that the clock for long-term capital gains starts right away.  It also means that if your co-founder leaves the company for any reason, then the company simply buys back all or a portion of the stock, based on how long your co-founder was at the company.  This protects the company from a bad founder. The employees of the company are often issued stock options.  Those come from a stock options pool that is typically in the range of 10% to 20% of the authorized shares.  Employee stock options also usually vest on a 4 year schedule, based on the employee start date. Advisors to the company, directors, and possibly other important people may receive warrants, which are basically just options except they don't come out of the stock options pool; new shares are created to issue the warrants, so they are technically dilutive.  Typically, advisors receive between 0.1% and 2.0% of the company, depending on how valuable they are.  If they bring in $1 million in angel money, they're easily worth 2.0%.  If they just help you understand how business works generally (i.e. not specific to your industry) and can connect you with a few good contacts, then maybe that's a 0.1% advisor. This brings us to investors.  Angel investment can be structured as \"convertible debt.\"  What this means is that it acts like the company is issuing a bond, and that bond may convert to new shares of common stock based on various triggers (e.g. sale of the company).  Such bonds (a.k.a. \"notes\", \"paper\") will dilute the shares of existing stock holders, it just won't happen immediately.  The notes will also have a \"cap\" which is essentially a maximum valuation for the company.  If the company raises money at a valuation that exceeds the cap, then the angel investors are issued additional shares to prevent further dilution. When venture capital firms invest, typically the company will issue a new series of shares, which are \"Series A Preferred\" or similarly named.  These are issued above and beyond the originally authorized shares, so it dilutes the shares of all previous investors.  It also requires a lot of paperwork.  The preferred series of shares will definitely have special rights attached to them that make them pay out more than common stock.  You will also have to give seats on the board of directors to the VCs. Now, as to how much you should give a co-founder, there's probably a thousand answers on Quora for that question, and they're all different.  My advice is to consider equity as mostly compensation for risk taken.  I consider the \"value brought to the table\" portion to be comparatively minor at the formation of the company.  Whatever you decide, do not make a 50/50 split.  You need one person who is the clear decision-maker/tie-breaker.  They need 1 more share than anyone else.  This means that if you and three friends start a company, and you want everyone to have 1/4 of the shares, then you still need to give 1 extra share to a designated tie-breaker.  I say this to make clear that you don't need one person to have 51% (total control), you just need a way to make decisions without dead-lock. The other answers have mentioned AngelList.  I find that AngelList is a good resource for getting an idea of what to pay employees, but still under-represents market value, since what you see is only a \"starting bid\" for a potential employee.  It is not a good resource for determining how much equity to give a founder. Thanks for the A2A and I hope you find this helpful. ",
