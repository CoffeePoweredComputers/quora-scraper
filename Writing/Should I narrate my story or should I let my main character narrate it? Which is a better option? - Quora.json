            "answer_text": "The difference is the point of view. If the main character narrates the story, it's called first person P.O.V. He or she can only relate to the audience what he or she sees, hears, or experiences. Anything outside of the character's reach remains unknown. This works well for mysteries and detective stories in which the audience tries to play along with the detective to beat him or her to the answer. When the author narrates his own story, it's more likely omniscient P.O.V. , all knowing, all seeing. Every piece of the story, no matter if it happens on different continents, is related to the audience. This works well to develope the character of your villain. Which is better? Both work well, but it is your story. It is totally up to you. Which point of view do YOU enjoy reading most? ",

            "answer_text": "Letting your character narrate it tends to be engaging and allows your character to reveal himself/herself in a natural fashion. It also becomes interesting when the reader suspects that the narrator might be lying about some things, or might have misperceived some things. The big disadvantage of the first-person (character-narrated) story is the limited viewpoint involved \u2014 if the character didn\u2019t see it, how does he or she know about it? The authorial narrator can see everything, can know everything, and is assumed to be telling the truth (unless the authorial narrator is also a character and thus may be unreliable.) ",

And\u2026extra credit: what would happen if your narrator main character were to lie to us? ",

            "answer_text": "I prefer writing in the third person point of view, meaning you narrating the story, this gives more freedom in expressing and giving more details and you can basically talk about any of the characters comfortably. But it is not always ideal. Sometimes it is better if it is the main character narrating the story, that is, first person POV. I would suggest that you consider if most of the story and scenes have to do with the main character or if there are a lot more other scenes without the main character. This would give you a better view on which way is best for the narration. Happy writing. :) ",

If you are narrating your story, you are writing an essay or a memoir. Not a story. ",

You might try writing a few scenes twice- in both voices- to see which works better for you. Which is easier to write? Which feels more natural? Is dramatic irony important? (It's not going to work in the first person. ) I also find it useful to put the writing aside for a couple of weeks and then read it with fresh eyes to get a better take on what works best for the reader.

The story will inevitably take on a different slant depending on the narration you use, so chose the one that suits your style of writing. I really enjoyed getting into the head of the protagonist in my book. If I\u2019d written it in 3rd person I wouldn\u2019t have been able to explain his actions in quite the same way. You should definitely experiment with both techniques. ",

            "answer_text": "The best results most often come from the third person limited viewpoint, in which the narrator tells and shows only what the viewpoint character knows and experiences. The narrator thus becomes effectively invisible, so you get the intimacy of first person without the inevitable time distance and artificiality that first person brings. (While first person present tense is absurd, a constant annoyance to reader and writer, burying the story in artificiality.) First person from a character forces us to see the character as someone who could or would write a book. We also know that as he writes, he already knows the outcome, so any suspense is deliberately created by him. Whereas third person limited, even though past tense, is always in the moment, because as the narrative unfolds, the viewpoint character has no idea how things will come out. A good enough story will pull at least some readers past any number of narrative mistakes. Just remember that first person feels easy starting out, but it's far harder to do well at any length. ",
