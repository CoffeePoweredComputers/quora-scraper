            "answer_text": "If your blog isn\u2019t open to comments, it is not a blog. It is a static website. And your blogging is merely a set of articles, preaching and promoting rather than giving your readers the chance to have their say about what you\u2019ve written. Blogs arose because they allowed comments to be published instantaneously. In the beginning Web2.0 included the ability to comment. This was way before the rise of social media, so blog commenting was used correctly: the reader could communicate with the blogger about what they had read in situ underneath the post they referred to. The comment was published immediately, as no moderation was needed because there was very little spam, and replies were able to be instant as well. Now everything has changed, not only because of spam, but because of haters and trolls. Moving engagement and interaction to social media, which is totally in real-time and not moderated, means anyone and everyone can comment, good, bad and ugly. However, blogs should remain open to comments. These responses should bear in mind the delay due to moderation, and the lack of real-time replies. Popular blogs can only open their comments for a set period to beat the spammers. But moderation keeps comments clean and relevant. The comments themselves are longer, more considered and worth reading. A blog that is closed to comments has no sense of community with its readers. If your audience feels it doesn\u2019t \u2018belong\u2019, they won\u2019t return to read your posts, let alone comment on them. The blogger won\u2019t know what their readers think, or what they want to read about. The readers won\u2019t be able to communicate with the blogger, and the ability to form a blogging relationship will have been lost. In addition this results in no recommendation, sharing and advocacy. Oh, and I forgot to add that getting lots of comments on a blog proves its popularity and social credibility. Search engines are looking for blogs with lots of comments, because their algorithms are trained to connect popularity with excellent content, which must be worth indexing. And social credibility encourages more visitors and ultimately more comments, which increases page ranking and domain authority for your blog. Consider this: you read a fabulous post, and this sparks an idea or you can relate it to an experience you have had. You look for the comment box at the bottom of the post, but there isn\u2019t one. All your enthusiasm fired up by the post implodes, leaving you feeling neglected, hard-done-by, rejected. You never bother visiting that blog again, and the blogger has lost yet another reader, all because they have prevented the chance to communicate in the form of comments. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes to certain extent because it allows your followers to communicate or show you how their feedback towards what you have written in your blog. The way you interact with those comment will bring more people in viewing your blog and it will help your blog ranking in the search engine. No to certain extent because comment is not the only way you use to boost your ranking or interact with your followers. You can install an opt-in box on your blog and invite people to sign up or subscribe to your blog by offering something free and useful for them . It depends on what is your blog about . For example, if your blog is on cooking, just offer them one or few recipes, then it will build up motivation for your viewers to subscribe and become your list. Since everybody knows that the money is in the list. Once you have their email , you can sell them whatever you want in the long run and these are your real targeted market but not those in the comment box. ",
