There are fanfiction websites out there for you to publish your story on, such as FanFiction, Archive of Our Own etc. You won\u2019t make any money off of it of course. Harry Potter is owned by JK Rowling and the characters and settings all belong to her. Don\u2019t try doing anything else unless you have a burning desire to be sued. (And I would heartily approve. HP is HER property. Don\u2019t steal.) ",
