            "answer_text": "In the Book, Rambo wants to die, so he commits suicide by cop in the end of the book. They wanted to change things around, and leave the possibility for a sequel, by not killing him off, but sparing him from death by allowing himself to be arrested by Colonel Trautman. Even though he suffered police brutality from the cops he went on a rampage, stole a motorcycle, killed several police officers, and went on a vigilante spree which led him to break into a weapons shop and steal munitions. What are you, a humble and unaware citizen watching the news to see what is happening in the world, going to say when you find out that a crazy and psychotic drifter went on a spree and killed police and harmed others over the course of a crazy day? That\u2019s the point, we do not take time to understand the stories of the veterans. Many of them returned with PTSD and were not the same. We do not treat veterans with much respect other than give them a medal and tell them they did a great job. What do we do for them after they come home? ",

            "answer_text": "As sympathetic John Rambo is, he still did enough damage (which sadly enough, saying a bunch of law enforcement officers were total assholes to him ultimately isn't enough to defend his case) that if it weren't for Trautman talking him down, things would have gotten to the point of no return with a pile of bodies at the end. All in all, it was pretty much a downer with only a slight bit of hope because all Rambo really needed was someone to talk to, to unload all the baggage he kept inside since coming back from the Vietnam War. He essentially had little to no friends left that relate to him and Sheriff Teasle may be doing his job but it soon got way too personal between them as the situation escalates. That small ray of hope is the fact someone who knows Rambo finally got to talk to him and get him to stand down before shit really hits the fan. \u2026Admittedly it is kinda weird the sequels became straight up action flicks with maybe a few scenes going back to this theme as Rambo looks for a reason to stick around in life.
