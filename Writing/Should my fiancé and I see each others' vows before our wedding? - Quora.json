            "answer_text": "My wife and I did this. We wrote our own vows and read them to each other a few days before the wedding ceremony. I'm really happy with the way it worked out and I think there were several advantages to this approach: 1. We felt like we were on the same page and there were no surprises. Even though we'd agreed to ground rules beforehand (no quotes, no making fun of the other person), it was nice to hear each others' vows and know that we were both using the same tone and were comfortable with what the other person was saying. 2. It made our vows better. Of course, we could have gotten feedback from other people, but I think we were very well-situated to give notes to each other because we were both going through the exact same process at the exact same time. 3. It made our delivery better during the ceremony. For one, we had both practiced,  and we'd done it in front of the most important audience- each other. Additionally, since we'd already heard each other's vows and processed them, we weren't as nervous or emotional during the ceremony and were able to deliver our own more clearly.  I realize #3 might sound a little cold, but actually I felt the opposite. I don't think I would have been able to fully process what my wife was saying during the actual ceremony because of all the people surrounding us and the general state of excitement and being \"in the zone\" that accompanies getting married. But when we were sitting in our apartment the week before the wedding, and exchanging vows one-on-one, it felt incredibly intimate and close. This is, of course, the general tradeoff you make. I can see the appeal to some people of wanting to hear the vows for the first time in front of the crowd at your wedding and have an authentic \"first\" reaction. For us, we were happy to do that part as a couple beforehand and to help each other craft our vows. I think you can't really go wrong here. ",

            "answer_text": "As a relationship coach, I find your question begs a few others that may well be worth your while (and your fianc\u00e9's) to look at. Could we see a vow as the deepest commitment of love from your heart and mind to your partner and to the marriage? If so, do you want to wait until your wedding to hear your partner reveal these things to you? Or, for that matter, do you want your partner to have to wait until the wedding day to know your promises? What if your partner isn't thinking the exact same things you are? Will you be OK with that - or would you like to know now so you can create even greater harmony and unity - perhaps by enhancing your vows from having shared them with the other partner? The EXPRESSION of that vow on the day of your wedding...well, I admit regret that I can't be there to see you exchange them. I wish you love, delight, and everything necessary to create a \"fortress for well-being\". ",
