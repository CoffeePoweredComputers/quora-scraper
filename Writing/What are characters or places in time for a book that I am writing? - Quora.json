            "answer_text": "i have a problem with bit players in the stories I write. If the person is in mentioned in, let\u2019s say, three paragraphs, I feel that person needs a name. But the main characters might interact with several bit players and inventing all those names is annoying. I love Fantasy name generators. Names for all your fantasy characters. In the \u2018real names\u2019 category, it will offer English, Korean, Chinese, Tibetan, and many other groups of names. Some other generators (this is from a blog post of mine so the formatting is different from Quoran links): A human name generator. Superhero character generator. Lists of names with meanings. D & D characters. Character appearance generator. Character backstory.A google app: Character story planner. I wasn\u2019t going to offer a link to my blog because I don\u2019t want people to feel they have to visit it for details to my answers here. But I can\u2019t tell if I copied and pasted the links properly. If I did, there\u2019s no need to visit. But if the links don\u2019t work, you must (must!) visit my blog.TWIC: lots of generators, a science of imagination, Gates on NPR I guess I might use some of the generators to start my creative juices flowing or to get me thinking about aspects I normally ignore (I am generally oblivious to fashion choices) but again, I mostly use them for secondary or less important characters. Personally, I would like to read more stories set in Central Asia - it is a huge area with varied terrain but it mostly feels like little more than an annoying place that must be crossed to get to the good stuff. I sometimes get Mayan, Aztecs and Incas mixed up and would love to read stories set in one of those cultures at its prime. Oh, and stay away from Georgian Bay in Ontario Canada because I have a story coming out next year set in that location and I don\u2019t want to share it! ",

            "answer_text": "The news is filled with characters everyday. There are a lot of villains, sometimes there are real heroes. And don\u2019t just look at today\u2019s news. There are many you can tap from history. Sometimes I\u2019ll create characters that are chimeras of different people/characters. A feature here, a trait there. ",
