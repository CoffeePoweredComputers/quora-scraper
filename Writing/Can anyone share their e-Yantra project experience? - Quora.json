            "answer_text": "I have participated in eYantra Robotics Competition and have won for three consecutive years and I must say this is one of the best competitions I have ever come across. Caretaker Robot (Image Processing - eYRC+ 2014\u201315 - First Place) was my theme in my first year, Gas Leakage Detection Robot (FireBird V based - eYRC 2015\u201316 - Third Place) in second year and Balance Bot (eYRC 2016\u201317 - Track 2 - First Place) was my theme in third year. It\u2019s a 8 month long competition starting from the registration till the finals. Having no prior knowledge of something even as simple as Arduino (when I first took part in 2014) to building more advanced robots like a balance bot and working on quadcopters (eYSIP 2017 Project), it\u2019s just an unbelievable experience for me. The amount of knowledge and practical experience you gain from eYRC is something that no other competition in India has to offer.  The winners of the competition are selected for a 7 week Summer Internship Program at IIT Bombay, where you not only work on amazing projects (such as Quadcopters, Kinect, Robotic Arms with concepts such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision and many more\u2026) but also get to attend talks and workshops on various non-technical aspects such as finance, history, entrepreneurship from highly qualified guests from the industry. At the very beginning, in my first year, qualifying in just the selection test seemed like an impossible task for us. Eventually, when the results came out, we were overjoyed to know that we have been selected for the competition. Every task was very interesting and challenging to solve. Finally, after several months of dedication and hard-work, we managed to qualify for the finals at IITB and stood first, beating even some of the fourth year teams at that time and that is a moment I\u2019d cherish for a lifetime! Here is a detailed journey of the entire competition from the very beginning and some tips to win the competition. The first step is to qualify in your online selection test. It is a 30 minute MCQ based test, which all four members of your team will you have to individually take at the same alloted time slot. The test will contain questions from basic mathematics and aptitude, basic electronics and fundamentals of C programming. In the month of November, you will be allotted your themes. The entire competition is divided intro various tasks (Generally 4\u20135). Some easier themes will be conducted in two stages, where initially 100 teams are selected and after 2 tasks, 50 teams will be eliminated based on their performance. The top 50 will receive their robotic kits in the month of January. More advanced themes (such as themes under Build-Your-Own-Bot in eYRC 2016\u201317) generally don't have any stages. Initially 50\u201360 teams are selected and receive their kits at the beginning of the competition itself in November. There is no elimination till the end of the competition (February) in these themes. The schedule of the entire competition and task deadlines will be given at the beginning of the competition itself. So plan your schedule and manage your time properly as you might have semester exams too. Every task will have 2\u20133 weeks of time to complete and some resources/tutorials will provided along with them. It's best to complete your task as soon as possible so you have ample time to improve your solution and always avoid last minute submissions (also sometimes their servers get busy at the last moment and sometimes you may not be able to upload within the deadline). e-Yantra is very strict with deadlines and penalties will be imposed for late submission. In case of tasks where subjective (theory questions) solutions are required, be very concise with your answers and support them with some good figures, analysed sensor data, 3D models, block diagrams and flowcharts. It is always good to test your solution first before submitting them.  Go through your Rulebook (which will provided mid-way through the competition) very carefully and make sure you have a very good understanding of it. Build your arena exactly as mentioned as it will be the same in the finals. Optimize your solution to get the maximum score as mentioned in the Rulebook. Time is the most crucial factor in the scoring formula. Apart from this, follow up on the Piazza forum daily where you get to know the problems other teams are facing. It also gives you an idea of where you stand in the competition. The most important task and the task that carries the most weight-age in score is the final video and code submission. So it is very important that you get a perfect run for your video submission in order to get the bonus score. You will have only 48 hours to submit your video solution as the arena configuration will only be revealed then. A good dynamic and robust solution is what e-Yantra looks for. Avoid messy and hard coded solutions. Organise and document your code well from the very beginning. The top 5\u20136 teams from every theme will be selected for the finals at IIT Bombay. Perform well, try to get a full score in all your tasks (since they are cumulative) and stay on top of your theme\u2019s leader-board from the first task itself. In the finals, apart from your robot\u2019s performance and run score, you will be interviewed by a panel of judges on several things such as your algorithm, robustness, construction, scalability and team work. Make sure everyone in your team is well prepared for these questions and knows everything that's required. Judges score will contribute to around 30% of your final score. A perfect run in finals and a bad Viva can make you lose that first place (it has happened in the past!).

All the best!  Image Source: e-Yantra 2015\u201316 Finals Photo Gallery ",

You will get to know what is embedded C if you don't have any prior experience. While my peers were studying about 8/16 pin micro controller, I had a chance to work on 100 pin micro controller ATMEGA 2560 which is super cool and awesome. :)I got to know about interfacing, learnt programming in Embedded C. Overall,it is a very good experience. ",
