            "answer_text": "I assume you mean \u201cinterchangeable nibs.\u201d It really depends on how important you think it will be to change nibs. I know that\u2019s pretty hard to guess if this is your first pen, but it\u2019s the truth. If you think you will want to try a few nibs, I\u2019d encourage you to make your first pen a Lamy Safari. You can swap nibs quickly and easily and Lamy offers a nice variety at a good price. The Safari itself is under US$40 \u2014 not expensive as quality pens go, and designed for easy nib swaps. Even so, swapping nibs can be an inky business. Check YouTube for instructions on how to remove and insert a Lamy nib. Follow the instructions that involve cellophane tape. I don\u2019t know of a better method for the Lamy. If you do plan on trying different nibs, please consider the 1.1 mm stub. You\u2019ll be amazed at what it can do for your handwriting. That said, a huge number of vintage and new pens permit nib changes, but changing them without some instruction can be both difficult and hazardous to the life of the pen, not to mention your fingers and that brand-new shirt. Again, YouTube is your friend on this topic, where Brian Goulet, among others, does an exceptional job of teaching new pen owners just about everything they would need to know. ",
