            "answer_text": "From the hallways and classrooms of higher education to the board rooms of corporate America, declaration letters serve myriad purposes in the realm of communication. As its name implies, the letter declares something. It also can be regarded as a statement of fact, an announcement or a clarification. Sometimes, an issue is in dispute or money or a reputation is at stake. For whatever reason you're writing a declaration letter for your organization, adopt a sensible and logical tone, maintain your focus and keep the letter brief and concise. State your purpose in writing the declaration letter. For example, say that you're writing a declaration letter to your employees to announce the launch of a new product or service. Waste no time in getting to the point: \u201cI am writing to announce that after four years of intensive study and research, ABC Vitamin Company will launch a new digestive supplement, called Quell, on February 17.\u201d\t Provide other pertinent details of the declaration. In this example, you might wish to include how much the supplement will cost and where it will be sold.\t Anticipate the needs of your audience -- in this case, your employees. They will want to know how the declaration -- the product launch -- affects them. Rather than bog down your letter with details, you might wish to convene a meeting to unveil the product and answer questions. Supply the time and date of such a meeting in your letter, and specify whether attendance is optional or mandatory. ",
