            "answer_text": "It depends on the nature of the information, and what you define as personal, but the basic answer is yes, they can share it without your consent. Most data about people has almost no legal protection. This is why it\u2019s legal for gMail to read and analyze your emails looking for topics they can use to categorize you for advertisers. It\u2019s why Facebook can do the same, even in your chats using Facebook Messenger. It\u2019s why it\u2019s legal for VR games and even your weather app to collect your minute-to-minute GPS track 24 hours a day, and sell it to advertisers or anyone else willing to buy it. It\u2019s why your supermarket offers you a discount membership card, so they can sell lists of all the products you buy. The list is endless. There are a few precious restrictions, but not many. For example, healthcare providers must safeguard medical information about you quite carefully. The IRS must protect the confidentiality of your tax returns, and the courts must protect records that have been sealed by a judge. But even then, if by negligence, error or intent any of that information leaks to a third party, there are very few limitations on their ability to share it even more widely, entirely without your consent. This does not mean that such things are entirely without consequences. In certain instances you could initiate a civil lawsuit in an effort to collect damages, but the burden would be on you to prove that the data was legally privileged in the first place, and to prove that their actions were instrumental in causing you harm. But that only applies to a very narrow band of information\u2026 almost all of the personal data about you flying back and forth in our digital domains is legally naked. And thus so are you.  NOTE: This is NOT legal advice, which can only come from an attorney licensed to practice law in the relevant jurisdiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Whether or not someone can share your personal information without your consent depends on what that \u201cpersonal information\u201d is. Some types of personal information the law treats as being confidential; other types of information is not treated as being confidential and people can share it freely. Statutes that create a duty of confidentiality \u2014 In the United States, some sorts of information are considered to be so sensitive that laws have been passed to help preserve the confidentiality of that information. For instance, the federal Privacy Act prohibits the Social Security Administration from disclosing your Social Security Number unless strict procedures are followed to ensure that the information is protected. Invasion of privacy \u2014 Even if no statute has been passed that prohibits someone from disclosing sensitive information, there are some types of information that the law treats as being private. If someone discloses that information about you without your consent, you can sue that person for invasion of privacy. For instance, if someone sneaked a camera into your bedroom and filmed you while you were changing your clothing, that would be invasion of privacy. Information that is not confidential \u2014 Most of your personal information is not considered to be sensitive, and people can share that information without your consent. For instance, if you graduated from college, bought a new car, or changed jobs, that would not be confidential information. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me rephrase your question in terms of the General Data Protection Act (GDPR): Can personal data be shared without consent? In short: yes, where there is another lawful basis for data sharing. Consent is one of five lawful grounds for data processing you can choose from. Select always the most appropriate one, the one that best reflects the purpose and methods of your data processing practices. When (most likely) do you need consent? when you process sensitive data categories (the consent should be then valid, lawful and explicit)when you have no other lawful basis for data processing. The other lawful grounds are:A contract with the individual: for example, to supply goods or services they have requested, or to fulfil an obligation under an employee contract.Compliance with a legal obligation: when processing data for a particular purpose is a legal requirement.Vital interests: for example, when processing data will protect someone\u2019s physical integrity or life (either the data subject\u2019s or someone else\u2019s).A public task: for example, to complete official functions or tasks in the public interest. This will typically cover public authorities such as government departments, schools and other educational institutions; hospitals; and the police.Legitimate interests: when a private-sector organisation has a genuine and legitimate reason (including commercial benefit) to process personal data without consent, provided it is not outweighed by negative effects to the individual\u2019s rights and freedoms.when you process data for some marketing purposes (and you want to install cookie files on users devices or track them with other intrusive technologies) - these rules are expressed in Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR) which might be replaced by ePrivacy Regulation. Please note that if you need consent by ePrivacy means, you need it too in terms of GDPR.Seeking valid consent for data processing is good data protection practice and it gives users the highest level of control over what happens to their data. If you want some further reading, please see the relevant provisions in GDPR. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally NO, BUT these days when you sign up to stuff you give away so many permissions you aren\u2019t even aware of. It\u2019s like reading all the terms and conditions on something you buy or place you join, very few of us do this but click to say and agree that they have read them and agree with them anyway. If you want to verify what privacy you have given away already, but really wouldn\u2019t want to, just check your mobile phone settings in particular GOOGLE. Do you mind someone recording you on your phone remotely WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE OR PERMISSION. Probably not I would suggest BUT you have given that permission away anyway. Think about this : In the comfort and safety and ( what you think ) is the privacy of your own home and in particular the BEDROOM, GOOGLE can record you without you knowing and without your permission. Don\u2019t believe me : please feel free to check your settings and try to take this permission away. IT WON\u2019T LET YOU. Very very soon this world will properly fall apart, the pawns ( the general public ) have all been suitably placed into social groups ready to harm one another. Wait and see peeps wait and see. ",

Unless it\u2019s in the context of employment and your company has a policy against providing employee information to outside parties. If the information is not otherwise available to anyone looking, like something in your medical history or even class grades from university that were shared in confidence with a friend or other trusted person, you may have a basis for legal action against them. Especially if you\u2019re able to show that there was malicious intent and also financial or other damages that occurred as a result of the unauthorized disclosure of your information. If it\u2019s an organization who released your information without your prior approval, you have a case. ",

Daniels claims that Trump violated terms of the agreement, thus making it null and void, freeing her to speak openly without restriction as she may wish. ",

Where the law requires someone to delete information, the agency using the information licenses it from someone else, so the deletion is only done in a front-company that doesn\u2019t actually hold your information. The only exception is medical records, those are generally private by law. So no, you can\u2019t stop someone talking about your past, unless the stories are designed to harm you. In the US, the truth is generally a defense for defamation (but not always, and the defendant/respondent must prove truth). What you want is a restraining order.
