            "answer_text": "I guess your methodology of teaching your 8 year old son is not proper or interesting. Instead of saying that he is not able to grasp the concepts, why don't you introspect, if your way of teaching him is easy and understandable or not? You find that he is not able to grasp basics, because you have learnt them very long back and they appear to be very minute things to you. Till you learn, every thing appears like rocket science. Once learnt, you feel it is nothing. Don't know whether you could recollect how you learnt them at his age. You might not be good at teaching him. Find some innovative methods online which makes kids fall in love with learning new concepts. Even I did not enjoy when teachers used to teach us monotonously on black board all the time in my child hood.I used to watch NCERT classes on Gyan darshan on DD 1 on TV and used to love the way they used to present some concepts. Now a days there are many interesting and innovative ways of teaching kids to learn any difficult thing. These are the lucky generations unlike us who always found studies to be boredom due to boring and difficult to understand methodologies followed by the teachers of our generation. The concepts we learn in our post graduation and doctoral degrees are easily presented in innovative fashion online now a days and kids can learn anything very easily.Give access to these for your kids. Secondly, your losing patience with your 8 year old kid is all up to you. I think you should work much on it. There is nothing to lose patience in these kind of matters. Don't try to be too strict and serious with your kids. Be less critical and more of a easy going kind of friends with kids and when he fails to understand something, tell him in a humorous story telling way and even after many attempts, if he is not able to grasp the things, be empathetic to find out if anything is wrong with his mental and psychological development and abilities. This you can identify if you always try to have an eye on your kid. Sometimes even doctors fail to identify these things. As a biological parent, you can better understand these things better than them. There is nothing wrong to think in this line. God creates us all in different types. Though our genes make up our abilities and deficiencies,sometimes poor environment leads to more difficult circumstances for the kids development. Identify those deficiencies and help the kid. Realise that kids are mere replicas of you in terms of their genes and behaviour. What you teach them, that they become. So be kind and be loving to them. If you cannot practice patience with your 8 year old kid, you do not actually have it. Get some more. Life needs more of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you considered that your child may have dyscalculia, or one of the other learning disabilities that can impact in math (including dyspraxia, auditory processing disorders,etc)? It\u2019s never a joy to learn one\u2019s beloved child is struggling - they are facing frustration and anger at learning, and generally hate feeling like they are disappointing those they care about the most. He\u2019s not doing this to purposely irritate you! Maybe try a new approach of discovering what\u2019s underlying this together. You can\u2019t possibly be as frustrated as your child is - this can be so intense they simply disengage. Start with reading up on learning disorders, and approach the school psychologist (if you have one) as well as his teachers. They can get you started on figuring out how to address this. It\u2019s so important to start working on it as early as possible, while neuroplasticity is still very high. Best of luck tracking this down - give each other lots of affection and support, you CAN work your way through this! Kind regards, Alexandra Sent from my iPhone - please pardon errors. ",

            "answer_text": "My kids find Timez Attack anxiety inducing - so be careful  there.... I had trouble with basic math. I know now it was because I need to see it and feel it - I did some of this type of math with my 4 kids assuming that since they're mine - they might benefit too.My kids do not go to a Montessori school, however I use some of their math techniques to let my kids see the math happen. If I were better with computers, I'd attach a video!So, Google \"Montessori math\". You do not have to switch schools - just take a look at how math is presented in the Montessori curricula - there are videos on all their methods. See how 'carrying' in addition and 'borrowing ' in subtraction is shown through games like the, \"Montessori Snake Game\".  If you need to go further back in the learning, then try using a big poster board with the 1's, 10's, and 100's columns marked on it. Then have him use rods and cubes to make a number on the board like 234 (4 ones, 3 tens and 2 hundreds)... (Google, \"Base ten blocks\"). Further back still?... make sure he can skip count - knows odd and even numbers and WHY they are odd or even. Does he know that you can count by 10's (or any #) starting at any point, not just 10, 20, 30?  It's easy to forget that that is an awesome realization for young learners.  For multiplication - use graph paper and show 3x3=9 as  a box drawn 3 squares up and 3 down... see 9 altogether - now have him do it.  Schools zoom over the basics and leave us reader-types going...\"say whaaaaa?\"...... I'd give that \"Zap Zap Fractions\" a try (I intend to!) but if that isn't quite right, try \"More StarFall\" and notice you can click on 'second grade math'. It has base ten work and easy arrays to begin seeing multiplication. ",

Now which is important for you : your patience or son's math . A REAL EXAMPLE: ( my daughter is now in 8 th class and now she learn dividation and multiplication) I am graduate and my daughter was poor in math. so you can think about my condition. Her teacher always call me to show her homework. But for this what I did, that activities give you some inspiration. We buy glass balls( mini) , mini Chinese toy set , small stones and so many tiny colour full things. Our basic goal was 1 counting 2 addition 3 substraction and in 5 th standard there are positive results Now she gets 90/100 in math. Suggestion : don't make hurry and don't become impatient try slowly. Join a proffesional class for his math because they actually knows the level of childs.",

            "answer_text": "I am in the same boat. My 9 year old can get through maths if he tries. He instantly calculates how much time his sister gets on TV or computer compared to his, the amount of Jewish blood in him as his great grandmother was a Jew or how much it would cost me to buy his Pokemon cards( he insists it is a very small part compared to my salary or my new sari). But ask him to solve some word problems, he becomes dumb and dumber together. My parents belong to the old school and constantly get agitated when they see the neighbor kids and sometimes that agitation gets on to me. Unfortunately, I have even spanked him. But now I have sort off moved on and arranged a home tutor who constantly does the grappling with him. Since he is a teacher there is a sense of discipline. If that is not possible try the trick of him teaching you. Give him a chalk board. I made one by painting the wall chalkboard black and even gave him a ruler. Sometimes I am too tired on weekdays but it works on weekends well. There is no right or wrong answer and only thing I can say is that I empathize with you. I was an university topper and focused only on academics. But destiny made me a army wife where a career is impossible. I wish I had taken arts in my bachelors and enjoyed life a bit. So may be destiny will make my son a math genius!!! ",

Your son is doing the harder job not you. So your losing patience can not be justified.\u201d Losing patience only means you have lack of it. It has nothing to do with your son\u2019a ability or lack of it to understand maths.So start with separating these two first. You have to start working on your patience level. Now once you can see these two things separately, your mind will stop giving you the justification that because your son is slow in grasping, you are justified to be aggressive. Now coming to the question-\u201dHOW TO INCREASE YOUR LEVEL OF PATIENCE \u201c. It is same as building your muscles. You have to keep setting goals to have a higher level of patience.Don't let your mind justify your loss of patienceTell your mind your son is doing the harder job not you. So your losing patience can not be justified.Mark your triggers besides your son\u2019a maths that make you lose patienceHappy Living Nitin Sarswat ",

Accept that there is a problem, but every problem has a solution. Reassure him that you will help him and work with him. You both are now a team and the challenge is to get better at maths every day. Maths builds on concepts. You need to go back to basics and see where the foundations are weak. Depending on where you live, you should be able to google targets for each year group. Start from a year below where your child currently is. See if he understands all the concepts clearly. When you see gaps, use free resources like Khan Academy to help him understand. Give him adequate practice. Do NOT rush. Don\u2019t say hurtful things or express disappointment. Keep the mood calm and positive. This will help build trust and willingness to learn. If your son has no learning difficulties, I don\u2019t see why he cant improve and even become BRILLIANT at maths. If you are committed to see this happen and if you need my support, I am happy to help you build a study plan. ",

Practicing Maths can sometimes be draining, if he wants to do it alone let him, when he asks for help, help him.
