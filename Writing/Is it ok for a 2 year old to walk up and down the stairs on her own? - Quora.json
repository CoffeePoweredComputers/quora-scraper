            "answer_text": "\u201cIs it ok for a 2 year old to walk up and down the stairs on her own?\u201d Motor Skills. Children develop motor skills at different rates. Some children walk around at one year old, others crawl until they are two. If a child shows good motor skills and balance and they can hold on to the railing when they descend or ascend the stairs, there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do it by themselves, providing they don\u2019t become overconfident and stop using the railing. My daughter was 5.5 years old and had walked our straight stairs up and down hundreds of times already when she decided to walk downstairs while carrying Lego downstairs with both hands, foregoing the rail. And she tumbled down the stairs, losing three of her front lower milk teeth and complaining about her head and her back. We took her to the ER and there they took photo\u2019s from her vertebrae, which showed an L5 fracture referred to by the orthopaedic surgeon as a \u2018Nutcracker\u2019. Lumbar vertebrae have two bone protrusions at the side called \u2018transverse process\u2019. One of them had fractured but wasn\u2019t broken off. The orthopaedic surgeon was cheerful, as he rarely saw a fresh \u2018Nutcracker\u2019. As he told us, the Nutcracker fracture happened often when children bent their backs the wrong way, which happened a lot during ballet classes (hence the name). In most cases, the pain subsides after a few hours, so parents rarely get their children X-rayed. In most cases, the stability of the spine is compromised, but that won\u2019t have any adverse reactions until someone gets to be 30\u201340 years old and develops back pain. By then, it\u2019s too late. However, with my daughter\u2019s fresh Nutcracker fracture, we put her in a cast that limited the movement of her lower back for six weeks, so the fracture could heal. So, while the motor skills are a factor, overconfidence is the major cause for falling down the stairs. As long as you hold on to the hand rail and concentrate on negotiating the stairs (and not on whatever you\u2019re holding in your free hand), and if you don\u2019t rush up and down the stairs, chances of falling are quite limited. And, of course, make sure the stairs are clear of toys and other stuff, and don\u2019t allow children to play on the stairs. ",

            "answer_text": "I am quite free with my child. I let her do things that other parents cringe at - but always under controlled circumstances. Jump off the roof? Sure. But only when I have checked to make sure the snow is soft. Slide down the banister? Sure, but only if I am there to catch her and there is a mattress at the base. Climb up and down a six meter high fence? OK, but only when I am there waiting below to catch her or at least buffer her fall. At two years old I suppose I even let her climb the stairs alone, but not on purpose. It would have been a time when I was working or cooking or otherwise distracted and she did it on her own without me noticing. I know she can do it, but even I have slipped on the stairs and it is not pretty. I know how to brace myself and stop from falling all the way down. I could not live with myself if my daughter did it and suffered some type of irreversible accident that effects her for the rest of her life. I would let her and encourage her to walk up and down, but only when I am standing there ready to catch her if she falls. I would not hold her hand, but I would be waiting on standby to spot her and catch her. When she was two or three she wandered out of the house without my knowing. I thought she was still sleeping. By the time I noticed she was gone and the front door was open. I walked around the neighborhood searching for her for an hour before I found an old lady walking with her and the old lady asks me \u201cIs this yours? She came into my house and we have been eating cookies.\u201d She walked the same route we always walk together. She is completely capable of surviving, but soooo much could have gone wrong. ",

While I agree that a two year old is still new to walking, people overlook that due to a very small height and weight toddlers are less likely to get serious injury. Falling off the stair for an adult is way more traumatic than for a short and chubby baby. I let my children try doing what they want independently and I am happy to see how they learn to calculate risks and be realistic about their capabilities. Btw my daughter fell off the stairs once. She was about year and a half. It was a steep wooden stairs, but thankfully she didn't get even a scratch. She played it safe after and didn't come too close to the edge alone. ",

Considering how toddlers have only just recently learned how to walk, it is safest for someone to be around to make sure they don't get seriously hurt, but it is okay to let her do it on her own. The more she does it on her own the more skill she will build and be less likely to fall. She is small and likely still working on her gross motor skills so if she was on her own she could fall, and if she fell the damage would be a lot worse then if you fell down the stairs. So yes, it is okay for her to, but it is also okay to stand behind her to catch her if she falls. ",
