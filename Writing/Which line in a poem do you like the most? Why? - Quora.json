So here it goes\u2026  \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d, By ROBERT FROST Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveller, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; //1// . Then took the other, just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same.//2// . And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.//3//  \u201cThe poet says that both the paths were similar that morning. Both had leaves on them and no one had stepped on them as they were still green in colour. He decided that that day he would take one path and keep the other path for another day, although he knew that one way leads on to another way. He knew that he could not go back on the choice that he had made. Similarly, even in our life once we choose an option, we must keep on moving ahead with that option and we never get a chance to come back and take the other option that we had left earlier.\u201d I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2014 I took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference.//4// You too have read this poem in your school days. Tell in comment below which was your favourite stanza?? Gratitude! the road not taken drawing the road not taken drawing The Road Not Taken, Class 9 English Explanation, Summary ",

            "answer_text": "And Agamemnon dead. William Butler Yeats presents us a hard break in line 11 of his fantastic sonnet, \u201cLeda and the Swan.\u201d The poem describes the scene where Zeus\u2014disguised as a swan (as he was wont to do)\u2014fell from the sky and raped the mortal beauty Leda. In this abhorrent act lies the suggested purpose of the poem: Violence begets violence. Just prior to the referenced broken line, Yeats describes Zeus\u2019 impregnation of Leda and the walls and towers (of Troy) falling before issuing the aforementioned reference to Agamemnon\u2019s death. Leda\u2014from this act\u2014laid two eggs. From those eggs were born four children, but we usually attribute the two daughters to Zeus: Helen and Clytemnestra. The former was the \u201cface that launched a thousand ships\u201d and spurred the Trojan War when she left Sparta with her lover Paris. The latter cast a net on and stabbed to death her husband Agamemnon and his Trojan prize Cassandra while they were taking a bath. The intentional break in structure creates a long pause for thought, and Yeats\u2019 brevity\u2014succinctly summarizing my exploration above into sixteen syllables\u2014is a masterful display of poetic language. I provided the link above, but here\u2019s the entire sonnet for any who\u2019d like to read it: A sudden blow: the great wings beating stillAbove the staggering girl, her thighs caressedBy the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill,He holds her helpless breast upon his breast. How can those terrified vague fingers pushThe feathered glory from her loosening thighs?And how can body, laid in that white rush,But feel the strange heart beating where it lies? A shudder in the loins engenders thereThe broken wall, the burning roof and towerAnd Agamemnon dead...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. Being so caught up,So mastered by the brute blood of the air,Did she put on his knowledge with his powerBefore the indifferent beak could let her drop? ",
