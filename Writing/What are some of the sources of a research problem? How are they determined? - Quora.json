            "answer_text": "If you are lucky, in your everyday life somehow you may stumble in a research problem and , in case you have the skills to tackle it and, eventually, to solve it, then congratulations. you entered in the research world. However, the above lucky scenario is rare for the laymen: who stumbles in research problems are the people who works deeply in a certain scientific area and knows the loose ends. Often these are the thesis advisors of PhD candidates in the Universities. So, if you are interested in finding a research problem in a specific scientific area there are three ways I recommend: Talk to an expert in the area you are interested in and ask him/her to point out interesting research problems in that area.Browse the scientific literature of the area you are interested in and try to find \u201creview papers\u201d, or \u201coverview papers on the state-of-the-art\u201d, or \u201cchallenges ahead papers\u201d. Often the plenary lectures on large specialized conferences are a good source of this sort of papers.Sometimes there are broadly known \u201clists of open problems\u201d (which are usually good research problems) in certain areas. For instance, in List of unsolved problems in mathematics - Wikipedia there is one about math. The solution of each of the 7 math problems in Millennium Prize Problems - Wikipedia is worth 1 million bucks. The gotcha with these lists is that probably the solution of most of the problems there already has been tried (and failed) by many researchers, and so they are certainly hard nuts to crack.HTH ",

            "answer_text": "Let me answer based on my own field (business administration). Research problems can be rooted in real-life phenomena (e.g. Why are chief executives paid so highly in the US?), or they can be rooted in gaps in the literature (e.g. Papers by X, Y and Z have looked at when/why alliances between competitors in the same industry fail to produce the desired benefits, but relatively few papers have examined alliances across industries longitudinally) (please note that my examples are made up). Even when research questions are motivated by gaps in literature, they ultimately come from real life phenomena. The best way to find research questions then is to be curious about a phenomenon you observe in real life, read about that phenomenon in popular press and the academic literature, and see if there are questions about it that are still unanswered by the relevant literature. Perhaps the existing studies contradict each other, or they all looked at it in a particular context, or they all looked at it the same way and there is another way to look at it. ",
