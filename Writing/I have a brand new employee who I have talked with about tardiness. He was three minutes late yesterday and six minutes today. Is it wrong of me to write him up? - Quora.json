            "answer_text": "Three minutes and six minutes \u2026 well, they\u2019re not ideal, but they\u2019re not terrible. Is the guy making up the time at the end of his shift? Is he working hard during his shift? I\u2019m sure there are jobs in which it is absolutely crucial that someone arrives absolutely on time and is ready to start the second their shift starts - but I\u2019m finding it hard to think of one. Are there reasons why he\u2019s being late? Is he reliant on public transport and does it screw up? Or is the traffic unpredictable? There are so many different reasons he could be having difficulty arriving on time. I feel - as I sense that you do too - that punctuality is really important and it\u2019s a mark of respect to show up on time. But you need to work out how to get the best out of your employee in the long-term, and filing a complaint about him won\u2019t necessarily achieve that. It may be enough just to let him know that you\u2019re aware of his lateness and that it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. But making a real complaint about him for three minutes \u2026 that doesn\u2019t feel right to me. If he can make up the time at the end of his shift, you could show a bit of flexibility, kindness and understanding. But if he really starts to take advantage, you will have grounds to use whatever sanctions you have available to you. ",

            "answer_text": "It's the beginning of a trend. A new employee should be trying to impress you in the early days of new employment. Personally, if it was me, I don't \u201cwrite him up\" just yet as he may still be figuring out how to get to work on time as far as transportation, traffic expected during commute, etc. But good employees (who last) figure this stuff out quickly. To me, employees should arrive to work approx 15 min early or before. Have you said anything to this new employee about your expectations? If not, you need to. I would also stress to this employee that they're essentially \u201con probation\u201d for 90 days and you're going to be closely monitoring their work habits. Lastly, I don't write people up unless i warn them first and basically tell them it's not acceptable. But every \u201cwrite up\" is like a strike in baseball, 3 (in a short time period) and you're out! Communicate this. Do it in calm tones, nice professional way. This is business, not personal. Good luck. ",
