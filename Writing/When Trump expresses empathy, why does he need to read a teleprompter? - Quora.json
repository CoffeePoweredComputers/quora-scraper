            "answer_text": "Donald Trump doesn\u2019t express empathy. Let\u2019s be clear on that: he\u2019s a narcissist, at the heart of it, and when he does overtly offer a sympathetic comment, it\u2019s rarely a sincere one. It\u2019s not a surprise that 99% of his comments in a positive vein are written by somebody else, and you can tell that by the language used. He has to read from a teleprompter on those occasions because he\u2019s not speaking from the heart, and not expressing his own views. He\u2019s articulating what he\u2019s been advised to say, but not in his own words and never with any real heart behind them. Trump\u2019s sociopathic in his behavioural patterns. For example, look at his comments on Covid-19 deaths, when the US his 100,000 deaths: \"We have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000. To all of the families & friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy & love for everything that these great people stood for & represent. God be with you!\" Now look at his unscripted comments when interviewing with Axios, on 3rd August: \u201cThey are dying. That\u2019s true. And you \u2013 it is what it is. But that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t doing everything we can. It\u2019s under control as much as you can control it.\u201d No sympathy there. No empathy for the victims, or for their families. When talking to President Bolsonaro about whether he was concerned about the virus: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d Again, no acknowledgement of the damage caused or the lives taken. It\u2019s clear from most of his comments that Donald Trump simply doesn\u2019t care about the lives of the American people. As long as he\u2019s fine, it\u2019s all good. The reason he has to use a teleprompter is because when expressing sympathy or sorrow, the sentiments and the words are not his own. He\u2019s simply not capable of that feeling. It is what it is. ",
