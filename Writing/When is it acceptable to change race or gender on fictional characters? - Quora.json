            "answer_text": "It's acceptable when it makes better stories. \"This is a jar of major characters\" has really informed my thinking on this matter, and it's a great read, but I'll give some concrete examples. Think about it: how would the story change if Black Panther (who is the king of a fictional high-tech African country), or Danielle Moonstar (who is Native American and has been a member of the New Mutants and the X-Men) were 'made' white by new writers doing a reboot? Would it make their stories more interesting? It would turn Black Panther into a Kevin-Costner-In-Dances-With-Wolves type \"white savior\" character, which is both bigoted and boring. Dani's story would suddenly lose a lot of its depth if she were just some white girl from wherever who gains powers on a camping trip, joins a superteam, gets more powers when they visit Asgard, and has a superheroing career. The intersection of her growing-up with everything that happens to her later informs her entire story, and being a member of a minority culture that has had genocide attempted upon it came up in more than one storyline where her teams encountered other alien societies. If you posit an alternate universe where the Captain America who survived the super-soldier program wasn't Steve Rogers, but was instead a black sergeant who was experimented on in the early stages because the doctors doing the experiments felt (as did the people doing the Tuskegee syphilis experiment did) that black subjects were more disposable -- that makes a very interesting story to tell. Imagine if a BLACK American soldier were overseas in the uniform punching out Nazis -- would the American media of World War II have covered it? He could certainly have never been sent around the country to advertise war bonds. Or what if Steve Rogers were born Esteban Rivera, a Puerto Rican kid from Brooklyn -- but EVERYTHING ELSE is the same? Being blond, it was easy for the Army to decide (when suddenly the experiment worked) to \"neutralize\" his \"ethnic\" name -- this was commonly done for all kinds of backgrounds in the 40s. His uniform even LOOKS like he ought to be Captain Puerto Rico in some of the recent films! But think what it could say if someone with the morals and opinions of canonical Captain America -- that truth and justice are important, that all citizens are equal -- were from a non-white background, both in the original wartime setting and in a modern, post-ice Avengers universe? That's a more powerful story. But most of the time, when you bring a character closer to the \"default\" -- when you make them a white, straight male, or a blonde white woman -- you make the story more boring. This was done in the recent movie of The Martian, when Mindy Park (who was clearly intended to be Korean-American in the book, though never stated explicitly to be so in the text) was cast as a blonde white woman ... and then treated as if she were a random employee with no special expertise. How did that make the story better? Whenever you want to change a character, think to yourself: does this give me MORE story to tell, or LESS? ",

            "answer_text": "Meh, \"acceptable\" to whom? What's acceptable to the author? What does the audience  want to see? Does it make you care more about the story, or care less about the story.  You have to look at what you end up with. Just plugging a rich dude from Shanghai into Batman's shoes and moving the story there seems unlikely to work very well. But there must be Batman fans in Shanghai, and maybe one of them can adapt it in a way that would kick ass.  Nobody can figure out whether Stravinsky really said this, but I think it's right: \"Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.\"  You get the right English black guy as James Bond, with the right ideas and the right director, we won't want the character to be white anymore.  You take Speed Racer and make him white, for me that just kind of messed up the movie. I'm not even sure why, I just always assumed the kid was Japanese. It's like going into Streetfighter 2 and making Ryu white. Meh. Shouldn't be a big deal but it would kind of make me care less about the game. ",
