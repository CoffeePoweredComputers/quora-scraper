            "answer_text": "Why do you feel you have to write your uncle informing him of anything? Why do you have to explain what you do on your own time? Were you supposed to spend time with your uncle and chose to go somewhere else instead? If That is the case, Then you will need to write a letter of sincere apology for not considering his feelings first. Telling him that you probably should\u2019ve told him prior to your vacation that it would not be spent with him And that it was nothing personal, you just chose to go somewhere else and then apologize for not telling him first. If that is not the case, it\u2019s none of his business to begin with. You don\u2019t need to \u201creport\u201d to an uncle\u2026. i\u2019m just not understanding why there would be the need for a letter to begin with. are you afraid to tell him in person? If that be the case, then it may be best to write a letter. I don\u2019t Know how close you are with your uncle, but it sounds like you\u2019re under his control. Are you under his supervision and during this time of Covid, maybe he\u2019s giving you a homework lesson? I don\u2019t know really how to answer this except to ask a bunch of questions myself to understand the actual situation And relationship at hand. So I just went with different scenarios by providing my advice. ",
