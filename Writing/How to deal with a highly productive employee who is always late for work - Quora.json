            "answer_text": "In my line of business - software engineering - we really don\u2019t watch the clock too carefully. The presumption is that \u201cso long as the work gets done on time\u201d - we can cope with a modest amount of bad timing. Some companies (including the one my son works for) don\u2019t even bother to tell people how much vacation time they can take. \u201cTake as much as you need\u201d. Of course - this does induce a certain degree of pressure to get the work done\u2026and if the work isn\u2019t getting done - then people are going to get fired regardless of whether they worked long hours or short and regardless of the amount of time they were on vacation. It\u2019s kinda refreshing actually! But assuming this isn\u2019t that kind of business, you have two problems: If the person isn\u2019t in the office when people expect to be able to hold meetings and such - then poor timekeeping can affect the group as a whole.If other (less productive) people see that it\u2019s \u201cOK\u201d to be late - then they may decide to do the same thing - and then you really are eating into overall productivity. It\u2019s tough to yell at one person for being late - if some other person is getting away with it.",

If they depend on public transportation and because of the schedules they have to be either an hour early or 15 minutes late, or if their spouse works a different shift and they have young children that need to be cared for (has to wait to leave once they get home)\u2026I might be understanding. But, remember that every other employee should be given the same consideration. Are they not hearing their alarm clock, or just not setting the alarm early enough? They just need to work that out on their own\u2026and be on time. If they are capable of being highly efficient at work, they are capable of acting like an adult with their own time. Yes, being productive is important, but so is dependability, maturity, and workplace morale. What good is a highly productive employee if they cause overall production to lag because of the declining morale of the other employees? ",
