Pre\u2013writing stageIn this stage, you need to analyse the work that you have been asked to criticise thoroughly. Say you have been asked to critique a book.

Writing stagesThis is the active stage where you need actually to write the paper. Take your time to craft a perfect critique and make it completely error-free. The steps included in this stage are: Read and read the work againMake sure you completely understand the context, purpose and structure of the work that you will criticize. Note down the author\u2019s or the writer\u2019s misconceptions and mistakes. Create an outlineNow it\u2019s time for you to create an outline for the critique based on the notes that you have taken while analyzing the work. Make sure the outline meets all the criteria of an ideal critique as instructed by your professor. Summarize your opinionsYou are already aware of the format of your paper. Just pen down your thoughts in a proper sequence, so that it makes sense to readers. Make sure your critique is not only about the flaws but also about the good things in the work.

            "answer_text": "I taught this as a review; the students wrote about the last movie they saw, or the last restaurant at which they dined, or the last book they read. Always remember that you need an introduction, a body, and a conclusion. Tell the audience what you\u2019re going to tell them, then tell them, then tell them what you told them. Don\u2019t jump right into the body, and don\u2019t just stop writing. In the body paragraphs, a \u201csandwich\u201d technique can be very effective. Discuss a good point, then something that didn\u2019t please you, then conclude with a good point. However, if you\u2019re reviewing a restaurant, chronological order may be effective, too. Be certain that it\u2019s your essay and your opinions. Instructors can tell! ",
