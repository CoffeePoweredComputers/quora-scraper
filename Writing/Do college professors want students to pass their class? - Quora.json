We want them to learn the hardships of life. Should I go on? Of course we want them to pass the course. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s our failure, not theirs. It is us who designed and delivered that course. Isn\u2019t it obvious that at some point, we, the teachers, failed? It is my responsibility to design an updated course, based on the newest and most relevant materials, scientifically validated and supported, with as many and as diverse examples and applications as possible. It is my job to deliver that course in such a way that it motivates your, engages you in thinking and in wanting to discover more. On the other hand, there\u2019s the small aspect of you wanting to be in that class, too. But, hey, I assumed that\u2019s implicit, since you\u2019re in my class. I mean, other than taking shelter from the bad weather outside, hiding from your dealer, not having a proper place to go, why would you be in my class if you didn\u2019t want to? To make the story short, for those authentic teachers I know, there\u2019s not greater satisfaction then seeing their students enjoying the success of their work, growing into better, wiser persons. And, passing your course, provided is a decent one, is part of that, too. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but more important, professors want students to learn the material. You can probably pass the class without learning the material simply by doing the required assignments and cramming for the exam. But after the semester is over, you won't remember the material and your professor won't remember you. But if you strive to understand what is being taught, to understand why the material is important (and IT IS important to your professor), then you will differentiate yourself from your fellow students, you will load new material for decision making into your brain, and you will make your professor feel like he or she accomplished something. I taught Management Information Systems. I had plenty of students who memorized the difference between a Customer Relationship Management system and an Enterprise Resource Planning system well enough to pick the right answers on the test and get a C or even a B if they were good test takers. That didn't make me happy or sad, it was just a fact of life. But I thought that since I taught one of the first required classes for a Business degree, and most students didn't really have any idea what a business did or how they are organized, I gave the students the opportunity to get a glimpse of the operation of a business to see if they could picture how they would fit in a business organization and even get a clue about whether they would be happy doing some of the tasks that needed to be done. So there were a few students who took that opportunity to understand WHY we needed CRM and ERP systems, and how using those kinds of systems would help a business succeed. That made me happy. Those students almost always got A's - not because they gave me what I want (I had a lot of students who thought that kissing my ass was a great way to get an A - they ended up disappointed in me and I ended up disappointed in them) but because their effort to understand the importance of the material helped them answer the test questions correctly and focus their writing assignments on issues that were important. They also learned a lot of things that helped them succeed in their careers. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not see why not, if they are true and responsible educators and want their students to succeed in their studies, graduate and find good jobs and contribute fruitfully to society. I have defined college professors as university professors in countries such as UK, Australia and NZ teaching Bachelor courses, including Medicine, Engineering, Education and many other courses. Yes, indeed, professors want their students to pass their class. I cannot see any good reasons for not wanting tbeir students to pass their class. However, I must qualify this by saying that the professors have standards to uphold for the courses they teach. This means that they will need to assess through assignments, test and examinations on how well the students have learned and if they have indeed reached the set standards. If so, on graduation, there is guarantee that these trained men and women, will be sufficiently competent to do jobs for which they are trained to serve the community. Imagine, for example, if professors in medicine or engineering or education courses willy-nilly passed students without ensuring these students had indeed reached the determined standards, they would be graduating incompetent doctors, engineers and educators. Who would want to consult these half-baked professionals? Clearly, you and I and every rational-thinking person would be most unhappy with those irresponsible professors. Society would compaign for their removal from teaching. Professors have nothing to gain for failing students when they have achieved the set standards. Having taught students, I would feel most delighted and satisfied on graduation day to see each graduand I was privileged and responsible to teach, walking past the stage in academic regalia receiving his/her testamar amidst the applause of the families and congregation. Yes, professors want their students to pass their courses but also want to ensure that they have been trained competently. ",

            "answer_text": "College professors want students to reach a place in their development where they wouldn\u2019t (seriously) ask a blanket question about the intentions of a highly diverse population like college professors toward an array of highly diverse populations like students in their various classes. I\u2019m sure the answer is a class of conditioned statistical distributions, dependent on the year of study, the subject area, student backgrounds and demographics, cultural distance between students and professors, how much of the content being presented the student is willing to confront and engage. Some researchers have already published a number of journal articles on this, I\u2019d bet money on it. The professors job is to present the material, assign homework and projects with performance expectations and a grading rubric, administer quizzes and exams and then evaluate the work submitted according to the rubric. He/she should return fairly graded papers quickly be impartial as to the outcomes achieved by an particular student. The student is responsible to know when to withdraw from or drop a class. Some classes are offered every semester and the material is critically necessary in follow on classes. It\u2019s in the students best interest to take the class until they master the content. If you\u2019ve reached a point where you\u2019re concerned about the professor\u2019s intentions, and merely passing, you may want to revisit the notion of a college education as a productive way to spend your time. The original question is probably interesting research for people who study this stuff. It\u2019s probably a waste of your time if you\u2019re in undergraduate classes right now. Go talk to the professor about the material/homework/exams during office hours. Go to tutoring and recitation sessions taught by TA\u2019s. pay for private tutoring. Put the effort your need into fulfilling your own intentions. ",

When students are going to be paying for school for much of their adult life, they won\u2019t stay in it if they have to repeat numerous classes. That said, the assistance readily available in high school has to be searched out by the student in college, and you probably don\u2019t already know the smartest kid in your class and have him or her on speed dial like you did in high school so passing might be more difficult. They used to say everyone should expect to drop one letter grade between high school and college, I know that happened for me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s still the case as today\u2019s students take dual credit and AP courses that weren\u2019t available back then.

While I was in college, students took a survey at the end of the class and the answers determined whether or not new professors kept their job. I had a professor while I was in college that gave me a D on my midterm. I took the test to my advisor and asked her to look at it and tell me what was wrong with my answers. There was nothing wrong with my answers. I made an appointment with him and he would not change my grade, but if I made an A on everything else he would drop my grade on this test. This went against any justice that I understood but I agreed and informed him I better be graded fairly from here on out. This professor found out he and my brother were drinking buddies and he made a comment to me about it .and I told him that neither of the two impressed me much. I ended up with my A, went on with my life and never looked at or spoke to the sorry excuse of a professor again. If I had not recieved my fair grade I would have fought for it and would have done everything in my power to cost him his job. ",

Especially at the graduate school level, Master\u2019s and PhD graduates with inadequate command of material would be seriously detrimental to a university\u2019s reputation. When I was giving my orientation to each of my classes at College of the Redwoods, I would state I have no problem giving everyone As, I also have no problem giving everyone Fs; however, if I am giving everyone Fs then there is something wrong with how I am conveying the material. I used a concept that I had experienced from Dr. Tom Hale at Cal Poly. He would have the weighting of the final so that a good performance on the final could wipe out poor performances on the midterms. At College of the Redwoods in all my classes, the final score counted in place of all midterms or counted just equal to one midterm whichever was the most beneficial to the student. Conceptually it recognized that if the subject matter all came together at the end of the class and was demonstrated by a good score on the final, then the student benefited from proving command of the subject matter. If the student had been doing well up to the final but just had a bad day for the final exam, then the student was slightly dinged but only by having the final equal to just one midterm exam. ",

Faculty and staff are hired by the students to provide an educational experience. Not just an experience but an atmosphere in which to learn the required material to advance onto the next educational level. The responsibility relies heavily on a contract between the student and the faculty member. A contract that (informally) states that the faculty member will deliver and provide an educational atmosphere in which the required material is covered. The student\u2019s side of the contract states that he/she will study the material provided and exhibit competency (i.e., an understanding) to advance to the next educational level. Each side has its part in the process. Furthermore, the educational process is a two-way street. Knowledge flows both ways. ",

It is one of the most rewarding parts of the job to see students who have come through your course doing well in the real world. Unfortunately, there are students who fail my courses every year. Given the assessment strategy for my course, it is genuinely hard to fail. You would have to do very poorly across multiple assessments. For the most part, there are clear reasons why my students fail e.g. regularly absent from class, poor work ethic/attitude. It is usually more work for professors when someone fails a course from an administrative perspective. However, if you are failing a course you need to look at your own performance first before blaming a professor. Have you given 100% in your course? Best of luck. ",

There is a great deal of mutual satisfaction to be derived both from the party who set high academic expectations for a class, and from the parties who exerted themselves to meet or exceed the challenges.

A large number of those students were unable to complete the course successfully, but that was definitely not the desired outcome from the point of view of the administration. There was even a petition by the English department to the math department at that college to allow someone to graduate who couldn\u2019t add two digit numbers, on the grounds that they had a math learning disability. The math department said no, but the consequences for that were bad. Eventually, because it was a small college, it was not able to attract enough students who were able to do college work. As a result, it was forced to close. This was not the desired outcome by the administration. This would probably be less likely to be the case at a state run school, or a well-funded private school. still, in general, teachers are measured by how much their students learn. If the students fail, it does reflect poorly on the teacher. ",
