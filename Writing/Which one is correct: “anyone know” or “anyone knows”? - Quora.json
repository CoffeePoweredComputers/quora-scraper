            "answer_text": "When we use the words \u201canyone\u201d and \u201ceveryone\u201d, we mean, any, one, random, person out of many people and every single person out of a group of people, respectively. In both the cases, we talk about one individual. Therefore, both the words, \u201canyone\u201d and \u201ceveryone\u201d are always singular in number. Now, since, \u201canyone\u201d is singular, it will require main verbs and auxiliary verbs that are in agreement with singular nouns and some singular pronouns. I say some singular pronouns because the singular pronoun \u201cI\u201d is an exception. Therefore, \u201canyone knows\u201d is correct. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are collections of words, and don't make sense (grammatically) when used individually. However, both make sense when used in a sentence. If used as a question, we'll say-\"Does anyone know the name of the singer?\"We always use the basic form of the verb with does/do. Therefore, \u201cknow\u201d and not \u201cknows\u201d. In an affirmative sentence, we can use it like \"I don't think anyone knows the name of the singer\". It could also be used like \"If there's anyone who knows the name of the singer, please come up\". The rarest but grammatically correct way to use the 'anyone' and ' does' together in a sentence is to write like this- \u201cIdon't think he is very popular, but if anyone does know the name of the singer, he/she should come up\".
