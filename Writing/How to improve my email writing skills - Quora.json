            "answer_text": "It would have helped to write an applicable answer if you would have briefed about the subject under consideration. However, in general sense, reminder mails are broadly sent either specific to meeting a deadline/timeline or else for making sure of letting not someone forget about someone. The reminder mail, contextually, should be short, precise and polite. Also, another important factor is to keep an acceptable time gap between repetitive reminders, if in case reminder mail needs to be sent several times, which is common for work related mails. Example-1 : Work specific reminder mail, which is written to remind co-worker or team to follow one of newly introduced HR policy, following HR's email on same. \u201cHello team, Hope you might have gone through the HR's email sharing a few changes in HR policies. I trust your sense of obligation. Please feel free to share your concerns, if any. The policy is introduced to maintain the required decorum of organisation and thereby creating a healthy work environment. Your all's cooperation is expected in achieving the same. Regards, Mr. Xxx\u201d Example-2 : Reminder mail to your cousin to bring your earrings, which you had lended her a month ago and which she had been forgetting to bring in her past visits. \u201cHi Bansi, I am expecting to see you again soon. Please share your details of arrival. Also Bansi I hope you won\u2019t forget to bring my earrings along. A little recommendation to set a reminder for same just to make sure you grab them before you leave your place to be here. Looking forward to meet you soon!! Regards, Vidhi\u201d The choice of words should be in a way so as to enforce obligation in reader to remember the point highlighted in the message body!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Every email you send is going out into a blizzard. Business professionals spend 16 hours a week reading emails, and most are sending or receiving more than 100 per day. Punching through this noise demands a radical rethink of the way you communicate. Your recipient has just a few seconds to decide if your email is worth reading, and to try and get the gist of what you\u2019re after. So change the way you write. Here\u2019s how. 1. Have a clear objective The only purpose of a business email is to create a change in the reader. Before you send an email, ask yourself, \u201cWhat do I want the recipients to do?\u201d There are two possible answers: Respond to your request (\u201cCan you tell me which of these two logos you prefer?\u201d) or act (\u201cHere are the steps required to sign up for the new health plan.\u201d) If you expect neither response nor action, then you\u2019re just creating clutter; don\u2019t send the email. 2. Write short Keep your email to 250 words maximum. According to email software provider Boomerang, every word over 125 begins to reduce email response rates. If you have more to say, link to a more detailed document or, if absolutely necessary, attach one. 3. Make the subject line meaningful Recipients will open emails whose subject lines explain what\u2019s coming (for example, \u201cProduct tradeoffs that will enable us to meet the deadline.\u201d) Remember, that subject line becomes the topic for threads of responses. If you\u2019ve called the email \u201cStuff I became worried about this morning,\u201d nobody will know it\u2019s important, or be able to find and refer to it later. 4. Get directly to the point Forget the friendly warmup. The first two or three sentences \u2013 no more than 20 words \u2013 should explain exactly what the email is about. For example, when the Boston Globe changed delivery suppliers in December last year, it found that the new company was unable to deliver all of the papers on time. Here are the first few sentences of the email that Scott Steeves, the head of the Globe\u2019s union, sent to get other newspaper workers to help: Dear members \u2014 We are in crisis mode. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard about the papers not getting delivered this past week. We are looking for people to work tonight delivering papers in the Newton area. It worked, too. Dozens of reporters and other staff got the Sunday paper out in the wee hours of the morning. 5. Think outside the paragraph. Busy readers skim emails. Help them figure out what yours is about. Include headings, bullets, graphics, and links. They\u2019re a lot more inviting than a wall of paragraphs. 6. Stick to one topic. People flag emails and use them as a to-do list. If you\u2019re covering separate topics, create separate emails and send them to separate lists. 7. Write like a human. Dump the jargon and just say what you\u2019re looking for, in simple terms. If you\u2019re writing to customers, they\u2019ll appreciate a description that\u2019s designed to help them, not intimidate them. And if you\u2019re a manager, your staff will be grateful for a message that doesn\u2019t require a secret decoder ring. 8. Don\u2019t compose an email on a smartphone. You can go ahead and read or even respond to emails on your phone. But if you\u2019re creating a message to send to multiple people, you\u2019re going to want to think about it and edit it \u2013 and that\u2019s a whole lot easier on a computer. 9. Reply to senders, not to everyone. Get in the habit of hitting \u201cReply\u201d rather than \u201cReply All.\u201d Unless everyone else will benefit from your response, only the sender needs to see it. And you\u2019ll avoid the highly embarrassing \u201cReply All\u201d gaffe. 10. And finally, consider just talking to people. Sometimes a conversation is more productive than a chain of emails. If you\u2019re frustrated with people\u2019s inability to understand what you\u2019re getting at, just walk over or pick up the phone. For more information, you can also watch the below video.  ",
