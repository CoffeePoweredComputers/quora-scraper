            "answer_text": "You bet it is possible to work from home full time, and here\u2019s how\u2026 First, here\u2019s a bit about me and how I ended up working from home full-time. Before I ever started working from home full time, I was burnt out in a 9 - 5 job that was sucking the life force from me. When ever I got home I couldn\u2019t even be there for my wife as I was too tired and didn\u2019t have nothing inside of me to give. So as I was falling asleep on my desk, I realized that something needed change. I didn\u2019t want to spend my whole life living and working like that. So I did mlm businesses for a while on the side, but didn\u2019t succeed on it. Until one day I went online for ways to work from home, making money online. And that was when I life changed. I was guided to work from home and be an entrepreneur. Here\u2019s how YOU can work from home full-time or do it part-time first until you\u2019re earning enough to replace your current income. My best recommendation for you is to work from home through an online business. Here\u2019s all you need, assuming that you have a laptop/smarphone and an internet connection: A product or service that solves a problem to offer (A solution) People are searching for solutions all the time on the internet. Wouldn\u2019t that be cool if you had a solution? And people already looking for it online found it and paid you for it?An effective and efficient system that does the telling and selling on your behalf 24/7. The beauty about working from home full-time with your own online business is the FREEDOM it provides. Having a high-converting system in place gives you that freedom because it\u2019s doing 90% of the work for you. Not having this component in place will make you a slave to your business and not give you the time freedom you desire to do the things you love.Learn to drive traffic(eyeballs or visitors on the internet) into your system. Remeber above I mentioned that people are looking for solutions to their problems? Well your job when you work from home in your online business, is to get the solution in front of people that are already searching for it. This is called driving traffic to an offer that has the solution.This takes skills of course but there are different programs that already have all of this component done for you even if you don\u2019t previous experience. If you\u2019re starting out your best solution is to start working from home in an affiliate marketing program. With affiliate marketing you\u2019re simply getting paid for selling other people\u2019s products and the company keeps a portion of the sale to keep it running. This is the best way to work from home because You don\u2019t have to worry about creating products or doing products research to then create themYou don\u2019t have to worry about building your own systemsYou don\u2019t have to worry about traffic as these affiliate programs will train you and in some cases even provide you with a done for you traffic solution. So all you do is order traffic based on your marketing budget like ordering pizza and start seeing the system work for you and earn you money.Once you start earning enough income to replace your current one or even over pass it, then you can work from home full-time. Hope this helped answer your question and if you it did, please upvote and let me know in the comments.

            "answer_text": "Hi there, The first thing you should ask yourself is if you want to be an employee working from home or if you want your own at-home business. The reason why you want to work from home can help you decide this. For example, if you are like me and want to work from home to be with your kids, you will probably want something that is flexible and allows you to work when you want. As an employee working from home, you could very well still have to work at a certain time, for a certain number of hours and you have to be focused on work instead of taking care of the kids. With your own business, you can decide when and where you work. You can schedule your work around your life, which can be great if being with your kids is the reason you want to work from home. If you are looking for a \u2018job\u2019, I suggest to search on free classified sites such as kijiji, backpage, etc. by typing \u201cwork from home\u201d in the search box. The at-home opportunities can be few and far between so it may take you a while to find a job you are interested in, but they are out there. Keep an eye on the ads so you don\u2019t miss out. If you have an entrepreneurial spirit, you may be more interested in your own business. However, this is not for everyone. To have your own business from home means you must be disciplined and when you set aside time to work, you have to get down to business. There are many opportunities out there. You will definitely want to do plenty of research and see what is the right fit for you. Google, \u201cjobs from home\u201d, \u201cat home businesses\u201d or \u201conline businesses\u201d, etc. There are tons of articles out there with some great, detailed lists of different opportunities. After all my research when I was asking myself how to work from home, I decided on Network Marketing (which I never thought I would do!) You may be surprised on what ends up being the right fit for you. I absolutely love what I do! If you would like any advice or have any questions specifically about Network Marketing, I\u2019d always be happy to help :) ",

            "answer_text": "There are probably a lot of ways to step into the world of working from home. But most important thing is that when you are starting if you get the results or are able to make some money within few days of starting your work it become an encouraging reason for you to continue that work and if you are not able to make any money in the very beginning then a lot of people drop the plan and step out. And most of the ways to start earning from online seems to be the same time consuming. Ofcourse you will find lot of people sharing their views and even providing lot of knowledge about how they made thosands of dolloars doing particular work but when you actually follow them you will start realising that either it is already having lot of competition or it need you to first pay some money and even after paying money its not that you will surely start making money. I have faced ther same problem until I found this one strategy to start making as much as $25 to $30 perhour and the good part is you will be paid on regular basis so no tension of finding new clients everytime. And the best part is that you are going to get paid to use social media such as Facebook, Twitter or youtube. If you want to earn $100, $200 or even up to $500 a day, and like spending time on Facebook and Twitter then this is the perfect opportunity for you! As you know, businesses of all sizes right from McDonald\u2019s and Coca-Cola down to your local hardware store are trying to get a presence on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Think of how many \u2018Fan pages\u2019 and advertisements you have seen on Facebook recently for businesses in your local area. It\u2019s a big thing right now and it\u2019s making people just like you a lot of money. You see whilst all of these businesses want to get a presence on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter they don\u2019t have the time, ability or knowledge to do it themselves. They are far too busy with the day to day running of their business and they don\u2019t want to hire someone full time to do it because in most circumstances it only takes 1 \u2013 2 hours per day to manage. So what do you think they are doing about it? They are hiring people just like you to do it for them! They are paying people just like you great money to work from home doing simple tasks such as: Creating their Facebook Fan pagePosting status updates and commentsCreating Twitter profilesTweeting special offers and promotionsEngaging with their customers through comments and postsSpending time messing around on Facebook and Twitter!So if you think you are good at using social media platforms just click here to get started.

            "answer_text": " Thanks for the A2A, Sarah. The best way to land a work from home job involves three critical factors: Skills QualificationGetting past the application slush pileShowing you can work from homeSkills QualificationShowing that you have the skills required to do the job is fundamental to landing any job regardless if it\u2019s in an office or remote. Managers searching for the best candidates to work from home tend to look a lot closer at past experience, education and skills than office-based managers since they can\u2019t actually watch you doing the job when hired. Gut feeling and trust plays more of a role in the hiring process which means that along with being very clear about your qualifications you should do everything you can in your written and verbal communication to project confidence in yourself and skills. When I interview candidates I can hear a clear difference between \u201cI think I can\u201d versus \u201cI know I can.\u201d Be the candidate who \u201cknows.\u201d Getting past the application slush pileYou know you are the best candidate for the job but what if I told you that there was a 98% chance that your application, cover letter and resume will never be seen by a human and you will be rejected because a computer program\u2019s matching algorithm was only configured to match on a very specific pattern in every resume and yours was 1% off. Would you even bother applying? Don\u2019t trust the first layer of bureaucracy, human or machine, to recognize the perfect candidate (which is you, of course). Instead, use your Google search skills to track down the email address and phone number of the person at the company who is most likely to be responsible for the position you applying for. It\u2019s not as difficult as it sounds and you can probably find them in fewer than 5 minutes. Email them an introductory email and include your resume. Explain that you have questions that you would like to discuss before applying. If it\u2019s not the right person, they will usually send you to the person who is. Don\u2019t underestimate how helpful people will be for someone who is politely and professionally reaching out. If your email doesn\u2019t receive a response, call them. Be polite, respectful and persistent. For a little more detail on this technique check out the Quora question How do you find job you want? Showing you can work from homeBefore you get deep into a discussion with a potential employer and long before you get that first interview, learn how you can show that you are more than capable of working remotely without constant supervision. If you have never worked from home before, learn about the ups and downs and successful tactics of people who work at home full time. Quora is an amazing resource and packed with helpful threads on this subject. This step is often overlooked and is responsible for many people losing out to another candidate who may not have better job qualifications but could convincingly demonstrate that they could manage themselves from home. This process works. Period. You will get a great work from home job if you can address these three points. If you\u2019d like more help with landing the perfect work from home position, I offer webinars on how to get the best work from home jobs from anywhere without previous experience.

            "answer_text": "Today, technology allows us to work from almost anywhere! Whether that\u2019s in a conference room at the office or in the comfort of your own home, many employers are giving their staff the luxury of choosing their own workspace. If you are one of the many who have decided to work from home\u2014either on a full-time or an as-needed basis\u2014you have found yourself with a pretty amazing set up! However, this doesn\u2019t mean that working from home doesn\u2019t come with its own challenges. From being fully autonomous over your own workload to eliminating common distractions, there are different elements you need to be prepared for when choosing this type of work environment. Let\u2019s take a look at 5 ways you can ensure you\u2019re ready to work from home: Dress for the day When working from home, it might be easy to get into the habit of \u2018rolling out of bed\u2019 and starting your daily duties. Instead of sitting down at your computer in lounge clothes, however, begin your day as if you\u2019re commuting to the office. In doing so, dress for the day as if you were leaving the house first thing in the morning. Not only will more professional attire put you in a more productive mindset, you\u2019ll be less tempted to take a nap midday! Find a dedicated workspace Whether you\u2019re working at home for one day or you are a fully remote employee, finding a quiet space to set up your desk is crucial. Instead of lying in bed with your laptop, for example, try setting up at a different space in your home. This will not only help you eliminate distractions, but also better differentiate between your work and personal life. If you prefer this space to be a public establishment like a coffee shop or library, be sure to check and see if it\u2019s suitable that you stay for extended hours. In addition, there are plenty of coworking spaces that you can look into\u2014especially if you plan to work remotely in the long-term. Check your connectivity + technology Before working from home, it\u2019s important to certify your tech capabilities with your company\u2019s IT department. This means that every program needed to do your job should be easily accessible on your laptop or home computer. If your role requires heavy time on the phone, for example, double check that your desk phone forwarded to your cell. Or, do you have Photoshop available at home if you\u2019re a graphic designer? Keeping these questions in mind about your connectivity can make your work from home experience as productive as possible. Stay in touch often Working in a different location than your manager and team members means you have to be easily accessible. To help you keep in touch, there are tools such as Slack and Google Hangouts which make for a seamless stream of communication. If you plan on working remotely (or from a different location) in the long-term, you should plan on scheduling regular updates with your team. Keep a work-life balance When working outside of the office, it\u2019s easy to fall into the habit of working around the clock. Disconnecting after a day of work is helpful to wind down and relax, even if you\u2019re working in your immediate living space. When you log off for the day, just as you\u2019d be leaving the office, try to avoid checking back in after your work hours. Keeping a work-life balance can ultimately help you avoid burnout, and you\u2019ll be thankful you took the time to spend more time enjoying life outside of work with family and friends. ",

            "answer_text": "Freelance Writing Freelance writing is another way to earn online income if you don\u2019t mind earning some of your money with active work. Another benefit of freelance writing is that you can gain exposure by writing for larger websites. One of the first websites I wrote for paid me $150 per article. This wasn\u2019t a lot of money, but I used the opportunity to improve my writing skills and get my name out there. I don\u2019t write as much for other people anymore, but I do know plenty of freelance writers who are earning $250, $500, and even $1,000 or more per article. Selling Leads Once I was a few years into Good Financial Cents, I started a second website called Life Insurance by Jeff. While we initially started this website to build up our own leads, we got to the point where we had so many leads we couldn\u2019t handle them ourselves. Investment Gains Like anybody out there, you can set up an online brokerage account and buy ETFs or stocks. I\u2019ve been able to make at least $100 per day off my investments for a long time, and this income is some of my favorite since it\u2019s entirely passive. Keep in mind that it\u2019s crucial to have traditional investments in addition to an online business that can help you rack up passive income. Just open an account with Scottrade, TD Ameritrade, or another online brokerage and you\u2019re good to go. There are so many ways to invest online these days that there is literally no excuse not to. I am tired of the excuses, so start investing your money to grow long-term wealth today. YouTube Ads Even though I used YouTube back in 2011, I didn\u2019t even turn on ads until 2017. When I did finally turn ads on, I started making $5,000 per $6,000 per month! YouTube ads are easy because all you have to do is turn on ads every time you publish a video. Obviously, you\u2019ll earn more money with this strategy as you build your viewership. Brand Sponsorships This strategy runs alongside sponsored posts, but it\u2019s much more involved. Many brands want more than a sponsored post when they work with you. In fact, they are often willing to pay for some sort of sponsorship package that includes written content, videos, social shares, and more. I\u2019ve done a few of these over the years, and they can be very lucrative but also a huge pain! But, if you\u2019re willing to jump through some hoops and you have a sizeable following, you can absolutely consider brand sponsorships as yet another way to earn money online. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you planning to work at home? Great! There is so many benefits work at home. But lack of planning you might have to face some problem. Last couple year I work from home. In the beginning, I face some problem. Then I maintain a healthy routine. And still, I need to adjust my rutin according to the situation. The tips which share to you is followed by me. Its worked for me. You can also apply to your situation. Weak up early in the morning: This is something that I would say, whatever you do in your life. Are you a student, an employe, parents, whatever it is everyone must wakeup in the early morning. The benefits of the weak up early morning everyone knows, but for some, it's very hard to wake up early in the morning. Make an alarm before go to bed. And try to stick to it.Get ready: Exercise must. Take a shower, and dressed up. You are not wearing the same pyjama that you wear last night. It affects your work. Be thankful to God for everything you have. Imagine a ZERO negativity life. No complaints, no blaming, No excuses. That's how Allah wants you to lead your life. No matter what the circumstances always faith in Allah.Need A working area: Yes, you work at home. But still, you need a work station. That keeps you motivated. Organise your workplace. Everything should be in, please. SO you can find the tools when you needed. It also improves your productivity.Maintain a routine: Nothing new! Everyone knows about the benefit of making rutin in different purposes. Your Routine must be according to your situation. And it's adjustable. Make a realistic routine, do not make a routine that you can't fulfil. I can't even imagine my life without a routine. Two years ago when I lift my job, decided it goes with the flow. No routine no plan. I continued this for approximately 3 months. The result was I went to bed at 9 am and Wakeup 4/5 pm. Life was miserable. I was disturbed, unhappy, don't know what to do. My processes to thinking way of thinking everything was wrong. In general, I am a positive and happy person. Then I organised my life. Maintain a healthy routine. And Alhamdulillah today I am happy more than anything. And I thank Allah for everything in my life. And also thanks for those three months, now I know how goes life without routine.Set a goal: It can be long term, can be short term, daily bassed, hourly bassed. Set accounting to demand. It's really helpful. Set a realistic goal and that can help you to fulfil. Sometimes we failed to fulfil our goal, don't worry reset goal and try it again. When you start to doing something say Bismillah with intention. Allah will help you to fulfil it.Reduce distraction: Distraction, Distraction, Distraction. In today's life, we all are the victim in various distraction. Imagine, you are working, suddenly your phone rings or notification (TING!). You just check this notification, and you think it just takes 5 second or less, but if you notice you lost almost 30 minutes. Because you lost your concentration. You need to reconcentrated your work. I don't say do not use social media. Use it with conscious and try to get some benefit from it. But during work turn off ringtone and notification. Work without distraction can save your energetic and save time. You can be more productive.Breaks are also necessary: It's a healthy way of leaving. Constantly setting, working computer, put your self various desires. It improves your working quality and productivity. What to do during a break, Pray, Do household work, Walk around, have lunch or take small snacks, take a powerful nap, drinking tea, coffee, water. For me, I pray, Household work, play with my son, take food and very rarely take a nape. It improv my working quality and productivity.Do not mix your personal life with working life: That's a very hard part. Especially for parents. When you are planning to work at home you will count as a benefit that you stay at home so you can take care of your child during your work. It's Misconception. Nither concentrate your work not take care of your baby. Make routine wisely, give priority to your child. Make sure you are with him when he needs you. And at the working time, he is busy or with someone.The ideas are not new. I just share my experience. There are also so many types I tried but those are not worked for me. Still, I synthesize my routine followed by the situation. ",

            "answer_text": "10 Real Work-From-Home Jobs If you want to coast into the future with real skills that pay, check out these real work-at-home jobs for 2020 and beyond: Virtual Assistant With so many businesses operating mostly, or even completely, online, it\u2019s no wonder that many hire virtual assistants to help keep them organized and complete administrative tasks. According to the International Virtual Assistants Association, these workers are \u201cindependent contractors who (from a remote location, usually their home or office) support multiple clients in a variety of industries by providing administrative, creative, and technical services.\u201d Although virtual assistant jobs vary drastically, tasks can include composing and responding to emails, creating and distributing business-related documents, responding to media and business inquiries, writing and creating content, and more. While pay varies, virtual assistants average around $26,350 a year, with the top percentage making $43,000. However, what you\u2019ll earn depends on who you work for and the level of skill required for your daily tasks. Medical Transcriptionist Although many medical transcriptionists work for hospitals or physician\u2019s offices, most are able to work at home, and at a time or place of their choosing. Since their tasks involve transcribing recorded medical dictation, a computer, desk, and earpiece are generally the only requirements after completing a postsecondary medical transcriptionist program. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), medical transcriptionists earned a national median wage of $34,770 in May of 2018, or $16.72 an hour. Although many medical transcriptionists are self-employed, many find jobs through their local hospital, physician, or community college or vocational school. Translator According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most translators do their work at home, and often under tight deadlines. Although some need a bachelor\u2019s degree, the most important requirement for translators is, of course, fluency in at least two languages. As the BLS notes, around 22% of translators were self-employed in 2018. The majority were spread among these industries: professional, scientific, and technical services (33%); state, local, and private educational services (18%); hospitals (8%); and government (8%). The national median wage for this career was $49,930 in 2018, although the top 10% of workers earned an average of $90,610. Web Developer It\u2019s fairly easy to build your own website if you take advantage of the many free learning opportunities online. However, much of the population isn\u2019t equipped to build their own site or don\u2019t have the time, which is why so many people make a living building websites and blogs for others. According to the BLS, around 16% of web developers were self-employed in 2018, with the vast majority able to work at home, or anywhere with a laptop and speedy Internet connection. Even better, the national median wage for web developers was $69,430 in 2018, with the top 10% earning an average of $124,480. And you typically don\u2019t need an advanced degree to begin working in this field. All you need is some postsecondary education, applicable experience, and a portfolio of successful sites you\u2019ve built and managed. There are even intensive coding boot camps designed to teach programming skills in just a few short months. Travel Agent Although the demand is expected to decrease over the next decade, the opportunities are still there for travel agents who can harness the Internet to earn clients and help them plan their adventures. According to the BLS, job prospects may be best for travel agents who offer expertise in certain regions of the world, have experience planning tours or adventures, or who focus on group travel. Around 11% of travel agents were self-employed in 2018, but the vast majority of the rest of them worked in the travel arrangement and reservation services industry. Travel agents earned a national median wage of $38,700 in 2018. Freelance Writer More than ever, writers are needed to formulate news articles, create content, and come up with creative ideas that fill the pages of nearly every site on the Internet. And although many bigger sites have in-house writers, a growing number of sites outsource their content and hire freelance writers and content creators. Writing experience is very helpful, but what you really need to get started are drive, ambition, and the ability to find a unique angle on events that happen every day. Sites like Upwork | Hire Freelancers. Make things happen. list online freelancing positions, as does Freelancer.com and Media Bistro.

The BLS notes that writers earned a median wage of $62,170 nationally in 2018, although the top 10% of workers earned around $121,670.

Blogger Becoming a blogger is unlike any other work-at-home job in that you have to show up and build it yourself. Even worse, the vast majority of blogs make zero dollars for years as they grow and become established. In that sense, blogging isn\u2019t much of a job at all. However, there is a lot of potential for writers who are able to build an audience, grow their site, and find a way to monetize it and start earning an income. Some of the ways bloggers make money include affiliate advertising, sponsored posts, Google Adsense, and product sales. According to Glassdoor, established bloggers make $32,934 a year.

References help, too, especially if you can list anyone who has overseen work you have done in any of these fields. Another important thing to consider if you are a freelancer or remote worker is picking the right business credit card.

They cost as little as $0.99 to register with GoDaddy.com yet premium domain names can fetch $1,000s if not millions when sold on. In 2007 Vrbo | Book your vacation rentals: beach houses, cabins, condos & more went for a cool $35m! Now you're probably not going to come across anything like that, but you can still turn a quick profit with a bit of searching. The trick is to find available domain names which have some commercial value, snap them up and then list them for sale on a site like Sedo.com. 23. Mystery shopping Today becoming a mystery shopper is easier than you think and you can get rewarded handsomely. There are dozens of agencies that pay you to visit all sorts of shops and restaurants to feedback on how they are performing. We've reviewed the best agencies in our guide. 24. Be an Extra Do you fancy yourself as a budding young actor or just that person that walks past in the background shot of an episode of Eastenders? It could be you if you apply to be an extra in TV or film. The pay isn't bad either: \u00a360-80 a day on average, and you hardly have to do anything! There are lots of casting agencies that place willing extras. They make their money by taking a cut from your earnings, so always ask what that is before you take on work. 25. Sell all your old CDs, games and movies If you are looking to make a very quick buck, then selling your old bits and bobs that are cluttering up your room is a good idea. The best thing about it is that you can rip all the songs and films onto your laptop or external hard drive before selling them. This means that you are only really selling the plastic and artwork! 26. Sell on your education! Becoming a tutor to other students is easier than ever. Until recently your market was limited to local face-to-face sessions, but thanks to online tutoring sites you can go global! Udemy allows anyone to create an online course (on literally anything!) and get paid forever after as users take it up. 27. Sell your photos If you think you've got a good shot and a little creativity, try uploading your photographs for free to stock websites. A good starting point is Adobe Stock or Getty Images. 28. Rent out your car parking space Some student accommodation comes with a drive or garage. If you aren't using your parking space and you live in a busy area then you might be in luck. There are plenty of people that may work in the city centre and are fed up of paying through the roof for daily parking. 29. Babysitting It's a classic money-maker, and for good reason. You get paid (well) to watch TV and not very much else - hopefully! If you are wondering what to charge have a look at local ads, but you can expect to be paid over \u00a39ph even if you aren't trained in childcare. 30. Dog walking & sitting If babies ain't your thing, then maybe canines are... dog sitting is big business. Students especially are likely to have free time during the day when others are out at work and worried about their pets at home. You could bag around \u00a38 an hour per dog, and it's also a great way to keep fit. 31. Become your own bank 'Peer-to-peer' lending is the future of banking. It cuts out the middle-man, passing on higher interest rates to you and cheaper loans to borrowers. And it's all managed online from the comfort of your sofa. 32. Work as a charity collector Ok, so this job takes a certain kind of person, as you'll have to take a lot of rejection and be persistent. But if you are bubbly, personable and reckon you could sell ice to an Inuit then this could actually be a great student money making idea. You get paid commission on new sign ups (typically around \u00a320). 33. Rent out your house for filming Directors for TV and film are always on the hunt for houses to film in. For instance, a scene for Coronation Street was recently filmed in the student house one of the Save the Student editors used to live in! 34. Rent out your body If you are comfortable taking off your kit then why not try life modelling. Sit there in the buff while budding artists capture your every curve (or pokey bits) in frightening detail! Try RAM, a website especially designed for these kinds of jobs. 35. Freelance work Perhaps you enjoy writing, managing Facebook pages or doing a little bit of graphic design in your spare time. There are so many freelance jobs out there that require simple skills or just time that someone else might not have. 36. Sell clothes on eBay Everyone's best friend when it comes to getting rid of junk is eBay. Online auctions are a sure-fire way to turn that sleeveless jacket (which came in and out of fashion in a week) into hard cash. 37. Sell your stories and videos If you have an interesting story then you could try selling it to the papers. It could be anything from sleeping with a professional footballer to getting caught in a clothes horse! One of the Save the Student team was unfortunate enough to have a pigeon fly through and smash their window at university and sold the story to The Sun for a tidy \u00a350. You could also film your mates at all times and send it into You've Been Framed to net yourself \u00a3250 and a few seconds of fame. 38. YouTube videos According to recent stats we now watch more videos on YouTube than searches on Google. And with the recently introduced YouTube Partner Program you can now profit from making and uploading videos. You will receive a percentage of the advertising revenue collected per 1,000 views. Depending on how successful you are (virality, subscriber base and topic) you can make a lot of money, and there are plenty of stories every week of more and more YouTubers making it their career. 39. Watch videos If creating videos sounds like too much hard work, then getting paid to watch videos online has to be one of the easiest ways to make money, ever. For more involved and rewarding opportunities, consider branching out as a freelancer typing up movie subtitles or writing film reviews. 40. Source property for wealthy investors We all know how much money there is in property, but on the surface (with house prices as high as they are) you might be thinking this market is off-limits. Truth is, lots of people make a great deal of cash simply sourcing suitable properties for wealthy investors who simply have no time. Source: SaveTheStudent[dot]org ",

            "answer_text": "The process to start working from home has been taken from my blog Start an online business to earn passive income. The general steps include the following: Brainstorm and select a potentially profitable business idea that solves a burning problem for your potential customers who are willing and able to pay you.Conduct an in-depth due diligence of your target niche market and of your potential customers.Quickly validate your business idea by surveying, prototyping, and selling your minimum viable product or service to your potential customers as a proof of concept.Validate any feedback received from your proof of concept.Improve and commercialize your product or service, especially if the numbers are right. (If not, select another business idea and repeat these steps until you have found one that will most likely generate profits for you.)Build a \u2018good enough\u2019 (not poor quality) website (see below) and fill it with great content. Use words and phrases your visitors will find familiar. Speak as they would speak, if you will. Take a cue from the types of calls to action your direct and indirect competitors are using. Font, color, and images all have emotional values. Be purposeful when choosing them. Writing copy that tells a story can help you make an emotional appeal.Start attracting visitors to your website and convert them into leads; more importantly warm or hot leads. Offer a free gift where people only pay for shipping. Push visitors to subscribe to your email list or download a relevant free resource. Once they\u2019ve made a small commitment, they\u2019re more likely to make a bigger commitment. Use visual cues to direct visitors down the page, especially if you have valuable product information below the \u2018fold\u2019.Encourage social sharing at every stage. Market and promote your products or services to your leads by regularly engaging with them.Optimize your sales and profit by converting your leads into paying customers. Offer a welcome discount for first-time buyers, product samples, an unexpected free gift to go along with an ordered product, etc. Offer a tripwire, an irresistible and low price product designed not to make money, but to change the relationship from casual visitor to actual buyer. Have an influencer or expert endorse or provide a testimonial for your product. Show the number of people who have purchased recently or how many people are currently viewing the product. Offer limited-time-only discounts and deals. A countdown to when the discount or deal ends can spur purchases. In the cart, show how much the visitor saved with a call to action to check-out before the savings expire.Offer free express shipping or something similar to those who purchase before a certain time of day.Upsell other products and services to these paying customers, especially higher priced items. Send appreciation cards and notes to existing customers.General technical steps to build a website Steps to build a website include the following: Find a niche that you have practical solutions for solving your potential customers\u2019 problems. By solving their pain points, your website will attract readers or traffic. For ideas, go to Trend Hunter, Kickstarter, Uncrate, and Fancy without leaving out social media platforms.Select either a self-hosted WordPress site or a free page on com. If you are a blogger who does not care about making money, go with WordPress.com: Create a free website or blog. If you are a blogger trying to make blogging as a profitable career, you will want to use self-hosted WordPress website that will cost money to set up. Note that these costs are tax deductible if you are a start-up business.Pick the right domain name from Namecheap or GoDaddy. If you choose the wrong domain name, it can be a hassle to switch later on without hurting your brand and search rankings. That\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important that you choose the best domain name from the start. Keep in mind the following: stick with .com; use keywords in your domain name that will tell search engines what your website is about; keep it short (aim for no more than three words); make it easy to pronounce and spell; keep it unique and brandable; avoid hyphens; avoid doubled letters; avoid \u201ccutesy\u201d names and abbreviations; stay clear of copyright issues; protect your privacy with a privacy service; and leave room to expand.Choose a WordPress hosting service like Bluehost, Dreamhost, HostGator or SiteGround. There are different types of WordPress hosting options available such as free, shared, virtual server hosting, dedicated and managed hosting.Install WordPress on your website using MOJO Marketplace, Softaculous, QuickInstall (preferred), Fantastico, or file transfer protocol.Select a WordPress theme that enables what you are doing. (As an analogy, WordPress is the basic engine of a car and the WordPress theme is the design and style of the car) Your chosen WordPress theme should complement the content of your website. For example, if you are starting a blog on politics or social issues, you want a WordPress theme that improves readability. When selecting your WordPress theme, strive for simplicity.Choose a mobile responsive WordPress theme across different screen sizes and devices, browser compatible, supports all popular plugins, multi-lingual ready (use WordPress Multi Language plugin), and search engine optimization friendly.Check ratings and reviews for the WordPress theme. Review Elegant Themes, StudioPress, Themify, and Themes for WordPress themes.Verify your WordPress themes using Themecheck. It\u2019s a quick service that lets you verify WordPress themes for security and code quality. This service is free and compatible with Joomla templates.Install plugins for WordPress. A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that extend the functionality or add new features to your WordPress website. There are different categories of plugins: security, backup, performance, marketing, analytics, monetization, styling/design, comments, social media, contact, get found/ search engine optimization, landing page, etc. Questions to ask before installing a plugin: (1) Is the developer a well-known contributor? Do they have other popular plugins? (2) Is the plugin updated often? (3) Has the plugin been downloaded/installed enough times by other people? (4) Has anyone said they had a drop in performance when installing and using this plugin?Install and setup Google Analytics to your WordPress website by signing up for your free Google account. The best way to know your audience is through your Internet traffic stats and Google Analytics provides the information for free.Setup a professional email address for your business. A professional email is one that has your business name in it (e.g., john@ABC.com). John.ABC@gmail.com does not look professional.Content is king. Without high-quality content on your website, no one is going to visit or recommend your site. Good and fresh content will rank highly in Google search results.How to start an eCommerce website Select your product niche after conducting a market search and evaluation. You can\u2019t really start selling any product until you know what you want to sell. If you pick the wrong niche or the wrong set of products, you could be shooting yourself in the foot well before you even begin. In selecting your product niche, select a target market that is not completely saturated and super competitive. If you choose a very narrow niche and you are the best at selling these products, you can easily outsell larger branded shops. You should always focus on selling to a niche market rather than trying to satisfy everyone. Pick an area where you have expertise and interest, and can effectively position yourself as a specialist retailer or go-to person. It\u2019s about product differentiation that meets customer\u2019s requirements. If you offer everything, it\u2019s impossible to compete with big online shops like Amazon and eBay. But in a small niche, you can differentiate yourself and really stand out.Identify the product you want to sell. The product should be easy to pack and ship and not be fragile. It should not take up much physical space, is timeless and sells from $20 to $200. Understand the legal and custom requirements of online retail before you start to sell online. Some products cannot be sold online. Others have age and import restrictions, or tax and intellectual property implications.Identify who are your customers who will buy your products. Knowing who your customers are and understanding their requirements and pain points will help you narrow down the appropriate product that will meet your customer\u2019s requirements and needs.Evaluate or assess the product demand by your potential customers. When you first start out, avoid common items like T-shirts or really strange and obscure product ideas. Use Google Keyword Planner, Google Trends, Google Search Results, eBay/ Terapeak (eBay product research), Amazon/ Jungle Scout (Amazon product research), and comparison shopping engines like Amazon Product Ads, Google Shopping, Nextag, Pricegrabber, Pronto, Shopping, and Shopzilla.Once you know that there is good and sustainable demand for your product, assess your competition. Do your competitors have quality websites? What Google ranking do they have? Do they offer a good shopping experience? What is their pricing? Find out what they do well and what they do poorly. Buy their products and figure out how you can improve upon them. Use tools like Semrush and SimilarSites to uncover information about your competitors.Test and validate your product idea and its value proposition and benefits with your friends and potential customers. Get a feel for whether your product is a winner or has legs. You may also want to consider buying a small quantity to sample and try selling them on eBay to gauge customer demand. You are testing the market.Source your product locally or overseas using wholesale pricing once you know that your product is a winner with the customers you want to sell to. If you source products overseas, there are customs and importation taxes and processes to deal with. When importing products, there are longer lead times, quality issues, relationship building, language barriers, time zone issues, contracting, payment terms and minimum orders to worry about and manage. Are you shipping your products by air or sea? Do you have a customs agent to help you with documentation, entry, duty, and bond? Visit websites like SaleHoo, a directory containing 2.5+ million of wholesale products from 8,000+ wholesale suppliers.Determine whether you want to carry or hold inventory or just drop-ship. Drop-shipping is a type of online store where you are only responsible for taking orders and handling customer service. Once an order is placed on your website by your customers, your vendor will be automatically notified and handles the shipping and delivery of product to the customer. You should ensure that the ordered product is actually delivered to the customer within the agreed time frame and condition. Find drop ship vendors using websites like WorldWide Brands and Doba.Are you buying wholesale or from a middle-person? Can you distinguish between the two?Start your own online store completely from scratch using WordPress to build your own sales funnel or use existing eCommerce marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, and Etsy that can potentially offer you instant sales. These marketplaces charge commissions on each sale. They have strict terms and conditions that are ever changing. Diversification is key \u2013 don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket. Start off with existing marketplaces to learn the ropes and gradually move your business and traffic to our own online website with a uniquely branded web address.Your ultimate goal is to set up your own online store platform. The biggest mistake most people make is not choosing the right platform for their online eCommerce store. There are two types of eCommerce platforms: (i) BigCommerce, Magento, PrestaShop or Shopify are fully hosted eCommerce solutions where you just log in and immediately start selling where they can get expensive with fees and commissions; or (ii) WordPress + WooCommerce (free plugin) that offers flexibility but requires some setup.To setup your WordPress + WooCommerce store, you need to have your ownAfter buying your domain name and web hosting, install the WordPress open source content management system andSelect and customize your own WordPress theme. Themes control how your WordPress website will look to the users when they visit it including how your products are displayed for sale. There are thousands of paid and free WordPress themes available for online stores.Set up your WooCommerce store by downloading the free WooCommerceplugin. Before you can start selling, there are a few things like currency, payments, and shipping information you need to set up. WooCommerce needs Internet pages for cart, account, shop, and check out. WooCommerce can be used to sell both digital downloads and physical goods that need shipping. By default, WooCommerce comes with support for PayPal, PayPal Standard, and Stripe payment gateways.Add products to your online store. Set up your \u2018Product Categories\u2019 first. This allows you and your customers to sort and browse products easily. Then add \u2018Product Data\u2019 information like description, pricing, inventory, shipping etc. Then add a main high quality, high-resolution product image, and a product gallery. Repeat the process to add more products as needed.Enhance your online store with other WordPress plugins. There are over 46,000 WordPress plugins available.

            "answer_text": "A major problem is how to remain productive when there are so many distractions at home that can get in the way of your work. Stay on target with these five productivity tips and give yourself grace if you can\u2019t manage them all. They\u2019ll help you stay focused and get the job done. 1. Have a Dedicated Office Space Whether you have a room set aside to be your office or a section of a room dedicated to work, it\u2019s important to have a place to \u201cgo to work.\u201d Be sure to have all the office necessities there: a desk, a comfortable chair, computer and telephone, filing or storage solutions, office supplies, and adequate lighting. This room or space should put you in a work mindset, so when you go there you\u2019re prepared mentally to do your job. Your custom office space should appeal to your work ethic and mindset. While a TV is generally distracting, some people work better with background noise. You know yourself better than anyone \u2013 just be reasonable and practical about the setup. In other words, don\u2019t just pull out your laptop and work from your bed in your pajamas. That might put you in a state of mind to update Facebook or even drift off to sleep! 2. Set and Enforce Boundaries When you\u2019re working from home a major productivity-buster can be the people you live with. The child who wants your attention. The pet who wants to hop in your lap or go out for a walk. The friends or family members who call just to talk because you\u2019re home. To combat these distractions, it\u2019s important to set and enforce rules for when you are working from the comfort of home. If you have a door, close it. If you don\u2019t, try hanging a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign on the back of your chair or set up some other notice that you are not available. Distractions are the downfall of productivity, and working without some healthy boundaries will cause more harm than good. Post a schedule so others can see when you\u2019ll be taking a break or are finished. Tell family not to call unless it\u2019s an emergency. Enforce these rules from the get-go so they become a habit for everyone. 3. Set Regular Working Hours Just because you\u2019re working from home, doesn\u2019t mean you should roll out of bed at 10 a.m. or take a two-hour lunch break. Schedule hours to work, just as you would in an office setting. Set your alarm, take a shower and get dressed, and eat breakfast before you begin work. This will help put you in a mindset for working, not lounging. No matter your profession, there will still be deadlines to meet. Set reminders that you have responsibilities and stick to a schedule. Do take a lunch break, but keep it to a reasonable time, no longer than an hour. Take this opportunity to eat, spend time with family or make those personal calls. If family is adhering to the second tip, they will know that this is a time you are available. 4. Keep it Clean It\u2019s tough to be productive when your desk and office area is a cluttered mess. Be sure to keep your desk clean and clear of any clutter. Keep a trash can nearby to toss unwanted items and a filing system to keep your important papers organized. Have an in-bin for items that need your attention. Make sure only work-related items are in your office; no kids\u2019 toys (which could attract the kids) or piles of junk from elsewhere in the house. Your office space should be for your work only! 5. Eliminate Background Noise Noises and other distractions will kill your productivity. Crying children, noisy lawnmowers and email alerts can all jolt you out of what you need to be doing. Turn off all alerts and vow to check email only at certain times of the day, such as first thing in the morning, before and after lunch, and at the end of your workday. Have your personal cell phone send all messages to voicemail during working hours. ",

            "answer_text": " 50 Work-From-Home Jobs Paying so Much or a Lot More Than the Average American Salary Sometime in the past telecommuting was an unrealistic fantasy, however as of late, there's been a flood of occupations you can do from your own place. Regardless of whether that is working distantly for an organization or going into business, there's no deficiency of work-from-home chances. Here are 50 alternatives, huge numbers of which can produce yearly profit that liken to more than the normal American compensation. 1. Member Marketer For those new to partner showcasing, it's just referral promoting where you win a commission. Suppose that you have a site and allude a book on Amazon. At the point when the guest taps the partner interface and purchases the book, Amazon will pay you a level of the deal. Individuals love offshoot showcasing on the grounds that they can begin winning cash latently with not many startup costs. 2. Artist Is it true that you are an aesthetic and imaginative person who can make liveliness and enhanced visualizations for TV, films, computer games and different sorts of media? At that point you can work at home as independent artist. (By and by, I've seen illustrators make between $25 to $106 an hour on destinations like Upwork.) 3. Dough puncher/Caterer/Chef In the event that you have a talent for heating or cooking, at that point transform your energy into a side business. From your own kitchen, you could begin a providing food business or become an individual culinary expert. In case you're a bread cook, you could offer you products to companions, neighbors, on the web or at nearby rancher's business sectors. 4. Blogger Blogging is economical and simple to begin doing. It could be as straightforward as you simply expounding on your preferred music or food, and in the long run, you can begin creating cash from your site. Simply remember that you have to pay tolerant with regards to taking advantage of your blog. On the off chance that this is something you need to seek after, look at this guide. 5. Clerk In all honesty, you don't need to be a CPA to begin accounting. Simply pursue an accounting course at a junior college or even on the web, (for example, this course from The Accounting Coach). When you complete a course, you can begin winning, and the middle pay is purportedly $34,000. (Some stay-at-home clerks I've spoken with by and by make more than $70,000.) 6. Youngster Caregiver Regardless of whether if it's only for a few hours or for the whole day, maintaining a childcare business from your home can be worthwhile. Simply ensure that you get the right licenses and allows. 7. Clinical Research Coordinator Clinical exploration facilitators help oversee activities for clinical preliminaries. You could make more than $48,000 with this activity, and you needn't bother with a four year certification. 8.

            "answer_text": " I\u2019ve worked at home for years as a copywriter for a multinational software company. I also started my business while working from home. On the flip side, I\u2019ve also worked in an open plan office. I\u2019d never trade the former for the latter, even if it meant a pay cut. Working from home unlocked extra hours in my week that I\u2019d otherwise have to spend stuck in traffic or on a packed, sweaty train. Other contributors posted lots of ideas about the types of jobs that are ideal for working from home. But let me cover the \u201cHow\u201d Working from home (or WFH) is all about mindset. You are the custodian of the day. By all means, enjoy a lie in, get up late and take calls in a dressing gown. That\u2019s a sure fire way to turn WFH into a a protracted experience whereby you find yourself playing catchup every night or at the weekends. A routine that gets you up and out of the house at lunch or in the evenings helps you accomplish more than stay in shape. It staves off the loneliness every home worker faces. For me, that involves activities like CrossFit or long-distance running\u2026 and often with other people. Focus is key for the new home worker. Your phone, social media, games consoles, magazines and the news are all tempting distractions. Purge them from wherever you intend to get stuff done. And while you\u2019re there, associate one place in your house or flat with working. That could be a chair at your kitchen table or a quiet room at the top of the office. In other words, the laptop and your to-do list doesn\u2019t belong in bed. You\u2019ll need to polish a few skills too. Can you present on a video-conference? Do you know how and when to use instant messaging software? And are you ok with fixing equipment and software when it breaks? Because IT isn\u2019t usually instantly on hand. Right now (March 2020), many of us are taking part in a great working from home experiment, willingly or otherwise. The results may surprise you. ",

The first question to ask yourself is, \u201cWhat marketable skills do I have that can be done from home?\u201d Skills such as writing, administrative/secretarial/data entry tasks, graphic design, marketing, computer coding, and customer service all lend themselves to work from home. If you are trained as an electrician, HVAC contractor, or physician, you\u2019re more likely to be required on site; it\u2019s just the nature of the work. Next, get some real world experience - yes, in an office, with other people - under your belt. I would say at least 5 years of office experience. This trains you to understand the machinations of the typical office environment. You will learn how offices work, how people think, and how to work together. You will need to be scrupulously honest and reliable. When people cannot see you on a daily basis trust becomes a central issue; break their trust once, and they will not work with you again. Where to find jobs? It depends on what you are looking for and a simple Google search reveals many freelance jobs to work from home. It\u2019s not for everyone.

            "answer_text": "I think the real question is why should you work from home? The answer is because of time efficiency; you will literally have more time per day. I\u2019ve worked from home for over a year now and I can simply do more stuff now than I could when I worked in an office. When you work in an office there are a number of \u201ctime sucks\u201d, things that eat up your time, that you\u2019re often not aware of.  The biggest one is your commute. I used to waste an hour each day driving to and from work. That\u2019s one less hour I had to do other things like exercise, hangout with friends, or simply relax and do nothing. But it doesn\u2019t stop there.  Inertia is also a big time suck. By inertia I\u2019m referring to the time it takes you to walk from your office to the elevator, then go down the elevator, then walk to your car or the bus, and then sit down and decompress for about 2 minutes before you begin your actual commute. And then once you get home you probably have to change your clothes, put your work stuff away, sit down and decompress again for a few minutes, and mentally prepare yourself to do whatever it is you\u2019re going to do next. Think of your inertia like your phone on low battery. Before you can make your next call you have to charge it up for a few minutes, lest you want it to turn off in the middle of your conversation. Your mind has to \u201ccharge up\u201d a little bit before switching tasks. Overall your commute itself might have wasted an hour of your day, but your inertia also took an additional 30 minutes, for a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes wasted.  The final big time suck is maintenance. Maintenance is the time you spend maintaining your vehicle and other intangibles related to your commute. When you commute to work you have to stop to buy gasoline more often, you also have to get your oil changed for frequently, rotate your tires, etc. These things may not seem like a big deal, but over the course of a month they can add up to an hour or more of lost time. That\u2019s one less hour you have to exercise or do something you truly enjoy. So now, including maintenance, we have an average of about 1 hour and 35 minutes wasted every day. In conclusion, a good reason to work from home is that you avoid time sucks like commuting, inertia, and maintenance. In other words, you\u2019ll more time to do the stuff that you want to do.

WHAT IS THE REASON TO JOIN WORK AT HOME EDU Now they just focus on making it look like a real program and took out all the hype. This is not real work at home opportunity with this Work at Home EDU fraud. After you buy the system, they tell you to call a specialist that can help get you started for only 4K lol. The program is similar to the work at Home University but has been redirected to Home EDU at Work so that they basically use the same product and different names. JOIN WORK AT HOME If you go to Wahedu.COM is for sale you will see that they are trying to sell and market much better as they try very hard to make this program look legit. The marketing on Work At Home EDU is much more informative and tells you what you will be doing. The problem is, even though they are telling you what you will be doing they still redirect you to the same sales page that is used in the Work At Home Institute scam found here http://wahinstitute.net and the work at home university scam. Although they did a better job on the sales page, they sold exactly the same scam product with the website\u2019s facelift and a new name. IS WORK AT HOME EDU A SCAM | WHAT IS WORK AT HOME EDU? So, is training any good? While it appears, you do get a little training when you sign up for Work at Home EDU, it is not good information. Most of the time you will get theory and generic training that would be hard for a newbie to act on. They will not offer step by step actions and a clear guide to see results. In other words, the training at Work at Home Edu is not going to get you from a newbie to a full-time internet marketer. In fact, information, as they give, could just make things worse and inundate you with too much filler information. IS WORK AT HOME EDU A SCAM | WHY WORK AT HOME EDU IS NOT FOR YOU how to work at home So I have already told you that the course cost $97 dollars to register and at that time they initially say that they have a 365-day money-back guarantee. This is a conditional refund which is in the fine print. This course has 3 365 days return so that you forget to give it back or when you try as a return policy they will surround you that you only get a refund if you just follow the course. How To Start With Affiliate Marketing For Beginners 2020 This leaves many ways for them to get out of refunding your money. So normally someone will buy the $97 dollar course and then they are hoping you go past 60 days and then they basically can keep your money unless you did everything perfectly. Also, the $97 dollar registration is said to be a one time fee, but that only gets you 6 months access. They will also be hounding you with upsells after you join, this is typically the way they make most of their money. There 24/7 support is more like a sales team that tries to upsell you on much more expensive packages. Also, once you are a part of the Work At Home EDU scam they will also share your personal data with partner companies who will call for all sorts of offers and have auto dialers with recorded messages and crazy text messages. Even if you are a part of the do not call list they can still call you after you sign up, as that gives them permission again. IS WORK AT HOME EDU A SCAM | WORK AT HOME EDU CONCLUSION So, is work at home jobs in education Scam Yes, it is in my opinion and I do not recommend anyone throw away your money with this course. If you have tried this program and feel that it is better than I have stated them, please leave a comment below and we can discuss it. When it comes down to it, if you want to be successful online, you need to have a strong mind and be realistic. You must wade through all the hype and play devil\u2019s advocate whenever you see a new online opportunity such as the Work at Home EDU fraud. People that think setting up an online business is a breeze will end up, giving up. Not only do you need to have the proper mindset, but also you need a solid foundation that you can understand easily without loads of filler info. American Income Life Insurance Company | Not A Scam Job The only thing that you get with Work at Home EDU is unsatisfactory training and sleazy salespeople that try to sell you like a used car salesperson close to the end of the pay period for high-priced back end coaching programs. So, when everything is said and done at home at work, there is another wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. They try to defraud as many people before they must change their name and do it all over again. Then, once they have you on their list, you will receive a ton of sales calls trying to persuade you into buying high-end business coaching that typically costs a few thousand or more. If you are asking yourself \u201cIs Working at Home EDU a scam\u201d I can tell you right now Work at Home EDU is a fraud. It is not even recommended to work at Home EDU or WHU EDU or Home Institute at Work. Soon after dealing with increasingly of these frauds, they will soon start sticking out like a sore thumb. So If This Program Doesn\u2019t Work Which Program Does? So just to clarify after learning from the school of hard knocks, there is nothing that will make you rich with the push of a button but there is a real training that can teach you how. I have a program that can teach you everything if you just try it. Also trying this program is 100% free and there is no automatic forced continuity to make you pay either it\u2019s completely up to you if you want to stay a free member for life or move up. There is no easy one-step or push-button solution to making money online but there are really good programs that train you to have a realistic shot at it more\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Working from home (and making the big bucks) is reasonably simple to achieve. And no, it\u2019s not \u201cfinding your passion,\u201d or \u201cfollowing your strength,\u201d or whatever other popular ambiguous advice exists. Let\u2019s take 15 seconds and visualize a bit because it\u2019s fun to imagine a beautiful future. For some, that might look like sitting in the back of a pickup truck, facing the beach and tapping out your life story on a MacBook while an endless parade of surfers and vacationers pass by.  Cool breeze, wind through your hair, warm rays of sunset. Dat___. Source For others, that might look like staring at a Nikon DSLR in front of a standing desk, discussing your favorite MMORPG while flanked by a green screen in your basement. For others still, that might look like painstakingly hand-carving delicate wood sculptures of professional basketball players, to be later exhibited and sold on your limited-edition only eCommerce site. No matter what you envision for yourself, there is one key element of yourself you must understand to be successful. Get Chosen By Your Work You read that right. I\u2019m saying you don\u2019t choose your work; you let it choose you. It\u2019s very simple. 3 steps and you\u2019re golden. Here\u2019s how. Step 1: Find a type of work where you read the description and think, \u201cHey, maybe I would like that.\u201d Then, don\u2019t overthink about the choice. Just start creating, building, or whatever it takes to do the work and produce something that others might value enough to pay for it.  Sometimes it really is that simple. Source Now I know you might be thinking, \u201chow can I possibly create anything good enough to make money when I\u2019m a complete beginner?\u201d Good question. Keep reading, and you\u2019ll understand. I promise. The key here is to: NOT get stuck in any single part of a jobTRY as much actual work as possibleStep 2: Work Until You Find Your Zone The reason for trying different types of work is to find work that puts you in the zone. Definition of In The Zone:\u201cExpression used to describe a state of consciousness where actual skills match the perceived performance requirements perfectly. Being in the zone implies increased focus and attention which allow for higher levels of performance. \u201d- Kenny August 26, 2004 at Urban Dictionary You want to work and allow your brain to \u201ctell\u201d you what type of work puts you in a highly productive and highly focused state. This zone is actually not hard to find, but different people get in the zone for various tasks, and it really can depend on anything. And you only can be 100% sure after you try. So try, fail, and try again. \u201cI have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\u201d- Thomas A. Edison How do you know when you have found it? Very simple. You know that feeling you get when you suddenly get jarred out of doing something, and you see the clock and think, \u201cWow THAT much time as passed?\u201d Or when you realize you are doing something and missed dinner, and now you will starve because all the stores are closed?  Self-explanatory. Source. STOP. THAT\u2019S THE WORK FOR YOU. And hey, it might take a while to find. Don\u2019t be discouraged. Persist, and you will eventually find your \u201czone work.\u201d And when you do, SUCCESS! I envy you. You\u2019ve just found work that fits you. Step 3: Do it. A lot. You found the work that instinctively puts you in a zone of productivity and focus. So do it, often. The more you do it, the better you\u2019ll get, and naturally, the more money you\u2019ll make. Not enough for you? Rinse and repeat. Find another \u201czone work\u201d that \u201cworks\u201d for you.  But really. It\u2019s great. Source. So go out, Youtube yourself taking 20 puppies for a walk, or write about your favorite strawberry cream cake and post it to Medium. You never know, lightning could strike. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Yes, absolutely! How? Online Freelancing has become a way of life for many. With the accessibility of high-speed internet and online communication platforms like Skype, freelancing has become truly accessible to everyone with a laptop and internet, no matter their age or industry. In fact, according to Forbes, 35% of the U.S. workforce is now made up of freelance workers. These workers collectively earned 1 trillion dollars in 2016 alone. That\u2019s some serious money, all from working from the comfort of home. Freelancing used to be thought of as something only for designers and the ultra tech savvy. However, there are now plenty of ways to earn money freelancing online, you just need to know how, and where to start. The Why: While freelancing, you can make anywhere from a few extra dollars a week to six figures a year. Your earnings are totally dependent on your skill set and the amount of time you are able to devote to projects. However, regardless of your skills, or lack thereof, you are bound to find something you can get paid for. Sometimes clients are only lacking in time, which may be something you have to offer. The How: Now for the trickiest part, how are you going to actually start making money? Well, first you need to identify what skills you have that are currently in demand. A good place to start is with some self-reflection. What skills are involved in your current (or past) position(s)? What are your strengths? Regardless of your skill level, from entry to executive, there are positions available for your skills, I promise. If you\u2019re unsure what skills may be viable to an employer, take a look at Quora and see the top in demand freelance skills. Technical skills are often high on the list, however, the following skills are also highly desirable, and profitable: AccountingConsultingBookkeepingAdministrative TasksAppointment SettingGraphic DesignWeb DevelopmentMobile DevelopmentWritingCustomer ServiceSales and MarketingBefore you get started, keep in mind: If you\u2019ve never completed an online freelance job before, and you\u2019re not an expert in any specific field, you shouldn\u2019t request $100 per hour for your services. Be reasonable, and start small. These sites are competitive, you will need to start slowly and work your way up! Additionally, if you have just created a profile and have never completed a project, clients may be weary of hiring you. You may receive quite a few \u2018no\u2019s before you get your first \u2018yes\u2019. The Where: Fiverr.com: Unsure if you have any skills worth paying for? You\u2019re wrong, and Fiverr wants to prove it. On http://Fiverr.com you will find a wide range of tasks available ranging from online instruction to digital marketing. Fiverr has what are known as \u2018micro jobs\u2019. \u2018Micro jobs\u2019 are small, and inexpensive tasks which don\u2019t require much time to find or complete, and can truly help you get started freelancing. UpWork.com & Guru.com: these sites provide a platform where you can review job listings, apply for positions, and even get paid. Keep in mind a small chunk of your earnings will be paid to these platforms as somewhat of a \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d. Craigslist: Yes, the same Craigslist where you can find apartments, sell your furniture, and buy concert tickets, also has a wealth of opportunity for online freelancers. You have to be selective and be very careful of scams, but if you\u2019re picky, you can find some great opportunities. BelaySolutions.com: Belay used to be only for virtual executive assistants. However, now, they are offering social media assistant jobs, and other types of work may not be far behind. Have some great admin skills? BelaySolutions may be a great place to start. Rates range typically from $20 to $45 per hour for U.S.-based virtual assistants. FlexJobs.com: Over 1.8 million people have found positions via Telecommuting Jobs & Professional Part-Time Jobs which serves as an aggregator for jobs of nearly any level with some sort of remote component. The site promises to offer pre-screened and scam-free listings. They offer a wide range of positions in consulting, tech and administrative support, sales, customer service, tutoring, and accounting. PeoplePerHour.com: This company is based out of the UK and offers only fully remote listings. The positions typically focus on design and website development; however, other creative options are available. There\u2019s plenty of opportunities out there. Be mindful of your current workload and take the time to find the right opportunities for you and your schedule. Remember to be reasonable. You won\u2019t become a millionaire overnight, but there is endless opportunity to earn some real money through online freelancing. If you want to get started small, check out micro jobs. Good luck!

            "answer_text": " A better question to ask yourself is this one: \u201cWhy do I want to work from home?\u201d But I\u2019ll get to that in a minute. I started my career in a dead-end, 9-to-5 cubical job, and then moved to a role where I traveled to London, Paris, France, Madrid, and other places to producing creative content. Here\u2019s the kicker. Both those jobs were in the same company. Promising \u201cbulletproof strategies\u201d with a topic as broad and varied as this seems dangerous, so I\u2019ll just tell you my story, and how it went down. After I got hired, I did my boring work, and then met everyone else in the office to see if I could help them for free.One of the managers I knew previously was swamped. I took on a project she\u2019d wanted to do for years. Then I gave her team all the credit.She created a job for me on her team, and doubled my salary immediately.Even when she was out of the office, I came in to work every day.During this time, I built a skill where I could work at my own pace. For me, that meant a little bit of photography, video, graphic design, online course building, and copy writing are all excellent examples of this.One time, we were particularly busy. I said \u201cHey Boss, I have a lot of demands to meet in the coming days. Does it sound reasonable for me to work from home one day this week?\u201dShe said yes. I intentionally made that day the most productive of my life.I turned in that massive pile of work in before the deadline. I said: \u201cthanks so much for being flexible on how I spend my time. That extra day at home really helped.\u201dThis happened again a few months later. (Please note we are now 3 years into the relationship, and I am still coming into the office every day).We had a one-on-one. I asked if I could work from home without hesitation or apology.I said something like this: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m able to get more done whenever I work from home. There are much fewer distractions. Do you think it would be possible for me to spend 2 days a week there?\u201dShe said yes.Two days turned into 3, which turned into 5+Ultimately, I believe anyone who has a job that fits a remote lifestyle can leverage what they do into a full-time remote position. If the people you work with are half reasonable, you can probably do it without changing companies. Now, for a warning: My full-time remote schedule dismantled me emotionally. I didn\u2019t have a community. I didn\u2019t have boundaries. I didn\u2019t have a set work schedule. These things stressed me out so badly, I decided to jump back into office life when given the chance. Before you make the move, be sure you\u2019re ready to handle it. ",

            "answer_text": "Do work from home jobs work? Yes, but it depends on what kind you do. Do you do the kind that are outsourced like call center work or data entry? Because those you work for someone and they are required to pay you like any other employee. But only if you \u201cshow up\u201d and do the work, otherwise they don't have to pay you. Do you do the kind where YOU are the boss? Like running your own blog, starting a from the ground up business or doing direct sells? Yes they can work, BUT you have no \u201cboss\u201d to hold you accountable and to fire you if you don't \u201cshow up\u201d for work. Because YOU are that boss and you have to understand that even though you are your own boss, you still have to put the time in and you still have to do the work. People think that those kinds of jobs don't work, but those are the same kinds of people who do not have any experience or education or understanding of how that industry works. You have to put the time in. If you say you are going to work your business for 5 hours a week, then you better do it. If you say you are going to work it for 30 hours a week, you better do it. If you don't, then don't be surprised when it doesn't work. My mentors say all the time: \u201cIf you treat your business like a hobby, it will pay you like a hobby. If you treat it like a business, it will pay you like a business.\u201d The other piece to this is: do you have the skills or do you need to learn the skills. People say all the time, \u201cIt's easy! You don't need skills!\u201d But that's a lie. Some people need to develop basic people skills, they may need to learn how to step out of their comfort zone or they may need to develop business skills. This is true whether you are doing direct sells, starting a franchise or starting your own business from the ground up. So do they work? Yes, but only if you are coach-able and train-able and if you actually put the time in. Otherwise no it won't\u2026.but here's a tip, neither will your job, because an employer will fire you if you don't show up and don't make yourself trainable and coachable. ",

            "answer_text": "I used to hate working from home. I mean, I loved it, but I hated it. I loved that I didn\u2019t have anyone sneakily cruising past my desk to look over my shoulder; that my boss couldn\u2019t interrupt me on a whim; that I could take off for a workout any time I wanted. But it only took about a week before I started to hate myself. Working for yourself only works if you are finishing your most important work, and I wasn\u2019t. I was brutally unproductive. I\u2019d spend my first few hours debating with myself in bed, deciding whether I needed more rest. Once upright, I\u2019d theoretically start with exercise, but somehow I always found other things to do. (I learned how to make yogurt! I cleaned the dishes! I wrote a six-paragraph email to a friend! Hurray!) When I finally did get my ass on the couch, computer in lap, it was usually around noon. That was just just perfect because I was living in Mumbai without air conditioning. It was like trying to work in a sauna\u2014one with windows open to the 95-degree air and horns honking right outside. I watched my savings slowly drain away. I\u2019ll skip ahead. Back in the U.S., I went through a Starbucks phase. That didn\u2019t work. I felt obligated to chat with the baristas, all of whom I came to know. Half the time there\u2019d be a patron chatting so loudly I\u2019d forget what I was working on, close my eyes, and just burn inside. I tried every tool, technique and trick. For example, I probably re-did my todo-list system every six months for 5 years. But when it came down to it, I always, always felt like I was fighting myself. It was an awful way to feel every single damn day. Today I absolutely love working from home, and my whole team works from home too. I get more sleep and more exercise than ever before. When I work, I focus. But, I want you to know that I\u2019ve been to the darkest depths of the pit when I tell you what has made the biggest difference for me. Start your day with a morning routine. You can win or lose each day in the way you start. When you accomplish a series of tasks on purpose you build momentum and confidence to continue your day in an intentional manner. It doesn\u2019t matter so much what you do as long as you can reliably repeat it so that you feel empowered when you finish.Add structure and accountability with an accountability partner. Meeting a friend for a video chat at 9a can be a motivating impetus to finish your routine and get ready to work. The secret is that you don\u2019t chat with your partner; you set an intention and then you quietly work together. (Check out Focusmate, a free tool and community that provides an accountability partner any time for a 50-minute working session over video.)Block off and rigorously guard your work time. Just because you decide when you work doesn\u2019t mean you should be lax about it. Decide when your work hours are and maintain strict rules about the exceptions. (My only exception is health-related, e.g. doctor appointments.) You can further break down your work hours into different categories also. For example I only take calls and meetings after 3pm. Finally, dispense with any sense of guilt about telling people \u201cno\u201d when they ask for things that violate your boundaries.Create your ideal work environment. Ironically many people have a home office environment worse than a corporate office. Why?! It should be the opposite. You have 100% control over this space, so make it great. That means lighting, seating, desk, aesthetics, noise control, space\u2014you name it.Move your body. You can\u2019t focus if your body is weak, achy or restless. When you work from home, you can exercise whenever is best for you. Personally I move 2\u20133 times a day, doing physical therapy in the morning, taking a walk at noon and hitting the gym after work.Keep healthy food and snacks (only) in the house. What you eat dictates your energy and mood. Make your life easy by maintaining a supply of accessible healthy options, and don\u2019t give yourself the option (or temptation) of junk food.Punctuate the end of the day (e.g. go to the gym). You might be tempted to believe that working extra is awesome. (In the U.S. this is a strong societal norm.) But you know what\u2019s really awesome? Consistency and routine. Make sure you end your day on time so that you can do it all again the next day\u2026 and the next\u2026 and the next.Plan every day. Most people underestimate how much planning is necessary. After all, when you\u2019re planning, you\u2019re not getting stuff done, right? (Wrong.) Planning is critical because it ensures you\u2019re spending your precious time on the work that matters most. Personally I find that setting goals once a quarter, month, week and day is about the right cadence.P.S. You probably noticed\u2026 All of these suggestions are systems. You could also call them routines, or rituals. The point is that when you make an action habitual, it requires less cognitive effort. You want to save your real brainpower for doing the work itself. If you only take away one idea, it\u2019s this: find systems that work for you, whatever they are, so that your mental capacity can be spent doing the work that matters most to you. ",

The best option for you depends on your own skills/experience and what you actually want to do (i.e. what you\u2019re passionate about). The focus shouldn\u2019t be just about having a \u201cwork from home\u201d job, it should be about having a job that you enjoy doing. You have two main avenues for remote work; Set up your own business/freelanceFind full-time employmentTo help you get started, here are a few areas that you might be interested/qualified in. 1. Marketing Marketing is an area that is extremely popular amongst remote workers and there are a number of areas you can choose to specialize in depending on which best suits your expertise. 2. Content Writing Content writing tends to pay better when you combine it with content marketing, and the two often fall under the same umbrella as a result. It just makes more sense. But if marketing isn\u2019t your thing, there are writing only gigs out there that don\u2019t actually pay peanuts (honest!) as long as you have some experience under your belt. 3. Web Development And Design Are you a web design pro? If so, you\u2019re in luck. Web design is definitely one of the more popular areas in remote work. 4. Sales and Customer Support If you have experience working in B2B and/or B2C customer service and sales, there are a number of positions available to you on a remote-work basis! You can work solely in customer care and go for roles such as \u2018Customer Happiness Officer\u2019(i.e. customer care agent), or you can work in sales and go for \u2018Business Development Ninja\u2019 roles, or you can combine the two because they tend to overlap anyway. As for the whacky job titles\u200a\u2014\u200aconsider it a forewarning\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019re going to see a lot of those. 5. Finance If work in the finance area, you\u2019ve probably had a hard time finding a remote based position\u200a\u2014\u200athere just aren\u2019t as many available as in other work avenues. However, there are some openings to be found once you look hard enough! Buffer had a Head of Finance opening last year and they\u2019re pretty much top of the food chain when it comes to remote work. So there you go\u200a, hopefully there\u2019s a position in there that\u2019s right for you! Also, don\u2019t forget to keep checking in on job sites such as RemoteOk, We Work Remotely, and Working Nomads, because you never know what might pop up. If you do strike lucky, check out this post I wrote for some tips on acing your first Skype interview! ",

            "answer_text": "I found my position by luck. It was a new company starting out. The CEO posted the work on a site and I completed some of it. I than wrote him an email stating that I would be interested in this type of position if possible. I left it like this. He came back and said he would need someone to do this job and asked if I was interested in it? I jumped on it and said yes. We started off using spreadsheets, until he got his database built and up and running. Once it was up and running we tweaked with it for the 1st 6\u20138 months. I was trouble shooting, entering data. I got distracted with health issues between myself and my dad. I couldn\u2019t keep up. I had to give up the counties I was in. Which was fine with me. I had to prove myself to my boss again. I am now gaining new counties. I have a set schedule that works for me. The information that is entered into the courts, has a 24\u201372 hour\u2019s to get into his system. So I learned what times 8 different court houses enter their information into the systems. I know I have one county that does it between 12:00 am-4 am Weekdays. So this is what I do. I save 7 counties for the following day, I start my day off at about 4:00 Am and I am usually done no later than 6:30 am for 7 counties. I start with the county that is going to add the most cases 1st. Than I just move down my list, as some counties are in the same state. So I do those next. Than my last casefor the morning is going to be the lone county that is in a different state. I block out 2\u20133 hours in the morning for myself to work daily. I do it while everyone is asleep. I am fresh and ready to go. After I finish I go take a quick nap to make sure I am ready to go for the rest of the day. Schedules are important to stay on track. ",

I tend to think a lot of people \u201cwork from home\u201d actually work from a coffeeshop or some other similar set up. There is also the option of co-working spaces. You can find co-working spaces often for $100 to $300 per month. Look at co-working spaces in your area by Googling it. The movement is global. You also have the option to spend $15 or $20 for a day. Co-working offers a number of advantage over pure working from home. The nice part about the co-working space movement is that it help provides a community. I believe it emerged around 2005 or so, as more people were going entrepreneurial and more people were working from home. The other option is meeting for coffee and/or meeting for lunch for more human connection. I suppose if you have Skype, Zoom, Facetime, or another video conferencing tool, you have alot of options. Presumably the people that will be most susseptible to chatting like this are good friends and/or people who also work from home. ",

            "answer_text": "To work effectively from home you need to use your time as productive as it possible. It means you need to allocate a particular amount of time to every separate task. Do not multitask! It will kill your productivity. Also, very important is to make an inspiring atmosphere that would encourage you to work and create. That\u2019s why the coworking spaces are better than home office. Coworking has less distraction, though you need to interact with a lot of people. Because everyone there is into work, you do so as well. But, anyway, if you decided to work from home and want to be more effective then, I think, you need to consider the main principle of Time Blocking technique. And it says that in order to complete the task faster you need to set aside the exact amount of time for that exact task. And no minute more. Because you have time frames and some kind of pressure your brain starts work faster and you become more effective. + No distractions. Since you set aside the particular amount of time during which it is possible to finish your thing, you SHOULD pay attention only to your task and nothing else. If you want to know more about Time Blocking technique and how to set up the time blocking plan and then your schedule, check out the blog by Kelley Oreglia from Ann Kelley \u2014 Time Blocking for Productivity. Hope it helps. ",

Remote working is: Talking to people onlineDoing the workSending an invoiceIf you\u2019ve got a cool boss, you tell your boss, \u201cI\u2019m going to live and work from Greece call me if you need anything.\u201d If you don\u2019t have a cool boss you need to quit that job and start freelancing. Now the question you should be asking is how do I sell myself as a service and convince people to pay me for my output? The answer is that you: find a thing that people need done, and you do it for money. Advertise that you do the thing, to the people who need the thing done. There are platforms like Upwork and surprisingly there's actually a lot of remote jobs on Facebook. Normal job portals like seek and indeed have remote jobs. Apply to job portals in as many countries as possible. Look on Linkedin, buff out your Linkedin profile if you haven\u2019t already. When That Shit Fails Cold Call People For Work Build your portfolio. It is your proof. You\u2019ll need it to pitch your services. If you don\u2019t have a portfolio offer to work for free or at a reduced rate. Just do it really good for like $1 an hour or whatever get some shit published, and then use it to pitch your services later. Don\u2019t get stuck in this phase. 3 portfolio items are plenty. You can also find businesses with a sucky websites or a shit blog, a company that obviously has money, and just make something better and give it to them for free. You find a graphic that\u2019s really ugly and then go away and design a nice one. Then you give it to the business, and they go, \u201cWow this is a massive improvement.\u201d And you say, \u201cI know, I\u2019ll make your site look like this for $$$$$.\u201d And they go, okay. I\u2019ve created a group to help people work online and to share funny memes of people failing to work online. Check it out here ",

            "answer_text": "There are many businesses you can run from home. But given all the available information you should only consider a business which has all of the following characteristics: 1. Unlimited income potential You can grow this business as big as you want \u2013 for example, from \u00a390,000 in a first year to \u00a3400,000 within a couple of years to millions later. It is not too demanding and complicated. 2. It can bring you money within a short time, for example within two weeks You need a business which allows you to get some customers right away, get some cash flowing and grow from there. A service is generally a lot less expensive to launch than a product, especially if it is something you already know how to do or can learn quickly. Gardening, cleaning and selling comes to mind as well as cutting hair, walking dogs, chatting with old people, growing vegetables or painting houses. 3. You can start on a shoestring budget, no massive overheads There are many businesses run from home you can start for well under \u00a3200, for example a domestic cleaning agency. 4. No experience required You can learn from other people\u2019s mistakes by reading books and manuals available out there. 5. You can be your own boss It\u2019s absolutely my favourite reason for starting my own business. Nothing quite compares to the pride and excitement of calling the shots and being in charge of your own destiny. 6. You can set your own hours It is great to take days off when you want and as often as you can get away with. You can work part time or full time or start part time and when you make enough money to quit your job. You find that you work smarter instead of harder because you are able to tap into your natural sense of responsibility. 7. You can choose who you work with If you discover you don\u2019t exactly click with a client, you can replace them quickly. You can run your business by yourself or with a partner or delegate some duties to a helper. ",

Working from home can seem like a daunting task. There are many things at home that can distract you from the work at hand. However, there are many ways to effectively work from the comfort of your own home.   1. Eat a hearty breakfast. You're not hurried to get to the office on time, relax and eat well. 2. Create a list of objectives you want to accomplish. Like I said earlier, it's easy to get distracted so planning your day is essential. 3. Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can close a door. Creating a sense of being in an office can help productivity at home so you don't have the sudden urge to clean the kitchen. 4. Set \"working hours\", ex. 9:00-12:00 then 13:00-18:00. Giving yourself a time to work will help you stay focused.  These 4 tips can help you become more productive when working from home. ",

After identifying your ares of interests (probably the list will have 4\u20135 interests) then start looking out for the opportunities in you areas of interest who can offer work from home. You can find online work or you can get a work from home option from some companies/people and they will pay you on assignment basis. Usually thorough some customized and in-depth google searches will give you better results. You can identify the small companies in your areas of interest and reach out to them directly, they can definitely give you some work. In most of the small companies major work force would be either interns or part time freelancers. This worked for me several times. Hope this information finds helpful. Happy earning at home.

            "answer_text": "My personal solution for working at home effectively is to make sure that I don\u2019t get vital work done in my bedroom. I always make sure I do the stuff that needs to be done, but never in there. My bedroom is a place to relax, to be comfortable and most importantly: to sleep. For me, it doesn\u2019t work if that room is \u2018filled\u2019 with all the things I have been stressing about. There is a desk in my bedroom, but any time I spend there is spent writing or drawing; stuff that is relaxing to me. Another thing I do is be disciplined and turn my phone off. No incoming messages, emails, DMs or other notifications to distract me. I do make sure that I am available if people genuinely need me, so I tell them to call me on the house line if they really need me. Lastly, one of the things I have found to be really important is staying hydrated and full. I have a tendency to get so caught up in my work that I don\u2019t eat or drink anything for hours on end, but that eventually starts working the wrong way around: I get distracted easily, as a result I don\u2019t get as much work done as I\u2019d want to and then I end up in a really bad mood. Therefore I use a little alarm clock (obviously not the one on my phone, but an old-fashioned actual clock-thingy) and set it for about an hour ahead, so I can make sure that I eat and drink enough. In the end, working at home is of course a very personal experience and thus there is a probability that my methods of working effectively and efficiently don\u2019t work as well for someone else. However, any tips and tricks might help ;) ",

            "answer_text": "Starting a job from home is quite easy if you follow the right steps. There are many business models that you can try and get regular income from an online business. A usual start is by selling your own services or products: Writing services: If you have a way with words, then you can start by offering freelance writing services to website and blog owners. It is a simple business as your offering is very clear: content. You can use Upwork, Fiverr, or similar freelance websites to find clients.Graphic Designs: Similar to freelance writing, you can start making money online by creating images using your editing skills. Depending on your experience, you can charge $2 and upwards. Again, Fiverr and Upwork are great platforms to connect with clients for such services.Digital or Physical Products: If you have any kind of product, you can sell it online. If it is digital, you can have your own blog or use JVZoo & Clickbank to publish them. If it is physical, again your own blog is an option. You can use eBay, Amazon and others.If you have nothing to sell, then you can promote what others are selling. Dropshipping: You can find wholesellers and be the middleman between them and the clients. You sale the product as your own without having to actual own the inventory nor take care of the shipment yourself. All you have to do is get the wholesaler the details and let them ship the merchandise. You pay the wholesaler the price agreed upon and the rest is yours. (For example, you can sell a product for $15 while the wholesaler is only asking for $10. That\u2019s $5 profit from one sale.)Affiliate marketing: Possibly the best business model online, Affiliate marketing is when you promote a promote or service in exchange for a commission. Depending on your niche, the product, and the agreement with the seller, you can get up to %35 commission.I hope this was helpful. ",

When you work from home, nobody is going to look over your shoulder reminding you to complete your tasks. You need to have the discipline to do the work, whether you feel like it or not. Next, you need to have the initiative and the creativity to solve problems on your own. One of the things you automatically lose when you work from home is office mates. The great thing about having co-workers is that you can ask them for help if you run into any problems. When you work from home, you\u2019re on your own. This means you have to not only solve problems yourself but also find ways to solve these problems on your own. Last but not the least, you need persistence. Working from home is still a grind but it kind of feels harder when you\u2019re doing it on your own. But you have to power through it. As a professional, it\u2019s your responsibility to power through, no matter how tired, bored and demotivated you can be sometimes. ",

Affiliate marketing is essentially referral marketing with a commission. When you refer a new customer to a business that has an affiliate program, you get paid. For example, if you're an Amazon affiliate and you recommend a book, and people buy that book through your affiliate link, Amazon will pay you a percentage of the sale. How Affiliate Marketers Are Paid The frequency and method of payment vary as well. Most programs pay their affiliates monthly, although a few pay more frequently. Some require that affiliate earnings reach a specific threshold, which can be as low as $25 or as high as $100. Some programs don't have a threshold. There are programs that pay through direct deposit into your bank, but a vast number pay through PayPal. Pros of an Affiliate Marketing Business: Low start-up costs: Most affiliate programs are free to join. Since the affiliate company takes care of providing the service or product, there is no inventory or supplies for you to worry about.No product creation or service providing.

            "answer_text": "You can make even more than a full time income if you are willing to work consistently and persistently in a business of your own. The business is a special type called online affiliate marketing. It has a number of distinct advantages over most other forms of income generation. It is business with no overhead, no employees, no warehouse, and no store front. It can be operated anywhere you have Internet service and a computer or smart phone. The start up and training are absolutely free. It is a business beyond borders, so potentially you can have team members from from virtually any corner of the planet. Even better than a job, it allows you to develop multiple sources of income that compound monthly, eventually building up to far more money the you ever will earn on an hourly basis. What you would be doing is building up a team of people who agree to cooperate together to move products and services for mutual benefit. The leading proponent of this type business is a company called SFI. If you are interested, join my SFI team at www.joinmysfiteam.com/14566239. I will personally work with you to ensure your success in this business. ",

It provides links to jobs boards that feature full-time remote jobs and job boards that feature both remote and in-office jobs. (Sometimes using bigger job boards like LinkedIn that feature both is a good way to quickly find and apply to remote jobs.) After this it shows you how to craft your resume and cover letter in a way that hiring managers at remote companies are most likely to respond to. It also shows you how to use Angel List, a job board for startups that features remote jobs, and what to do to prepare for remote job interviews. ",

But the reality is that no company is going to pay someone to sit at home, unsupervised. So they offer \u201cpiecework\u201d, at a rate so low that it\u2019s not worth the effort. Consider, for example, the Quora \u201cpartnership program\u201d, where they pay people to write questions. Quora fills its site with nonsense questions posted by people who could not care less what the answer is. In return, the people posting these question hope to make their fortune. They give examples of people making hundreds of dollars on a question. But those are very, very rare. From Quora: \u201cThe top 10 earning partners [last month] earned an average of $9,189 and asked 11,256 questions each, averaging 61 questions per day.\u201d That\u2019s 81 cents per question for the top 10 earning partners. You can just imagine what the average \u201cpartner\u201d might get. If you have enough skill and expertise, and you demonstrate that you can be productive at home, most companies will no long require your presence in the office. In my last few years working, I only went to the office to attend meetings and to pick up awards. But just seeking a \u201cwork at home\u201d job is unlikely to get you anything at all. ",

Be prepared to work at it and most importantly\u2026 you will fail over and over again. Nothing personal, you don\u2019t have any experience how can it work the first time? Does it happen for some people? Yes. But Not For You. You will have to work and learn. People that have overnight success usually don\u2019t know what they did right or just got a little lucky. Can they repeat the process over and over? Find something you like and dive in. Learn all there is to know about it, Become the authority in that niche and dominate that industry. You Need Training?

            "answer_text": "2 TIP Maintain Regular Hours Set a schedule, and stick to it...most of the time. Having clear guidelines for when to work and when to call it a day helps many remote workers maintain work-life balance. That said, one of the benefits of remote work is flexibility, and sometimes you need to extend your day or start early to accommodate someone else's time zone. When you do, be sure to wrap up earlier than usual or sleep in a bit the next morning to make up for it. Automatic time-tracking apps, such as RescueTime, let you check in on whether you're sticking to your schedule. They can also help you figure out what times of day you're most productive versus when you slack off. You can use that information to your advantage by reserving your hours of high focus for your most important tasks Create a Morning Routine Deciding you'll sit down at your desk and start work at a certain time is one thing. Creating a routine that guides you into the chair is another. What in your morning routine indicates you're about to start work? It might be making a cup of coffee. It might be returning home after a jog. It might be getting dressed (wearing pajama pants to work is a perk for some, but a bad strategy for others). A routine can be more powerful than a clock at helping you get started each day. ",

If the latter, the biggest thing is setting up a dedicated space and committing your time to work. It\u2019s way to ease to be distracted. If you mean the former, the first thing is how will you market your skills? Put together a concise plan for marketing yourself and make sure that it is directed to those who are your most likely customers. As an author, I dedicate at least an hour a day to being on the social media trying to get my name out, but for a novelist, the entire world is ones market. If, however, I were looking to ghost write, I would probably spend that hour just on political websites where I might find people who needed a writer. However, once you have established yourself, again, the most important thing is making your space and time dedicated. ",

Ideally, one would have a home office or a study or something like that to avoid this issue entirely, but I cannot afford to live somewhere that would provide such luxury. Instead, I take the living room. I will also try to keep away from the kitchen. If I go there, I\u2019ll only end up cooking something I\u2019m probably not hungry enough to eat. I give myself 30 minutes to an hour for lunch, and try to spend this time outside, if possible. That way, I won\u2019t be tempted to stick the TV on, and inevitably leave it on, get distracted and waste the second half of my working day. Keep notebooks nearby, if you can. Fill up your calendar on both your email client and your physical one, if you have one. Do it for your phone too, if you like. The latter would be especially helpful if you were planning on heading out somewhere, only to have your phone tell you that you have a conference call in an hour, for example. Just a few little things to make working from home, for me at least, more efficient. ",

I was a freelance developer for a few different startups and online clients. All I needed to do was take phone calls and write code, you can do that anywhere. However - Work is work is work. If you work at home you need discipline and good time management skills or you end up stealing from yourself. You still have to produce value. You still have to deal with people. Take a look above, or below at some of the pyramid schemes others are running. These are for fools who want to drink cool aid, tell everyone how fantastic their flexible income and lifestyle is and take home approximately 0.002 cents an hour. Don't waste your time on this BS. If you want to work from home, find a flexible employer, or have a compelling offering to serve others independently from an employer. It's the only viable way to do it. Do not expect to watch a 5 minute DVD and then have the cash roll in. As for affiliate marketing, yes opportunities do exist within this space but most of the deals that that fall in your lap will see you take home a big slice of nothing relative to the effort you put in. Those running such campaigns are smart, because they capitalise on idealistic idiots and have them do all the heavy lifting. ",

You can definitely find a bunch on Job Search | Indeed or other job sites. I found one in February 2017. It didn\u2019t offer a lot in income but it offered more than enough. It help me build funds for myself and because it was part-time, it allowed me to put more time in my other passions and slowly build other income streams. This leads me to my second option: Build an online service. There are several you can look at: -Online course -Amazon -Being a Coach (your preferred practice, life, health, finance, fitness, business, etc) -Sell your own books -YouTube -Blogging And those are just the few that first comes to mind. So if you\u2019re not entrepreneurial but want more freedom, a work from home job would be the best option for you. If you do have an entrepreneurial mind, you\u2019ll prefer option 2. Just keep in mind you will need to plan and set goals for it since it would be your own project. And if you like both, then explore both and you can build up your income while having one steady paycheck to cover your monthly expenses. The big factor that also helped with both options was saving funds on the side which helped if your income went low or got delayed. ",

The next key element involves your finances. If you are starting your home business as a side gig, then you have more flexibility because you have income from your full-time job. If not, then be sure that you have at least 6 months of living expenses set aside before you begin your business. Next, you need a budget for your business. What will you be making, selling, or providing? What do you need in terms of materials, equipment, supplies, etc. Be sure to include everything. To break even, you need to have at least enough income to cover the expenses. Do some research\u2026who else is selling your product or marketing the service you intend to offer?

I\u2019ve lived in apartments my whole life and have a dog that is trained not to do he\u2019s business inside. I used to live in a good apartment in Buenos Aires and I tried to work from home MANY times and it was always impossible. The dog constantly asked me to take him for a walk, I always found something to fix or to improve or organize and my productivity really suffered. I also realized later on that what I used to work on wasn\u2019t really what I loved and that altogether made it so hard to focus on work\u2026 So, I moved to a different country and now live in a bigger apartment which makes it much easier to work at. I took over a small corner of the place and turned it into an office. My kid has grown Up although I have a new baby which asks me for more attention but I don\u2019t really know why It\u2019s easier to distract her. I also switched to my professional area to video game design and that really made a difference. It\u2019s easier to focus on something you love than to force yourself to focus on something that might not be so interesting for you. I remember my dad working from home most of his days, even though he has a beautiful office. And I once asked him how he do it. He said that for him it\u2019s not a matter of where as much a matter of what he is doing\u2026 He even preferred to be at home working and not wasting time traveling from a place to another. ",

Personally I have been working form home for 6+ years, and have found that in business/IT there are a myriad of openings available, but I will warn you that sometimes the criteria can be a bit higher because the employer has to be confident that you will be a good fit, be able to be self motivated, and most importantly be VERY communicative! Good luck! ",

While blogging is not the only way to make money online, it is the easiest and cheapest to start up. Another way to make money online is affiliate marketing. This is done by bringing potential buyers and the products they are seeking together. You can place their ads on your site and start generating online income. However, in affiliate marketing, you do not get paid per click in most cases, but rather you are paid every time someone goes to their site and makes a purchase.

However it's still important for your manager to have confidence that despite not being in office you are able to deliver on work commitments. On the contrary if your organisation doesn't have WFH option; then no harm putting up a proposal to HR. I have seen many such employees who haven't left a job in many years despite not getting increments because of other fringe benefits like work from home.. In case you are not in job currently ; there are many professions that you can pursue from home like a recruitment consultant, educational trainer etc etc.. ",

It saved me quite a lot of time and money to not have to drive 70 miles each way to the client site on a daily basis (I only went to the client once to pick up my work laptop and a second time to return it). The downside was that the particular project required me to work 12 hours a day during the week and typically another 8 hours on either Saturday or Sunday. My job was as a business analyst and software tester, so it\u2019s certainly more realistic than for some jobs but it\u2019s probably easier for others to find work from home positions. ",
