You\u2019ve asked a grand total of 5 questions, haven\u2019t filled out much profile information, haven\u2019t answered any questions, haven\u2019t shared anything, posted anything, haven;t really done anything on Quora. Why would you think people aren\u2019t taking you seriously? You don\u2019t seem to be taking Quora seriously, why should they? You\u2019re right, I think you are a joke, prove me wrong by adding some quality content for me to read. ",

            "answer_text": "Why are some people not taking my questions seriously on Quora? Your question \u2014 as modified \u2014 is a reasonable question, though the original question I saw was not. Why do some people pass over questions that are grammatically incorrect or otherwise incomplete? Because these are the responsibility of the one asking the question. Many questions that are grammatically incorrect are hard to interpret. It is not the responsibility of the responder to translate the question! For any question I answer I first decide (1) if I understand the question and (2) if I can offer a useful answer. Unfortunately, that means I decline answering many questions. I still have no trouble finding questions to answer, including virtually all questions specifically asked of me. ",
