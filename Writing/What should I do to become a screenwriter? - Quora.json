            "answer_text": "There are many questions like that on Quora that have been answered by myself and others.  I strongly suggest you explore the site, and specifically, the screenwriting topic.   I'll offer some quick thoughts here though.   First off, it's not that easy.  Too many people think it's about writing a script, emailing it to an agent, having someone like it, and then having that someone sell it for them for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars.  That's myth, not fact.   Even when you read the anomalies about some writer selling their first spec script to a studio for mid to high six figures (And this really is an anomaly), what people don't realize is that the writer has likely languished in the screenwriting trade for years, writing under assignments for low compensation or WGA scale, or even more likely, they've maybe had an option or two for little to no money.  And they've done this for years.  Struggled for years.   So my advice to all is to wipe that pre-conceived notion out of your mind right now.  I wish someone would have told me that back when I started out, so I'm doing this for you as a favor because I really do care.   Get that thought out of your mind.  It's okay to have the dream.  We all have it.  But you have to pull yourself down from the clouds and face reality.   It's hard.  It's a grind.  Your chances increase ten fold if you live and work in Los Angeles.  If you embed yourself within the industry, working as an assistant, working in the mail room, working in the studio commissary, etc.  Make contacts and network.   I started in security at Sony.  Not because I wanted to wear a uniform and sit at a gate for eight hours, but because that was the only way I could get behind those studio walls.  I worked my way into an office position and then into development as a studio reader.  Reading hundreds of scripts gave me the true education I needed by learning the general guidelines and expectations of the film industry.  I networked.  I made friends in high places or kept in contact with friends that rose higher than me.   That's what it really takes.  Your odds of success increase ten fold.   Secondly, do you have more than one script?  Because if you don't, don't even bother trying to market it.  Let's say, by some miracle, that you've had beginner's luck and written a hot script.  The first thing the powers that be will ask is, \"What else do you have?\"   It happened to me.  I had written three scripts before my marquee one that garnered me representation from a Paramount Pictures referral.  Those three scripts were horrible.  Your first ones are ALWAYS the worst.   But Doomsday Order was my first hot script.  I had a connected manager.  He got me meetings with almost every studio after my script went out wide.  They loved the writing.  But with each meeting, the conversation went to, \"What else do you have?\"   I had nothing.  It wasn't until a year later that I had my sophomore efforts that garnered me my Lionsgate deal, and that was a stroke of luck as well.   So one script is nothing.  Your first script is ALWAYS your worst so why would you burn all bridges with that?  You need to stack your deck.  You need to have three or more excellent spec scripts with great concepts, great characters, and great execution of them both in the writing.  Don't even knock on a door, pick up a phone, or send an email until you do.   And know that this is coming from my heart.  Time is constant.  If you really want this, hunker down and hone your craft by writing more scripts.  Give yourself a goal.  A deadline.  \"I'm going to have three hot spec scripts written within the next year.\"  And do it.  Learn.  Study movies.  Study produced screenplays.  Write.  Fail.  Write again.  Learn from your mistakes.   Then, and only then, when you have at least three high concept spec scripts, should you explore options for taking it out to people.   Thirdly, test the waters.  Enter the script into the Nicholl Fellowship competition, Scriptapalooza, and the TrackingB competiton.  See if anyone bites.  See if you make it to the quarterfinals.  If not, ask yourself if there is a reason why?  It's true that you can't depend on competitions, but it's a place to start.  Enter them and keep moving forward.  Don't sit and wait for results each and every year.  This is something that you can do with your first or second script, as you're writing your third.   Lastly, take it out to people.   You need a logline for your script.  A good one that captures the core of your concept, story, etc.   Sign up for IMDBPro.  This site is an amazing research tool.  Look up similar movies to your concepts.  Similar in tone, atmosphere, genre, etc.  Look up who produced them.  Look up who wrote them and who represents those writers.   Then, if their email addresses are available, write them a short, sweet, and to the point email.   Ken Miyamoto's answer to What's the process like for getting an agent as a screenwriter or TV writer? Whom do you contact? What will they expect from you? What determines whether you land an agent at a major firm vs. an independent agent? Ken Miyamoto's answer to What is the best way to sell a screenplay to Hollywood? Never send a script unsolicited.  If they don't ask for it, they don't want it.  They are too busy.   So if they're aren't interested after reading your email, they will NOT read an attached script.   Search Quora for more questions and answers.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience here.  Best of luck. ",
