            "answer_text": "Normally, you don't need to know a programming language or the other before you become an accomplished chemical engineer. This is because each operation in chemical engineering , talk of numerical analysis, process designs , process dynamics and control etc all have specialised/dedicated softwares ( hysys, MATLAB, SIMULINK, MATHcad, ansys, Excel, RSM) for handling them. The mastery of these softwares requires no coding in most cases , well except MATLAB and a few others. So if u are thinking of a career in any other area of research in chemical engineering but PSE, you may not necessarily need to code. However, if you are going to major in process system engineering (PSE) where the sophistication of MATLAB is required, knowledge of programming will help you find your way around most modelling problems easily. On a final note, based on popular demand and for completeness, a chemical engineer should master a programming language. The knowledge will always come in handy, trust me. Moreover, you can never tell the stress a simple line of code will save you. ",
