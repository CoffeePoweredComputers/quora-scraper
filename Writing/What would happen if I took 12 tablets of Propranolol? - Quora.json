            "answer_text": "Lucky for you, some very caring and knowledgeable strangers on Quora have already taken the time to answer your rather unusual and scary question. I hope that if you were considering taking the 12 Inderal or propranolol before you asked, you are now reconsidering it. I have taken this medicine myself for control of blood pressure, migraine and hand tremor. My dose was one 40mg tablet at a time, not 12 of them, and even that low amount was pretty sedating. No way would I have been upright and functioning on 12 of them. Taking 12 tablets of anything at once is likely to be an \u201coverdose\u201d just by definition; doctors don't usually prescribe a dose of 12 of anything at once. If they did, the drug companies would dispense it in one monster high-dose pill that probably wouldn't even be safe to have around the house. What people do not realize when they consider overdosing is that it may not \u201cwork.\u201d Instead of letting you peacefully float away from all your troubles as you might be imagining, it may leave you in a terrible condition. It will not get you high. But you could end up paralyzed, brain damaged, on lifetime dialysis for kidney failure, on a ventilator with a breathing tube from inhaling your own vomit, with a damaged heart and liver, needing a catheter and a bedpan, unable to talk, dependent on nurses for everything, confined to a bed in a nursing home, maybe with bedsores, unable to think or do anything for yourself, leaving a devastated family and abandoned pets behind to care for themselves, and ironically, maybe taking a whole cabinet\u2019s worth of expensive medications every day that you were not taking before you had this \u201cgreat\u201d misguided idea. It's not a matter of floating blissfully away. If intentionally taking an overdosie to end your life is something that you have been thinking about, something is wrong with your present thought processes. It is not you being weak or stupid or evil. It is you being tired and hopeless and desperate. It is a medical problem that needs to be addressed. People don't normally want to die\u2014it goes against our species' instincts. Ironically, many medications that are meant to help you can paradoxically lead to suicidal thoughts. Propranolol could very well be one of them. Why do you have those 12 you are asking about in the first place? I know that they can cause depression, for one. Please do not attempt an overdose. Please do not do anything impulsive. Please flush the 12 propranolol down the toilet and get then out of your way. Then immediately contact a doctor or other health professional or someone that you know and trust. The doctor who gave you the propranolol would certainly want to be informed. If you feel that you have no such person in your life right now, look in the phone book for something like a suicide and crisis hotline, call 911, or just walk in to the emergency room of any hospital, where you can talk to trained people and start the process of getting a handle on whatever is bringing you so down. If you are suicidal, they have to take you, with or without health insurance or money. Be honest and let them do what they are trained to do. If you are having such thoughts, your life is in danger, and you need to be protected. They say it's not over till it's over. Well then, it's not over yet. Believe me. Things can get so much better with some time, introspection and objectivity. Sounds like bullshit now I know. But you just have to be here to experience it. Flush the pills, get some help, do some serious self- examination, and give yourself a chance to enjoy life again. Please. ",
