The institute in which you actually studied gives money in lakhs as they will be so popular and all new sheep and goats will line up for the rat race at their institute. The thing is there are thousands of coaching centers in India. The most prestigious coaching institutes like Aakash ,Allen ,resonance, etc give you money maybe around 80 lakhs to 1 crore just to publish your name and roll no. And other credentials in their colours even though you had distance learning or even had no connections whatsoever with their institute. AIR 1 in India dont worry you're a crorepati( millionaire). ",
