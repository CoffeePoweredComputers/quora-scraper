            "answer_text": "The mainstream ones like the Famous Five series will always be her best known works, but there are so many others worth reading and rereading, even today. You'll be interested to know that she created Noddy and Toyland - a fact that wasn't highlighted enough when the TV series came out. Some of my favourite books by her are - Mr. Galliano's Circus - about a boy whose family joins a circus, and the adventures they have on the road.The Adventure series - each book explores a different terrain or setting. A river, a sea, a valley, a ship, a mountain, a castle, an island, and a circus.The Barney Mysteries - featuring Barney who is supposedly an orphan, and his pet monkey Miranda, as they make friends for life and eventually help him find his roots.Mr. Twiddle, Mr. Meddle, and Mr. Pink Whistle - books about the mundane and the magical in equal measure, I read these when I was about five and it started my fascination with goblins and pixies and elves, much before Harry Potter did.The Five Findouters (and Dog) - about five friends who work against the local cop, Mr. Goon, and manage to outwit him every single time. Full of thrilling escapes and disguises, thieves who can give a six year old the shivers and lovely picnic lunches in the traditional Blyton style, these books remain, to this day, in my favourites.",

            "answer_text": "Though her most famous series are the Famous Five and the Secret Seven, my favourite Blyton series is the Five Find-Outers and Dog . In these books,she is at her humorous best-especially the disguise episodes starring Fatty and the dumb village policeman,Mr.Goon.Special mention for The Mystery of the Hidden House and the the few later books which include Ern, Mr.Goon's 'pome writer ' nephew. I also like The St.Clare's books.Provides very entertaining accounts of life at boarding schools. ",
