            "answer_text": "Well it never sucked, let\u2019s get that out of the way. The reason it seems bad is that it\u2019s first arc is the worst in the series. The Hunter Exam and Zoldyck Family arcs are probably 7/10 or 6/10s. That\u2019s above average. It seems bad because every other arc is so freakin\u2019 good. Hunter Exam- 7/10- Had some really interesting moments. It had some great moments, like Killua taking out the heart of the mass murder in the tower and Gon and Killua trying to take the ball from Netero; However, the pacing was bad, and in the anime it didn\u2019t give a great explanation of why Gon wanted to be a hunter.  Zoldyck Family- 6/10- My least favorite arc. It had some cool moments, and it really expanded on Killua, but it really didn\u2019t mean to much. There weren\u2019t any super memorable moments either. Even so, it was an above average arc.  Heaven's arena- 8.5/10- I loved this arc. It introduced us to nen, one of the best power systems in anime. Plus it gave us some great fights, like Gon vs. Hisoka and Hisoka vs. Kastro. The learning about nen and the power it holds is just amazing.  Yorknew Arc- 10/10- The 2nd best arc is the series. It is chalk full of super amazing moments, and it also introduces some of the coolest characters in the series like the Phantom Troup. Chrollo is a 10/10 villain. Kurapika vs. Uvogin, Silva and Zeno vs. Chrollo, and Uvogin vs. the Shadow Beasts are some of the best fights in the series. Chrollo directing the Phantom Troup like the conductor of a symphony is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite moment in the series.  Greed Island- 8.5/10- Expanded even more on nen. The game against Razor was amazing. Just the whole idea of a card game was fantastic. All of the cards were written out, and the complexity and variety was great. We finally got to see Gon\u2019s hatsu, and Hisoka was in the arc; However, it had to worst villain in the series. Chimera Ant Arc- 10/10- I don\u2019t even have to say anything. It\u2019s the best arc in all of anime.  Election Arc- 9/10- Pariston is another 10/10 antagonist which is really impressive considering he\u2019s the fourth best villain in the series. Although you could argue that Hisoka isn\u2019t an antagonist. Leorio punching Ging was the most satisfying punch I\u2019ve ever seen. Hisoka vs. Gotoh was super cool, but I wasn\u2019t a fan of the Alluka plot line. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a 9 instead of a 10.  So the reason it seems that Hunter x Hunter starts off badly, is that it does. However, it\u2019s only bad because the rest of the series is so good. If the rest of the series was average, the early arcs would seem average too. ",
