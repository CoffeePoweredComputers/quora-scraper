            "answer_text": "I will provide a few tips, but my energy levels are low as I am in the middle of writing a review paper! Firstly you are not going to review a paper as the first sentence suggests. You will review lots of papers. You paper IS the review paper.You need a purpose. What topic are you going to review? I\u2019m reviewing \u2018electronic waste and occupational and public health\u2019 this week.Decide whether you will carry out a \u2018systematic review\u2019, or a more vague \u2018rapid review\u2019 or \u2018comprehensive review\u2019.Choose your search engines. I\u2019m using Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science, but you may choose others depending on your subject. You can find review papers about review papers which will help you choose how to get the most hits.Develop Boolean Operators- for instance I might type into Scopus: (electronic OR electrical) AND waste AND (safety OR health). You can make these very long and complex, or very short. Try developing different strings of operators and test them on a search engine.You will probably end up with a huge pile of papers. My last review started with 2,500. Decide how you will exclude or include them with pre-planned criteria. For instance, I excluded all papers which didn\u2019t determine a hazard index. You choose.Narow the papers down to a manageable handful, say 20 or 30.Compare the data presented in the papers. Find similar values and present them in tables.Discuss the tablesThat\u2019s the basics, but there may be others here who can provide you with more detail. ",

            "answer_text": "Experimenting and analyzing is not the only way to collaborate with knowledge creation: to make a literature review can be very helpful for the others. If you are performing a SYSTEMATIC review, I suggest reading one of the numerous papers written about how to do a systematic literature review (SLR). The chapters are associated with the different ways you analyze the obtained data and one or two more for introduction, discussion, and conclusions. Best of the lucks. ",
