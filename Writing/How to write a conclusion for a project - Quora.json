            "answer_text": "The conclusion of a research paper needs to summarize the content and purpose of the paper without seeming too wooden or dry. Every basic conclusion must share several key elements, but there are also several tactics you can play around with to craft a more effective conclusion and several you should avoid in order to prevent yourself from weakening your paper's conclusion. Here are some writing tips to keep in mind when creating the conclusion for your next research paper. Do not spend a great amount of time or space restating your topic. A good research paper will make the importance of your topic apparent, so you do not need to write an elaborate defense of your topic in the conclusion. Usually a single sentence is all you need to restate your topic. A thesis is a narrowed, focused view on the topic at hand. This statement should be rephrased from the thesis you included in your introduction. It should not be identical or too similar to the sentence you originally used. Try re-wording your thesis statement in a way that complements your summary of the topic of your paper in your first sentence of your conclusion. For more details visit here. ",

As per my experience until and unless you make yourself part and parcel of the project you will not be able to write a effective, impressive and satisfactory conclusion. Be with it, understand the demand of the project, try to communicate with it, think in and on every aspect of it, read/refer related literature, and believe me no one should doubt including you, that you will come up with a excellent conclusion. Hope it helps you. Regards and good luck. ",
