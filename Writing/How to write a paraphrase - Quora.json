            "answer_text": "I am sure you understand what a paraphrase is and when it should be used. Below are the steps you should use to paraphrase: Understand the complete meaning of the sentence that you wish to paraphrase.Find the keywords in the sentence, replace those with the closest synonyms.Identify the distinct components of the sentence (these can be seen as sub-sets of a super-set).Rearrange the order of these sub-sentences such that the intended meaning of the sentence still stays the same.Here is an example: The sentence is: We like playing hockey at this institute because it is one of many ways we can support the national game, which is more often than not, neglected by the country. Here is how you will paraphrase it using the steps I mentioned: Identify meaning- People like to play hockey at the institute to encourage it as a sport in the country because they are aware it is not given enough importance otherwise.Keywords- \u201clike to\u201d, \u201cplay\u201d, \u201csupport\u201d, \u201cneglected\u201d. Please note that the words \u201chockey\u201d, \u201cnational game\u201d have not been selected by me as keywords because I cannot replace it with a synonym, since I do not want to go too far with the paraphrasing.Here are the synonyms I chose for the selected words respectively: \u201ccherish\u201d, \u201ctake part in\u201d, \u201ckeep up\u201d, \u201cdiscount\u201dIdentify sentence components- The trick to identifying components is that each component by itself must be a meaningful sentence. The sentence is comprised of three parts:We like to play hockey at the institute.We wish to encourage it as a national game.Hockey is usually neglected by Indians.Rearrange order- I will rearrange the order of the above components and present my final sentence after replacing keywords with chosen synonyms.Hockey is more often than not discounted by the people, so we cherish taking part in it at this institute in order to keep up it\u2019s spirit as a national game in India. This may look like a long method, but I laid it out like this in order to explain the method. Once you start paraphrasing sentences more frequently, you will find yourself doing it quicker, without going over these steps, eventually within seconds. Practice makes perfect! Tip: Use Thesaurus.com - The world's favorite online thesaurus! to find great synonyms. ",

            "answer_text": "As outlined in our article \"How to Paraphrase: Dos, Don'ts, and Strategies for Success,\" we outline three effective methods for paraphrasing. We have outlined these below for your convenience. The first method, as explained by OWL, is to write down paraphrases of a source on note cards. As you read the source text, keep notes on a card along with the source. Then, compare your version to the original, making sure you've covered all the necessary information and that you haven't paraphrased the text too closely. You can also outline how you plan to use this paraphrase in your paper. Using this method allows you to physically arrange your essay outline, which can be very beneficial if you are a visual learner. In addition, having a physical copy ensures that you will not copy and paste text and accidentally plagiarize in forgetting to paraphrase it. The second method, as outlined by Jerry Plotnick from the University College Writing Centre at the University of Toronto, is to paraphrase from your own point-form notes on a source. Taking only point-form notes from the source text allows you to capture the original idea without plagiarizing. Like the first method, you should compare your version to the original and outline how you will use this source in your paper. The benefit is the same: it will allow you to distance yourself from the original source and put the information in your own words. The third method, as suggested by the Writing Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is called two-step paraphrasing. As with the other methods, it involves taking notes to distance the paraphrased text from the source text and then changing the sentence structure and the word choice. In English, sentences can be simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex. To paraphrase, simply change the sentence structure. (You can read more about how to do this in our full article.) You can also change the voice from passive to active, or vice versa, or change the sentence length. Next, you can look at the word choice. Remember: paraphrasing isn't meant to hide the fact that you are copying someone else's idea; instead, it is meant to demonstrate that you are capable of explaining the text in your own words. I hope that helps! ",
