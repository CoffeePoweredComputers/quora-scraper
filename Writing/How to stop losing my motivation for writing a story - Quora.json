            "answer_text": "Hi Mastura has a really great answer. I have the same problem as you do! I actually have about six or seven began-but-by-no-means-even-anywhere-near-finished novels. All arose from the beautiful mess I call my imagination. There's a really good upside to these \"Oh man, that would make a FABULOUS story idea!\" moments. You get to explore them in different ways. The key to really enjoying writing stories, is to just write them. If your aim is to doggedly get through to the end, you could very well lose the feeling of adventure you had when you began.  I believe wholly in practicing writing every single day. Writing classes are also a good resource for learning new methods, trying out new ideas, learning how to write - and yes, even the best authors in the world need to brush up every now and then! One of my favourite things to do with all my (hundreds) of ideas is to take just one, and build on it. I call these my 3ams. I write dialogue between characters only. I write a paragraph describing settings. I write an event, an occurrence - the ideas you keep having are the food your imagination is giving you to nourish your creativity. Every new idea is an idea you can use in any way that will stretch your writing muscles. Besides, having lots of ideas you've started writing, but haven't been able to finish, means lots of books you can use in your publishing future! Jules ",

            "answer_text": "Two solutions: Keep pushing yourself to write it. Devote a certain block of time each day to writing. Write the bits that are in your mind, and go back to fill in the blanks later. As Thomas Edison said about inventing, it\u2019s 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.Maybe the story isn\u2019t ready yet. Write the story you\u2019re enthusiastic about, and put the unfinished one aside. Later, when you\u2019ve gotten the other story out of your system, take a look at your unfinished symphony and see if you\u2019re ready to go back to it. It probably will require a substantial rewrite, which may have been its problem to begin with.I\u2019m reading a collection of early short stories by Isaac Asimov, and he mentions regarding one of them how he early on formed his \u201ctwo-rewrite\u201d rule. If an editor expresses interest in a story but asks for a rewrite, that\u2019s okay; it\u2019s to be expected. Same if the editor asks for a second rewrite. But if the editor asks for a third, see if you can interest him or her in a different story. You\u2019d be spending far more time on a story than it\u2019s ultimately worth, and the premise was probably hopelessly flawed to begin with. ",

            "answer_text": "The best way that I've found to keep going on one storyline is to just start asking questions and posing hypotheticals about the storyline and world. I think the SouthPark guys recently gave a presentation where they said something along these lines for how they develop stories, but basically, you have to think of each Act as something that creates the next scene. So whatever your chapter 1 or scene 1 is, at the end of it you have to make the statement: \"and therefore this occurred,\" which creates the next scene. Thus creating a story chain which will inevitably lead you to a conclusion. If you want to split the story in a new direction, you can think along the lines of \"but meanwhile, something something,\" which presents a problem or another faction or something else that is set up to conflict or impact the previous scene (maybe in 1 or 2 scenes from then, or maybe not until the very conclusion). Either way, as long as you think of your story in terms of progression and can come up with meaningful connections and links between the scenes, there should be no end to your creative process. If you feel you've exhausted the content, you can try coming up with a conclusion or end scene and then work the links back to where you started and see how it connects together. Either way you'll be doing lots of rewriting and revision later on, but that's much easier to do once you have the full story completed. Hope this helps. :) ",

            "answer_text": "This is really hard--I've had the same problem all my life. I think it's actually two different problems that lead to a trail of incomplete projects. One thing is capturing your ideas effectively so that you can return to them when you have more time and second is the motivation to DO THE WORK. That's the really hard part. Try setting aside time each day for writing one thing until it's done. Maybe you'll only have 15 minutes at first, but make that 15 minutes count and stick to your story, even if it feels uninspired or you're not feeling on top of your game. Not everything you write is going to be wonderful, but getting things completed is the only way you'll ever have a shot at wonderful. You can do this!!  ",
