            "answer_text": "First, I think you're right about the 'Dear Pam' as it sounds ..um...ordinary.You could start diretly with \"Pam, Dearest to my Heart\".  That starts out pointing out that she is THE dearest to you.  The body of the letter should really be just you honestly saying what you wish to mean.  A letter gives you a great opportunity to re-read and edit your text.I would say just what you mean.   Carpe Diem!  Speak now as there just might be someone else on the edge of bf-gf with her.1. If you enjoy her company, then say so.2. If you want spend more time with  her, then say that also.3. If there are things you want to do (no, no, not that), then present her with some ideas for adventures to do together.  You know her better than we do, so think about what you two enjoy together.  Does she enjoy museums?  (There are usually art, history, and even local culture museums near everywhere by urban areas.)There are various parks and wilderness areas where maybe you can hike and enjoy nature and the outdoors.  4. You suggest you'd enjoy an exclusive relations (bf-gf).  Tell her so, but not in the clingy or obsessed way.  Tell her in light of (3 ) above.  We can plan and share such adventures better if we were bf-gf, eh?5. You say you two 'banter' and 'flirt'.  Bear in mind that's potentially all there is there for her, the enjoyment of a friendship just on the edge of bf-gf but not quite there.   Give her an out so she can stay close to you.  I definitely think you'd rather remain close to her even if you can not yet stake a claim for bf-gf relations.6.  Here's one final point which you can say first in the letter:  tell her why the letter and not speaking to her directly.  Just be honest!  \"I'm tongue-tied when I'm around you because you're the most important person to me and I want to try to say just the right things rather than stumble around and maybe say something stupid and/or inarticulate.  \" Good Luck!  (BTW, ....does she read Quora?  :->  )\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "I'd start with \"Dear Pam\". It is traditional and does not imply too much, but is friendly where \"To Pam\" sounds stilted. If I received a letter beginning \"to Barbara\", I'd wonder if I had offended the sender. If you can't bring yourself to use \"Dear Pam,\" just \"Pam,\" is better than \"To Pam.\" How you sign off has more implications than how you start the letter. \"Love, [your name]\" will give her a strong hint of your feelings, but has plausible deniability, as friends sometimes sign off this way - especially if it is a paper letter. \"Yours,\" or \"Yours truly,\" or \"Your friend,\" or \"Warm regards,\" implies some closeness without suggesting love. \"Kind regards,\" \"All the best,\" \"Cheers,\" or just signing your name with nothing else is more neutral and can be used with strangers.
