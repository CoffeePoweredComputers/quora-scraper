            "answer_text": "Obviously, your best hope to land a job is a resume with years of relevant, extensive experience. So what do you do when you don\u2019t have that? Maybe you\u2019re just out of school, or you are trying to change careers \u2013 it might be trickier, but with our Resume writing tips you can still create an impressive entry-level resume. 1. Keep it short A resume should be a maximum of two pages, but this looks silly when you don\u2019t have enough to fill it! Keep things brief and easy to scan on one page only, so your best achievements quickly stand out to those reading. 2. Keep it simple Unfortunately there is no \u2018one true way\u2019 to write a resume. Some hiring managers are horrified by colored paper, some will throw out a CV with an oxford comma \u2013 and some will throw out those without! Using an objective or not is up for debate \u2013 we lean towards no. 3. Include transferable skills Before you start thinking how to write a first resume, make a list of anything work-related you can think of. Maybe you helped to run a club, or built an exciting project in a class, or did bookkeeping for a family business. This helps in two ways: you\u2019ll feel better about what you\u2019ve done, and you\u2019ll think of all the transferable skills you might have learnt! Accounts, time management, public speaking, computer skills, and organization are all important soft skills that you can highlight to potential employers. A resume writing service can help you make the most of your limited experience. 4. Be realistic If you\u2019re changing careers, you can\u2019t expect to jump straight into the same level you were at, and likewise, just starting out you won\u2019t be landing any senior titles. Don\u2019t treat any job as beneath you, you might be surprised, and even entry level positions can have lots of room for vertical or lateral advancement within a company. 5. But don\u2019t be discouraged! Seeing a 10-point list of requirements can discourage new job seekers, but for many points, these are wish lists rather than firm requirements. Don\u2019t be discouraged from applying if you are missing 2-3 points off the list! Writing a great cover letter, or using a professional cover letter writing service is the best way to stand out from the crowd and convince an employer you can learn the skills they need quickly. 6. Always keep learning Just because you lack experience now, doesn\u2019t mean you will be this way for long! You should always be looking forways to improve yur resume or CV. Volunteering, personal projects, internships, and courses are all great ways to get new skills and add connections to your network. A positive attitude and a drive to learn are your most valuable assets, with and without experience. So, keep improving your resume! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, If you don\u2019t have any hobbies (which is highly unlikely), then it is better not to mention any on your resume at the moment. Use this opportunity to cultivate meaningful hobbies that enrich your life (and not just your resume) There are three facets to hobbies that make it appealing to the employer: 1. Uniqueness If you add an interest that 90% of the population have for e.g. Watching TV, Listening to music \u2013 that\u2019s not going to count for much. But if they include things like stamp collecting, horseback riding, etc then it becomes unique. 2. Difficulty Things are that more difficult to do, are more appreciated. For e.g. running marathons, playing musical instruments, etc. 3. Specifics Even if your interests coincides with something fairly common, you can add specifics to it to make it truly yours. For e.g. Instead of just mentioning that you like reading books, you can mention the genre e.g. magical realism, the authors that you like reading e.g. Isaac Asimov, etc to make it more specific.
