There are some other ways on the internet too. You could even sell your songs on your own website or a platform like twitter.Either way, you should keep in mind that no matter which way you choose, you'll always have to get yourself out there by marketing your business on social media. Watch out, this is not as easy as it may seem but if done properly, it can gain you a lot more clients. ",
