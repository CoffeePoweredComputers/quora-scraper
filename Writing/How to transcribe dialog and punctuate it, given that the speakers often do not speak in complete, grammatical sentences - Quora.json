            "answer_text": "Transcribing dialog and punctuating it\u2026 hmm\u2026 This is a piece of a real live transcript spoken by someone with a Master\u2019s in Communication conducting an interview. Yeah, it was good. I mean it was good. I mean it\u2019s like \u2014 so you know, all of a sudden, you know \u2014 maybe sort of tell us, you know, saying this news of his murder was sort of, you know, spreading across the country. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a shock, however, you know? But the country is like thrown into \u2014 once again, thrown into chaos. Like, you know, different groups vying for \u2014 so you got all that? Just specifically this little bit \u2013 do this little bit, a little bit.\" Out of context it looks terrible and can probably be punctuated a plethora of ways without losing any clarity. But if you were in the room, all that makes sense. When people talk, the meaning is often confuddled and there isn\u2019t a damn thing to do about it, because most likely, there\u2019s a ton of body language and facial expressions that is completely lost in the words that the punctuation won\u2019t make up for. And most of the time, people speak with the words, \u201cBut, just, like, you know, kind of, sort of,\u201d etc., as forms of punctuation that easily lends itself to a period, comma, or what-have-you. . Transcribing can be seen as art to maintain the cadence and integrity of the speakers words through proper punctuation. The general rules I follow in plain English \u2014 Periods at the end of a thought. The comma, like a breath, a pause, a gathering of neurons, maybe changing a slight direction of thought, or lists. The ellipses\u2026 when people stop mid sentence and think for a while. And then there\u2019s the em dash, when thoughts change mid \u2014 man I\u2019m hungry. When people interrupt themselves, there\u2019s the em dash. (Trump speaks mainly in em dashes.)  Communication is 1/2 sound, 1/2 silence. The words indicate the noisy bits. Spaces, [Tab], [Enter] and punctuation indicate the quiet bits. Like rests in sheet music. They\u2019re all symbols to convey a meaning so people can hear through their eyes. I type what I hear. What I read my typing, it needs to make as much sense as what I\u2019m hearing \u2014 bringing attention to what the speaker wants to emphasize. So, there\u2019s no guess work. It\u2019s a fairly human thing to do, translating the spoken word so it can be read. Or reading the written word aloud. That\u2019s why we know \u201cHelp your uncle jack off the horse,\u201d sounds completely different than, \u201cHelp your Uncle Jack off the horse,\u201d simply by enlarging two letters changes the enunciation and the meaning, changing the way the surrounding words sound, the amount of breath used, the emotional nuances behind \u201cUncle Jack\u201d when it\u2019s spoken \u2014 it\u2019s all gonna be different between the two sentences, from the way \u201cHelp\u201d is formed by the mouth, to how \u201cjack\u201d is enunciated. Plus all the surrounding dialog that aids in giving contextual clues as to what the speaker meant and intends their audience to perceive. . How we communicate and understand one another is in the midst of continual evolution. Nothing is static, nor fixed. Rules and guidelines are a reflection of what people are practicing in their lives. Grammar rules and guidelines are saying what people are using, not dictating what we MUST use to communicate. Rules of communication are handy, but humans kinda suck at following rules. Lol!  I focus on understanding what I\u2019m hearing, and making sure I got all their words, and they can be read by others. Punctuating other people\u2019s thoughts is quite a creative process. And it\u2019s that creativity \u2014 full of flaws, errors, and understanding, is something I think the machine is going to always struggle with. Human communication is chaotic, highly creative, non-repetitious, and forever altering with every breath we take. ",

            "answer_text": "Suggestion: Dialog has its own practices. Read a novel with dialog. Any of Hemingway\u2019s works would be a good start. Then pick another novel or short story. Copy the dialog. Literally write or type the sentences. After copying a page or two you will see how each author patterns his/her approach to dialog. A common convention is to start a new paragraph when speakers change. A change of time, place, action, or speaker may all occasion a new paragraph. Speaker tags (he said, he asked, she shouted) follow varying (yet consistent) practices in a work. I like (I guess from my journalism days I like to put the speaker tag at the end of the statement.) One of my favorite authors starts the sentence (and new paragraph) with the tag which really annoys me. Like this: Joel said, \u201cI am really tired of these games.\u201d (New paragraph): \u201cI am too,\u201d Veronica said. Read carefully, copy different authors. Dialog is really an art difficult to master but a powerful tool. Ask any playwright, who deals in dialog almost completely. :) ",
