            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not like writing is a necessary thing to do. Someone starts to write when he/she feels like he/she wants to share something but unable to do that, therefore, he/she starts to write to shed off his/her burden. But the thing is writing is not the only way to do that I feel self-talk is also an effective way. Because, the ultimate aim is to share your feelings, your thoughts, etc. to yourself now whether to do it by writing or by any other way doesn\u2019t matter the aim should be accomplished. Your writing should include what you feel like if you want to write your goals you should do that, if you want to write about your feelings you should do that, if you want to write anything else you should do that. The major factor here is whatever you write you should do that for yourself, your thoughts should not be corrupt while doing that because the reason is you are writing it because you feel like doing it, you are not doing it for anyone else. Therefore, I will say that while writing your diary you should be the true you, you should be honest to yourself while writing. ",
