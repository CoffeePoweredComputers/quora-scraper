            "answer_text": "As a writer, I believe that self-publishing has numerous benefits that attract many authors. It not only allows you more control over your book but also gives you more creative freedom and larger amounts of royalties. In my opinion, with the right professional help and resources like Pencil, the process can be easily simplified. Here are a few steps that can be followed to ensure the best outcomes. 1. Plan your first draft: Figuring out your story before you sit down to write is the first step to a draft. In my opinion, writing a logline for your book before the draft will give you an idea of the storyline as you start writing chapters. 2. Plan a routine: In my experience, I had to adjust some family and work-related commitments to find the time for my writing practice every day. So I suggest that you plan to build up an efficient writing practice, even if it is just two hours every day. This will maintain the flow of your writing as well as your enthusiasm for it. 3. Perfect your craft: Writing a book requires time and an eagerness to learn. There will be several iterations, and the process might get tiresome, but I have learnt that one must take it constructively. An effective way to learn from your mistakes is that you revisit the chapter a few days later after writing it so that it allows you a fresher take on the corrections. 4. Edit the manuscript: While it may take time to finally conclude, once you are finished writing the manuscript, set it aside for a few days. Setting it aside and coming back to it later may give you a fresh perspective and allow you to make corrections that you didn\u2019t think of before. 5. Self-edit as much as you can Nobody knows your piece of art better than you do. Hence, self-editing will allow you to add/remove as per your understanding of the story before you let a professional editor do his job. But keep in mind that professional help in terms of editing is just as necessary. However, before you hand over your work to a professional editor, I highly recommend that you peruse through it a few times. 6. Let a professional help you over the finishing line Once you\u2019ve taken your manuscript as far as you can by yourself, it is best to bring in a fresh pair of eyes. If you are looking for professional quality editing, I would suggest getting a freelancer or using platforms like Pencil, Reedsy, and others. 7. Design the cover and format the interior As the final step to publishing your book, this is the part where your ideas will come to life. In my opinion, self-published authors intensely depend on the book cover to attract readers. Thus, you must ensure that the visuals on the book cover speaks for the words inside the book. 8. Self-publish (DIY) Making the best out of the modern options available to you, I think self-publishing is more convenient and easy with platforms such as Pencil, KDP, and others. Personally, I think Pencil platform is great since it is easy to use and is absolutely free. Unlike other platforms, it helps you distribute your book on all major retailers (in eBook and Paperback format) while you keep the rights of your work to yourself and make royalty for each book sold, I think it\u2019s a win-win situation.

            "answer_text": "Assuming you have a completed manuscript in your hands\u2026 Edit. Edit the living hell out of that manuscript. And I don\u2019t mean you, I mean hire someone to edit it for you. This usually takes a few rounds before the manuscript is ready to be called a book. Give the manuscript out to select people to read as proofreaders. They\u2019ll catch the mistakes that you and your editor missed. Stare at something long enough, it fades from your vision. You and your editor will miss stuff the longer you edit the manuscript. Fix the errors your proofreaders found and send it out to a new group of proofreaders to see if they catch any mistakes. There are some people who do proofreading professionally. They are more likely to find errors that most people would miss. Hire an artist to create a REAL cover for your book! Like editing the manuscript, the cover illustration will go through a few iterations before you finalize it. The cover is the primary advertisement for your book. Don\u2019t skimp on it. If you fancy yourself having an artistic bent and figure you can assemble something on your own with [INSERT GRAPHICS PROGRAM HERE]\u2026\u2026don\u2019t. There have been many self-published books that were excellently written but were absolutely destroyed by their covers. You are a writer. Not an illustrator. Go hire a real artist to create a real cover illustration for you. Good editing? Passed proofreading? Got a nice cover? That manuscript is ready to be published as a book. Storytelling is an art. Writing is just at technical facet of storytelling, it is what you have to do to create a permanent record of the story you are telling. But trying to sell a book to other people is business. Don\u2019t ever forget that. You can\u2019t just slither back into your writing hole and start writing the next book. You have to go out and promote the book you just pushed out into the wild. That\u2019s called \u201cSales-Marketing.\u201d Because the vast majority of writers are introverts, this is the hardest thing for a writer to do: get up in front of other people and say, \u201cStep right up folks and buy my book!\u201d (Seriously, buy my book! I had to replace my car and the next payment is coming up!) And, oh, it gets uglier! All these things are going to cost you money. That\u2019s business. And by business, I mean business. You should create a business! A small corporation; a LLC S-corp (US). Hire an accountant to help you set up the best option to help you save money on taxes and manage your expenses according to the regulations of the locality where you live. This will cost you a couple hundred of dollars, but should result in you making more money than that if you had done otherwise. This is why hiring an agent or publisher costs an author so much. Rough 80%\u201390% of your income. There is so much to be done in the process of making a book that can be sold publicly, it can cost a lot of money. Self-publishing can push many people into cognitive overload, where they just can\u2019t figure out what to do next and freeze up. (edit 2020\u201307\u201313: the above paragraph is rather misleading. It should be compared to publishing yourself as opposed to having an agent and publisher get your book out there. The publisher takes on all the risk, production costs, marketing, etc., so they take a lion\u2019s share of the sales proceeds. The resulting royalty from all that is split between the author and the author\u2019s agent. Self-publishing means all the money from the sales proceeds goes into your pocket, so you will earn more per copy sold than you would via traditional publishing. You still have to take on all the financial costs of prepping your book for publishing. But a trade publisher is more likely to sell more copies of your books; greater exposure means greater sales in the future and more income.) ",
