            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be honest: you aren\u2019t halfway through it. You are halfway through your first draft, and you will need a lot of work yet before it\u2019s ready. Get comfortable with that now. It will save you a lot of heartache. You SHOULD be proud of what you\u2019ve done: you\u2019ve taken amazing strides to realize your dream! But it\u2019s so important to pace yourself and learn that it\u2019s a process \u2026 not a destination. Now go write the other half! Then put it away for at least a couple of weeks, preferably a month, and read it cold. See it for what it is, clearly, and how you can make it better. Then rewrite, and put it in front of others. While they\u2019re reading it, start something new. Always forward motion. ",

            "answer_text": "Quality is best. When you get halfway, one of the things that begin to stop you is the need to finish, the desire to finish, but it snufs out the flame to quality. Don\u2019t rush it, because once you do, it\u2019s not a matter of delete and retype. It\u2019s a matter of ctrl+a delete and rewrite. ",
