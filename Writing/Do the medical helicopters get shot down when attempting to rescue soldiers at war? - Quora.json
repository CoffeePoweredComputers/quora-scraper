            "answer_text": "Whenever possible. Beginning in the Korean War and ever since. The ability and demonstrated intention of a military force to extract its forces when injured or facing massacre has always been a morale boost. Denying your adversary the ability to treat and/or evacuate wounded troops from combat has always best served enemies. Especially since WWII, the concept of wounding your enemy rather than killing him outright was considered optimal if possible. If you kill a soldier, he\u2019s just dead. If you wound him, he\u2019s lying on the ground screaming for help, something his colleagues can hear quite clearly. If they try to rescue him, you get to shoot them too. If they send in medics, unarmed by agreement and clearly badged with large red crosses as \u201cnoncombatants\u201d and you shoot them, too, that simply reinforces the terror in the ranks of your enemies. If you fast forward and that rescue and medical evacuation is coming from unarmed medical evacuation helicopters and you can shoot them down, too, even better! Don\u2019t throw rhetoric at me about the Geneva Convention. Very few conflicts since the end of WWII have involved the sort of combat in which they would apply and those conventions have never been implemented enthusiastically. My father was a medic in George Patton\u2019s 4th Armored Division in WWII. He told me the Germans shot at medics so often, he took to carrying a .45 caliber Colt pistol. Completely unauthorized and probably meaningless in a combat zone ruled by high powered rifles and machine guns, but it gave him some moral confidence that he wasn\u2019t completely defenseless. If he\u2019d been much younger and had flown on medivac helicopters in Vietnam, it\u2019s likely that he\u2019d have done the same since the enemies he would have been facing treated helicopter pilots and crews exceptionally poorly when they had the chance to shoot them down.
