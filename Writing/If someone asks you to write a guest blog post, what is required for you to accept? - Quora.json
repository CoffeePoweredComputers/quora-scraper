            "answer_text": "It's a bit like getting an A2A on Quora. It helps immensely if the topic is something I know and am comfortable writing about and the blog supports the same sorts of things that I support. I would probably not be a willing or effective writer otherwise. Beyond that, it will help to have some understanding of what the blog's proprietor is expecting, as well as whom the intended audience might be. Are they offering a specific title/topic, or giving me a general direction and letting me run with it? A wide-open blank screen can be daunting, so it would help to narrow it down at least a little. If I have already written something along those lines, you might ask instead whether you could republish it directly or get some variation on the theme.  I'd also like to understand how I'm getting credited and linked before I write. I began writing online through wikis (chiefly Wiktionary and wikiHow), so I am concerned that most of the stuff I submit be freely licensed, usually cc-by or some equivalent. I choose to publish most of my flickr photos under a cc-by license, and the times that someone requests the use of one, I generally agree (after all, they could have anyway) and ask that the photo credit state that it is cc-by and credit me, with a link to the photo if practical. Another helpful thing would be to have the ability to back out. I'll be happy to try to write the post, but if it's going to mess up everything if I don't write what you intended, if I don't write it by your deadline, or if I end up getting stuck and not writing it at all, then you may be better off writing it yourself or finding someone besides me. And finally, if you've asked, please be engaged about it. If it's been a few days, check in. I may have gotten stuck, or busy. It was a podcast, not a blog, where I contributed a few times as a guest. The host was a pretty good coach. He helped me choose from topics I had already written, set up an appointment at a time that worked in both our time zones, handled all the recording (via Skype), and was very reassuring that he'd edit out flubs and re-takes. That sort of support meant the difference between me contributing multiple times and me never contributing at all. I expect the guest blogging equivalent might be the sort of editorial input I describe above. For one guest blog I wrote, I approached the blogger, whom I had read regularly: here's a post I think might fit. You have my permission to use it, or get back to me and we'll retool it if you prefer. It ran basically unchanged. ",
