            "answer_text": " I am the author of a fully legal (and somewhat succeffull), unofficial Rambo prequel. With time my community grew so much that when I ended up watching LAST BLOOD I (sadly) knew all of the plot in detail and that was before the film was even released. Every info I received before time was (sadly) right. And I am saying \u2018sadly\u2019 because me (just like anyone else in the world) don\u2019t enjoy reading spoilers before watching ANY film. Anyway, this premise was just to explain you why I receive so many rumours about Rambo and Stallone and that often. Original question: \u201cDid Rambo: Last Blood really end the journey of John Rambo?\u201d Your answer is\u2026 It\u2019s up to Sylvester Stallone.  SPOILERS ALERT! According to rumors, after the trailer of LAST BLOOD was showed at the CANNES films festival, Stallone re-opened the set in order to shoot some extra scenes for the film and changing it\u2019s ending in particular. According to those rumors again, the film\u2019s ending was changed in order to make a sequel \u2018possible\u2019. In other words, Rambo was meant to die at the end of Last Blood, but Stallone changed the film in order to let the door open to a possible sequel after seeing how well the trailer was received at Cannes. As matter of facts and if you think about it, the ending titles sequence of RAMBO LAST BLOOD makes much more sense if the character died, but he didn\u2019t. He survived. THAT SAID\u2026 On a financial level, Last Blood wasn\u2019t THAT successfull\u2026 It was barely \u2018okay\u2019. On a critics level, it was a disaster\u2026 But that\u2019s okay. It was okay for massive hits like Rocky 4, hence it doesn\u2019t really matters. On public level\u2026 It polarized the public. Regarding the fans of the character\u2026 It was a hit and miss, and I think that this is what hurt Stallone the most. Many fans enjoyed it, but many others didn\u2019t. And what\u2019s even worse than that, everyone agrees that this is the lesser entry of the saga. Now Stallone is a pretty fair guy and fully capable of accepting a defeat, and in some interviews he admitted that the film could \u2018have been better\u2019 or said other similar phrases while talking about it. He had always accepted the public response in the past, and I think this time he did no exception to his rule. He makes film for the others to enjoy, not for himself. IN CONCLUSION: Stallone did Rocky Balboa and John Rambo in 2008 in order to make \u2018one last big hit\u2019. And even more than that, he was not happy with both Rocky 5 and Rambo 3, hence he did those two film back in 2008 in order to somewhat \u2018repair\u2019 the legacy of his two most beloved characters.. I am quite sure Stallone is not happy by the way LAST BLOOD was received compared to JOHN RAMBO. I have no doubts he would like to set things \u2018straight\u2019 once again. YET\u2026 It\u2019s very hard he will ever find producers for another Rambo film again. Many professionals think he has no excuse for both the gross LAST BLOOD made (considering how famous the brand was) and the public\u2019s reception. Will he try? Sure. Of course he will try. But will he ever do another Rambo one again and for real? Nobody knows. POST SCRIPTUM There are \u2018entirely unconfirmed\u2019 rumours about the plot of \u2018Rambo six\u2019. It would be about a dying Rambo being helped up by Indians living nearby, and being carried in an Indian reservation for treating his wounds. At this point and being the Indian reservation out of government control, Rambo would have troubles with the government of the US trying to figure aout what the hell happened between him and the drug cartels. This would be the beginning point of the plot. But if this film will ever be done, and if this is going to be it\u2019s plot for real\u2026 This is extremely soon to say. And if you ask me, I think Stallone is pretty done with the character because of two reasons: financial reasons, and the way Hollywood works. ",
