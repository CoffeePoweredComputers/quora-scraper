            "answer_text": "Which sentence makes sense, \"He succeeded at third attempt\" or \"He succeeded a third attempt\"? In that sentence, succeeded is intransitive: it does not take a direct object, so \u2018\u2026a third attempt\u2019 is an indirect object, which requires a preposition. \u2018Third attempt\u2019 requires a determiner. Correct alternatives are: \u2018He succeeded at a third attempt.\u2019 \u2018He succeeded on his third attempt.\u2019 ",
