The Ellen Degrees show is already all on Youtube and there for you to watch. If you don\u2019t use the internet that much and don\u2019t know what it is. Youtube is a video-sharing app website developed in 2005. And it is completely free! PS: Hope this helped you and enjoy the watching! Peace out! ",
