            "answer_text": "The main concept of your resume is that it needs to be a targeted marketing document that centers around career achievements. COVID-19 has forced a lot of teachers to become familiar with both in-person and virtual learning environments. You could use this as an achievement on your resume, especially if you were involved in helping develop or launch any of the virtual curricula or learning pathways. The company I work for, Zipjob, has developed a database of hundreds of sample resumes. There are 10 separate examples of resumes for teachers.  Source: 10+ Teacher and Educator Resume Examples (2020) | ZipJob. You\u2019ll notice how each one is specifically tailored to a particular type of teaching position. Going back to that idea of a targeted marketing document, you must define the type of teaching position you seek. Then, tailor your resume to match that particular role. Each of the 10 example resumes has a link that provides more specifics and some expert tips on building that particular resume. There are also downloadable templates you can use to build your resume. Good luck with your job search. ",
