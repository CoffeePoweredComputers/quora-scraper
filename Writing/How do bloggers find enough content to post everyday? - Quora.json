            "answer_text": "It's a process, but some are more simple than others. Here comes an example. I'm a nerd. Point blank period. So let's just say I make a blog, or twitter/Instagram account about a person or franchise I like. Let's try Dragon Ball Z. Now from learning the game of insurance, I know numbers, a lot better than I learned them in high school. So from there I understand a couple of things. I want to make money from this.I need to be able to post different contentI need to keep it interestingThere 365 days in a year, every four; 366So with that thought process, I need to be able to post a minimum of 366 different things. Now let's map this out. So with DBZ, I can take this, by dividing what I want to talk about into different factors. I hope everyone's following along because this is how you make money while sleeping. I think about it like this. I want to talk about the following CharactersEpisodesMoviesGamesToysSo that's 5 right? 365 divided by 5 equals 73 if my maths correct. So for every bullet point above, you have 73 things to possibly talk about. Now if you're a DBZ fan, we know they're definitely enough characters and episodes to talk about 73 different times. Toys as well. Games and movies, not so much unless you're uploading screenshot content. So time to compensate. You then pick apart the characters. You list every single Character that ever been spotted on DBZ. Last time I've read there's 130, but as we know there will be more as long as the season progress. Now let's say you talk about each character twice, just not in succession. That's 260. 365 minus 260 is 105. Only 105 things to talk about left in that year\u2026 crazy how simple that gotten right? I only choose 1 out of the 5 bullet points above. It's simple when you think about it and map it out. I just showed you how to make money in the process, you can also use that idea and funnel it from my guide here. But basically that's how some of us find ways to post material every day. You pick a topic you know you can rant for ages. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question! I have seen bloggers who start their blog and just after working for some weeks or months, they QUIT! The reason is, they failed to find new content ideas to write on. But it is not that much difficult as it looks like\u2026 It\u2019s pretty easy if you follow the right techniques for finding new content ideas. I will share the methods that I use always to hunt for the new content ideas to write about in my new blog post. 1. Use Quora Quora is a platform where people come and ask questions about their interest and about the topic they want to read. You can use this amazing platform to find new content ideas for your next blog post. What you need to do is, open the Quora and search your niche. Like I am blogging on Dog foods niche. Quora will show all the questions people are asking on Quora related to the topic you search for. Something like this\u2026  So, you just need to search your seed keyword(topic) in the Quora and search to get the questions that people are asking about your topic. You can write on these topics. 2. Use SEMrush Topic Research Tool SEMrush is a bundle of SEO tools which offers amazing SEO tools which makes the tasks like Keyword research, site audit, backlink audit etc easy. SEMrush also offers a tool named Topic Research which will help you to find new content ideas within your niche. For this, just search for your topic/seed keyword in the SEMrush topic research tool. You can also find topics from your competitors.  SEMrush will show you all the trending topics which are ranking high and getting high social engagements.  You can grab SEMrush Free Trial from here\u2026 3. Spy Your Competitors Do you know, your competitor\u2019s blog can also help you to get new content ideas. Take your eyes on your competitors\u2019 blog and see what they are writing about, write on the same topic, better than them. Or, if you use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush then you can see what is working for them, keywords they are ranking for. WHAT I DO IS, I use SEMrush and find the low competitive keywords my competitor is ranking for, so, I can write my next post on the same topic. This will really help you to find new content ideas. 4. Use Blog Ideas Generator Tools Like HubSpot You can also use Blog Ideas generators tools to find new content ideas for your next blog post. There are many tools available which you can use here, one of them is HubSpot\u2019s blog ideas generator. Open the HubSpot\u2019s Blog Ideas Generator, you can add up to 5 keywords in the tool.  Once you hit the Give Me Blog Ideas, HubSpot will show you some pre-made blog post topics which you can write your next blog post on.  5. Use BuzzSumo BuzzSumo is an amazing tool which shows you popular and trending contents. Open the BuzzSumo tool and enter your seed keyword to find trending contents.  BuzzSumo will show you all the contents which are performing well and getting huge engagement in Social Media.  BuzzSumo is one of the amazing tools that I use to find new content ideas, it not only shows the content ideas, rather you will get the social engagement of each post idea. It really useful tool to hunt for the viral contents. 6. Use Google Auto Suggest You can also use the Google auto-suggest tool to find new content ideas for your seed keyword. Enter your seed keyword or topic in the Google search box, Google will show you all the related topics around your main keyword.  These methods will help you to find new content ideas for your next post. I hope you liked these tips if yes, then please UPVOTE this. ",
