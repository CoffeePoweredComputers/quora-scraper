            "answer_text": "Not all ARMY\u2019s have social media or a youtube account as some are not old enough. Plus BTS and Blackpink have a different amount of popularity on different apps/ social media: Youtube Blackpink: 46.5 million Bangtan TV (BTS): 35.7 million Instagram blackpinkofficial: 28.2 million bts.bighitofficial: 29.2 million Twitter (doesn\u2019t count) Blackpink: doesn\u2019t have an account BTS_twt: 28.5 million V live Blackpink: 10.3 million BTS: 22.1 million TikTok Blackpink: 16.5 million BTS: 18.9 million Total (For the total I didn\u2019t add BTS twitter followers) Blackpink: 101.5 million BTS: 105.9 million When it comes to youtube Blackpink does beat BTS, however on V live and Instagram BTS are the winners. Plus its obvious that not all the people that has subscribed to BTS follow them on social media. For example, I follow them on V live, twitter and youtube but not on Instagram and TikTok since I\u2019m a closet ARMY! So followers doesn\u2019t really determine popularity since many know that BTS is the kpop group with the biggest fandom (2nd Exo)! Hope you enjoyed my answer, feel free to ask me questions about Yoongi or BTS in general!   \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\uace0 \uc0ac\ub791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4#BTS#ARMY#\uc6b0\ub9ac\uc544\ubbf8\uc0c1\ubc1b\uc558\ub124#BTS_Dynamite pic.twitter.com/9yuiWdqJf4\u2014 \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 (@BTS_twt) September 1, 2020\n  And of course, a special Happy (belated) Birthday to our favorite maknae - JUNGKOOKIE!! <3 -semi- ",

            "answer_text": "Each of the Blackpink members have their own accounts (Instagram). However, BTS doesn\u2019t have their own individual accounts (Instagram, Twitter, etc.). There are lots of fandom accounts for the BTS members, but they aren\u2019t the real BTS members posting. Another reason is because Blackpink is more active, at least on Instagram. Of course, Blackpink members have more advantages since they all have their individual accounts. However, BTS is more active on Twitter. Some Kpop groups are more active on some apps/websites than they are on other websites. BTS is also more famous worldwide. Yes, they are some of the top Kpop groups well-known world wide\u2026 Instagram(quite close): BTS (official account)- 29.2M+ Blackpink (official account)-28.2M+ Some other idols active on INSTA: Red Velvet -Joy, very active on EXO- Chanyeol, frequently active Got7- Jackson, active    Twitter: BTS -26.4M+ Blackpink -4.1M+ Some other idols active on TWITTER: SuperJunior- Siwon, Lots of followers on Twitter (7.1M+) Twice -5.6M+ TXT -3.9M+ Red Velvet -3.1M+   So basically, it depends on which app/website you\u2019re talking about. On Insta, Blackpink has more followers(individually), but Blackpink Official has fewer followers than BTS Official on Insta. On Twitter, BTS has more followers, since they are more active on Twitter than Blackpink. OVERALL: BTS has more followers in the 2 main apps people use, Instagram and Twitter. ",
