            "answer_text": "Technical content writing is a way to explain a product or service to the users. It can be also some academic topic. The writing should be easy to understand without the use of too much of technical jargons. If you have to use them then explain in great detail. You should write as if you are explaining something to a child. Writing technical content can be a challenging task particularly if you have just started. You must have a level of knowledge about the subject before you can start writing. But, you can only become better with deliberate practice (Writing). Here, are my 2 cents on the question: 1. 80-20 ratio:  Most of the time new writers jump on their laptops/computers and start punching the keyboard. According to me, 80% of your time should go in the research of the topic. You can't write good content without investing time in research. 2. Create a list of terminology guide:  Learn more about the subject by reading the industry-specific guides. This will help you immensely in understanding the jargons. You will learn from the industry experts, it will improve your writing quality. 3. Understand your readers:  This is one of the most valuable things you can do when writing. Understanding who your readers will be goes a long way in writing quality content. Whether you are writing for businessmen, sportspersons or for school children, you should write accordingly. And, as the old saying goes keep is simple. Image Credit: Google. ",
