            "answer_text": "I just want to echo what some others have said \u2014 find the human within the villain. Also, I think it\u2019s good to remember that many or maybe most evil or bad people do not think of themselves as evil or bad, and so their evil (in this case racism) will connect in some way to some larger life view that allows them to accept racism as making perfect sense, even if that perfect sense to them is that the other is naturally inferior and they, themselves, are superior and therefore have natural rights that the other doesn\u2019t have. But if your character is merely racist, I fear they won\u2019t be interesting at all, as they might merely be a convenient character in order to push your plot where you want it to go. It\u2019s always a mistake for a writer to do something just because they need to do it to make the plot move from A to C; the B has to make sense, ring true. Another question: Is your villain the uber villain, or is your villain merely a lieutenant who believes in order, and societal order, from his point of view, means that certain people are inferior and should be treated in that way. Is their motive even more banal: they have a job to do and that job means they have to subjugate people they consider inferior, since one does what one\u2019s bosses/leaders/superiors tell them to do. One of the most interesting recent antagonists that connects to this issue is John Smith in the TV series The Man in the High Castle, which if you don\u2019t know it is a series about an alternative time line in which the US and the allies lost World War II, and so the country is divided into two parts, with the Nazis governing the east, and the Japanese the west, with a sort of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d in between. Smith eventually becomes the head of the Nazi government in the US, and does any number of evil things, but what makes him human is that he has a family he cares about, and he does what he does in part to protect them, but also because he has ambition to be more than he is and, in his circumstance, rising in the Nazi party is the way to achieve that. His family and his ambition make him human, so that he has multiple dimensions even as he carries out the most heinous actions. At one point, Nazi policies about racial purity end up at his front door giving him a dilemma, which also helps make him human, since he has to rationalize his belief that he should enforce the policies without question with the effect they might have on his family. (I won\u2019t be more specific, in the event that you (or someone reading this) might not have seen the series and want to; I want to avoid spoilers.) So, I get that you don\u2019t want to see yourself in a racist individual, but is there some other aspect of you that might help make the antagonist a more rounded and therefore more interesting figure? Something that you value that they could also value? Something that you want that they could want? If you can find that, and give that quality to your character, I think you will stand a good chance of writing a successful narrative. ",

            "answer_text": "In the book club discussion guide for The Sing, I listed the main characters including the main bad guy who was the Klavern leader of the Ku Klux Klan and asked what motivated their actions. Then which motives were admirable and which were not. In my opinion, all of the motives were admirable and understandable. That was not true for the actions emanating from motives. The racist bad guy was worried about the society that he had known and the society his son would grow up in. He feared the loss of important things, including his status in the community and his own status in the Klan, which was his emotional support system. Most people could understand him, even if they didn\u2019t like him. He was a racist through and through. Unlike some of the others who have posted answers here, I don\u2019t have a problem with the word racist nor do I subscribe to the semantic quibble that we are all of the human race and should call it something else. For eighty-plus I have lived in a society that was demonstrably racists, and The Sing is about the institutional racism of the 1950s. That\u2019s just the way it was, and in the book I contend that probably 10% of the population were actively racist, about 10% had come to the conclusion that it was stupid, and about 80% simply accepted the racist strictures without thinking much about them since th at was the society they were born in. To specifically answer your question: have some empathy for why your antagonist is racist even if you can\u2019t agree with the racism. He or she is that way for a reason. Figure out what it is. ",
