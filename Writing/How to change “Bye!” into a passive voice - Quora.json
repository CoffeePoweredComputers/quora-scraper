            "answer_text": "Your question is a good comeback to the formalists who claim that a sentence must have a subject and a verb. [I usually answer them by saying \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d] To be changeable to passive construction, a sentence must have [at least] a transitive verb and a direct or indirect object. \u201cBye!\u201d has no verb.

            "answer_text": "It wouldn't really be done in English as there is no obvious subject/object. In some other languages the form for \u201cgoodbye\u201d is more complex. So, for example, in Polish and German it basically means \u201cuntil we meet again\u201d. If you really wanted to make a goodbye into passive in English you would probably have to make it longer, \u201cI wish you goodbye\u201d: \u201cYou wished goodbye\u201d but it sounds very strange. ",
