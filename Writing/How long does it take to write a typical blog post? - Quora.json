            "answer_text": "How long it takes to write a blog post depends on a lot of factors. The post\u2019s length.How technical the post is. More technical posts may require more research and citing.How familiar you are with the topic. Similar to #2, if you are new to the topic, you may need extra time to research the topic.How fast you write or type.How much effort you put into SEO. This includes, but is not limited to:Keyword research,Writing SEO friendly headlines,Writing SEO friendly titles, andAdding pictures or infographics.How much of a perfectionist you are. This is where I run into the biggest problem. I spend more time than is probably necessary revising.Bottom line, if you are blogging for just yourself and family/friends, your posts may not take long. If you are blogging to build authority and make money, then your posts will take much longer. The one thing to remember is patience and persistence. Results will be slow in coming but stick with it and constantly learn. Do that, and the results will come. ",
