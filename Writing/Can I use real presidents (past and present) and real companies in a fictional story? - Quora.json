For Instance: \u201c The year was 2016 and the candidate for the presidency of the U.S.A. Mr. Harris went to Florida, North Carolina and Montana, where the racist and fascist supporters were supporting him; not to mention the members of the Imperial Wizards of the KKK who had their headquarters in this state!\u201d As you know you are talking about Trump, but you changed the name to Mr. Harris; So that Trump can not suit you. Simply, you are writing fiction based on facts! Also you need to write a DISCLAIMER in your FOREWORD, INDICATING something like this. ALL NAMES, CHARACTERS OR INCIDENTS PORTRAYED IN THIS PRODUCTION ARE FICTITIOUS,NO IDENTIFICATION WITH OR SIMILARITY TO ACTUAL PERSONS LIVING OR DEAD OR TO ACTUAL EVENTS OR ENTITIES IS INTENDED OR SHOULD BE INFERRED. Dear Mina, with this disclaimer, you are home free from anyone who might want to suit you. Mina, I honestly admire you trying to write your book, and I wish you the best of luck in you writing career. and remember: That the world is yours, and all that\u2019s in it. also. \u201cThat the world belongs to all those who believe in the reality and beauty of their dreams!\u201d ",
