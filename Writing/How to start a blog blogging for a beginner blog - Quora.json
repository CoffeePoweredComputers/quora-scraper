Skip the rest of this introduction and start building your blog! What is a blog anyway? In short, a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you\u2019ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable. Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a \u201ccomments\u201d section where readers can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your readers in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader. This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide. ",

Domain and Hosting are two important factors to build a website or blog. www.facthb.com is my website URL and here FACT HUB is a domain name and I have bought this from Godaddy at \u20b9605. Now coming to the point whether it's free or paid. See,it depends on you or on your budget.If you are a beginner and don't want to invest money then you may use the free domain of blogger. As blogspot blogger is launched by google and here you may use its free domain Blogger.com - Create a unique and beautiful blog. It\u2019s easy and free.. But if you want to invest money on domain and want to buy domain like .com, .in,.net, .org then it's good for you.
