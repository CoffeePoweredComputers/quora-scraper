            "answer_text": "There are no hard-and fast rules to writing \u2013 be it a novel, a short story or anything else.  There are accepted styles for writing essays or technical papers, but nothing is wrong with mixing first-and third person in a work of fiction.  I notice you're also mixing tenses, which is interesting.  I suppose the question you have to ask yourself is \"Does mixing POV and tense add to the story, or help the reader in some way?\"  If the answer is no, then the next question is whether you intend to make any money.  A final point:  using the third person and the present tense is essential for writing scripts or screenplays. Thank you for asking this question, it's given me the little push I needed in-order to get writing again.  I hope! ",

If you are asking about switching in the middle of text, no, a good writer would not do that (i\u2019m not saying you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d because you *can* do anything you want\u2026but experienced writers woudn\u2019t) ",
