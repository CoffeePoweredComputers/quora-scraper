            "answer_text": "Now. The earlier the better. Because like a novel or screenplay\u2019s first draft, a well written application should evolve over many weeks, or months, to become an excellent final draft. And I use novel/screenplay on purpose, because \u201cessay\u201d is a misnomer. College applications are not the English or history class essays you\u2019ve been taught to write. Rather, they are something you are not usually trained for: \u201cstories\u201d about you. Excellent \u201cessays\u201d are actually mini-autobiographies, which tell the readers (i.e., Admission Officers) something insightful, compelling, surprising, intimate, etc., about who you are. Not easy. And to make it even more difficult, while J.D. Salinger used 73,404 words to tell Holden Caulfield\u2019s story, you\u2019ll often be limited to between 200 and 650. An excellent common app or other application \u201cessay,\u201d must grab the Officers\u2019 attention from the start and make them \u201clean in\u201d till the end. This is crucial, as the typical time the first Officer spends reading your application is 3 MINUTES!, including all your personal data and \u201cessays\u201d. It took you longer to get up and dressed today. But when Officers have to read 50+ applications a day, that\u2019s what happens. So it better grab their attention instead of looking like so many others, and also overcome the possibility that your application is #43 of that day, when the Officer is tired, fighting a headache and a cold. The end result you want is that after those three minutes, Officers believe that: they know you a little better beyond GPA/SAT/activities, you are a special kind of person that someone would want as a roommate, and the school is looking for students like you to become part of its world. There are other ways as well to increase the odds the Officer will actually know who you are before reading your application (what I call the \u201cHarry Potter Factor,\u201d when everyone knew who Harry was before he met them), but that\u2019s Phase 2. Phase 1 is presenting yourself as a \u201csuper candidate,\u201d who, beyond grades and scores, is a memorable, different, and desirable applicant - and that starts with compelling essays. So I highly recommend starting early, even if it\u2019s just random sentences on a notepad with qualities or experiences you\u2019d like people (i.e., the Admissions Praetorian Guards) to know and be impressed with. I\u2019ve been interviewing and counseling applicants my whole life, after working in the Admissions Office throughout my four years at Brown and seeing the process from the inside, through the eyes of my life-long Admissions friends. It\u2019s a great joy to see applicants I work with get the best shot possible and to get into the schools of their choice. I hope the above is helpful, and let me know if you have any questions. ",
