            "answer_text": "I was taught 'the Oxford comma' at primary school, although it was never called that at my school in Sydney. It was intended to make a sentence clear from confusion or ambiguity. It was also included in the entry exams for the state public service (civil service). I come from an earlier generation but, honestly, most of my fellow high school students had no interest in English grammar and punctuation, beyond passing the next test. At university in 1974, I saw the hand written essays of fellow students, who had been educated at many different schools in my city. I realised that the university did not care whether students were literate, or not. It really destroyed my illusions about academia. I don't know how the tutors and professors could pass many of those assignments. It seems that many school teachers of the new era are not required to be able to spell, punctuate, or parse a sentence. How can they teach what they were never taught? Perhaps English teachers have higher standards, although judging by some of my fellow work colleagues, now in their mid to late thirties, I doubt it. It seems that the corporate world is full of students who have been taught to scorn correct grammar and precise terminology. In my experience, many people who do not use commas, especially when the meaning is ambiguous without it, are too confused to commit themselves to a 'comma' for fear of putting it in the wrong place. They don't seem to miss a comma when it is omitted in someone else's written work, either. Over my years of working in a government department that restricted commas and banned the use of the word 'that', my own use of commas has become sporadic. Sometimes I leave them out, following the new work habit, but since I am now retired, I am allowed to put them in again, whenever I remember that I am now free.(See how I inserted commas and 'that'!). Whoopee! I apologise for any missing or random commas. I would also like to point out that the em-dash and the en-dash would have received a ruler across the knuckles, so I rarely use them, although I am pretty good with hyphens. So I need my commas. ",

            "answer_text": "The Oxford comma is the last comma in a series of three or more things, such as\u2014\u201cPlease bring me a sheet of paper, a pencil, and an eraser.\u201d Some entities, such as newspapers, use the AP style of writing. This style does not allow for the use of Oxford commas. Generally, the use of the Oxford comma is up to the writer. However, if you're taking an English class, the instructor may insist that you don't use it. Personally, I always use the Oxford comma. It's the way I was taught. Some sentences do not make sense without it. For example: \u201cI love my parents, Donald Duck and Daisy Duck.\u201d Omitting the second comma from the series makes it seem that my parents are Donald Duck and Daisy Duck.\u201d The correct sentence is: \u201cI love my parents, Donald Duck, and Daisy Duck.\u201d ",
