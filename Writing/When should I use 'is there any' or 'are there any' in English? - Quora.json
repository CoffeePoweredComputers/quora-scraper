Are there any sheep? Is there a sheep. Is there any mutton? Use any when you are using a plural noun. Use is when you are using a singular noun. When you are using an uncountable noun or mass noun. Note that there are countable forms of such nouns. (We have two soups, vegetable and mulligatawny. The different coloured sands of the Isle of Wight. The rices of the word.) though they tend to be rare. Sheep are countable it just happens that the plural and the singular are the same. If we were talking about a single sheep we would not use any we would specify a sheep. Using any implies the plural ",

            "answer_text": "It would depend on what follows, namely, either a singular noun or a plural noun. Eg. 1 \u2014 Is there any bread? is there any food? is there any cheese? (= all singular nouns) Eg. 2 \u2014 Are there any customers? are there any books? are there any burgers? (= all plural nouns) A counter-intuitive example, however, is this one: Is there any money? = because \u201cmoney\u201d, as a noun, is usually a singular form, even though you *can* count it \u2014 but when you *do* count it, you count it with \u201cdollars\u201d or \u201ccents\u201d as the unit of measurement \u2014 the only people who really use the plural form \u201cmonies\u201d are economists or stock-brokers.
