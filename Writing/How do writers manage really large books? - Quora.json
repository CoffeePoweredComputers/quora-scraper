            "answer_text": "I agree with most of what the authors have said so far, but I do want to mention that I seldom edit my entire book in Word. It is only when I put it out for submission that I work with the entire book at once. I write scene by scene and sometimes scraps on a setting or emotion, eventually these get put together into a chapter. The scenes go into a directory labeled booktitle01, through booktitlex, with the numbers changing every time I backup the files. Sometimes the title is something unpretentious like memoir. I label my files chapter 1, through chapterx, often with a description so I know what happens in that chapter. When I move the files into the chapters, the original files, xfdies, ymarries, etc, now go into a file called working files. This allows me to recover earlier work that I may delete then want back. Nothing is ever permanently deleted. Even these early files may have versions. Never forget to backup your work. Have multiple storage drives, keep at least one in a fire proof safe or in a bank box. Seriously. If you're going to write, you're going to write for decades and the storage media and your computers will change many times\u2014once I dumped an ice tea on my computer. It took me 1 day to get up and running and I only lost what I was typing up from a notebook, keep a paper copy too. If all else fails, you can scan your paper copy. Writing is a serious investment; it may not bring you large sums of money, but it will add to your professional credentials. You need to take it seriously. Don't store your files under C:\\documents, either, that is the first place that gets wiped if anything goes. Create another directory. Don't do your writing connected to the web. Do your Internet access on your phone or somewhere else. ",

            "answer_text": "Its easy enough if you take any number of organized approaches. I use Evernote. One evernote note per chapter. Pretty much like a single file per chapter equivalent. I keep a sheet that lists each chapter, its title, what approximately occurs, and usually a word count for the chapter. I keep a sheet of facts about the world in question that builds as I go. That way I can look up a character\u2019s description without having to paw through various chapters. If necessary I just copy-paste the description out of the prose. I\u2019ll generally mark which chapter the person first appears in. Likewise with places, and important objects. At the top of the sheet is a synopsis of what the story was originally supposed to be about. I keep another sheet to note problems that I need to go back and fix so they get worked on. A sheet for feedback from my first draft readers. I keep another sheet of real world pictures that inspired elements of the story, which might also include drawings I\u2019ve made of buildings or maps. If I draw something by hand, I photograph it and put the photo in this doc. A glossary of words if I\u2019ve made up a language and it gets too big for the fact sheet. All of the above is searchable. Because it is in Evernote all of it is backed up to a cloud location frequently. None of it replaces good writing, of course. Its just methodology. The plot and story arcs are in my head. If the sheet of chapters and the synopsis isn\u2019t enough to re-invoke all of that I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a bad sign for the book overall. If I had that problem, I\u2019d just write smaller. Smaller in the sense of creating a much less complex plot or story line. If I can\u2019t keep it in my head then how can I expect my readers to? edit: I understand Michener would use notecards and lay them out as he needed to to organize the story. ",
