Maybe it's hereditary  Me: *Googles 'Is being savage hereditary?\u2019 and gets no proper result* So maybe not. Or maybe he understands that it doesn't matter if he is savage or not, so he can do whatever he likes.  What's the harm in being a bit savage and sassy for fun? After all, ARMYs love savage-Suga-quick-witted-sass because it's quite chucklesome        Or the Internet won't be filled with these. Sometimes he's straightforward and savage.   Never thought savage people can give you the best medicine (Laughter is the best medicine) I'll say being savage is a talent and Yoongi is a genius for coming up with sassy answers so quickly. Maybe his brain is wired differently. But being savage is just one side of Yoongi. Let us not forget that he's thoughtful    Well, this is still a bit savage. And sometimes sweet and babyish.   Weird   No matter what, he really deserves our love because not many celebs will do this  Wipe your tears. Whatever, he's still S to the A to the V to the AGE.

Yoongi can be so very, very endearing, especially when he\u2019s with the members, but he has an utterly wicked, natural sarcasm and dry whit which, personally, I love. My favourite comedians are the same - dry, sarcastic and forcing an emotionless front. We all know that Suga cares very deeply. As one of the older members, he has that sharpness that some maturer audiences understand which gives him the \u201csavage\u201d concept, just for his comments or behaviours. Like, throwing a present at Namjoon and speeding away. Hilarious! The real Savage King is the one who does this\u2026  Mic down, smirk set and lights flashing behind him. This is where I bow to the savagery. There were rumours that BTS lip synced so, of course, how do you prove that that isn\u2019t true? You stop rapping in the middle of a live performance and smirk at the camera, saying everything without uttering a word. I adore this man! TTFN! ",
