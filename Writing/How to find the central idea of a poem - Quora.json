            "answer_text": "Consider the title - it may give it all away in an instant, it often does. Examples would be Wordsworth\u2019s, \u2018Composed upon Westminster Bridge\u2019, which is a sonnet meditation on the splendour of London town and the Thames flowing through it. Just a snippet: \u2018This City now doth, like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning\u2026\u2019. And this also works for lyrics (sung poetry), eg \u2018A Red, Red Rose\u2019 by Robbie Burns. Just a snippet: \u2018As fair art thou, my bonnie lass, So deep in luve am I.\u2019 Of course we must first grasp the simile - the girl in question and and the new beauty of the rose are directly equated. Consider the first line - as in prose, it is often best to state the topic up front. Again from Burns: \u2018O my Luve's like a red, red rose, That\u2019s newly sprung in June;\u2019. And a great favorite: \u2018She walked in beauty like the night, of cloudy climes and starry skies\u2026\u2019, Keats. But both the title and the first line may play us false if we are overly hasty and overly literal. The title and first line of \u2018The Sun Rising\u2019, by John Donne - \u2018Busy old fool, unruly sun, Why dost thou thus, Through windows, and through curtains call on us?\u2019 Is not about the sun, it is about the intrusion onto the bliss of two lovers, woken up in bed by the early sun blinding in through the window. The poem runs on: \u2018She's all states, and all princes, I, Nothing else is. Princes do but play us; compared to this, All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy. Thou, sun, art half as happy as we\u2026\u2019. The Sun is personified in a metaphysical one-sided conversation, but the poem is all about their relationship. Then there is the omnific poem (as I call it), where we must consider the poem, the whole poem, and nothing but the poem. (That is, no silly cherry-picking from his autobiography to invent a meaning or theme.) The only way to capture the fish is to spread you net as wide and deep as possible, and many times at that. So, here is a great favourite by e. e. cummings, who would have been great friends with Douglas Adams, if only they had met. anyone lived in a pretty how town anyone lived in a pretty how town\u00a0(with up so floating many bells down)\u00a0spring summer autumn winter\u00a0he sang his didn\u2019t he danced his did.
