            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Marcin Calak, but I'm not an editor by trade, see. I picked it up in film school and have edited a number of short films/trailers as well as worked for a while as an assistant editor so I'll give my point of view based on that. Editing takes up a lot of time. It's a lot of watching through the same sequence of clips again and again, adjusting and re-adjusting until it gets somewhere favourable. And then you move on for a bit before you find yourself at the same scene to make more changes. It's a lot of nitpicking and a lot of going back and forth trying out how something looks before you scrap everything and start all over again. It also requires you to be very organised, keeping in mind that there are multiple people involved at different stages of editing, and at any point of time the work has to be easily transferrable or easily picked up by someone else. It also makes you realise how finicky everything is, and although some things don't make sense to you, solutions are solutions and you'll find yourself going back to them whenever you need. You also realise that the majority of people troubleshooting due to software issues span from very experienced to new editors and it's quite humbling to see the community work together and help each other out. You'll be surprised how things turn out if you just dare to cut things a different way. You'd be surprised at the kind of effect that can have on the story, emotional release, and audience. Editing can be crazily creative, potentially beautiful, and very intuitive. It's music. ",

            "answer_text": "Its a very beautiful feeling in my sense. Because when we see a beautiful song or a movie then we think that how an editor of this movie has done all that. When you will become an editor then only you will be able to feel what is like to be a film editor. You love the silver screen. You go and watch your favorite movie with your friends. You love it. Then imagine if you have gone to watch a movie that you have edited then think how would you feel on that particular occasion? You will go crazy my friend, it happens to me alot. You watch a movie. You find it boring and you commented that this movie should be make in another way. But when you will listen to these comments on your own edited movie then you will be able to feel how is it like to be an editor. Your favorite movie\u2019s trailer has been released. You liked it. You didn\u2019t get what the movie is about and suddenly you decided to watch that movie. Now imagine if that editor is you and you have edited that trailer then your work is done if you have convinced the audience to watch the movie. This is what you will feel like to be an editor. I hope it explains everything! ",
