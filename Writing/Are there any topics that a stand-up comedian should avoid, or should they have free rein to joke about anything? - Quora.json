            "answer_text": "A comedian should be able to say anything as long as they make it funny. If you can\u2019t make something funny to most people most of the time, then it\u2019s not comedy. It might be interesting and worthwhile, but it\u2019s not comedy. I just came from a show where I disclosed my childhood sexual assault, and got good laughs. There are a few reasons I chose to do this, and a few reasons why it got laughs. First of all I was not getting paid, I was trying new material at an open mic night where none of the audience had paid to get in, so fuck them if they didn\u2019t like it. Secondly, I\u2019m a very experienced comedian, professional for over twenty years. Thirdly, I\u2019ve done a lot of work healing my trauma, it was obvious I was okay about it, but also obvious enough that I was telling the truth. I did the jokes because first of all, I thought they were funny, which is the main reason any comedian tells a joke. Secondly, not talking about this stuff nearly killed me and has killed a lot of other people. If I had seen someone ten years ago who had worked through their trauma to the point of being able to joke about it, I would have had a lot more hope for the future. However, if I had talked about it and the audience didn\u2019t believe me, they wouldn\u2019t have laughed, they would have (quite rightly) thought I was an arsehole. I made an assessment that the audience as a whole would be able to cope with me disclosing, and I was right tonight, but as a comedian working with problematic themes I don\u2019t always. Comedy is not easy, and difficult topics are even harder, I couldn\u2019t have done the material I did tonight ten, or even five years ago. I don\u2019t always push the boundaries, when I\u2019m getting paid to do a show for people who\u2019ve paid for a nice night out, I give them what they expect from a comedian. I regularly do clean shows for old people and children, and have fun doing them. I get paid more for those shows. However, when I know I\u2019m performing in a venue for adults who expect something edgy, I swear and talk about sex and religion and death and trauma because these are the things where the laughs are the biggest and most uncontrollable. We laugh because we know we\u2019re going to die. I\u2019ve met and worked with older comedians who were arrested and put in prison for talking about these things, so when appropriate I use the freedoms they suffered to earn for everyone who came after them. There are many different types of comedian, they work in many different societies, they find different things funny. If you are a comedian who fits in to the society you live in, that society will reward you. If you are a comedian who questions the society you live in and makes people within that society uncomfortable, be prepared to make do on very little money. I respect comedians who talk about \u201csafe\u201d, \u201cfriendly\u201d, non controversial things, not everyone wants risky comedy and it\u2019s still really hard to be funny, no matter what you\u2019re talking about. Some comedians who push boundaries and do interesting, artistically difficult material are real arseholes to deal with. So I guess what sort of material any given comedian does depends on what sort of career they want to have. If they are always crossing boundaries, being inappropriate, saying difficult things they\u2019ll have an interesting colourful artistic career like my friend Jon, who\u2019s currently broke after being banned from many clubs and a couple of countries. If they don\u2019t swear or be controversial they might end up being the most beloved and wealthy comedian in the world, like Bill Cosby, who was an inspiration to me as a kid. I loved watching Jon and Cosby, but I know who I\u2019d rather have a drink with after the show. ",

Once a comedian has become a brand, and an entire TV network is associated with that brand, they have to become more PC and not offend any sponsor or organized group. Lenny Bruce is one thing and Steven Colbert is another. You see less people today like Lenny Bruce and more who have their own TV show. It used to be that there were this list of prohibited words George CArlin insisted on using and then it became minority groups you could not make jokes about and now the only thing a comedian cannot say is he likes TRump.

That\u2019s it - plain and simple. On a personal level, it\u2019s up to you to decide what you don\u2019t want to talk about. As a Christian, I never made fun of God or Jesus, but I made fun of Christians all the time. That is where my personal line was drawn. For other comedians, I think they should be able to make fun of God, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad or any other religious figure or follower if they want to. It may make me or other religious people uncomfortable but a lot of times that\u2019s where the comedy is found: in the uncomfortable. To reiterate, there is no topic that should be off-limits for comics to address, though some may personally choose areas they don\u2019t want to touch. ",

It is very difficult to fake a sense of humor As a comedy scriptwriter I have had several films banned for reasons that were unpredictable to me at the time One because it showed a person unsuccessfully attempting to commit suicide in \u2018funny\u2019 waysOne because it had Napoleon blowing up (by chance it happened to coincide with a French terrorist group that I had never heard of)One because it appeared to be \u2018anti-feminist\u2019Two because they showed a cartoon man having sexual fantasies (both contravened newly made laws related to video censorship, and not because of the subject matter) They were later used on TV to show the how pointless censorship isAnd one banned in Russia because it had Mr Kruschev bouncing on a trampoline I am personally against all forms of censorshipThis is not because I am totally open minded, or have no moral compass, but because allowing sick jokes is better than allowing sick actions If someone finds it funny to joke about another persons misfortune, religion, beliefs, looks, mistakes, etc. then it brings it into the open, and allows others to retaliate in kindIf those misplaced attitudes are hidden then they will surface in other ways that may be more unacceptable In answer to the questionIf a Stand-up comedian chooses to use material that in any way denigrates others, then it is usually because the humor is in the publicly saying something that few would say in public, as against the \u2018joke\u2019 being funny It is interesting to note that studies of language show how the more one uses swear words, the less impact they haveWe are now at the point where we have virtually no swear words that carry any weight The same goes for jokes about religion, disabled people, old people, ethnic groups, etc. We have heard them all, and they are no longer daring to say in public, so they either have to actually be funny or to be an unspoken truth A study of Humor itself will show how jokes have changed over time.In WW2 it was common to have comedy shows about the Military. There are few today. Humor is fashionable, and quickly goes out of date. Over the last fifty years we have seen the rise of Women stand up comedians, but more, we have seen Stand up comedians from ethnic groups and even religious groups that have only recently found a voice Whenever I meet someone new from a country I haven\u2019t visited, my first question is \u201cTell me a joke that only has meaning in your country\u201d ",

As they learn there is inevitably either alienation or mediocrity as they become too comfortable on either side of the line. This becomes less frequent or less pronounced with experience. With this in mind, everything can be in limits; but day-to-day it depends. ",
