            "answer_text": "The correct choice would be \u201cWas it hard to get used to it? or better stated \u201cWas it hard getting accustomed to it?\u201d Generally, when dealing with a question I prefer to translate it to a statement. \u2026 makes things easier that way. So you have, \u201cIt was hard getting used to it. From this little change in wording you can see that getting used to it must be present tense. (You would never say Gotting used to it so, it follows that you also would not say \u201c\u2026 hard to got used to it.\u201d ) In the sentence, It was hard to get used to it, the word, was, means that the getting used to it happened in the past. But, in the past when the getting used to something was happening, at that moment it was happening in present time. Also note the words, to get, which is the infinitive form of the word, get. The infinitive form which is used for definitions can only be in present tense, never in past tense. The word, to, must always be followed by a present tense verb. ",

            "answer_text": "To Przemek Zarobnik, \u201cWas it hard to get used to it?\u201d is correct, because the infinitive is formed by \u201cto\u201d plus the base form of the verb, not the past tense. Therefore \u201cWas it hard to got used to it?\u201d is incorrect. The use of \u201cwas\u201d is correct. \u2014Sarah M., posted 16 April 2019  QUESTION: Which one is correct? \u201cWas it hard to get used to it?\u201d or \u201cWas it hard to got used to it?\u201d Should I use the past tense after \u201cwas\u201d in this case or not?
