            "answer_text": "Sell a lot of books. That number might be spread over several titles, but as long as you are selling enough books, you can bring in a decent income. Many self-published writers who are bringing in five- and six-figure incomes generally have more than seven books on the market. This is a lot of work on your part, as writing a book isn\u2019t easy. The more you buckle down and work at it, the more reward you will see when you finish.Get a movie option on your book. An option is someone is paying you to not sell the movie rights to someone else for a period of time. It takes time to convince a studio and/or investors to back a movie idea. So they pay you to sit on it while they try to raise the money needed to actually produce the movie. When the option expires, you can sell another option to the same people or to another production group. Or, if the producers succeed in gaining financial support, this could lead to\u2026A movie deal\u2014this is when they are actually going to start production on turning your book into a movie. If this happens, your ship has pretty much come in. This could result in enough money that you could potentially live the rest of your life without lifting a finger to work ever again\u2014assuming you are good at budgeting yourself. Honestly, it really depends on who is making the offer and how much they think they can make.I strongly urge you to get a good agent who is familiar with Hollywood business practices to represent you if someone makes an offer for an option or a deal. They will have your back and make sure you get the best deal possible. The better you do, the better they\u2019ll do. Hollywood has a well-earned and nasty reputation for cheating people out of their just due.If you are looking at a large check coming at you, I strongly urge you to consult with a Certified Public Accountant on how best to set your finances. This could save you thousands in taxes.A TV deal. Just as with movies, television studios can option or offer a deal for your book. Popular TV series could also extend to movies as well if a series proves to be popular.Appearances. When authors appear in public for fan conventions like Comic-Con, they are paid to be there. Entertainment talk shows do pay their guests, based on minimums set by the Screen Actors\u2019 Guild. If you are really famous or they really want you on the show, they\u2019ll pay more. At the very least, they should cover your travel costs. If you are a good speaker, affable, funny or entertaining, you can expect to be in demand for appearances. Doing an appearance is part of your job as an author, you should be paid for it. How much depends on how much you are in demand. You should set a rate for an appearance. You don\u2019t have to charge it if you are doing it for charity. But you can then write off that time on your taxes as a charitable donation. Appearances are pretty much a second income for authors that fills in the gaps between books.Have Oprah Winfrey comment that she read and enjoyed your book and her fans will flock to the bookstores to buy your book. She has probably created more over-night millionaires than any other person in history.Hone your craft as a writer. Don\u2019t just spit out words. Question yourself on the results of your work. Could you have done better? Could you have crafted the story in a way that there was more of a message to it than just the telling of a tale? If you want to be an author, you should approach it like a professional and be professional at it. Learn about the publishing industry and how it works. The better you understand this, the easier it will be for you and those people who work with you.",

            "answer_text": "I am surprised by the cynicism in most of the answers here. I\u2019ve made a lot of money writing books, and I personally know dozens of authors who make a living writing. The secret is simple. Treat it like a job. Don\u2019t expect success immediately. One of my good friends who is now definitely in the \u201crich\u201d category is Brandon Sanderson. He sold his 6th book, and at the time he was writing his 13th. And he writes big, thick 400,000-word books. If you\u2019re unclear what I mean, he wrote a book, then tried to sell it, then wrote another and tried to sell it, and wrote another\u2026 on and on until his sixth book finally sold\u2014and at that point he had 13 manuscripts under his belt. Orson Scott Card famously said \u201cYour first million words are crap.\u201d I don\u2019t know if I believe that is the magic number, but the spirit of the quote is true: you start out writing crap\u2014everybody does\u2014and then after you\u2019ve put in lots and lots of work, you get better. And eventually you\u2019ll get published. One of the things that I think hurts writers now is the ability to self-publish: I think people that aren\u2019t dogged in their determination to be published fall into the trap of thinking \u201cthis is good enough. I should self-publish it.\u201d Because the truth is that you CAN be published by a Big-Five publisher. And you CAN make a living at writing. And you CAN be rich. You just have to put in the time, sweat, and work. Follow Publisher\u2019s Marketplace. They announce the sale of debut authors\u2019 books every single day. It happens. And it can happen to you. It is not a matter of luck; it is a matter of effort and time. ",

            "answer_text": "No magic formula. Need talent. Luck. Drive. Output. Quality. Connections. And more. Certainly, there are examples of authors who became spectacularly rich. It is a bit of a feast or famine market. Most writers don\u2019t make much. Not a lucrative field in general. But it certainly is possible to at least do well; and becoming rich is always in play. The better question, in my mind, is \u201cWHY DO YOU WANT TO BE RICH?\u201d And more importantly \u201cWHY DO YOU WANT TO USE WRITING AS A PLATFORM TO BECOME RICH?\u201d I mention this because I think you have a better chance of becoming rich if you just give up that as a goal. That\u2019s just my view on it. But I don\u2019t think Stephen King wrote \u201cCarrie\u201d when he was starting out, or \u201cThe Shining\u201d because he thought he was going to be raking in the dough. Rather, he just had a passion for horror novels. He confronted his demons on the page. He had his own struggles with alcoholism, like Jack Torrance, and, my guess is, his family was driving him a bit nuts. Throw in that he visited a creepy hotel\u2014and you can see how he got inspired to write it. How writing it, perhaps, maybe even exorcised some of his demons. He ended up being spectaculary rich and already has more than enough money to get by for the rest of his days. But he still puts out around a book a year. Why? He is not writing FOR the money. It is an ANCILLARY BENEFIT. In my mind, you are better writing for THE PASSION. Writing to do it. To express it. Like a songbird singing. Like a beaver making his dam. You do it because it is in you. The odds of becoming rich are low, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best goal. And, besides, better than the riches, for some, at least, is the process, is actually saying what you wanted to say, is telling your story, is being the writer and creating other worlds with your imagination.

The point of being rich doing that depends upon consistency, determination and most importantly passion. From the question it seems like you are more into being rich. It is great and quite positive but, why to correlate it with Writing? Because you like to write. May be it's quite free flowing for you. May be you consider your paper having more patience than people and that's why you want to write inspite of indulging into other things. If this is the case then passion should be/is there and if you have passion then surely you'll figure out how to make it into a financial transformation. Resoluteness and patience will be like the shooting stars that will bring fortune gradually. It won't matter because you are passionate. May be for few days or months or even years, you won't be super rich( that you are pondering) but there would be writing. But, if being rich is the most paramount thing and you are just using writing as a bait then definitely it's not going to bring enough money but a morsel of bread might be possible. ",

For that, you need to employ other writers to do all the work for you, but you will (legally) take all the credit. Consider this article about James Patterson, whose books are seen in the image above. He makes an awful lot of money by hiring struggling writers (presumably under a work-for-hire contract) to write chapters of his drafts for him: Genius Factories Past and Present  (The rest of the story is at the link.) So, there will come a time when you, or another struggling writer, will get published, and you will have to make sure that you have other writers working for you under similar constraints\u2014they do the work, you pay them, but that work is yours and you get the credit.

About the only category of writing where you are guaranteed to be able to make a living (not get rich) is technical writer and advertising agency writing, and in the case of the second, you really have to know someone to get a job in an ad agency these days. So far as fiction writing goes, the people here blowing smoke up your ass will now have to contend with the facts, that a very recent study of writers proves that most writers make less than minimum wage.

Unfortunately, because I\u2019d love to retire all other efforts and pursue my writing career, the last time I checked it was more likely to become a professional football player (in either of the sports people refer to as football). Even becoming a full time writer is hard work. I still have hope though (despite the occasional accusation of delusion). There is probably a reason why the \u201cstarving artist\u201d image is so popular. As to how to succeed and become super rich by being a writer? Write an insanely good book, and send it to everyone. Here\u2019s to hoping! I hope this helps. ",
