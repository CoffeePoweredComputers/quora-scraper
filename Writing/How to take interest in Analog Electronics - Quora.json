            "answer_text": "See if you are really interested in analog electronics, then the best way is to do it practically. Buy the necessary equipment for making electronics like bread board, analog ICs, capacitors, resistors, some tools and many more and try to make something that can benefit you. For example, if your friends are always busy on their cell phones, (which has now become a disease and sorry if your are addicted too), and you don\u2019t like it, make a phone jammer. It will not alow anybody to use their phone. Or if you have habit of locking your room and listening to songs on your head phones, make a door knock sensor so that you can see whenever someone knocks the door. Doing all this will not only build your interest in electronics but also will make your life simpler and then progressing in it will certainly make you one of the best electronics hobbyist. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a different take on this. Buy some data books from companies like National Semiconductor and if you can lay your hands on any application books. These data books will generally contain all technical data on each IC and will also have some typical applications. Just scan these books and go for something that piques your interest. You may want to read up and study some basic electronics and how discrete devices behave. ",

Never ignore these three. Then sources DC and AC voltage and current. It's actions wit RLC. Then generation, motors and transformers. Even if your interest is electronics learn the basics of Electricals. About conductors, insulators etc. Then Power supplies, opamps. Whenever there is a down come to components and power sources. Read old history of electricity as a story reader. Will be very useful. Work practically with power supplies to start. ",

It will help you understand the drawbacks of Digital Electronics and why after everything being managed digitally there is a need of Analog electronics. There are field of study where digital electronics can only take you to a particular level of precision. Take an example of Acoustics or Imaging where knowledge of Analogue Electronics allows you to make elegant solutions. Any Digital circuit always follows rules of analog electronics. ",
