            "answer_text": "The easiest way for a skilled writer to remove plagiarized content from his work is simply to rewrite the concept in his own words. For example: Plagiarized material: The Mandingo tribe had been regarded as fierce warriors for more than a century, and all who engaged them in conflict suffered for the effort. Rewritten material: Few tribes who went up against the conflict-hardened Mandingo over the years emerged victorious. The rewritten sentence doesn\u2019t have EXACTLY the same meaning as the original, but it\u2019s close enough to drive home the point and still avoid accusations of plagiarism. It\u2019s called researching and writing. Remember: Concepts and information can\u2019t be copyrighted; only style and form can be. Change the style and form of a writer\u2019s original work while keeping the concepts and information intact, and you\u2019re home free. A less simple approach (unless you hate rewriting) is simply to source the material with references or citations. It often takes more time and energy to unearth the original and create an appropriate citation than it does to rewrite the material, but referencing is certainly a legitimate means of avoiding legal action down the line. Either way, you can\u2019t go wrong. Just remember: Cite it or rewrite it! By the way, concepts and information can\u2019t be copyrighted because they have been critical to humankind\u2019s development over the eons. Without it, homo sapiens as a species would have died out long ago. We need to be able to communicate information between people in order to learn and grow, which is why information itself is always free to be replicated\u2014but only in the writer\u2019s own style and format. Got it? Good. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "You have two options. The first is to identify the plagiarised text and delete it. This may, of course, render the document unintelligible or (particularly if you\u2019re dealing with something you\u2019re intending to submit for educational purposes) too short. The second is to identify the plagiarised text and add sources appropriately. This will be easier if you wrote the document yourself and kept a record of your sources. ",
