            "answer_text": "I just got a job rejection a couple hours ago.  I had gone 3 rounds with the company and sincerely felt like it would have been a great fit -- a place where my ideas would have been respected and my hard work rewarded.  I've been looking for a new job in a new city for a couple of months now. Striking out always feels like shit.   In this case, I responded to their rejection, which was very kindly worded (\"we think you're a high caliber candidate, very intelligent, etc. etc.\") as these things generally are, within 20 minutes of receiving the email.  I told them I was disappointed but appreciated the opportunity to meet their senior mgmt and learn about their company. I also sent them (in addition to a long list of references from past employers that I had previously sent and samples of my Quora answers that have been published on Forbes, Slate, etc.) a list of questions / ideas for their company to show that I had been genuinely intrigued and enthusiastic about their business model and the ways in which I might have made an impact. One thing I didn't address that I believe would also help would be listing what you felt were your mistakes or weaknesses (on CV or otherwise) during this interview process and how you would plan to shore up those faults in the future if given more time and a second chance. Below is my \"thank you letter\" in its entirety:  M_____, I'm disappointed but very much appreciated the opportunity to meet with all of you.  Attached are some brief notes I jotted down a few days ago on the off chance that any of it is of interest in the future (text is also pasted below for ease of reference).   If things change, definitely let me know. Best,Dave Future Questions / Notes for AI: Ask re: possibility of price discrimination / tiered service (has it ever been tested in past?  In what ways and what were the results?  Do competitors do it?  How do our costs differ for different industries & types of products?) Given that more and more companies, from airlines to amusement parks, have tiered levels of service these days; perhaps it\u2019s time to to think about this and consider test marketing some forms of it: The Extra Legroom Society  \u201cCause\u201d philanthropy marketingMy previous employer had some success marketing charity-related items (e.g., Hurricane leatherbound book where part of proceeds go to disaster relief; 9/11 Commemoratives where part of proceeds go to victims\u2019 families, etc.) Increasingly, consumers want products and services that make them feel good and express themselves by helping others (see Lemonade Stand for-profit company article below) Benefits: positive marketing for AI brand / corporate imageclients may be willing to pay a premium such that our profit exceeds charitable donationmay attract new clientsRisks:  Need to stay away from any hint of politics (no disaster relief for man-made disasters; nothing that could be seen as supporting OR being against CCP) or religion; need to steer clear of controversy --  this means we may be limited to timely events (i.e., wait for a disaster to happen (e.g., recent typhoon in Phillipines?) before we can do the marketing and set up the donations)Could be seen as manipulative/exploitative; need to be transparent about who the charity goes to and how muchComplicates our marketing message; makes us seem unfocused on core competenciesIn a Lemonade Stand, a Transformation of the Corporation\u201cIf you look at the company\u2019s website or product, there is no doubt that the charitable mission is the sales pitch. Make a Stand may be selling delicious lemonade, but the hook to getting people to buy it and setting the company apart is the worthy cause.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "A handwritten thank you note is a great idea (and certainly good manners), but I'm not convinced that it will cause someone to think of you when there is another opening at the company.  I recommend that you send the note and then count this person as one of your contacts going forward.  As with all professional contacts, you want to continue to remind this person that you are still there (hi!) and keep your great skill set, experience, and education at the front of her mind. Some ways you can follow-up to build that relationship: reach out if you see an article that may be of interest to the field, the company, or the individual; connect with the person on LinkedIn and ask him or her to introduce you to others; ask thoughtful questions and seek advice on your job search; and continue to use your good manners and ask after the person's work, family, and community activities. Because very few people are truly good at the follow-up aspect of networking, if you can use these tools to create a relationship out of this experience, you may  just end up with a job offer! ",
