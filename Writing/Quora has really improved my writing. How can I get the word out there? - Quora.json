            "answer_text": "Same here! I\u2019ve been participating here since 2012. I never did it for the upvotes, followers or recognition. I simply did it because I enjoy writing and reading and because I wanted to improve my English. As it happened to you, I used to receive edits and suggestions, which I always appreciated wholeheartedly. Over time, the edits diminished as my writing improved. When I compare my current answers to those I posted in the beginning, I see a lot of difference. I am now more succinct and clear. The cherry on the cake was when I got my Top Quora Writer quill in March. Completely unexpected! So I encourage everyone to write here. Do not be afraid or shy. Do not think about popularity or recognition. Write with your heart and don\u2019t be afraid of making mistakes. Share your answers on Facebook or other social media. Tell your friends, spread the word. The Quora community is quite forgiving with non-native English speakers. Just do your best and you\u2019ll see how much your writing improves day by day. I also participate in Quora Spanish and, every day, someone comes up apologizing for their bad Spanish. I feel I have a debt with this community and I always welcome them wholeheartedly. ",

            "answer_text": "You can probably write a blog on Quora on how the community and Quora together helped you improve on your writing skills and add the link on your bio. That way, whoever visits your profile, follows and/or subscribes to you can get a good glimpse of your experience and even seek inspiration! They will also continue to get updates when you post anything new which a good means of promoting your work.  P.S. Glad to know that Quora has helped you positively. I feel that the purpose of establishing it has now come in full circle for the founders as this must've been their motive - help people learn as much as possible. It would be great to see you share your story and spread the inspiration among the community. Good luck! ",
