            "answer_text": "As with any mode, it needs to be established in the bass primarily, in context with the melody and inner voices. The best way to learn how modes work is with two hands on a keyboard, or by playing a bass part separately against a scale or melody. Simply playing the Mixolydian mode, or any mode, in a scalar step-wise fashion will not result in their characteristic sound. The main characteristic of Mixolydian is the minor v chord and major VII chord. The characteristic sound of Dorian is the ii-V, which is also the v-I of Mixolydian but you won\u2019t necessarily realize those relationships playing modes as scales. They have to be anchored harmonically and/or intervalicly. Those particular relationships exist across all the modes and will sound the same without context in the bass. Playing all the white keys on the piano and playing G octaves in the bass is Mixolydian. Playing all the white keys on the piano and playing F octaves in the bass is Lydian, and so on. Certain modes require more harmonic context than others, namely Dorian and Mixolydian, which interestingly contain the ii-V vice-versa: a D minor chord is the v chord in Mixolydian and the i chord in Dorian, which function as a cadence, or \u2018pseudocadence\u201d if you will. All the other modes sound like themselves without harmonic context like Ionian (plain vanilla major), Phrygian (with what we know commonly as a \u201cSpanish\u201d feel, or even Moorish), and to some degree Aeolian (natural minor). Pure Aeolian has a minor v as well which gives it darker sound rather than the harmonically-adjusted V7. In sum. certain modes require more harmonic context than others. With Mixolydian you\u2019ll want to focus on the v-I or VII-I with a v in the mix. Dorian and Mixolydian are two of the more popular modes, I think for the reasons I\u2019ve stated. They tend to be interchangeable by shifting what the bass is doing. ",
