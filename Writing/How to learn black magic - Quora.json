            "answer_text": "First off it is a misconception that magic has any colors. For quite some time people have associated magic that is used to help others with white magic and magic that is used to help oneself with black magic. However I believe that no one helps anyone unless there is something to be gained by doing so, even if it is just simply a feeling of gratitude. Therefor if one must associate magic with a color than all magic is black magic. Now when it comes to magic one can probably find a bunch of books at the local library or bookstore that contain spells and conjurations that call for various items that are next to impossible to obtain, spells and conjurations that are said to work best under different phases of the moon. These books call upon external spirits, Gods and Goddesses that are supposed to magically appear to do thy bidding. These books are nonsense and should be skipped over. A great starting point to look for magic that works, magic that taps into that energy within you, magic that doesn't require anything more than a strong will for change, would be in The Satanic Bible. This book will give you a more realistic approach to magic, defining such in terms of greater and lesser magic instead of in terms of black and white. From here you should be able to further your reading with other such books by Anton Szandor LaVey as well as other authors that have more of a firm grasp as to what it means to be a master of the magical arts. Hope this answer helps. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no difference between black or white magic, there is no colour to magic. Saying you practice white magic just makes people more accepting of you. For reasons in our psyche we assume black magic is bad and evil. It isn't, practitioners of \u201cwhite\u201d magic still do things for gain. Maybe not gold or things like that but a thank you is still gain. There are many books out there that you can buy but usually they are a waste of money, they are conjecture and just plain rubbish most of the time. I was told a long time ago , to buy these books and read them, then discount 90% of what they said, at most only 10% would be accurate. The Satanic Bible is a good starting point, hope this helps ",
