            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. It is actually \u201cuttering\u201d or \u201cforgery\u201d, two separate English common law offenses. Uttering actually means \u201cpublication\u201d. I have always wondered why \u2018uttering\u2019 was used as a word denoting a crime, it doesn\u2019t sound too criminal. Uttering was different than forgery in that you uttered a false or forged document when you passed it off as real with the intent to defraud. Forgery is the making of or creation of a false document to make it appear as though it was the real deal with the intent to defraud. Penal statutes have replaced common law crimes and I doubt that any of them now contain the word \u201cuttering\u201d, they are covered under once offense - forgery. In summary, you uttered when you tried to pass a fake document [that you did not create] off on someone with the intent to defraud them. If you actually made the false document yourself, whether you used it to defraud someone or sold or gave it to someone else so that they could defraud someone, you committed forgery. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to read the current statute in your jurisdiction. It might be that passing a bad check (giving it to another person) is the \u201cuttering\u201d part, but the statute will have other elements. That is, you may be guilty of \u201cuttering\u201d if you signed the check, or stole the blank, or provided the pen to the person who signed the check. The question is impossible to answer in the abstract; you have to read the relevant statute. ",
