            "answer_text": "Research papers can be a pain. I wrote a couple of research papers for school and it can be a long and dull process. Here are some things that helped me personally: Staying consistent on a schedule.Try to schedule a specific set time, date and place when you will definitely make some progress on the paper no matter what. Choose a time that is when you are least likely to be interrupted. I personally did most of my work either late at night or early morning. Mid-day is when distractions starts to happen. If you have a deadline, let that be a motivator for you as well !Create an outline. Have a rough idea of how the research paper will appear. For example, I start with drafting up an outline and brainstorming ideas of what will go into: introduction, body and conclusionTake it one step at a time. Start with one section first. Remember that a research paper is not something that will be finished immediately. It can take a few days or sometimes weeks depending on your schedule and deadline. Keep in mind that as long as you are making progress, you are getting somewhere. Start with the easiest component to research. I usually start writing up the body first and save introduction and conclusion for last since it will be easier to summarize.Take regular 15\u201330 minute breaks every 1\u20132 hours. Get your body moving! No, don\u2019t reach for the phone but take a walk, get up for water or healthy snacks, stretch or any other physical movement! This will refresh the brain and body especially after sitting for such a long periodKeep distractions away especially your phone! This one applies to almost everything in life when we try to focus or stay motivated on a task. Do whatever it takes to keep the phone or other things from distracting you. Find a quiet place and place your phone on silent from notifications and at a distance from you. Refuse to look at it until you have reached a certain amount of progress in your paperBonus: find help from others. This is optional and probably the last resort but you can ask a friend or classmate for help on finding additional resources for your paper. Teamwork helps a lot sometimes.Hope some of these tips helped! Best of luck! You can do it!!! ",

            "answer_text": "There are different ways to motivate yourself to write up your research work, and the most effective way would depend on your personality. I\u2019ll also assume that the person asking the question is a PhD student, or an undergraduate who wants to apply to PhD programs in the future. The desire to graduate: You won\u2019t graduate with a PhD until you publish your work in peer-reviewed journals.The desire to see the realization and culmination of all your effort: Research is hard, and you\u2019ve probably spent months or years collecting and analyzing data, checking your hypotheses, etc. All of that work is useless until it is published and shared with the world. People don\u2019t usually like wasting effort, so this can be good motivation.For me, the paper allows me to close research projects. I can happily say that I am done with that problem once it is published, and then move on to the next thing.To see your name in print in an academic journal: It\u2019s a great feeling to see your name in print\u2014to see the culmination of all the work you\u2019ve put in.Improves your future employment options in research-oriented jobs and graduate school applications: Journal papers are a great way to show employers that you are able to do original research, and this can open the door for interesting jobs. If you\u2019re an undergraduate student, then the paper will definitely help you with graduate school applications.The feeling of helping humanity progress due to your intellectual contributions: A good journal paper is a novel intellectual contribution to our species\u2019 knowledge-base, and the feeling of contributing can be a motivator.A combination of all of these factors should provide the required motivation, and if it doesn\u2019t, then you probably aren\u2019t cut out to be a researcher.

Several Nobel laureates\u2019 advice to those who are about to enter the research field : Go into science if you are curious and have passion for it. If not, find something else! If you are curious and passionate about science, you don\u2019t need separate modes of motivation in the first place. Your mind will have those special characters that will have you in their tight grip. If you are not curious and passionate, even though you get motivation from outside or from your own tutored self, research will be substandard and you lose interest very soon. ",
