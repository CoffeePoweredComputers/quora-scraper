            "answer_text": "Have you been checked by a doctor for ADD attention deficit disorder? If a person can\u2019t keep their attention for long on anything it might appear they lose interest in things too easily. Another loss of interest can be a sign of depression so you may want to be checked for that as well. Another thing that affects ones attention is too much sugar in the diet My husbands daughter from a previous marriage was going to a Montessori school back east. As parents viewing the class rooms in session, they were surprised to find second graders busily focused on their work, without even one daydreaming or acting up or doing something else. The staff told them they would have to agree to give their child no sugar at all. That was the policy and that was why the kids were so focused and didn\u2019t lose interest or attention at all. They said they would know if a kid got some sugar the night before because it affected them the next day at school. Yes, I said the next day, not just hours later. So if you go as sugar free as possible, that includes diet sugars, and you see improvement, great, if not, you really should see your doctor. ",
