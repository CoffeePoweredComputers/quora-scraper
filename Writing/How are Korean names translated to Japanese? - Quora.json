            "answer_text": "Basically phonetically, but with some quirks such as \"li\" often being changed to \"i\" for some reason (Update: Philip Newton has kindly explained this in the comments).Korean names are usually written in katakana in Japanese - they are sometimes also written in their original Chinese characters, but these are still read with the (Japanese phonetic approximation of) their Korean reading, as opposed to the Japanese reading (which is used for Chinese names). For example, the common surname \"Kim\" is written, in Korean, with the Chinese character \u91d1. The Japanese reading of the character would be \"Kin\", but as a Korean name it's pronounced \u30ad\u30e0 (\"Kimu\") in Japanese, in a rather unsuccessful attempt to mimic the original sound. Kim Il-Sung, for example, is famous enough that his name is usually written in Chinese characters (\u91d1\u65e5\u6210) and people will still know how to read it (\u30ad\u30e0\u30fb\u30a4\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3, \"Kimu-iruson\"), but for lesser-known Kims, and most other names, katakana are generally used in order to make the pronunciation obvious.
