            "answer_text": "It really depends on the age and capabilities of the child. A child of four/five years of age can write in sentences (some even tidily) however some cannot. My daughter at 6 isn\u2019t writing anything as yet. To prepare a child to learn to write they firstly have to have fine motor control and strength in their hands so playdough/clay/practising (playing) with small toys and larger ones\u2026 throwing a ball for instance, is all preparation.

            "answer_text": "So much depends on the development of the child. Some are early readers and writers and some are slower to get started. However my experience has been that writing sentences should go hand in hand with learning to read. Not only does is cement in the skills that are being learned in reading but it improves reading skills too. ",
