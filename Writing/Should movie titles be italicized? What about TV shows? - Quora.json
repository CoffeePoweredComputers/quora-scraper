            "answer_text": "TV shows - italics (Game of Thrones) - this is true even when you\u2019re using the show as an adjective to describe its fans (what kind of fans? Game of Thrones fans) Full-length books, or series of books - italics (A Song of Ice and Fire); the same is true for book-length collections of different writings, whether by one or multiple authors (Dangerous Visions, edited by Harlan Ellison; The Norton Anthology of English Literature; The Complete Edgar Allan Poe) Book-length single poems - italics (Beowulf; Pearl) Full-length plays, movies, and musicals - italics (Romeo and Juliet; West Side Story; The Lion King) Single poems shorter than book-length - quotation marks (\u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d) Short stories, newspaper articles, magazine articles, blog post titles, essays - quotation marks (\u201cThe Ransom of Red Chief\u201d) One episode of a TV show - quotation marks (the Star Trek episode \u201cEncounter at Farpoint\u201d) Name of a newspaper or magazine - italics (The New York Times; People) I\u2019ve honestly seen blog titles go both ways if you\u2019re talking about the whole blog. There are some that would seem really pretentious if you put them in italics, so you can just rewrite the sentence to skip the title. (The doctor who blogs under the pseudonym \u201cDoc Bastard\u201d has gone on record in favor of vaccinations\u2026.) For vlogs or other YouTube channels, I don\u2019t think most people will care whether you put the channel title in italics, as long as you put the episode title in quotation marks and italicize anything in that title that needs it. (CinemaSins, in \u201cEverything Wrong With Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones,\u201d claimed\u2026) This is how most styles will do it in most cases for US English. Commonwealth English may have differences. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question I had to deal with in Writing my book, Making Documentary Films and Videos. As a matter of style, I decided:  To treat film titles the same as book titles and italicize them.To treat the names of TV series the same as the names of magazines and italicize them.To treat the titles of individual episodes of a TV series the same as stories or articles in a magazine and place them in quotes.A film, such as Man on Wire, is italicized. A series, such as Nova, is italicized. A single episode from the series Nova, such as \"The Sinking City of Venice,\" is placed in quotation marks. It's not perfect, but it's consistent. ",
