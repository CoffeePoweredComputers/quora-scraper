            "answer_text": "Assuming that you read widely, pay attention to how other writers describe faces. For example, when I tried my hand at screenwriting, I watched the first ten minutes of a hundred films to see how directors/screenwriters set up their films in the opening scenes. Then I studied transitions from scene to scene. Faces, like snowflakes and fingerprints, are unique\u2026 but they also share characteristics. To reproduce the unique features of your characters means seeing them very clearly in your head. I know a novelist who would cut out from magazines pictures of faces for each of her characters and tape them to the wall above her writing desk. The details would then be constantly fresh and consistent throughout the book. Warning: There is one danger in studying other writers\u2019 descriptions of faces. One time when I was first starting out I liked a description so much that I \u201cborrowed\u201d it. This is called plagiarism and is forbidden in writing. The story was published, but I felt guilty forever after, and used to worry that someone might read that short passage and say, \u201cHey, seems like I read something like that in Hesse\u2019s Demian\u2026 Yeah, I just read that again last week.\u201d O.K., I took it from a far more obscure source, but t was one of the classics and I am ashamed ever since. Which is actually a good thing. One of the ways to avoid becoming guilty of writing in cliches is to actually look with your own eyes and learn how to see faces as they are, and practice finding new ways to capture what you see. Write on! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on how you want to approach the matter of his/her face. You can either explain it all at once, say your protagonist was close to his/her face and noticed it all at once, or you can mention it over the span of a few pages, as though your protagonist wasn't studying their face but merely glancing to it. While describing consider comparing things like their eyes to the ocean or their smile to the sunshine (okay, I know those were cheesy, but that's all I could come up with at the moment) Include nose shapes and whether or not they have wrinkles or freckles, maybe even acne. The shape of their face can vary and change a persons imagined picture of them drastically, so adding that would be a good idea. And even their hairline, say they had a high forehead or a low forehead, it would be good to write about that as well. ",
