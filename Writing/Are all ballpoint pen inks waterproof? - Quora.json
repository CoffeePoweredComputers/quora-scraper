            "answer_text": "At least since L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00edr\u00f3 invented the ballpoint in the 1930s, a \u201cballpoint pen\u201d has referred to a device that uses a viscous, quick-drying, waterproof ink fed onto paper by a rough rolling ball. In my experience, if it has a water-soluble ink then the device is a \u201crollerball\u201d pen. It features a smoother, easier writing experience but the ink isn\u2019t waterproof, no matter how long it\u2019s been dry. In my opinion, the supreme writing experience with water soluble ink is with a fountain pen. Rollerball disposable pens and refills expend quickly \u2014 usually just when you need them. Then you have to throw them away. The short lifespan makes them contribute more than their share to the world\u2019s landfill and discarded plastic problem. ",
