            "answer_text": "This is a great question, but hardly an easy one to answer. And I think every person who answers it will have a different response to it, but here is how I would describe my leadership skills: VISION:  The first relevant skill to leadership is vision, being able to see beyond the present moment, into the future, or into the potential future you would like to create.  This takes creativity, wisdom, out-of-the-box thinking, and an understanding of cause and effect, as well as knowledge of the end result of where you want to go. Without this, there is no leadership. CONTEXT:  The second component to my leadership skills is context. This is a way of being, a way of presenting yourself and your ideas that can be heard by others. Context is how you show up in the world (either consciously or unconsciously) but a true leader is able to control this context, and shift it at will and as needed. Context enables you to win the hearts of the people that you are leading so that they are as inspired to be a part of your vision as you are to create it. DELEGATION:  delegation is the next piece. Delegation is the ability to inspire others to follow your vision, and carry your context as if it was their own. Relegation is a side trait of delegation that is more involved with babysitting someone to make sure they follow every step that you have laid out as if they were a robot. Relegation does not result in good leading, or good following. Just following orders\u2026 On the other hand proper delegation where the followers are inspired, and feel that they are a crucial contribution to the big picture is key to good leadership. When your followers work with you, rather than against you\u2026 Building your vision as if it was their own\u2026 Then you are truly leading. COMPASSION/HUMILITY:  compassion and humility, although not exactly the same thing are related at this level of leadership. You must have compassion, understand the hearts, goals, and struggles of those that you are leading\u2026 And the humility to put yourself on their level as often as possible.  I was once at on event for over 100 people, and the man who was leading the event stood at the back of the food line and waited until every man had been served. When I asked him why, he explained that in battles, the general would always eat last\u2026 The soldiers needed the food more than he did since they were going to be fighting on the front lines. It was his job to make sure that all of those working for him and fighting for him were taken care of in body mind and spirit. To me that is compassion and humility combined in a beautiful way. I have always followed that model whenever possible in my life, and have found that it leads to great results. CLARITY:  being clear about your ideas, and being able to communicate your vision, your context, your directives and your desired results in an effective  and clear way is crucial to leadership. This requires an understanding about the deeper components of what you are trying to express, as well as the ability to express them in a simple, clear and focused way that can be understood by all. Leaders who are distracted in their explanations, or all over the place in their communication , rarely result in being strong leaders with a strong vision. The ability to communicate and express yourself in a focused and deeply understandable way is integral to proper leadership.   SYSTEMS:  The final piece, in my opinion of my leadership skills is the ability to create and implement systems that allow leadership to be effortless. In my opinion, a good leader is able to hand off his leadership to another person seamlessly. In order to do that properly and effectively, systems must be built that can be handed down along with the position. These can be systems about how to prepare or manage events, how to delegate, hiring employees, payscales, reports, or even assisting in the creation of new positions, new ideas, new products or intended future results.  By creating systems, rather than leaving things up to chance you make the process of leadership simpler, and enable another person to step into your shoes and easily pick up from where you left off, complete your vision, and deliver the results that  you set forth in the past well into the future. Steve Jobs was a great example of creating systems. That is why Tim Cook was able to step into his shoes and so seamlessly and effortlessly lead a company as complicated and powerful as Apple without many stumbles. The systems allowed the transition of power to be clean, The vision was already laid out into the future, and Tim Cook was able to gradually bring his own style of leadership, focus, intentions, and vision into the fold without having to reinvent the wheel. People at Apple know how they are expected to behave, perform, create, communicate and inspire and they do it without even thinking about it because the systems were set into place long before they started working there. Putting all these pieces together is the best way that I can describe my leadership skills\u2026 Vision, context, delegation, compassion/humility, clarity, and systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Business gets done in person. I enjoy meeting people face to face to discuss various issues or concerns they have. Seeing a person\u2019s face oftentimes convey to me their true feelings about a particular decision I have made. If something I have done upset them, I think it is only proper that I apologize to them face to face & allow them to see the sincerity upon mine.Mean what I say & say what I mean. If something such as an idea sucks or if a person\u2019s skills or capabilities is not up to the mark, you better say so at the beginning, before any undertaking or project has started. If I make a promise, I will always try to keep it. Credibility & Reputation are 2 very important things in life.If you care about someone, let them know. Don\u2019t care about people from afar, send them a text or message them, asking them directly how is their day & if you can help them in anything; and actually help them.Within reasonable limits, always give people want they want & soon they will give you what you want.The Leader must identify problems effectively. He must be honest to himself & the ones he is leading. He must call bullshit for what it is & take action to remedial whatever problems the organization is facing.Delegate jobs effectively to train the juniors. I see this each time juniors enter the ward. The Ward Leader must always give them the easiest task to perform, following its completion, praise them & allow them to graduate to more difficult tasks (a leader should use words effectively to reward & encourage); while at the same time, the Leader must always take on the most difficult tasks.The Leader must come at a moment\u2019s notice. Emergency rears it\u2019s head at the most unexpected of time. Only by coming when no one else will, your followers will know that you are reliable.The Leader must be up at night generating ideas & thinking about them. In a gridlock or a moment during a meeting when everything is stuck, the burden of the Leader is to be the tiebreaker. I believe that in all that an organization does, there must be a direction to which we are heading.Sometimes, when a task is particularly important, I would micromanage. Simply put, it is to my best understanding that a Leader has to follow up / spot check with the progress of any particular project because the ultimate responsibility lies unto the Leader to get things done.Finally, the vision is an important element of being a Leader. Putting the vision above oneself is something a Leader must do. Only when your followers appreciate your tenacity & passion, will they follow the Leader. When the going gets tough, the Leader gets going!",
