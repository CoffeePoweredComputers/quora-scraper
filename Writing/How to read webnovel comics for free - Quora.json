But, usually it\u2019s in violation of US copyright laws (which is why such websites are usually located in other countries). You can find them if you look. Whether or not you should look for places that are illegally profiting from someone else\u2019s work is another question. OTOH, it\u2019s not up to you to look out for the copyrights of others, and the sites are going to be there whether you look or not, as long as the comics companies (and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re aware of these sites) do nothing about it.
