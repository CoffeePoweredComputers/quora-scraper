            "answer_text": "\"Why are writers so good at writing?\" I think you mean: \"How do writers get so good at writing?\" The main reasons that actual writing original content - fiction or non-fiction - is often underrated and the effort underestimated, is because 'everybody can write'. Which is a fallacy similar to \"I got a driving license, so I should be able to compete in Le Mans\" or \"I can cut a steak, I think I should become a neurosurgeon\". Just because you got an A on an essay in school doesn't mean you can write a novel. Writing is talent mixed with dedication, persistence, humility and fortitude: The basic talent is your imagination and storytelling ability, but that won't carry you through the draft. You need to allocate dedicated writing time. You need to persist in using this allocated time for writing only, and you have to do that day in, day out. You need humility to learn from the feedback you get. People will try not to 'hurt' you, so they will often give vague feedback packaged in compliments, but you have to humbly show your will to learn from your mistakes and your desire to improve, so that people will realise that you need their feedback. It takes courage to tell someone that their work needs improvement, the least you can do to ease the pressure by showing egoless acceptance of criticism. And then you need fortitude, because you will find many people around you who would love to derail you. Some because they were unable to bring their own authorship to fruition, others because they think you don't write well, others because they dislike your happiness at finding something you love. You say, \"I have been writing for two years and still I am really bad. What am I doing wrong?\" Probably nothing much. You've been training for two years. If you had been training in aikido, you would be nowhere yet after two years. And, believe me, writing is way more difficult than aikido. The thing is, you think you had a headstart because you learned how to put words into sentences. That mechanical bit is pretty much the least important part of writing. Do you know how to tell a story so that readers feel engaged to the story? Can you bring your characters to life? Can you simplify complex matters? Can you write an argument on a topic where you care only about one side and have to step outside your comfort zone to write the other side of the argument? Do you take your writing seriously? Have you set time aside purely for writing? Have you sought feedback from more experienced writers (instead of subjectively labelling your writing 'bad')? Can you put your ego aside to listen to constructive criticism? Can you keep the skeptics at bay and believe in yourself? Develop the stamina to go in for the long haul. Don't look at the years you spent, look at the years you will be spending to become the writer you want to be. ",

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time there was a man named Josiah Franklin who had a precocious young son named Ben. Ben was a smarty pants for sure, Josiah knew this, but the problem was Ben wasn't a great writer.   One day Ben showed a fight he'd been having with a friend via letters to his father, and explained that even though he knew that all of his facts were correct, and his reasoning was sound, his friend always came off sounding more compelling. Josiah explained to little Ben that while this was all true, what Ben lacked, and his friend didn't, was style.  So what did little Ben do? He found himself a copy of a publication known as The Spectator and methodically took notes for each sentence contained within each article. With these notes he tried to capture the essential meaning of the sentence, eg: \"Thomas would send his friend letters until the day they both simultaneously, by sheer coincidence, died.\" Gets turned into: Some guy named Thomas sent his friend letters a lot then they both died on the same day which was, like, super weird. Then Ben would go and do something else for a while. Maybe invent electricity or ride on eagles or drink tea or something. After a few days he'd come back and rewrite the notes he'd taken back into an article and then compare what he'd written to the original.  By doing this he was able to not only practice, but also compare the quality of his own writing and monitor its change by using the feedback of the comparison.  He then started using this method on his own work. Quite literally writing out essays and then turning them into notes, and then rewriting them again using his notes.   This is a very different method from just non-stop writing all the time and hoping one gets better. Ben was able to create a value system, and a way to accurately monitor his progress and then tweak his efforts as he practiced.  When I was younger I did something similar: I would read a book and then attempt to write something that would appear to be written by that particular writer. I actually once wrote an entire novel using the narrator from Youth In Revolt as a joke.  You can't just write and hope you'll improve, you have to write deliberately, not mindlessly. I know plenty of prolific writers who are terrible and never get better, because they've only ever practiced at writing prolifically, instead of writing well.   Try copying out articles or stories with styles you enjoy and try using one of the aforementioned methods. Trust me, it's fun and you'll improve a lot and very quickly.  I would also purchase a copy of The Elements of Style. It can guide you in cultivating your own unique voice.  ",
