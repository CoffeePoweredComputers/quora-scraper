            "answer_text": "I would say it is worth it if you are passionate about seeing them in-person and enjoying their music. Personally even i went through same dilemma of spending $350 dollars on their concert. I was planning to attend BTS concert for a while now and they are coming to California, the state where i live right now. So, i thought why not have a trial and get a ticket. It was very hard decision at first, because i was also swinging between \u201cDO IT \u201c OR \u201cDON\u2019T\u201d feeling. But, later i thought i have been waiting for this opportunity from past 3 years and this will continue if i don\u2019t do it right now. This is my wish from the bucket list, so i thought NOW or NEVER, so i signed up for it. Now the concert is on April 25th at 7.30 PM. BTW i\u2019m a recent grad and still looking for job, the money i spent was hard earned so, no regrets. Money once spent can be earned anytime later. As long as you are spending (Money that you have earned through hard work) for your own well and check boxing few things from your bucket list should be ok. And if you love to attend their concert and it is something you are crazy about just do it! don\u2019t weigh it against money or ask anyone else. Life is short! It\u2019s not only about BTS concert, but in general. So decide wisely and Best of luck! ",
