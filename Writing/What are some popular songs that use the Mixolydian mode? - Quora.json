            "answer_text": "Blues tunes are famous for using the Mixolydian mode. Whether the player is theory minded or a self-taught player, the Mixolydian mode is the go-to chord. The I, IB, V chord progression uses a Mixolydian mode for each of the I, IV, and V chords. The Mixolydian mode is the fifth mode of the major it is derived from. For example, the C major scale provides the G7 of the Mixolydian mode. The F major scale provides the C7 of the Mixolydian mode. The G major provides the D7 of the Mixolydian mode. If you line up the chords I, IV, V in a progression It looks like this. I G7, IV C7 and, V D7 Each of the chords has its own Mixolydian mode. Jazz, country, rock, fusion and even classical music all use the Mixolydian mode. Why? Because the Mixolydian mode can stand alone or it can be used in many different situations. The function of the Mixolydian chord (mode) is to create action and resolution. When a Mixolydian chord (mode) moves into an Ionian based chord, The energy of the Mixolydian chord releases its energy into the one chord of its origin and the one chord of a major scale creates stability and rest. Mixolydian based chords are dominant chords and that is where their strength lies! I hope this makes sense! ",
