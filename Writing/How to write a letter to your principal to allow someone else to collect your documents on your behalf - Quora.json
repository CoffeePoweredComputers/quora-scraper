Please accept this letter as my authorisation (authorization in US English) for (name of person) to collect (correspondence, forms, documents \u2026 whatever) on my behalf. I can be contacted on (telephone number and whenever if relevant - eg during business hours) to confirm or clarify these instructions. Yours sincerely (faithfully, truly or kindly as appropriate and depending upon whether you have met them, know them etc. - look up on internet for normal rules of correspondence for your country). (Your Name) (Your signature - this is important) (The document should be properly addressed and dated. You may want to specify whether this is a one time only event, or a continuing arrangement. You may want to add a date beneath your signature. If the collection is related to legal documents you may need this to be witnessed, or signed by a Justice of the Peace, or notary, or some such depending upon your jurisdiction.) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d frame the letter as more of a legal document on the order of notarized letter \u2026. Example: \u201cI, Joseph Smith, hereby appoint Mary Smith, my spouse, to pick up or receive, any and all documents on my behalf from the Carswell School, effective April 12, 2018. By signing this letter (witness my original personal signature below), you are being relieved of any legal liability for release of documents to someone other than myself.\u201d BY Joseph Smith Date April 11, 2018 NOTARY signature Date Now, be aware I am NOT an attorney. However, the intent is to remove any legal liability from attaching to the school or person releasing the documents to someone other than you. This should get the job done. You may even eliminate the hassle of a Notary; that extra step means you have to appear before a Notary and sign the document in their presence. Certainly there are other formats that might be used. You might even ask if THEY have their own form. I have used a similar format, without a problem, to pick up medical documents from a hospital on behalf of myself or my wife. Hospitals are very reluctant to turn loose of records due to HIPPA requirements. ",
