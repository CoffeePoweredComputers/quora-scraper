            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by Arabic. Briefly, Arabic is of three types: 1) Dialects such as Egyptian, Syrian, Moroccan, Palestinian, Iraqi, etc. All of these are similar and others can be very different, sometimes even a different language quite literally. This is what you should learn if you want to learn to speak to Arabs, order a shawarma in Arabic, or creep people out in the Arab world. 2) Modern Standard Arabic is a formal, watered down version of Classical Arabic used in newspapers, radio, politics, etc. You should learn this if you want to work in government, politics, business, etc. 3) Classical Arabic is the source of both MSA and the different dialects. It is a highly structured grammatical language. Much of it was derived and codified from the Qur'an and Poetry. You should learn this if you want to understand the Qur'an, read poetry, see how much of Urdu actually comes from Arabic (you'll be very surprised!) If you want to learn dialects, watch movies (there are a ton in Egyptian Arabic) or listen to news in Arabic. You can also learn the Egyptian and Levantine dialect from the Alkitaab book series. Don't focus too much on reading and writing, speaking is your priority here. If you want to learn Modern Standard Arabic, Alkitaab is also a good place to start. Rosetta Stone is alright, however you won't be able to learn grammar very well. There are good courses on Duolingo and Memrise that are worth checking out too. Your priority should be balancing speaking and reading and writing. Excellent way to enjoy learning this is by watching entertaining Arabic cartoons. If you want to learn Classical Arabic, now you're talking. Since you know Urdu, you are already familiar with a lot of letters and words (though the meanings can often be very different!). You should first begin by formally studying grammar and morphology (best resource right now is Page on www.bayyinah.tv). Then start watching serials such as OMAR series or even any good cartoons in Modern Standard Arabic.  Learning Arabic will open your eyes to the roots of the Urdu language and how it developed. My recommendation is to learn Classical Arabic first to get a solid understanding of grammar and morphology. Even most Arabs around the world don't have this. This knowledge will be the key to unlocking Classical Arabic texts, poetry, rhetoric, and so much more. Starting at the top of the pyramid, Modern Standard Arabic has a dumbed down version of grammar so you'll be way ahead of the game. You will pick up vocabulary fast. Learning dialects is literally a joke after Classical Arabic.  I wish you luck in your journey in Arabic! Source: native speaker of Urdu, studied Classical Arabic at Bayyinah Institute ",

I'm sorry that Duolingo don't do Arabic yet, otherwise I would have recommended it, since I'm currently using it to improve my Spanish. In the UK I was unable to find many books on learning Arabic but since I live in France I was able to learn it from French. However, a few years ago I visited Egypt and I discovered that they had plenty of books available for learning Arabic. ",

Unless you have concrete plans to live in the Arab speaking world, or work with Arab companies, it's not necessarily the best language to learn.  If you're just learning for religious / liturgical purposes, focus your attention to Classical Arabic, which is very different from the varieties actually spoken across the Arab world. ",
