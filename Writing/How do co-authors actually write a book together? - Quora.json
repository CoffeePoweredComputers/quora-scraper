            "answer_text": "However they choose. I\u2019ve collaborated with at least six different co-authors, and all six worked differently. For one, we had a storyline we were following that we had agreed on at a cocktail party; the story was written as a series of letters, notices, news clippings, and so on. My collaborator wrote everything that was from the villain\u2019s point of view (at least, I thought she was the villain), and I wrote everybody else \u2014 which wasn\u2019t that much more, because her character had a habit of killing my characters. I\u2019d write a piece and send it to her, she\u2019d reply, I\u2019d respond to that, and so on, until we finished the story we\u2019d started with. For a short story I co-wrote with my wife, I was writing it and every time I\u2019d get stuck I\u2019d call to her, \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d and she\u2019d tell me. She didn\u2019t actually write anything. For one novel, my collaborator and I plotted it out sitting in my living room, with him providing most of the plot. I wrote the first draft, and he revised it. For another novel, we each had a list of things we wanted to include. We got together over lunch and worked up a rough outline, which I then wrote up in detail, and split into forty-two scenes (which did not match up to chapters). We then took turns choosing which scenes we wanted to write until we each had twenty-one of them. She wound up with the first two or three, so she wrote the opening, then sent it to me, I wrote my scene(s) and sent it back, and so on, until we got to the end. We would throw in little surprises along the way, things that weren\u2019t in the outline, that the other then had to work with. It was an immense amount of fun. When we had a complete first draft we discussed some revisions (which were pretty extensive; some scenes had wound up out of order somehow), then I wrote the second draft, she wrote the third, and voila. For yet another novel, my collaborator had come up with the novel, written about two-thirds of it, then decided that he had no idea how to end it and it wasn\u2019t working anyway, so I took over and rewrote the entire thing, which meant throwing out large chunks of what he\u2019d written. The ending was entirely mine. And for a short story, I\u2019d written a short-short and mentioned it to my collaborator; he asked to see it, I sent it, he suggested some revisions, I made them, he suggested more, and it went back and forth until we were both satisfied with it, whereupon I sold both our collaboration and the original short-short I\u2019d written solo \u2014 they had wound up different enough to be sold as two separate stories. So \u2014 lots of methods. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an old article of mine. Conquering Collaboration - Moviegoers Want What Kids Love and Hollywood Often Ignores Them by Skip Press As a writer in Hollywood, I am constantly reminded of certain phrases: Writing is the loneliest profession. We\u2019re looking for an original voice. Written by. Here\u2019s the Hollywood translation: It\u2019s hard to write something that sells. You only know it\u2019s marketable when it\u2019s bought. No matter how good your sold script is, you\u2019ll be very lucky to get sole credit. Some other things I wonder about: Is that ink on those pages, or my blood? Do expensive classes and workshops really help, or does playing the lottery make more sense? If it\u2019s so hard to find good scripts, why do they make so many crappy movies? That last one answers itself, and since obviously neither you nor I write bad scripts, let\u2019s move on. Here\u2019s a question I get a lot - How do they adjudicate the final credits on a show or movie, anyway? For the answer, go to the Writers Guild of America site at Writers Guild America West and look up their \u201cCredits Survival Guide\u201d for a full explanation of the credits process in the U.S. I get hundreds, even over 1,000 emails a week. Inevitably, each writer inquiry boils down to the same desire: the sharing of information for a more desirable result. Collaboration. It\u2019s the lifeblood of Tinseltown. If you can\u2019t collaborate well, stay away from Hollywood. Film, television and gaming are the most collaborative of all the arts and always changing. This makes for a neurotic business environment that can literally drive you crazy. Unfortunately, many aspiring screenwriters don\u2019t realize the scope of collaboration and craziness necessary to get a film, show or game to market. They also often under-estimate the sophistication of today\u2019s media audiences. Having a co\u2013writer might be your first best choice on the road to being an experienced collaborator. When another person catches a plot hole in your script it helps you understand the ultimate end recipient \u2013 the audience. It\u2019s easy to complain about the latest \u201cpiece of trash\u201d you saw at the local cineplex and think you can do better. What you might not know is that most independent films that don\u2019t get distributed do not start with a good screenplay. Hollywood executives know it. That\u2019s why the credits of your favorite Hollywood blockbuster often have at least two credited writers and more uncredited; the executives hedge their bets by hiring the best writers available to cover all aspects of the story. On my Yahoo! discussion group, \u201cSkip\u2019s Hollywood Hangout,\u201d professional writers, students, and filmmakers from all over the world collaborate daily. People offer notes on others\u2019 scripts and loglines, share contact information, and participate in polls. Some members have tried working together, so maybe that\u2019s why in the fall of 2003 I was asked for advice on co-writing. Since I was working out a screenplay with an English writer at the time, the collaborative process seemed an appropriate subject for a Scriptwriter column. Interestingly enough, the feature scripts I\u2019ve sold were both co-written. In contrast, with one exception the scripts, treatments, short stories and novels of mine that have been optioned were my sole creation. A radio script and several TV scripts I wrote had other writers after I sold them. I had to fight for credit on the last two TV shows I wrote, the only time I\u2019ve had to do so, but on a show where I was a staff writer the producer and I had almost no disagreements at all. In my experience, the good outweighs the bad. On another project, a best-selling \u201chow-to\u201d video, I received collaboration from my co-producer and others who did not want a writer credit. From working with co\u2013writers new to Hollywood to being mistreated by a Hollywood jerk, I\u2019ve seen it all in the collaborative process. So let me share that with you. Let\u2019s start with the types of collaboration that can take place and problems that might arise. (a) Working with a co-writer who is more experienced than you. If you\u2019re not a professional writer (someone who has been paid for your work) and you\u2019re lucky enough to hook up with a pro screenwriter, do more listening than talking when the discussion is about the structure of the movie. If you\u2019re discussing story only, that doesn\u2019t change much, medium to medium. A good story can come from anywhere. It usually takes a professional approach to sell it, though. A pro will likely know tricks of the trade that you cannot intuit. For example, William Goldman wrote about writing a \u201cblueprint\u201d script to sell to a studio and then, once he had a deal, writing the script he really wanted. Unfortunately, he probably couldn\u2019t get away with that today. Studio executives expect you to turn in the story that has been discussed. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019d better have something that\u2019s a lot better (which may be how Goldman got away with it). (b) Working with a writer less experienced than yourself who writes in stone. By \u201cin stone\u201d I mean they think all the precious words they conjure are inviolate and must never be changed. If you are the recipient of such insistence, you must learn patience, even when explaining what may seem to you to be the most mundane facts. In the case of both of the features I sold, I had to deal with what I call \u201cone baby syndrome.\u201d When a parent has only one child, they take it much more seriously when the child has an injury or any other kind of hurt. In families with many children, bloody noses are relatively normal occurrences and not seen as life or death matters. It\u2019s not always easy to convince inexperienced co-writers why it makes sense to cut a scene or a character. The first time I took on a writing partner, we worked out the story together and he drafted the script from our outline. I was busy putting up a play and didn\u2019t have the writing time. The first draft was 30 pages too long and contained oddities like a page and a half soliloquy from a minor villain. It took me around an hour of enduring rolled eyes, yawns, face stretches, and chain-smoked cigarettes (his, not mine) to convince my co\u2013writer that speech wouldn\u2019t work and didn\u2019t matter. I explained to him the old Harry Cohn (head of Columbia Studios in its heyday) \u201cbutt twitch\u201d method. When Cohn was watching a screening and his butt twitched, he knew something in that part of the movie needed changing because he was bored and shifting in his seat. We finally achieved a balance on the screenplay, but only after several rewrites and a determination that he owned 60% and I owned 40%. As I recall, it took us a decade to sell that screenplay. I put the final polish on it alone, and my co-writer got it to a producer friend who sold it. (This after I arranged a previous option to a friend of mine.) (c) Writing with a writer less experienced than yourself who is too blinded by their own ego to see what works and what doesn\u2019t. I was once paid to polish up a novel a rich attorney had been unable to sell but was convinced had great movie potential. (I didn\u2019t see the movie potential but I took the job.) He then got it published, and wrote another novel on his own. He couldn\u2019t get that one published either, so I offered some suggestions and introduced him to a publisher who published an electronic novel. The attorney has been unable to sell anything else, and doesn\u2019t understand why \u2013 his ego won\u2019t let him. As a ghostwriter, I wrote a book for a woman who saw visions and had delusions. She wouldn\u2019t listen to me about certain market-based suggestions. I was paid for the book, but I left her to her own marketing. She couldn\u2019t sell the flawed product she insisted on. In contrast, I was paid to write a book for a sensible fellow who would listen to all my suggestions and choose the ones that made sense to him. His book went to #1 in its category on Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more. Some people have to learn to be flexible. When I was starting out, I sold a show to a kids\u2019 TV series. The \u201cshow runners\u201d rewrote my script instead of letting me do it, due to time constrictions of taping. I didn\u2019t understand the process and was upset that my \u201cprecious words\u201d were being changed. And that\u2019s the only script I wrote for that show. I didn\u2019t know then that whatever medium you work in, someone will always have suggestions. Even if you are an \u201cA list Hollywood screenwriter\u201d this is true. If you\u2019re working with someone more experienced you must realize they may have a practical reason for certain opinions. Just make sure they are explained to you. If you\u2019re working with someone less experienced, you will probably get to a point where you\u2019ll have to deal with ego problems they may have. In that case, you must deal with it completely, or find another co-writer. (d) Writing with a writer, director or producer who is greedy if not downright evil. I once wrote a script with a fellow who convinced me that he could get the financing to make a low budget comedy. He was a fast-talking salesman and, I unfortunately only later learned, a con artist. After I put together a best-selling golf video, the producer who promised to finance it cut me out as a writer and refused to give me a credit. Only after I threatened a lawsuit did I get a paid settlement. He later lost his producing partner over such hijinks. A few years ago, a wealthy but neophyte producer paid a good bit of money to option one of my screenplays. Since she could finance the film, I introduced her to a director who had continually espoused great love for my script but never seemed to be able to put up any money to option it. Next thing I knew, my \u201cbaby\u201d producer had been talked into letting the director rewrite the script. Luckily, the project fell apart, and I got the rights back. Concurrently, the same director hired me to write a couple TV show episodes (for non-union prices at a time when I needed the money) once he heard about the possibility of my movie getting financed. Again, only after threatening a lawsuit with the show\u2019s distributor did I get a writing credit, and then less than what I deserved. I learned to avoid this type of situation by paying more attention to money and contracts. If someone offers you no money but promises you the moon, and/or if they won\u2019t put a deal in writing, avoid them at all costs or pay a heavy price later. (e) The wonderful land of \u201cnotes.\u201d Recently, I was in a meeting at Disney Studios courtesy of Gary Shusett and Sherwood Oaks Experimental College (see www.sherwoodoakscollege.com ). I speak at Gary\u2019s events on occasion and other times I\u2019m simply in the audience because Sherwood Oaks offers access to top Hollywood executives like no other organization in the world. At the meeting, the Director of the Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group explained how The Princess Bride went from a novel by an unknown writer to a G-rated box office bonanza. He also related how a co-writing team who didn\u2019t like the \u201cnotes\u201d they got from Disney cancelled their script option and failed to set up the project elsewhere as they thought they would easily do. (There\u2019s that ego thing again.) \u201cSo what kind of writers do you like to work with?\u201d asked one of the assembled aspiring writers. \u201cAudrey Wells,\u201d he replied. (Look her up on IMDb: Ratings, Reviews, and Where to Watch the Best Movies & TV Shows, you might be impressed.) Apparently, when given ideas to work with, Ms. Wells would regularly come back with great improvements on the executive notes. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not a writer!\u201d the executive exclaimed to the pleasantly surprised writers. \u201cWe can only come up with some ideas. When a writer can greatly improve them and make us excited, that\u2019s what we want.\u201d And that\u2019s about what it all boils down to, isn\u2019t it? The quality of the product is really all that matters. At the top level of a major Hollywood studio, an executive revealed that yes, they really do want quality at every step of the process. With The Princess Diaries, he had at first been reluctant to read yet another book (by a then unknown writer) about a girl who becomes a princess. Producer Debra Martin Chase convinced him. After reading the book \u2013 which is really about a girl who has an opportunity to become a princess but doesn\u2019t want it \u2013 he drove to his boss\u2019s house at 10:00 at night and insisted she read it. She stayed up late reading it, and they bought the book immediately. And that\u2019s the kind of thing that happens when a great story comes along, whether it\u2019s a sole creation or the product of a team. If I had to offer one rule in working with a co\u2013writer or in collaborating on any project, it would be another old phrase \u2013 honesty is the best policy. If you\u2019ve ever done a reading of a play or a screenplay that you\u2019ve written, you\u2019ve no doubt experienced surprise when laughs came at places you didn\u2019t expect, and didn\u2019t come when you anticipated them. You\u2019ve found that speeches that looked so good on the page didn\u2019t flow like hot honey out of your actors\u2019 mouths. And so you learned to collaborate, which is only done effectively when everyone is honest about the process. These days, as I work out the story of a new screenplay with my English co-writer (a novelist of some note who has proven to me that she is also a competent screenwriter) I offer my thoughts without consideration because I know I am working with a professional. She does the same. We are both experienced enough with readers and viewers to know when something works and when it does not. Ego doesn\u2019t matter, only the work itself. In getting to a sale, or to a completed production, successful writers remember the end recipient, that person in the dark who needs a lift, a thrill, or a laugh. It is never about the writer, only about the writing. The play is still the thing, and I hope you write great ones, alone or together. I hope I get to collaborate with you \u2013 from the audience.
