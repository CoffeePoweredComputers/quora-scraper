            "answer_text": "When I started freelancing in 1970, I used Writer\u2019s Market. It\u2019s still a good source. I picked business periodicals since they were hungrier than consumer pubs  for stories, and you could churn out a story a day. 10 cents a word,  1000 words=$100. If you\u2019re interested in those markets, pick an industry you know, read their trade journals, and query them. Here\u2019s a tip: What questions can you pluck from the trades articles(e.g., specialty, gross sales, location types, etc.) and write them in a little book. Then, every interview ask all those questions. Pretty soon you can expand your questions to fit many industries and markets. Today, of course, the internet has the most info, so hone your research skills by searching. Most of all, write. ",
