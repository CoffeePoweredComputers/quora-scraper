            "answer_text": "Yes. If you are very fearful and feel unsafe, I would go to the emergency room at your local hoapital and tell the doctor you are contemplating suicide and do not feel safe. They will admit you to the psychiatric unit of the hospital where you will receive care from staff nurses, doctors, and Psychiatrists. If you are experiencing depression or anxiety that is causing you to feel this way, you may be prescribed an antidepressant. Have you ever felt this way before? It is very scary when you get to the point of taking your own life. I have been in your shoes several times. And when I was at the point of following through, I went to the hospital for help. I had staff checking on me every 10 minutes until they felt it was safe to have half hour checks. I had good doctors, nurses, and other people that were in there for the same reason to talk with. It says a lot for you to reach out for help and want to talk about your suicidal thoughts. That tells me that you are fearful of dying and you have a reason to live. As bad as life can seem, there is always a reason to keep on fighting. I have used my family as my reason to hold on and struggle through the hard times. My mother would be devastated. My sibling would be crushed. And my 5 year old niece would not understand why her aunt died at her own hands. I can't do that to them. My sad and hopeless feelings do not outweigh the torment and anguish that my family would feel for many years to follow. You are welcome to inbox me anytime. I will chat with you. Do not give up on life. We are only here but once, and there are many things we overlook each day and take for granted that are beautiful and can bring us joy. Hang on. \u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "People are so ridiculous when they say \u201ccontact the suicide prevention number\u201d because they don\u2019t feel like taking the short time themselves to talk to someone in despair. I\u2019ve been suicidal myself and called that number, it was answered by some woman who didn\u2019t seem to really care what I had to say and sounded like she was reading from a script numbly. I don\u2019t know you or what you\u2019re going through, but I understand the pain. The pain of not wanting to wake up. Everyday is a struggle. I hope you find someone you can sit and talk to in person. It sounds like you would benefit from a hug and talk. I myself didn\u2019t have anyone to go to, so if you want to talk you can message me.
