            "answer_text": "I want to be a journalist for a variety of reasons: I love interviewing people. I participate in a program called National History Day, where students create projects about historical events, and analyze them using different historical perspectives. Students are encouraged to conduct interviews with experts and/or participants in the event for their projects, in order to truly understand the event. Despite being a very reserved and quiet person most of the time, as I've interviewed people for National History Day over the past five years, I've realized that I actually really enjoy doing interviews. I love hearing why and how people do things, and I love getting to know strangers by asking them questions about themselves and how they think.I am passionate about knowledge and the truth. I believe that knowledge is power, and thus the people must have knowledge in order to have the power the Constitution grants them (in the U.S.). I want to help give the people that power by providing them with accurate information that is as unbiased as possible, so that they can think for themselves and be empowered.Journalism could help me see the world. I've lived in the same small town my whole life, and while it is fairly diverse compared to other small towns, it is still very small (like I-personally-know-three-quarters-of-the-store-owners-small) and a lot of people live here their whole lives. I have heard many of the stories of the people here, and as a journalist I want to hear the stories of more people: politicians, public figures, artists, and of course, teachers, mechanics, soldiers, and other everyday people. I want to travel and experience life with different types of people. I hope I get to do that as a journalist.I love writing. Plain and simple. Ever since I was a child, I've wanted to be a writer. For the longest time, I wanted to write fictional stories, but a couple of years ago I realized that real life can be just as, if not more, interesting.There are plenty of other reasons someone might want to be a journalist, these are just my reasons. Hope this answers your question :) ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of a desk job (as in a standard desk job, roll in at 9, punch out at 5) has never appealed to me. I\u2019ve always been a description/language/visual oriented person (as opposed to being mathematically or scientifically minded). I did very well in English, and loved learning and speaking French. Oddly, I quite enjoyed physics even though I hated and wasn\u2019t particularly gifted with maths. And I think that\u2019s because I like to know how and why things are the way they are. Physics is a tool for understanding the actual world around us, physical and natural forces etc. Maths is just meaningless numbers and boredom on paper. Physics \u201cmeans\u201d something. It describes something. So a career where I learn and grow to understand and interact and work out what things/events/people/situations mean, the how\u2019s and the what\u2019s and the whys and the who\u2019s - were always far more appealing to me than wanting to have a career in banking, or medicine, or finance. Those things sounded like a sort of intellectual prison for me if I were to have to do that as a job. It\u2019s a cliche, but I like meeting new people and hearing their opinions/thoughts/knowledge/expertise/history and all sorts of things. Even if the individual person in question is not particularly friendly or likeable, they might still have some sort of knowledge, or a viewpoint or an opinion that I would have never thought of it realised independently. By working in the media as a journalist, you get to meet and be exposed to a wide variety of people and cross sections of people and humanity as a whole. I imagine if I were a doctor, the majority of my friends would be medical professionals, I\u2019d go to medical conferences, I\u2019d be kind of compelled to keep learning about medical things. And the same thing can be said of almost any job or career or vocation or profession. You get \u201ctunnel vision\u201d and your life might feel like it\u2019s running along pre-set train tracks. With journalism, I have no need to worry about those limitations. I could be dealing with law enforcement one day, an entrepreneur the following day, a showbiz event the next day, a political event or even the Prime Minister at the end of the week, followed by the opening of a new airport or train station, meeting a sports star, reporting on a terrorism event, and then be chatting to an Olympian, or talking to a single mother who has just won the lottery, followed by interviewing a convicted serial killer. (Okay, so my above lists are speaking hyperbolically, I haven\u2019t done half those things, but that\u2019s because I\u2019m still young and have only been working for a few years). But I\u2019ve done some of the things above, and it\u2019s actually a pretty realistic list of a standard career in journalism for an older journalist over a longer timeframe. And you get my point. A standard day in journalism is, almost by definition, never a standard day. That\u2019s exciting. That\u2019s interesting. I think I would be driven to impulsive distraction if I worked in an office as a banker or whatever else these days. Furthermore, while I consider myself ambitions, I\u2019ve never felt any compulsion to seek fame or power. I don\u2019t feel any need to dominate situations or people, or lord myself over others, but neither do I have any inclination to subjugate myself to others either. I can happily work under a manager who requires me to do things, and I could completely imagine myself being a fairly good manager of other people. But I can also work independently and I have no backstabby corporate ambition to climb over people nor throw others under any proverbial bus. That may, in part, be due to the fact that my own career as a journalist, simply doing what I\u2019m doing is interesting enough that I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m lacking in workplace authority. If anything, I might like a bit more independence to choose my own stories, have a bit more money, or be higher up or more senior so I can have the option of choosing what I do sooner, and maybe delegating the less interesting stories to more junior people. But beyond that, what I do is too interesting in and of itself that I\u2019ve never felt any real need to play office politics or get into workplace power plays. Another thing is, I quite like being a bit of a know it all - but ONLY if I\u2019m actually pretty confident that I am right based on evidence, proof and expert witness/opinion. In other words, I like telling people factual truths, rather than blindly give my opinions on things I know nothing about. A pretty crucial aspect of journalism. Finally, although I\u2019m not a scene-stealing extrovert, if anything I\u2019m more a confident introvert, I used to enjoy amateur theatre acting when I was in school. I was very comfortable giving class presentations when I was sure I knew my material, and I quite enjoy giving speeches as long as I know what I\u2019m saying and what I\u2019m talking about. I don\u2019t enjoy being the centre of attention all the time. I\u2019m not always the life of the party. But when there is a \u201creason\u201d for me to be doing what I\u2019m doing, whether that be on stage because I\u2019m giving a presentation, or a speech in class, or whatever, I\u2019m very happy to do it and I don\u2019t get \u201cstage fright\u201d in those situations. I understand stage fright on an intellectual level. I\u2019m not immune to it either, I would definitely feel stage fright if I attempted to do stand up comedy - because it\u2019s not \u201cmy thing\u201d. But give a talk in front of dozens/hundreds or act on stage in an amateur or semi-professional theatre performance, as long as I know what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019m comfortable with that, to the point where I actively enjoy it. This might be why I gravitated to television/broadcast journalism. Your face is on camera, you are in front of people, and you must be presentable, engaging and personable. Things that I\u2019m comfortable being and doing as long as there\u2019s a reason. And that reason is that it\u2019s my job. ",
