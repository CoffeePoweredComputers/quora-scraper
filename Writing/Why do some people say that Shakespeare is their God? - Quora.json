            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know that anyone has actually said that Shakespeare was their god, but George Bernard Shaw coined the term Bardolatry to describe those whom he felt over-idolize Him. Although he admired Shakespeare\u2019s talent as a writer, Shaw objected to what he regarded as his moral ambiguity. Someone one said that Shakespeare doesn\u2019t tell you what to think, he tells you what to think about. For his part, Shaw never shied away from telling people what to think and he regarded Shakespeare\u2019s equivocation as moral cowardice. There are people whose attitude towards Shakespeare does reach the point of deification. Harold Bloom, for example, embraced the term. This does have some unfortunate consequences. For one it prevents some people from approaching Shakespeare critically, making them unable to see ways in which some of his views, like his attitude towards Jews, is antiquated. And since he is often ambitious it allows those pressing a political, social or moral agenda to recruit his work in their service. Also Bardolatry, along with presentism and snobbery, forms the basis for the folly of Anti-Stratfordism. Those pressing this nonsense, and flogging their silly books, cannot reconcile the historical Shakespeare with their idealized image of the Bard. They find it necessary to reinvent him. Anti-Stratfordism is not really about who wrote Shakespeare, it\u2019s about who should have written Shakespeare. ",
