            "answer_text": "Every paragraph of your essay should have a main idea, point, or goal that you\u2019re trying to get across. The topic sentence will identify that main idea. For you to write good topic sentences, you need to know what your paragraphs are going to be about. An outline will help you do that. You don\u2019t have to write a formal outline using Roman numerals and the like. Even a loose, idea-based outline can help you know what you want to discuss. You can ask experts to have a good paper. Few months ago I used Dissertation team to write my paper. But they gave me a very bad paper to me. ",

            "answer_text": "State your main idea clearly. Because your topic sentence is likely the first sentence in the paragraph, it needs to clearly state the subject matter of your paragraph without being wordy or difficult to understand.. It must include your topic and an opinion, or your controlling idea. Keep in mind that this is not an invitation to simply announce your topic. \"Today I'm going to discuss the benefits of gardening\" is not an effective topic sentence. You should be able to make your intentions clear without stating them explicitly. Find more tips here at Customwritings reviews. I hope it will help you. ",

They have to analyze many of books, prepare some strong arguments and so on. However, the main secret of their success is hidden a little bit deeper. If you really want to get the highest mark, you should find the appropriate topic of your paper. This theme has to please needs of your audience. You can choose a little bit easier way, read the list of themes, and use the best for you on this website \u2013 Interesting Persuasive Essay Topics. However, it is really difficult to write a topic sentence even if you have already chosen the appropriate topic. So, to create an impressive topic sentence, you should explain the essence of your paper with the aid of some words. Write some possible variants of future title, but choose only the shortest one. In addition, you should use basic principles of SEO. SEO-specialists are people, who try to find the most popular words, which are used by a particular society or group of people. You should analyze your sphere and figure out these words, which other people use in most cases when they discuss your topic. After that, write down all of them and try to create a logical sentence, which will be your topic sentence. ",

The first requires your topic sentence to cover enough information, while the second limits the amount of information the topic sentence should cover. All of the information in the paragraph should relate clearly to the topic sentence. This means, reciprocally, that the topic sentence should be just broad enough to account for, with some detail, all the points you make in the paragraph. Make sure the topic sentence is sufficiently expansive and precise. To help with this, use key words from the most important point(s) you make in the body of the paragraph.

            "answer_text": "To be honest, I always think it's best to brainstorm what your essay/paragraph is going to look like first, basically an outline. Then I would suggest going straight to the actual writing (everything in between the intro and the conclusion). And after writing every thing you planned on saying, then you could move on to writing the intro. For the topic sentence you have to give some insight on what your talking about with out actually saying why. The topic sentence is basically a claim without the \"because statement\" (with the \"because statement\" would be called a claim, yes they are different). So an example would be: \"Vladimir Putin may be skilled in many areas, but one area he isn't skilled in would be leadership\" (from a previous history essay I had to write). From here you could tell that my entire essay was going to be about why he isn't a good leader. Honestly, this is pretty easy to me, but I hope I helped in some way or another. ",

            "answer_text": "Process essays are often used to answer how-to questions. The reader should see the gist of the essay from the first sentence of each paragraph which has the main point. Read many essays to verify the flow. Compose them by drafting or, especially, outlining. Make a list of questions around the thesis, like so what. Each paragraph is like its own essay to answer those. They may also reply to the counter-arguments. Fill in the middle ones, then add the introduction and conclusion. The topics are a claim or opinion substantiated by facts or examples. They deepen the thesis and establish order and continuity. The sentence type is analogous to the essay type which is itself a clue to its outline. Persuasive has arguments by most strength. Cause-effects has one or more of each of those. Narrative has the elements of what happened. Descriptive appeals to senses. Expository has facts. Compare-contrast has differences. Definition has terminology. Process has steps, directions or information. Critical has quotes. Writing exercises are good practice. Take some paragraphs and add topic sentences up front. Or randomize sentences and then reorganize them properly into paragraphs. Make the material clear and logical for the audience. ",
