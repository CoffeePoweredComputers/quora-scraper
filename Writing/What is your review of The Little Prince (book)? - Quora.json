            "answer_text": "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Written as a children's book, I find myself unable to pin down firmly as  to what makes The Little Prince such a universally likeable book, be it  children or grown-ups. What makes it the Hotel California of  literature?  Is it because most grown-ups secretly love being  treated like kids? I think as a grown-up you ought to know better than  that. Grown-ups like to be petted around now and then in jest, but  that's the end of it. Often, when grown-ups are indeed treated like kids  and they're not in the mood, there is a tiny matchstick inside each one  of them, an insecure ego which flares up angrily like it has been  wildly struck against a matchbox. In my experience, grown ups like to be  taken very seriously. Very very seriously.  Is it the clear,  simple language? No, it can't be just that. There have been books that  have been written with clarity and have been criticized by pedants and  pontificating bores for their simplicity. Grown ups like to feel wise  and learned by having claimed to read complicated texts that engaged  them at an 'intellectual' level. They don't like important things being  pointed out to them in simple language, after all they're the  know-it-all grown-ups and don't need anybody patronizing them.  Is  it because the book is so short and grown-ups are always keen on  finishing books real quick? No, it can't be just that either. I know  grown-ups who believe that a good book, like a well-mixed drink, must be  held between the fingers and tended to lovingly at length to let it get  to your head. Is it the timeless lessons that the book cushions  behind layers of delightful story-telling? Is it the sense of wonder  that the book inspires in the most cynical, world-weary adult, if not  for posterity then for a day or an hour? I don't know, could be, could  be. Worthy contenders they are, but I think I'm not still not home.  If  I had to lay a bet on it, I'd say everyone adores The Little Prince  because we are tired of meeting people from Earth everyday who speak the  same dry language of numbers and would love to encounter a  sunset-loving, wise prince from the room-sized planet of Asteroid B-612  who talks animatedly about butterflies, baobabs and volcanoes to the  child inside us that we've buried long ago underneath the grey tomb of  grown-up babble.   Kurt Vonnegut once expressed how laughable a critic taking himself too seriously is in these memorable words, \"Any  reviewer who expresses rage and loathing for a novel is preposterous.  He or she is like a person who has put on full armor and attacked a hot  fudge sundae.\u201d  That is exactly how ridiculous critics who  despise The Little Prince are. For The Little Prince is that hot fudge  sundae garnished with generous toppings of lost innocence, shared  loneliness, deliciously recycled perspective and lessons worth repeating  to yourself to keep from succumbing to the unsavoury, contagious  disease of adulthood.   To make your job easier, here are some lessons from the book worth remembering and repeating: \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\" \"People  have forgotten this truth,\" the fox said. \"But you mustn\u2019t forget it.  You become responsible forever for what you\u2019ve tamed.\" \"One only  understands the things that one tames,' said the fox. 'Men have no more  time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the  shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and  so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me.\" \"\u201cGrown-ups  love figures... When you tell them you've made a new friend they never  ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you  \"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he  collect butterflies? \" Instead they demand \"How old is he? How much does  he weigh? How much money does his father make? \" Only from these  figures do they think they have learned anything about him.\u201d This review is reposted from here - http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/249255934 ",

            "answer_text": "I have a history with \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d. When I first read it, I was very young (around 12\u201313 years old) and I hated it. I could not understand what was going on because for me the \u201cplot\u201d did not make any sense. And then one day our French teacher told us, \u201c\u2019The Little Prince\u2019 is one of my favorite novels, it discusses profound questions,\u201d and so on. Of course, I thought to my self, in despair, \u201cWhy would anyone love this book?!\u201d because I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it, at all. I thought I should give it a second chance, maybe I read it at the wrong age. And for me, it sure was like that. Then I re-read it in high school. I couldn\u2019t understand it (or like it, honestly) as a child because the M E T A P H O R of it all eluded me. So, from my own experience, I think this is a book to remind you of childhood and what it means/meant to be a child. It is about innocence. And maybe because I was innocent and I was actually living my childhood years at the time, I couldn\u2019t get behind it. But I loved it in high school when I actually got all of that out of it. Give it a try, and see if it\u2019s for you. If it\u2019s not, it\u2019s fine, you can always return to it and give it another try. I am a strong believer that you CAN and you certainly WILL read books at the wrong age and not fully appreciate them until much, much later. ",
