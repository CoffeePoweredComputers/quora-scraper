When3 people are together you can either talk louder and still be ignored or do what I\u2019ve tried is listen and chime along with laughter and short sentences like \u201cyeah I hear ya\u201d or \u201cI feel like that too\u201d it\u2019s when I try too hard to control the conversation is when I get ignored the most. I hope that was helpful if anything you know your not the only one. ",
