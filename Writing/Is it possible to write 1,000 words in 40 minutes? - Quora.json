            "answer_text": "When the SAT (high school) first introduced a writing portion in their test, I was the first grade to receive it. Taking it twice, I would learn some things the first time around- especially in writing. My first written assignment was to write an argument or historical moment that could be related to the Trojan Horse from Ancient times. I found the task very difficult to consider on the spot but felt like I wrote enough, for it to be sufficient. Then I read in the Times that SAT\u2019s writing section was based on speed and how many words were written, rather than the content. This upset me because my score was low. The second time I received this test, I was asked something about the influence of electricity; what I wrote was different. In this assignment, I declared that Benjamin Franklin was the true inventor of electricity but that he was inspired from a trip to Latin America. It was the most I could scribble out, in the moment, and my score was much higher: 8/10. Can you write 1,000 words in 40 minutes? Consider typing speeds. The common metric is 80WPM (words per minute). 80 wpm * 40 m= 3,200. So, that\u2019s using a computer. ",

            "answer_text": "Handwriting? Most people can only write about 20 words per minute (and it is hard to maintain that speed for 40 minutes, but maybe.) 40 x 20 = 800 words in 40 minutes. It would be quite hard to even physically hand write 1,000 words in 40 minutes. Typing, yes, sure, at 40 wpm, x 40 minutes, that\u2019s 1600 words. This assumes that the words flow from your mind to your fingers to the screen without any hesitation or thought. You could probably write about a memory from your childhood at that speed. An argument or analysis? Maybe\u2014if you know exactly what you want to say. ",

            "answer_text": "Very much so. I was a newspaper editor for many years, and for a long time, 1,000 to 1,200 words was the common length. If a plane crashes or there\u2019s some other very pressing news, the time for writing the story, as opposed to actually news-gathering, is extremely limited. Forty minutes is a healthy amount of writing time on deadline. ",
