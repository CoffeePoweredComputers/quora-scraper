            "answer_text": "You write\u2026and write\u2026and write. Seriously, it\u2019s all about reading good work by other authors, absorbing the important stuff, and practicing. Have you ever heard of the rule of 10,000 hours? This was an idea based on studies of musicians and their practicing their instrument over a period of many years. Malcolm Gladwell, in his book Outliers, proposed that it took 10,000 hours of doing anything to become an expert at it. That is, to become good enough at something to rise to the top of your profession or just master your craft\u2014whatever that might be. I believe that anyone can become an very good writer through reading widely, being aware of the methods of other authors, and writing a whole lot. In classes I teach in the Washington, DC area, my adult students enrolled in my 8-week course promise to write a minimum of 90 minutes a day, six days a week, for the duration of the course. Why do I ask them for this commitment even when they have day jobs and family responsibilities? Because if they get their writing in virtually every day for 8 weeks, they will have established a writing habit\u2026and they will be well on their way to 10,000 hours. I don\u2019t know how true Gladwell\u2019s theory is. But I do know that writers who rise to the top of their profession are those that write often and produce a lot of words. If you have basic speaking and writing skills in English, I see no reason why you shouldn\u2019t become a great writer. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I am not certain that you can and here are reasons: If your knowledge of words, their meanings and their usage are weak, then you will repeat only the words you know, in whatever you write. This narrow field of knowledge could cost you when trying to keep a reader\u2019s interest. People read for two main reasons and those are entertainment, and to acquire knowledge. If the book is too simple and conveys nothing that can be learned, most readers will put that work aside. Grammar and spelling are also important, returning to my first paragraph). If someone is not even a good reader, they still want to understand what is going on when they are made to read something. Proper Spelling and Grammar helps the reader to understand the content in a much easier manner. The reader will not consciously be aware of the spelling and grammar if it is good, but if they are flawed even a weak reader will notice. Now, if you are a person whose first language is not English, then you need to just write in your native tongue. Later, it would be a matter of getting translation help, or if you have the money, pay a professional, because that can be costly. ",
