            "answer_text": "Yes, but it should vary from assignment to assignment and teacher to teacher. As a general rule, I would default to the MLA (Modern Language Association) style guide. One inch margins, Times New Roman, 12 point font. Don't fudge the margins to get into the next page. Don't bump the font to get into the next page. The point of these classes is to teach you how to critically analyze, frame arguments, and use evidence.  Cheating is fairly stupid if you actually want to learn. The teacher will generally not use a word count but a page minimum. If they are having you do citations, don't count the \"Works Cited\" page toward that minimum. So, the teacher has told you they want five pages on Beowulf's fight with Grendel. I would suggest that you at least use the first quarter of page five. Roughly speaking, even with the your information on page one, 5 pages will be about 1000-1250 words if you follow these guidelines. Don't assume that these rules are ironclad. Your teacher may prefer a different style guide, or amend these general rules. Talk to your teacher. Ask what they want you to do. Communication beforehand is preferable to begging forgiveness afterward.  ",

            "answer_text": "Teachers will give a word count or page requirement in the assignment. Most typed essays use 11 point font, and this equates to about 300 words on a page. APA requirements dictate the way the essay looks, not how many words. One can write an academic research paper 30 pages long in APA. The number of pages or words is dictated by the requirements and purpose of the essay. APA is simply the style. Legal papers folloe the Blue Book. Humanities follows MLA style. ",

            "answer_text": "I currently teach this class and perhaps can give some insight. You have a limited time to write each of your three essays\u201440 minutes for each one. You have only 15 minutes to read all relevant documents that pertain to your essay prompts. Therefore, you need to budget your time wisely while getting what you need on paper. So you need a strong introduction for each of the three. Your intros much each offer context, concession, and claim. Your intro should be 2\u20133 sentences. The body of your essays need to include six relevant examples, each with context and relation back to your initial claim. So plan on three body paragraphs with two relevant examples for each. There is no need for a conclusion. If you must\u2014and if you have sufficient time\u2014a one-sentence conclusion to sum up your ideas will be more than enough. Hope this helps. ",
