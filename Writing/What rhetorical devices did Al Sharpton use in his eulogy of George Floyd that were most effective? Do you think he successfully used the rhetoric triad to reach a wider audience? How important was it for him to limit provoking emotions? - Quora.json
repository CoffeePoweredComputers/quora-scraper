            "answer_text": "I have known Al Sharpton in all of his guises when he was a force in the black community in New York City 30 plus years ago. He has changed a lot since then and has become a true defender of truth. He has also become a persuasive speaker in matters that are meaningful to him, not the least the murder of a fellow citizen, also black, at the hands of a zealous racist cop. He had a wealth of history to draw on and he drew on it. He was powerful, he appealed to their knowledge of injustice learned at such painful cost, to the realization that finally there were people out there who were on their side, borne out by the masses of protesters who demonstrated. He was effective. ",
