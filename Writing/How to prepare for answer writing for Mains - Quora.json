            "answer_text": "\u201cIts not an exam of reading, its an exam that tests your writing skills.\u201d WHY IS ANSWER WRITING IMPORTANT - Reading and revising is just 40% of the task, the main task in MAINS is to handle the actual exam stress and perform in it. If you have trained your brain to read the question fast, understand it, write precise answers within the given time limit, you are likely to score good marks. This comes with PRACTICE and hence the importance of answer writing, many times before facing the actual exam. HOW DO WE START? There are 2 parts - Static part (most of GS1,GS4) and the Dynamic part (Current affairs - most of GS2/GS3) Static part - as soon as you finish reading one part eg. GS4 or History of GS1, start with the previous year UPSC questions - Study and practice previous 3\u20135 years\u2019 questions. Then, buy a good test series from the market for the current or previous year and attempt its questions. Dynamic part - For Current affairs answer writing, follow the websites mentioned ahead. Practice answer writing for at least 3 days a week. Initially, you may find it difficult, start with reading answers by other aspirants and the model answers given there. It will give you an idea of the nature of questions and the way of answering. The details and strategy is given ahead\u2026 WHAT ARE THE RELIABLE SOURCES - 2 types of sources for answer writing practice: Online and Offline. Utilize both! Online - UPSC PYQs - Previous 3\u20135 year questions for static portion Daily Current Affairs answer writing practice - InsightsonIndia SECURE initiative or with IASBaba TLP initiative. Monthly Current Affairs answer writing practice - IASBaba Monthly magazine - \u201cConnecting Dots\u201d Offline Answer writing practice - Question paper sets of VisionIAS available in the market Answer writing Courses and Test series by VisionIAS or ForumIAS (good reviews) TIME MANAGEMENT - Almost every candidate struggles in managing time between reading and practicing answer writing. There\u2019s always this dilemma whether one should read more instead of spending time on answer writing. I could solve only 1 test in my preparation year (not recommended)! If you can spare 1\u20132 hours - Practice at least 1 to 5 questions daily using the above sources If you are working and cannot give time daily - spare 1\u20132 days per month for answer writing practice - do it with IASBaba Monthly magazine Do not delay answer writing practice. You may observe for the initial 3 months of your preparation, but after that, you should start writing and improve\u2026 HOW TO OPTIMALLY UTILIZE THESE SOURCES : 5\u20137 DAYS LAG - It allows the news to settle, you will read more articles on the same news over the week. Thus you will have more information. Students will have written and posted their answers and the classes will have time to write their model answers. So it becomes easy to compare. Plus, there\u2019s no point in reading the news in the morning and attempting questions based on it on the same day. If you try to attempt questions based on something you had read 5\u20137 days back, it will make you think hard about the points. You will have forgotten a lot of important points by then. This will thus simulate the actual exam scenario. InsightsonIndia Secure initiative:   We cannot read multiple Current Affairs sources. But these free websites help us in it.  IASBaba Monthly Magazine - \u201cConnecting Dots\u201d questions    SEQUENCE Assess the time available. Say you have 2 hours- 1 hour for answer writing and 1 hour for corrections, comparison and compiling. Time limit - Select 5\u20136 questions. 8\u20139 minutes per questions - give yourself 50 minutes. Set the timer and solve those questions in a serious, exam-like environment. Compare -your answers with that of other aspirants or even better with the model answer provided by the classes. These answers written by other aspirants or by the classes may not be ideal, but you may gain some extra points by reading them. You can assess your answer, compare and learn. There is generally a link provided to the related article. Now if you think you need additional information, read the article quickly and note the extra points on your answer itself. You may skip this step if you think most of the points have already been covered. Do not spend too much time on a particular topic/question/article. Compile - Take a picture of your answer and save it to the respective folder in your mobile/computer/drive/evernote. An answer related to Farmers should be stored in GS3>Agriculture folder. You may also save it in physical files/folders or make a notebook with proper index. You can also take printout of the IASBaba monthly magazine just as I have done. Practice answers on A4 papers and attach good answers to the monthly booklets for quick revision. Purpose - Remember, the purpose of answer writing is \u201canswer writing practice\u201d and not gaining more and more information. For that you already have enough sources. Do not burden yourself with the task of revising all the answers you have practiced this year. Only some important points or some exceptional answers should be compiled,highlighted, marked and revised in the end. Its not possible to revise your textbooks/notes+all the answers. FOCUS ON THE QUESTION - During answer writing, focus on what is being asked rather than trying to write all that you know. WHEN TO START? - Earlier the better. But initially you may not have enough information to practice answer writing. Start reading answers of other students, toppers and the model answers provided online. You will get an idea about the questions asked and the way of writing answers. As mentioned above, first 3 months you can observe the answers and learn and once you have covered a portion of the syllabus, start answer writing. Answer writing for atleast half to one hour should be a part of your schedule between Prelims and Mains WHEN TO STOP? You may continue Answer writing till your exam. But my advice is to reduce it gradually in the final month and focus more on reading and revising. Reduce it to 1 or 2 answers per day. HOW MUCH? Do not overdo! You may not be able to solve all the questions given on the websites. You may not be able to practice answer writing everyday. It\u2019s okay.But whenever you do, try to learn the way of answer writing rather than focusing on the content. I reiterate, Answer writing practice is not for learning WHAT to write but to understand HOW to write good answers. SIMULATING EXAM STRESS - Lag of 7 Days + Time bound answer writing. THE QUESTION - Read the question twice and mark the keywords. You need to address every sub-question. Exam stress may cause you to miss some keyword in the question. CONTENT - Its good to divide your answer into Intro, Body and Conclusion. Intro - Defining the terms/Linking to current affairs/ Articles or constitutional provisions/ Quotes or Reports or Data with reference etc Body - Answer all parts of the question. Keep a balanced viewpoint, avoid extremes. Conclusion - Be optimistic wherever possible and give pragmatic solutions But sometimes, you may not be able to divide the answer in these parts. Its okay to straightaway answer the sub-questions, especially when you are short on time. EDGE - Practice diagrams, maps, quotes, reports, government schemes,data etc to score more marks. Until and unless you practice it everyday, it will be very difficult for you to assimilate it effortlessly in your answers. That\u2019s what makes the difference - 1/2 mark per question! SPEED - Your aim should be to finish all the Questions in the given time. Do not leave any question unattended. CLUELESS - There will be a few question you\u2019ll have no clue about. Yet, you have to write whatever you can. Solve such questions towards the end. Even 1 extra mark in such questions can matter a lot. PRESENTATION - Examiner has no incentive to read your answer. Until and unless you make him pause at your answer &make him read your answer carefully, he wont give you any extra marks. You may not have very good handwriting and yet, your paper can be made legible and presentable. IMPROVING SCORE - I have posted a video to improve score on my YTube channel \u201cUPSC SmartStudy with Suyash Chavan\u201d  TEST SERIES - Its good to join a test series and solve atleast 2\u20133 full length tests in a simulated environment. Get an idea of the stressful situation at the exam centre, get used to it. If you cannot travel to a test center, practice full length tests at home seriously. STRESS - I would advice the aspirants to solve 2 full length tests a day, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. This is how UPSC Mains is conducted, 2 papers a day. Experience the fatigue, try to perform under difficult circumstances eg sometimes when hungry, with fans and ACs switched off, with noise around you. with broken desks and even with sleep deprivation..You might face such situations at your exam center, I did! You should keep your calm and focus. \u201cThe more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in battle\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Tips regarding answer writing in mains are :\\ Relevant quality of content:Write only relevant content. Content is the king in Mains answer writing . Many aspirant write irrelevant content just to have psychological satisfaction that they have attempted the paper . The main reason for poor content is non completion of the syllabus. Therefore first thing you should do is to complete your syllabus. Cover static part of all GS papers topic wise before the prelims result is declared. You can follow my 60 days plan in asksantoshsir telegram channel on my quora profile.Presentation: If content is king ,then presentation is queen . I cleared my 4 CSE Mains because of my good presentation skills. My GS scores were always good from my first attempt just because of my presentation . You should present your answer well with flow charts , diagrams neatly. Be unique and bring varietyStructuring : This is also big issue. An ideal structure should beIntroduction :Single short Para of few lines. It can be: : context, definition , explanation , facts It should be direct to the point . Context : When the issue was in news recently. Eg CSE 2017 GS 2 \u2018Simultaneous election to the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies will limit the amount of time and money spent in electioneering but it will reduce the government\u2019s accountability to the people\u2019 Discuss. Here You can start with context of PM suggestion . Definition : If it is a concept which is not so popular. Eg: CSE 2017 GS 2 How do pressure groups influence Indian political process? Do you agree with this view that informal pressure groups have emerged as powerful than formal pressure groups in recent years? Here you can start with definition of pressure group. Eg : CSE 2017 GS 2 Explanation: If the concept is new and needs explanation. \u2018The emergence of Self Help Groups(SHGs) in contemporary times points to the slow but steady withdrawal of the state from developmental activities\u2019. Examine the role of the SHGs in developmental activities and the measures taken by the Government of India to promote the SHGs. Here you can explain the functioning of SHG Body : It should be written in Points with Headings and subheadings.You could also draw diagram and flow chart if necessary. In body always write balanced content , both positive and critical side. Conclusion: It should be broad and suggestive. You can use recommendations of ARC, Various reports of WB, Committees ,etc 3. Substantiate: You have to substantiate your answers with facts and figures. Without them , your answers will be without legs and can\u2019t take you to Mussoorie . How can you train yourself in answer writing ? You can follow the Daily Practice Sheet posted by me daily in AskSantoshSir telegram channel on my quora. It has UPSC standard questions linking current to static part of the syllabus. ",
