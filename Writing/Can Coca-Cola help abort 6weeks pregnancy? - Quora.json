If you don't have access to safe and supportive medical care, look up \u201cwomen help women\u201d on Google to find a way to get abortion pills and instructions on how to use them. ",

There is a lot of information out there that is dangerous, incorrect, and should be ignored. I know that different states have different laws. If you are having a hard time finding a doctor who can help you, an organization such as Planned Parenthood should be able to help you learn where you can go for help. Seriously, don't try anything like that. ",
