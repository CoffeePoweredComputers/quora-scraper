As such the student will get admiration of the entire country and will also get a seat in the best medical college of his state or any other state\u2019s that he wishes to study in. However he will obviously not get any prize money or something like that. Only if he is a student of aakash or allen or pathfinder then he will be felicitated and might be given a nice amount as prize money owing to his hard workd achievment and also to make a nice publicity of the institute. Thats it. Hope this helps ! ",
