            "answer_text": "If you plan on trying to get published, first, identify the kind of poetry you are writing.  The poetry world is fairly segmented into different schools such as narrative poets, language poets, slam poets, etc.  If you try to get a narrative poem into a small magazine that favors language poetry, you will most likely get rejected.  Same if you try to get a language poem published into a magazine favoring narrative poems. However, getting a poem published is not always an indicator that a poem is good (just read Zola's The Masterpiece which tears the whole market side for art -- still applicable).  What it indicates, really, is that the poem you wrote spoke to the reader working for the small magazine and possibly its editor -- two people.  However, it's still validation as those two people (possibly a couple more on staff) really liked your poem. Personally, my own sense of when I think one of my poems is good is if it adheres to an ideal I have of a good poem.  General guidelines I have -- *Do not use cliched or tired language. *Do not use hazy phrases.  Each word must have a function. *Not only must each word have a function, the sentences, the stanzas must all have a logic guiding it.  *Besides function and logic, poetry originated as an oral art.  The sound of the words next to each other must echo back and forth in some way.  This doesn't necessarily mean rhyme although I find off-rhyme to be an effective tool.  I often favor alliteration.  But because poetry has a structure that is not reliant on a straight-forward read like prose, one can also use punctuation and line breaks to help structure the sound of poetry. *Most important of all to me -- what is the thought, feeling, idea guiding the poem?  What am I writing about?  How do I want to articulate the thought or the feeling?  Is what I wrote giving the right shape to it or are they the wrong ideas, the wrong line structure?   Poetry has so many variables.  There's the intangible tone, the stanza structures, the many choices in form, the line length, and let's not forget the words. Over the years, I've found my writing to change based on how widely I read.  Writing other poets informed what I wanted in my own work but also writing helped me to read other poems more closely.

            "answer_text": "The answers here are generally pretty good, but I will say that many successful, acclaimed poets will readily tell you that they have had to endure hundreds of rejections before they started getting published.  There are exceptions to that, but they're just that - exceptions. So be prepared to get turned down a lot - it doesn't necessarily mean your stuff isn't good. Do show your work to others.  Take a few workshops.  Find a mentor whose work and judgment you trust. Read (and read and read) as many poets as you can - that will help you improve and give you an idea of what is, at least at the moment, regarded as strong writing. I can't resist quoting from the lovely poem \"Berryman\", by W.S. Merwin.  He writes about a conversation, or series of conversations with the poet John Berryman, and it ends like this: I had hardly begun to read I asked how can you ever be sure that what you write is really any good at all and he said you can't you can't you can never be sure you die without knowing whether anything you wrote was any good if you have to be sure don't write ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to gauge any type of \"Art\" is to not try to justify it. Don't explain to someone that it is about \"life\" or \"love\" if they get the Message, you are on a track that about 90% of people don't pay attention to. Also, watch peoples reaction to your art because that's what really drives great art. If they smile and laugh really hard, if they widen their eyes in shock, those are good signs, but you need their reactions because its a base for calibrating your audience.  Also, if their is a group of people saying its good, and a group of people saying its bad, that's another sign because poetry is polarizing. with all that being said, step out of your comfort zone, share your poetry, and see what people think about it, and if they suggest something to change but changing that will effect your \"personal touch\" by all means DON'T DO IT.

You develop an objective distance from it that springs from time and experience. Find or create a circle of writers and critique each others work and improve together. The best good-or-bad gauge for any piece of writing is whether or not someone else enjoys it. I would even point out that although there is often correlation between publication and quality, it's not necessarily the case that great poetry causes publication. See Emily Dickinson, James Joyce, Edgar Allan Poe. ",

It's important to know exactly what type of feedback are you looking for, though, because whether or not a poem is good, is fairly arbitrary. However, I can say that writing from personal experience always creates a more genuine voice.   Also, writing poetry is a very personal experience, and it's important to write for ourselves, first and foremost, rather than focusing on public consumption. Of course, sharing poetry is great as well, but if you enjoy the process of writing, and you like your poetry, that is what matters. ",
