            "answer_text": "Here are the first step to create your first blog 1.Tools of Trade You need a few things. First, you need a device you can create your content from. This can be your computer or your mobile phone. You can always just buy a wireless Bluetooth keyboard. 2. Your own little online space Next, you will need a domain, hosting and a WordPress website. This will need a little bit of an investment. Don\u2019t worry, we are not talking about any astronomical numbers. You can even start for free, but I will tell you all about it in the next article. 3. A specific niche Before you make your blog, you will also need to figure out what the blog will be about. A niche is an aim at a specific part of the market. You need to think hard about your niche. Nothing stops you from making a blog about everything, but don\u2019t expect to make money out of it in some reasonable time, if ever. If you want to be successful, you need a niche. And you need to stick with it for a long time. So, make sure you will find something you enjoy or something you enjoy researching. The more specific you can get the better. Examples of niches you can write your blog about are: Pet trainingParentingCookingFinancesFitness \u2013 focusing on niches like callisthenics, CrossFit, yoga and more are even betterTravel etc.and much more\u2026 When you have a niche selected, try to research if there are products you could sell or affiliate programs you could join. You can do so by writing your niche into Google and putting \u201caffiliate\u201d behind it or the word \u201cproducts\u201d. 4. The unbreakable will The last and most important things you will need are patience, a strong passion and will to continue even when you don\u2019t feel like it. As good as blogging can be, you can never become successful fast. There are people that write 3-5 articles and expect the world to suddenly know who they are. This is unrealistic. If you wish to have this sort of income, you need to be consistent with your efforts. You must understand this is not an overnight success thing. Blogging takes time. This is why I said you will need passion. If you will end up with a niche you chose just for the vision of money, you will eventually dread writing every article. Your blog needs to be something you enjoy most of the time. There will be times when you will hate it, especially at the beginning. You will be writing articles to barely any readers. I promise though, those times will pass. You just need to stick to it. Blogging is a long journey and you need to keep walking to get closer to success. No matter how far it seems. Some other important things you need to know before you start 1.Staying consistent To be successful, you will need to be consistent. This means writing a blog post 2-3 times a week, every single week. You can write more often, but there is a risk of burning out. Weigh out the pros and cons. Faster writing means more content and faster discovery rate. If you create a review blog, it might be also directly tied to the growth of your income. Slower posts mean you can keep up much easier and have more time to research your ideas. Quality over quantity applies in blogging as well. You can also schedule your posts for the future. This means you can prepare posts for a month ahead and then have time to do other things. 2. Research is the key Let\u2019s be honest. No matter how much knowledge you have, you will never have enough information to keep up blogging without research. Research is the key to success. Yes, it turns out success has quite a few locks. You should be in a constant state of learning. Always strive to be better. If you become stagnant, your readers will notice and go elsewhere. Don\u2019t worry though. Research is what you are doing right now. That\u2019s why you are reading this article after all, so you are already going in the right direction. 3. Networking and marketing To speed up your growth, it will be necessary to learn how to network or market your blog. Blogging is about sharing your knowledge, creations or stories with people. As much as this seems like something you will be doing alone, it doesn\u2019t have to be. You can and should ask for help. And, to make money from your efforts, you will also need to learn some marketing strategies to do so. I will go over all these things, so don\u2019t worry. We are in this together. Hope useful ",
