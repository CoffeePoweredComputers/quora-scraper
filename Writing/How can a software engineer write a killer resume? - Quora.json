            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve interviewed many people over the past years and had to go over their resumes before each interview. I\u2019ve seen many terrible resumes written by smart guys. In the best case that those resumes can pass recruiters\u2019 evaluation, they might have a bad first impression on the interviewer. Put yourself in recruiters and hiring managers\u2019 shoes receiving tons of resumes every day. Your resume should convey as much as possible highlights about you in a short amount of time (5-7 seconds). They usually don\u2019t have time to read every details in the resumes. They might not even have robust technical background and just look for some keywords in your resume. So help them to hire you! With small modifications, you can make your resumes stand out: 1-2 page resumes. Try to keep your resume in one page but going to the second page is not end of world. Try to be as concise as possible without sacrificing the readability. Sometimes, you can play with margins (not too much) and resume structure to fit everything in one page. Don\u2019t try to make the fonts too small to fit everything in one page. It ruins the readability of your resume! Do spell and grammar check as much as you can. Ask your friends to proofread your resume. Every time you read your resume, you might find a new typo or grammatical error. Go with bullet points and avoid putting multiple-line full sentences. Put the \u201cright\u201d amount of details. Be specific but avoid going to too much details. A good example can be \u201cReduced our service build time by 1/6th by decoupling our service package from more than 600 legacy packages.\u201d. I see some people write paragraphs about what they did but it\u2019s still hard to understand. Be consistent. If you put \u201c.\u201d at the end of sentences, do it for all of them. If you use 3 letter month abbreviation, do it everywhere in your resumes. \u201cJan - March 2016\u201d is an example of inconsistency. Talk about the achieved outcome not how you achieved them. A good industrial resume is focused on the tangible accomplishments and not the methodologies. So avoid talking about your regular job duties and responsibilities and focus more on the highlighted outcomes. Put technical skills and previous experience at the top. These two are what most of people reading your resume are looking for. Mention the impressive projects you have done vs. every single project/assignment at school. Also, don\u2019t add too much details on what you have done on those projects. It\u2019s better to mention the highlights in the resume and details on your homepage for people who might be interested. Do not write objective or use it wisely. I\u2019m not fan of putting objective in my resume because it doesn\u2019t add that much value to the it and also makes the resume longer. What you are interested in is pretty obvious when you apply for a position. If you plan to use an objective, write a clear and concise statement like \u201cSoftware engineer with 4 years of experience in developing large scale systems\u201d comparing to \u201cSeeking a software engineer position with an innovative employer where I can contribute to the development of new technologies and work with committed people\u201d. Avoid putting publications in your resume. Sorry, I know it\u2019s hard. We are talking about industrial resumes and not academic ones. Hiring managers even for R&D positions do not care about publication. As I said, create a homepage (or LinkedIn account) and put your publications listed over there for people who might be interested. Avoid using photos. It doesn\u2019t give information about your ability to do a job and increases your chance of rejection. Believe me! If they are really interested to see your face before interview, they will look you up on LinkedIn or Facebook. Try not to write acronyms that are not well-known. For example, people do not have any idea of the acronyms internally used in your previous job. Do not put references and specially avoid \u201creferences available upon request\u201d. It\u2019s a waste of space! they already know that you have references. When you pass interview, they will specifically ask for it. The above points are just suggestions and not rules (some of them basically are!) Please keep in mind that the resume formats also vary based on target company, position, location, and other factors.

            "answer_text": "First thing to keep in mind is that your resume makes up maybe 1% of your job search. Most people mistakenly feel that its the end all to landing the career opportunity of a lifetime. It's NOT! There are many people who can't write a resume worth squat, who are brilliant at what they do (sw engrs especially!); and many others who write an amazing resume, but are not simply not technically all that they pose as on paper. I view the resume as one piece of your \"career portfolio\", and not necessarily the first piece you want to create at that. Instead, begin with creating a FAB sheet on yourself. F.A.B. stands for Features/ Accomplishments/ Benefits. Should be done in a spreadsheet format. (When I get a moment, I will put one up on Google docs as an example & link it here). The FAB sheet in essence will allow you to focus in on  what you have to offer (Features),  what evidence do you have of your stated features (Accomplishments) what your key values do (Benefits) do you represent to a potential new employer, what are YOU really looking for in a next opportunity, what types of companies should you be pursuing (industry niches, etc) which specific companies you should really be going after.You'll notice in that list that I did begin or even hint at starting to do a search of newspaper, company websites, or job board ads. The reason for that is that, even in this internet age of digital media still a majority of available openings never get advertised ANYWHERE, These are part of what is referred to as \"the hidden job market\".  Hence, it behooves YOU as a candidate to focus first on  who you are what you want what companies do bring the greatest value to.Great companies know innately that the most valuable asset of their business are their people - the talent they are able to source, attract & retain. Hence a great well thought out match trumps all! Once you have completed a FAB sheet on yourself, your resume will flow very naturally and honestly should be slightly re-tweaked  for each position you are applying for. But this way it will always be highly targeted to the potential employer, will be focused on actual Benefits that you offer to them, and will be a powerful document. My personal belief is that the best approach however, is to contact each of the specific companies, and hiring authorities you want to pursue (and have something to bring to the table for), first by phone, email, or social media. Once you have created a brief introduction (which is nearly ALWAYS appreciated), you then will follow up with a well-written cover letter and resume that will be certain to be noticed. Esp, since they are looking for it and now KNOW who you are. Regarding the FAB sheet: three columns with the headers (left to right) of: Features, Accomplishments, Benefits The Features column: is easiest to answer and typically all the further that anyone goes in marketing themselves to a new employer Features can include both \"hard\" facts about you such as: your education/ degree, X years of experience in whatever it is you have done, project mgmt skills, UI/ design, etc Features can & should also include and \"soft\" facts that may apply to you. Examples might be: fast learner, strong people/ communication skills, growth-oriented, leadership skills, etc The accomplishments column is corollary to each feature, where you provide a short data point or 2 which demonstrates an example of that feature (ie: if you have project mgmt skills as one of your features, then I wanna know: how many projects, what is your largest, over how many resources, etc.) Accomplishments is essentially the \"proof in the pudding\" of what you have stated regarding your features/ attributes Finally the Benefits column: This is the one that most people want to avoid cuz it causes us to have to THINK. lol. However, THIS is what employers (or anyone purchasing anything), REALLY want to know...and that is...what does it mean to ME (the employer) that you have X yrs of experience in Y, are a fancy dresser, that speaks 3 languages, and lives in (your big city). Benefits is what \"separates the boys from the men\" (no gender bias intended), when it comes to job search. Keep in mind that there are always at least 2 benefits that can be written for each corresponding feature. Again, the FAB sheet is not used in place of a resume, nor is it something that you even give to the employer (though I have had candidates that did that and it was always well-received). Instead the FAB sheet is YOUR preparation that focuses you on who and what you should be going after and what to say to them when you make the contact. IT does not take long to do, but once you begin it, will probably be something you will return to and refine for  the remainder of your career. Is more to be said on this topic, but you get the gist. I assure you its a highly-guarded NINJA job search secret weapon. That said, don't share it with ANYONE, :~) Best of luck. Feel free to email if you need help. ",

            "answer_text": "Assuming basic stuff, like spell-checking and truthfulness, consider that the best result of the recruiting process is a great match that happens quickly. For that to happen, both the company and the candidate must describe themselves accurately and succinctly. I started my career at a company that made recruiting a science, so much so that my second job involved spinning off a second company for matching technical graduates to companies. Since then, I've applied much of that experience to several startups. Here are some compositional and practical guidelines for the candidate: Limit your resume to one page. Hiring managers are time-constrained and will review dozens or even hundreds of resumes for a single position. In that environment, a concise, content-dense resume makes a delightful first impression. (I know some recruiters that read the one-pagers first. Since most people stop reviewing when they have a handful of promising options, strive to be at the top of the stack.) So, edit your resume down to just the best stuff, which fits on one side of a standard sheet of paper with sane margins and font sizes. This takes discipline, but anything more than one page lacks focus, and suggests the candidate is taking the scattershot approach of write once, blast everywhere. Which brings me to...Customize your resume when the job warrants. Everyone wants the same result: a specific match. If you send out the exact same resume to every company, then in a way you are signing up for a Lowest Common Denominator scenario. Consider tailoring specific versions of your resume for the top companies on your list. (This step is also a good filter for company selection: if every company on your list seems equally suited to your boilerplate resume, then maybe you're not excited enough about any one in particular.)Write descriptions about projects, rather than bullet points or lists of keywords. Your future co-workers are trying to imagine you filling an open spot on their team. Provide narratives that illustrate what that would be like. Since most companies divide work into projects, describe some that have been meaningful to you. Think of these as introductory paragraphs to longer discussions that you'll bring to the interview. The best result here is for your reader to finish a section and conclude, \"This sounds like what we need here.\" Before I get too much flak about keywords and acronyms, let me just say that they make much more sense when they are presented in context, rather than as lists.Include only what you can speak intelligently about. If it's on your resume, it's fair game for deep questioning, and neither you nor your interviewer wants you to be embarrassed. This is less about being truthful (which is already given) and more about choosing content that leads to fruitful discussion. In other words, it's against expectation if an interviewer asks you about something that you wrote and you give a flat answer. Think of your resume as the own deck of cards you bring to the table, stacked heavily in your favor. Any card that your interviewer pulls should be a fantastic result for you. (Another reason to closely edit your resume: the contents will often determine what you're tested on, if tests are part of the interview.)Publish your resume in multiple formats. Standard currency is Word and PDF, but consider linking to a TXT version that's online. The practical side about recruiting involves forwarding resumes around, so be maximally available. If you sign your emails to a recruiter with a link to your resume, that is your best bet that an interviewer will have read it before meeting you. (And in engineering, there is a certain credibility to having a simple TXT resume that is formatted with spaces and loads 100x faster than Word or Acrobat.) I have also noticed more people simply printing out LinkedIn pages, which implies that they've Googled for a candidate. Maintain any online records of work that you control.A resume is itself a work product. A great one will demonstrate professional discipline, good communication skills, and a specific approach to the task at hand \u2014 all of which are desirable qualities in an engineer or any other team member.

            "answer_text": "I'm a little late to the answer party, and there are already some solid answers, so I'll just focus on two guiding principles that I've observed while iterating on my own resume and while reading hundreds of other resumes:  Discuss benefits, not features. Your resume is a marketing piece, and you should treat it as such. If you're trying to sell a car, you won't get far by telling people how great the spark plugs are and how it \"runs well.\" Instead, you could talk about how it smoothly handles tight curves at 50mph and how the parts are of such a high quality that the car won't need any scheduled maintenance for the first 10 years. In terms of your resume, don't focus on the spark plug details (\"I implemented FooBar with C++ and STL\") nor on the generic descriptions (\"Designed and implemented custom solutions for an important client.\"). Instead, talk about how you improved the performance of something by 25x, or how you reduced the QA cycle from 2 days to 3 hours, or how it took you four months to implement the company's flagship product which is responsible for 45% of all revenue. These are the kinds of benefits that employers drool at.Put the most important things first. If someone is skimming your resume, you want to hook their attention ASAP. If you have a two-page resume and the second page has lots of great content while the first page is boring, then that's a big waste -- most people won't even get to your second page. Concrete tips:Your most recent work should generally go before your earlier work.Within each job's section, put major accomplishments ahead of minor accomplishments (or better yet, just delete the minor accomplishments)Your education generally comes after work experience, but if your education is awesome (3.9 GPA at Stanford) while your work experience is lukewarm, then put education first.A few other tips (some of which have already been covered): 1-2 pages is fine, 3+ pages is annoying.Spell check and grammar check several times, then ask a few friends to proofread your final product.Take out all of the fluff. Don't write things like \"interfaced with members of QA\" and \"worked closely with product managers\" -- that just waters down the quality of your resume. On a side note, the \"Objective\" statement that's found in traditional resumes is usually fluff.Try to make it look nice. It doesn't have to look like it was made by a UI designer, but stick to 1 font, make your sections consistent, etc.Use web-style writing, not prose. Bullet points, numbering, tasteful usage of bolding and italics, etc., can make a resume much easier to scan. Someone should be able to figure what school you went to and what roles you've had at different companies within 5-10 seconds of looking at you resume.Don't lie. If you do, I promise that you'll eventually get caught.Final bonus tip: The resume sets the course for your interviews. It should all be good, but try to be aware of which 2-3 things really stand out.  When you have a few very strong bullet points, many interviewers will naturally ask you about them.  As a concrete example, my resume mentions that I sped up one of LinkedIn's core algorithms by 200x. Even though that happened at the very beginning of my career, I would say something like 60% of interviewers ask me about that single bullet point and nothing else. Understanding that people are curious and will ask you about the most interesting things on your resume means that you can really polish up your responses and give a great first impression.",

            "answer_text": "We\u2019ve actually written a blog post about this exact question, which includes an annotated, editable software engineering resume, that you can use to update and optimize your own resume.  Some of the tips we include when we work with software engineers on optimizing their resume: Format should be clean, professional, and modernWith a maximum of 2 columns, 1 color, and a modern, sans serif font, your resume should be clean and professional at first glance. Don\u2019t use graphic bullets or other illustrations around your statements, because if the company is using an applicant tracking system (ATS), it can\u2019t be parsed. If you include links to your portfolio, GitHub, and/or additional websites you\u2019ve worked on (and you should!) ensure that they are clickable so that your work can be seen. Statements should show impact and quantificationStatements should focus on what you have accomplished and what your results were. These impact statements should follow a structure that\u2019s like \u2018Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z\u2019 or \u2018Developed X to accomplish Y, resulting in Z\u2019. The results show quantification, which is also important to highlight why your work was worth it. Did you save the company time or money? Did you manage a team or interdisciplinary project? How many users did you acquire? These will all help you provide additional quantification to show more impact with your resume statements. Always provide contextMake sure to include the important key words, but also tell the story and purpose of the product, app, or system you worked on. Context creates that story to your work and piques the interest of the reviewer, rather than just providing a description of routine and mechanical implementation details, which will just bore them. Example of a statement that needs more context: Developed a web app using Ruby on Rails and React that allowed for operations managementExample of a statement with good context: Developed a web app using React to manage operations for an NGO that pairs refugees with host families and provides them with stability in their new homesWith these tips and our editable template, you should be able to wow recruiters and hiring managers with your software engineering resumes.

            "answer_text": "Tech recruiters are assigned notoriously aggressive goals in a hyper-competitive developer talent market, so they have to be as efficient as possible in screening out bad resumes. This means recruiters will spend as little as 6 seconds skimming your resume before making a decision to pass you on to the next stage. So you need to really invest some time into properly setting up your resume if you want to even give yourself a shot at a company\u2019s coding challenge or phone interview stage. I\u2019ll skip the obvious high level formatting steps for resumes, that are more generalized for all career tracks. Instead, I\u2019ll focus on three developer-specific points that mirror the three stages of the recruiters evaluation of your resume. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Step 1 \u2013 Pass the Initial Skim for Key SUBSTANTIVE Skills The first box a recruiter needs to check on your resume is: does this candidate have the key skills I was told by the hiring manager are \u201chard requirements?\u201d This skills check can be done in two ways: either by a machine using OCR character recognition technology, or by a human recruiter, or both. Either way, you will need to make it very easy to find your technical skills, including languages, frameworks, and libraries. I recommend the following: A Separate Skills Section Listing all of your relevant skills (customizing the included skills per each job description) in one continuous list at the top, bottom, or in a sub column on the left or right This will allow a recruiter to quickly verify that your resume has the relevant skills in less than 10 seconds. Project-Embedded Skills The reason I highlighted \u201csubstantive\u201d before, is that recruiters are used to seeing large laundry lists of skills from applicants hoping to pass automated screens, knowing full well that many applicants do not truly have professional-level skills in all the listed technologies. Because recruiters professional reputation depends on being able screen out would-be \u201cfakers\u201d, they will quickly try to verify whether you truly understand how the technologies you list actually work. A way to prove that you truly know how to use MongoDB, or the React library for example, is to embed those skills into the bullet points under the jobs and projects you list in your resume. When doing so \u2013 make sure not to just create another laundry list of items, but actually explain how and why you used those technologies. Bad Example: Utilized MongoDB, Node.js, and React to deploy a full stack applicationGood Examples: Implemented database using MongoDB, reducing page load time through selective client-side subscription loadingDesigned web app front-end using server-side rendering of React components following SPA architecture to enhance client load times\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Step 2 \u2013 Prove Your Skill Relevancy and Applicability to the Job Description So you made it past the ATS (applicant tracking system) automatic skills review, AND the skim by the tech recruiter. Now it\u2019s important that what\u2019s on the resume is both relevant to the job description to which you applied, and that you were personally involved in deploying all the key tech you listed. Job Description Relevancy While it can seem like a huge burden to customize your resume for each job description, after you apply to 10+ positions, you\u2019ll start to converge on 4-5 resume \u201csets\u201d that can easily be tweaked in under 10 minutes for each position. For example: you may be a full stack developer, but have one resume that emphasizes front-end skills, one for back-end skills, and one for a more all-around utility player that would work best at a small startup engineering team. Between the different resume sets, and the final tweaks you make for each job description, you should customize the following: Relevant coursework: you can easily switch out relevant courses that are a better match for each job descriptionProjects and work experiences: pick past experiences that are closest to the JD. If you have limited experience, you can reorder projects with those with higher relevancy pushed to the topTech Skills listed: if you have 20+ skills listed, consider capping out at 10-15 and rotating out those least relevant to each positionRelevancy to Your Personal Accomplishments As recruiters are looking to sniff out the \u201cfakers\u201d, they will also be questioning whether you used all the tech you listed OR if someone else in a group project really led certain efforts. While you may be able to get past the resume screening stage by listing tech you didn\u2019t personally use, HR and the hiring manager will find out in the later stages when they dig deeper into your projects, and they won\u2019t give you credit for work you didn\u2019t truly lead. So make sure that with the limited space you have on your resume, you are emphasizing technologies you individually worked on in group projects. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 It\u2019s worth putting significant thought and effort into your resume to dramatically increase your success rate in landing an interview. Resumes are still the number one data point for many recruiters as they do initial screens, but don\u2019t forget to keep your Github, LinkedIn, and personal websites clean and organized too! ",

            "answer_text": "Elliot Loh has written some great advice for getting your resume noticed, and have a sourcerer/recruiter be able to screen you and get you onsite to an interview. So let's talk about things from a software engineer's perspective. Here's the things I'm thinking about as I read a resume before my interviews with onsite or phone screening candidates:  A single pager. Unless you have two+ decades of experience you do not have enough interesting things to say on your resume, and I just won't read it. Include a github link or a personal site if you want to show off what you've done.Projects, with technical implementation descriptions. Recruiters look for keywords, engineers look for algorithms, techniques and niche software. \"Wrote sorted hash map\" is more interesting than \"used jsonp for Javascript AJAX UI\".Technical proficiencies. Listing the twenty languages you've used is pretty standard, but we both know that you'd be most comfortable with a small subset, so try to specify which those are. I don't do this, but some interviewers will pick an area that you've listed on your resume and deep dive on the nuance, and hold it against you when you flounder.Post code online. There's only so much you can get across in an interview setting (especially when accounting for nervousness, bad questions, scheduling, etc.), and I'm always looking for more evidence outside of the interview if you can provide it. You also get the benefit of having spent much more time & having had many more revisions for anything you post online.",

            "answer_text": "Lets imagine two scenarios. Scenario 1: You are a fresh graduate who has just been minted into a world class IT professional. You should focus on. The core areas of education.The languages you learned.The projects you completed and how they benefited particular organizations.Any internships.Any class positions or academic accomplishments.Also, tell the company about how you can add value.Read about each company you are applying and talk in specific terms about that company not just generic cover letter. A definite No No are things like, I am hard working person, will diligently work, to serve the company and that kind of lingo. Please don\u2019t show desperation. Instead: I am a software engineering professional who can add value by taking up modern day business challenges and solve them using IT, something on those lines.Companies want and love action, they are not interested in what you can do for them, they are interested in \u201cwhat they want you do and if you can do that for them.Scenario 2: You have spent good number of years in the industry and are at senior or mid career level. These are the things you need to focus on. Your most recent job and its accomplishments.The overall experience in various organizations.The Why part is very important when switching jobs in IT. Companies want to know why yo want to work for them, tell them reasons which would make sense. Like for example, if they are working on some super- cool new technologies, apps or industries.Showcase where you see yourself in the future and how the company you are applying for fits into that big picture.Stay to the point, summarize, and do not drag into longer sentences. Write in a highly impacting manner. And deliver confidence in your writing so the readers / recruiters / potential HR managers are left with the impression that you just don\u2019t know the stuff but you actually mean business and KNOW YOUR **** VERY WELL.Hope this helps answer the question. I will add more to it if I feel something is left out. Cheers and best of luck in getting your dream jobs smart IT guys :) . ",

If you standout with something original, then you are much more likely to get an interview. Here is an example of an iOS Engineer resume that got me an interview with Google. Instead of sending a traditional resume, I sent out flyers for my interactive resume app. Its not just a gimmick and if a hiring manager\u2019s interest is piqued she/he will discover that Viral Hire is a real iOS app on the App Store. It also forces hiring managers to my his iOS skills, and it will be incredibly evident whether or not I am a culture fit for the company. Something like this is real hit or miss, but certain companies like Google love it. eHarmony even interviewed me for a job that I was clearly under-qualified for, but the hiring manger told me that my resume app at least warranted a first round call. Other more corporate companies may not. Moral of the story: try to think of a way to showcase your appropriate skills and target your market. Viral Hire on the App Store  ",

            "answer_text": "Within the rapidly changing technology sector, it is easy for the broad range of a job seeker's technical skills to become disorganized and hard to follow. A specialized treatment should be used in developing your resume to mitigate this; it begins with a clear and balanced summary of your technical and non-technical strengths which is further supported by a cohesive breakdown of your most relevant and marketable technical proficiencies, and descriptions of key projects and achievements. Depending on your career level, you might include this technical summary at the beginning or end of your resume, and this proven strategy ensures that your greatest assets are immediately apparent. Regarding the length of your resume. In today's job market, it is common for the length of a resume to be two (sometimes three) pages. While the one-page resume myth still haunts some professionals, reducing your resume to one page will exclude critical selling points. The ideal strategy is to provide an overview of your strengths and achievements to capture the employer's attention within 10-15 seconds while listing the key responsibilities and accomplishments of your career history. In general, most companies conduct a thorough screening process involving both computerized and human reviews; this process typically includes the following stages:            1. THE ONLINE/E-RESUME SCREENING: Many companies, professionals, and recruiters utilize online networking and social media Websites such as LinkedIn. Additionally, some mid- to large-sized companies continue to use internal resume databases (aka Applicant Tracking Systems) or Internet resources for storing and screening applicant information. To get noticed in the online or electronic scanning and networking process, your resume must be specially formatted and also leverage industry-specific keywords and phrases to be selected.            2. THE BRIEF SCAN: Hiring managers, upon initial review, will perform a brief 15-second scan to determine if a candidate appears to meet the majority of the requirements. This is why a powerful summary of skills or a concise first page is critical.            3. THE IN-DEPTH REVIEW: Next, employers scrutinize the details of your resume for relevant skills and strengths to warrant an interview. Lacking detail of daily responsibilities and key projects, you may be relegated to the \"no interest\" stack as employers weigh the need for more information versus their time allotted for interviews.The key to resume writing is balancing brevity with relevant depth and detail, this is just as true for IT professionals.

Relevance, not quantity. One page of easy to understand, highly relevant detail is far more effective than 3 pages of everything you\u2019ve ever done. Make it easy for the hiring company to relate your skills & experience to what they\u2019re looking for. Tailor your application to the specific requirements listed in the job ad. Talk less about responsibility, and more about impact. Most people list their skills and competencies in relation to the company/role they were employed by at the time. Very few people explain the impact their work had. And even less can explain it in a way that makes sense to technical and non technical people alike.

I have interviewed many tech recruiters who say 8 seconds is how long they look at a resume - they look at geographic location, last job and education, then skills list for a technical job. Then they look for projects and achievements.  Many software Engineer hiring managers do not want to read a lot of information. Highlight your technical qualifications in a technical qualifications profile, try to keep your resume to 3 pages or under (I have had many, many clients with 3 page resumes who have been very successful in hi tech - but often 2 pages is sufficient).  Bullet points are fine - but that does not mean they need to be one sentence - a bullet point about a project may be 2 sentences- with sub-points highlighting technical accomplishments. Also include details about customer interactions, documentation skills, team collaborations and 'soft' skills.  Does a cover letter matter -yep, not always in the first round but I know many hiring managers who say once they are given a list of candidates resumes they often all look alike and the cover letter helps them understand  a little more about the candidate. They like to see highlights or projects not just a repeat of the resume. A cover letter adds value during and after an interview as it gives you a voice and personality. ",
