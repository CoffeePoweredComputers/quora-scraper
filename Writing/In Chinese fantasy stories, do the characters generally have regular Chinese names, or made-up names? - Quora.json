            "answer_text": "They usually have a made-up name that can show the personality. Basically, regular Chinese would not choose those names as their real names. And the style of the names in Chinese fantasy Stories may completely differ from that of a regular guy because those are used to stress the personality while a normal one is used to speak out the beautiful wish or the personality that they want the kids have of the parents. Plus, in China, we don't name children by grandparents\u2019 or some kind of famous heroes\u2019 name. Most of us choose to refer to a dictionary, find some characters with good meanings and beautiful pronunciations and name the children or get a poemtry to seek some names. So I don't think there is \u2018regular name\u2019 in China if you mean the kind that we straightly use without any changing. And actually almost every name of Chinese are \u2018made-up\u2019. (Two guys\u2019 name may be totally the same tho, because there are usually only three characters in one\u2019s name and a lot of people just think the same.) Hope I could be helpful.\uff5e(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3\uff5e)~ ",
