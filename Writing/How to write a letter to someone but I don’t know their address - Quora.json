            "answer_text": "Presumably your meaning is that you know how to write the letter and to whom, but don\u2019t know how to arrange its delivery. Not knowing the subject or purpose of the letter, the answer is that it depends on whether you do know anything about where they live. It has to be assumed that you know the country, the state or county and the town. I recently mislaid the address of a house I had visited some years ago, so Google Map solved the problem with a little guesswork. In the UK, a local Post Sorting Office can be very helpful, as indeed they are with letters addressed to Santa Claus. Any description or clues can be successful. ",

Phone a friend who knows it.Place an advertisement in the paper asking them to contact you.Search Facebook.See if there\u2019s a clue in all those old Christmas cards you kept so that you can display them every year.Check with the cops to see if they\u2019re wanted for a crime.If none of that works, put a note in a bottle and heave it into the ocean.
