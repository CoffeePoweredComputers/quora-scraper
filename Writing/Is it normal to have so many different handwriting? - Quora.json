            "answer_text": "Yes. According to graphologists (handwriting analysts), it is actually natural to have two types of handwriting: personal hand and professional hand. Historically, this made sense, since before the era of the office copier, you needed to fill out all kinds of forms, write memos, and so on. For this professional use, you wanted a fast, neat, legible handwriting style that was also neutral (ie. didn\u2019t show too much character). Your personal hand, on the other hand, shows your character, and is more unique and authentic to you. You would only use this in personal letters addressed to relatives, and personal notes, for example. Even then, that hand will differ with mood, health, and even the weather - but the basic features will remain the same. Graphologists will be able to recognize the original writer.

            "answer_text": "Handwriting tells a lot about the personality of a person scientifically anyway\u2026.. If I understand your question directly then yes. Doctors write scripts several times a day so may rush through it but the pharmasict will pick up on words you cannot recognize. You develop your own style of handwriting as you develop from childhood into adulthood - some people land up not even being able to read their own words! Also depends on how fast you're writing, tiredness etc. I stand corrected though\u2026.. ",
