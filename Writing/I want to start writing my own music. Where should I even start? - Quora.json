            "answer_text": "If you have inspiration right now, go for it. Get it all out, it doesn't matter if it's crap. Get it out on paper, because on paper, it's real, and it's something tangible that, even if it is crap, can be turned into something amazing. And if it already is amazing? Well, you're half way there. If you don't have immediate inspiration, or you've already written it down, I suggest learning to sing and play songs you love, but also songs you don't know. When you hear a song you like, think about what exactly is it that you like about it? Do the drums really drive the song, is it a particular chord progression that makes you feel uplifted? Whatever it is, take note of it so that you can apply it to your own music. On the same note, when you hear a song you dislike, don't just press skip or change the radio station. Listen to it, and try to figure out what it is that you don't like about it, so that you can avoid it in your own songs.  Listen to as much music as you can, from all styles. When a revolution happens in music, it's never original, not even for the likes of Mozart and Bach. Revolutions in music happen when different styles and cultures meet, creating a hybrid. So don't just listen to the music you're familiar with, listen everything you can get your hands on. And study it.  Study the songs from a musician's perspective - if it helps take a course. There's a great one here that I started with Berklee Online with Pat Pattison through Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/songwriting). You can do it for free, if you don't want the qualification at the end of it. Songstuff Music Industry Resource might also be a good resource. Study the songs, realize why the songs work, why they don't work, learn the form, the key, the scales used, the rhythm, etc. Is it in simple or compound timing? All of these things are essential to know for your own song, and the best way to learn is to learn from others. Remember that you have hundreds of years of music history, theory (which is really just a summary of what has been found to work) and songs to guide you, and that nothing is truly original. Most importantly, write every day. ",

            "answer_text": "Listen to music that you like. Get a feel for the genre you want to work in. Some fusion concepts can work, but not everything. Imagine Classical-Country-Punk-Bluegrass-Dance. Probably not going to work out very well. If you\u2019re like me, there\u2019s a place in your audio-visualizing imagination that allows you to experiment with sounds. Maybe you\u2019ve played an instrument for a while, and now you can hear that instrument in your head, you can even imagine playing it and hear the sounds. Listening to the genre will improve your ability to imagine these sounds in more complex ways. From there, you can try to transcribe what you hear, maybe add a bit more structure if it is too repetitive or meandering. Make it consumable and marketable. Failing that, you can turn on a mic and record yourself singing. Just sing anything. Singing is the fastest way to get sounds from your imagination out into reality. If you play an instrument, first you\u2019ll have to translate the sound into the proper fingering (think of a guitar chord just by sound, now figure out what notes are being played and then go to the fingering. That takes too long) Typically it\u2019s pretty easy to get a decent melody or chorus this way. Do it for an hour, then play the audio back at 2x speed or faster and see what you like. Keep a catalog of ideas, then pick the ones that interest you and flesh them out a bit. You don\u2019t have to name them, just use the date and a number until you decide whether to publish. If you want to make a living, focus on marketability. Unfortunately this means you should water down your stuff to appeal to the maximum number of people. Most people don\u2019t like grunge noise, more people enjoy metal, more than that enjoy rock. So if you\u2019re going to get super technical and play black metal solos over every moment of your song, it might get enthusiasts enthusiastic about you, but the genpop is going to want some variation of your standard Pachelbel\u2019s / Let It Be chord progression. In the same way, write lyrics about love or your neighbor\u2019s crackhouse down the street, because those are more relatable than, say, a conlang retelling of your fictional world\u2019s bloodiest war.
