            "answer_text": "I hate to admit it, but Jane Austen was a little to flowery in parts. For me, because my genre is poetry, it's hard to think of novel with purple prose. But poetry is filled with it. Pablo Neruda. The first one that comes to mind is, \u201cI Do Not Love You Except Because I Love You.\u201d e.e. cummings. One of my favorite poems and poets, but \u201ci carry your heart\u201d is a little sugary for a lot of poem. Lanston Hughes. \u201cMother to Son.\u201d Emily Dickinson. \u201cHope Is A Thing With Feathers.\u201d Like I said, lol, poetry is filled with it. In my opinion, it makes a poem. The deeper you can show the emotion, the stronger it comes across to the reader. I've even been guilty of it myself ;). Being Part of a Harem i'm way too easy.i don't make Him work for it.But i know if i didi'd fail because i'm not perfect. So here i am.Laid out in all my glory.Please let Him find me worthy.At least in the sexual category. Let Him rest his velvet eyeson the sight i present.Let Him feast on the one whoalways gives complaint consent. Let Him take me as only He can.Fill me with His marvelous seed.His satisfactory grunt isall this willingly sub needs. i'll watch as He walks away.Carrying all my love with Him.And continue to hide the jealousybecause i'm one in a list of them. i love this man i now call Master.He's made me whole.His mark is invisible to the eye.For it's on my heart, mind, body, and soul.
