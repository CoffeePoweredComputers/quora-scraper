            "answer_text": "You bet. \u00c9mile Zola did this with his twenty Rougon-Macquart novels, subtitled Histoire naturelle et sociale d\u2019une famille sous le Second Empire (Natural and social history of a family under the Second Empire). In La Terre (The Earth), his fifteenth book in this series and my favorite, Zola shares the point of view of several characters. We see life through the eyes of Jean Macquart, Fran\u00e7oise Mouche, old Louis Fouan and many, many others. Zola tells part of his story from the perspective of old Fouan\u2019s sons, the brutish Buteau and the ne\u2019er-do-well Hyacinthe, nicknamed Jesus Christ. And he takes us inside the mind of Hyacinthe\u2019s daughter Olympe, also known as La Trouille. Norman Mailer took his approach when writing his World War II classic, The Naked and the Dead (1948). Mailer tells his story from the point of view of Croft, Martinez, Valsen, Wilson, Goldstein, Toglio, Roth, Stanley, Gallagher and other men in a reconnaissance platoon. And James Jones did that with his World War II trilogy, From Here to Eternity (1951), The Thin Red Line (1962) and Whistle (1978). Sometimes it\u2019s the best way to tell your story. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, depending on point of view. I prefer first person POV. Most first person POV novels stay in the mind of the MC. Some alternate between characters, some drop just a few chapters in other characters minds. As far as I know there's not a rule against it. I've also seen spots in novels where the author slipped up a bit with POV. A good writer can get what they want across from a single point of view. That's how we experience life after all. Once you choose a POV, you need to stick with it. Maybe you'll find the POV you've chosen isn't working. Switch it but don't try and do first and third person in the same novel. I read a novel recently (I don't have the heart to blast the author). She chose first person POV and the first three chapters were good, then the fourth chapter was a third person narration of a different character. I'm not sure what happened there but it was just the beginning of a whole heap of mistakes. Like only the first three chapters were edited. Choose what works best for you and your novel. ",
