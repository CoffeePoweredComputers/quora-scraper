            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. There was something I was working on at one point, an epic that I thought about writing. I showed it to a small number of people, privately, who compared it to Shakespeare\u2019s works. I was only mildly flattered by it, to be honest. However; My published writing hasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m actually more flattered by that fact because that tells me that I have my own style, rather than the tinge of someone else\u2019s. As a writer, I don\u2019t want to be compared with another writer. To me, that tells me I lack originality. Some might think it\u2019s a good think to be compared to the Bard, but again, I don\u2019t seek to copy his style, I want to write in my own, with my own voice, and I want my work to be recognized as having my voice, rather than someone else\u2019s.

            "answer_text": "It was compared (by one of my very perceptive children) to that of Enid Bagnold, who wrote NATIONAL VELVET and THE CHALK GARDEN \u2026 and I was pretty thrilled, but also realized that I had imprinted on her writing like a duckling since seventh grad on, and read those books so many times that the way she used language had become part of my molecules. I tell my students sometimes that we \u201ccopy\u201d the ways in which our favorite artists write because those particular voices help us find our own voices, just as PIcasso was inspired by Cezanne and Rousseau, and folded their perceptions into his own.

            "answer_text": "One reviewer of Raw Nerve compared the novel to James Patterson\u2019s work. I\u2019ve never read a James Patterson novel so I don\u2019t know whether to be flattered or not. But the reviewer was apparently a huge fan of his, so I suppose that must be good. The review can be read on Amazon. And a reader sent me a personal message after reading The Drama Merchant. She said she loved the book and hadn\u2019t read anything so controversial since she\u2019d read Machiavelle\u2019s The Prince, and I have to admit that did make me sit up straight. Definitely flattered by that :) ",
