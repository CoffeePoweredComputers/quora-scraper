            "answer_text": "Am I the only one who wants to answer this question? <-- that is an example of a first-person question.  If you are referring specifically to Quora, it means that some people phrase their questions in the first person. So instead of saying \"What are questions in the first person tense?\" they might say \"I don't understand what questions in the first person tense are. Can anyone explain?\" I would guess that most people prefer Quora questions to be phrased in a more general,  less personal, way. Incidentally, I don't think the term \"first person tense\" is right. \"First person\" refers to the pronouns you use: I instead of you, she or he. It's about point of view or perspective. Tense refers to the verb: present tense, past tense, and so on. It is about time - when did something happen?  ",

            "answer_text": "First-person is not a tense. Tenses apply to verbs, such as present, past or future. \u201cPerson\u201d applies to nouns or pronouns, such as you, I, he, we, they etc. A question using first person would be: Why do I have to learn German? A question using second person would be: Why do you have to learn German? (often used as a generic-you: Why should you study a foreign language?) A question using third person would be: Why do they make us study German? ",
