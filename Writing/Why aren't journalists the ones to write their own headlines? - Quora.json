            "answer_text": "Because print reporters don't design or do page layout, they would have no clue what character count is needed to fill the allotted horizontal space - one col, two cols/two decks,  is a \"kicker\" being used? Nor do they know the target point size of the headline. A newspaper page, especially a front page, isn't static. If a major story breaks an hour before press, you rip up whatever front page you thought you were going with and start over. This means a half dozen or so stories could need new heads (aka \"heds) and need them right now.  Reporters at some papers are free to suggest heds, and their suggestions might very well make print. But layout and news value dictate what headline will ultimately run. And remember, there are tens of thousands of headlines written and double-checked every day. The big time blunders slip through, of course, but they're the exception. ",
