If you just want a name for a character, here\u2019s an easy way to get one. When students were writing fiction, I forbade them to use the name of any student or staff member at the school. I had some books which they could use for names. Two of them were lists of baby names and the names\u2019 meanings. This was useful if the author wanted the name to be a reflection of the character\u2019s personality. The other was the telephone book. Students would open the book to a random age, shut their eyes, and put their finger on the page. If it happened that they knew that person, they did it again, but if not, that person\u2019s last name became the last name of their character. By choosing names this way, nobody could get bothered and say that the student author was ridiculing them. ",

You can use the same name as existing characters in media, i.e. conan or ana, because nobody can copyright a name, but the CHARACTERS can be, so you have to make them different enough to not qualify as misrepresentation or copyright infringement. For example, you want to use the name Ana for a character and don\u2019t want to get in trouble, just use a different last name, or use it on a character whose personality is completely different from the characters in public media.
