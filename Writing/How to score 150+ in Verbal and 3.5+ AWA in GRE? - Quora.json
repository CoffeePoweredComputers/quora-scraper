            "answer_text": "1.AWA - This section requires a lot of reading and writing practice. Start reading articles from websites, newspaper and try to write a paragraph about what you have read and what did you understand. If you don't have time to proceed this way, then there is a short cut to get at least 3.5 in AWA (which I did). Find answers for issues and arguments topics on google and categorize the endless pool into different sections like education, technology, science, politics, government, society, culture, religion etc. Once you have categorized them read 4-5 answers for every section and try to remember examples that you have read. They will surely fit in any question that might appear in your GRE. But do practice writing once or twice in a week because you should be in a habit of bringing out the best in 30 minutes! 2.Verbal - As it appears to most of us, the most tough section in GRE. But you can get a decent score if preparation is well planned. Have a mind set that you have to learn at least 1000-1500 words before you appear for GRE. You don't have to learn them all at once, but around 30 words everyday. Now let us start with book Barrens 333. Learn all 333 words perfectly. Once you are done with learning these words start practicing for questions. You have to attempt 20 questions of each type i.e. Sentence Equivalence, Text Completion and Reading Comprehension everyday. Refer to Princeton 1014 for SE and TC & Manhattan 5lb for RC. If you complete these books go for Kaplan. Level of Kaplan is slightly more than what actually comes in GRE. Along with these questions keep learning new words and revising old ones. Remember learning new is not that important as remembering old ones. Also do not learn random words, search online for 1000 high frequency words and learn them first. ",
