            "answer_text": "How do you become a freelance content writer? You declare it. Write it on your LinkedIn profile. When people ask you what you do, tell them you are a freelance content writer. If you don\u2019t have confidence in your ability to do freelance content writing yet, go out and learn it. Do some practice projects. Work for free so you can build up a portfolio and confidence in the value you provide. Becoming a freelance content writer is as simple as declaring it. How do you start earning ASAP? To start earning money with your services, you need clients. In order to get clients, you need to sell your services to leads. In order to sell your services to leads, you need to acquire these leads. Acquiring leads is also known as marketing. In order to start earning ASAP, you need to start marketing yourself. There are a million different ways to acquire leads. Philip Morgan gives you 46: Lead Generation Trust Velocity | More leads for your dev shop (Marketed for Dev Shops, but applicable to anyone selling services) I\u2019ll give you one below. ACTION STEPS: Write a 250 word description of your ideal customer. Who are they? How old are they? Where do they work? What do they read? Where do they hang out online? What problems are they having? What are their hopes and dreams? What keeps them up at night?Create a website designed for your ideal customer. Keep the copy focused on your ideal customer and the BENEFITS you can provide for them. No one is going to pay for your words - they are going to pay what your words can DO FOR THEM. Your website will also contain your blog, about me page, services page (which could be the home page), portfolio, and contact page.Write 5 pieces of helpful content for your ideal customer. Since you know their problems because you\u2019ve researched them, you\u2019ll have plenty of writing material. That\u2019s what your content is - material that helps your ideal customer with their problems.Promote your content. Since you know where your idea customer hangs out, go to these places and provide your material. Always be focused on helping your ideal customer.This is hard work, but you will find leads this way. Most people who want to do freelance content writing won\u2019t do this. It\u2019s much easier to send out a bunch of business cards and hope you find gigs. Instead, make it your mission to deeply understand your ideal customer. Your ability to write content should help produce a benefit which solves their problem. Selling is a very different game when you know your ideal customer and the problems they face. Take the time to listen to your new leads and to get a deeper understanding of how you could help them. Then, write a proposal that contains your solution to their problem. Making the sale has everything to do with how well you listen and your ability to communicate the solution to their problem. This is difficult, time-consuming, uncomfortable stuff. Lucky for you, you are content writer. So you\u2019ll be prepared for all the writing you\u2019re about to do :) ",

            "answer_text": "Once you have completed your +twos you can start working as a freelance content writer while you are in college are after you complete your graduation. Firstly, to become a freelance content writer you need to make sure that you have all the essential qualities. Then you can proceed to apply for different companies. I am going to talk about both of these aspects in detail below.  Along with a passion for content writing and a good understanding of grammar you need to have a good understanding of content marketing to become a content writer. Learn about the different domains such as lifestyle, education, technology, finance, healthcare and any other and see which one suits your fancy. Choosing one of these will help you get domain experience. You can read books and listen to podcasts about content writing and marketing. Free online courses on these are also available in sites in Hubspot. The next step involves you applying to different companies that will help you get experience as a content writer and also help you earn. You need to choose companies that allow you the flexibility to work at your pace and also allows you to explore different domains. For example, at Wittypen our freelance writers have access to our list of ongoing projects. They can see the deadline, the domain, the word count, and the amount being paid for the content piece. The payment release date is also visible to the writers. They can make an informed decision on whether they want to work for the project or not. As a freelancer, you need to have a structure to your day and you must know how to pace your work or else you can end up getting overburdened. Don't take on too much work and if you are still in college then balance it with your college work as well. Apply for companies that give you options to choose your work pace and pay on a regular basis, so that you always have a steady flow of income. You can try to work for different domains but it is better if you first find a domain you like and build experience in that. Then you can go ahead with other domains. During your application period, companies might also ask you to give your sample articles. Make sure to give your best work in those and use them as a benchmark for your future work. Build domain experience as that will be crucial for your future prospects as well. Lastly, understand that content writing is a constantly evolving industry so you will need to have the mindset to learn and grow. Keep working hard and take it one day at a time. Good luck. :) ",
