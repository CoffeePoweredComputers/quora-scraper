            "answer_text": "Our mind is based on the similar premise as that of a computer. Like a browser and website. You send a request, you get a response. If the Internet isn\u2019t working well, you send a request, you wait for a considerable amount of time before you get a response. That\u2019s how games work too, just at a much fast pace. You click a mouse and it fires a bullet. This action reaction conditions the mind to a certain extent. The more you play, the more impact it has on you. However, life doesn\u2019t work fast. You work everyday to get salary at the end of the month, in most cases I mean. If you\u2019re writing a book, you put in the effort everyday until it finishes one day. Gaming convinces you can do it all in one go, and if your foundations at what you\u2019re doing is strong, you just might. But not in everything else. Like in cooking food, or even going to sleep. I suggest meditation and/or yoga or if that\u2019s not your think, try some art you like, it has the added benefit of getting you into a discipline if you\u2019re really psyched about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Games are made to make you impatient. The manufacturer will put forth easy seeming yet unachievable levels, so that you waste more money on their products so that they can have much patience to lie on the sofa and see their stock scores. In games, everything seems achievable but you have to still achieve it thru levels. And those are very fast graphics. You have to clear a level in some time bound or shell life criteria else you fail. What games teach is nothing is achievable unless you concentrate on it and apply the correct approach. It puts forward an unseen message that impatience leads you to nowhere except a pool of mistakes which you will be regretful of later. Games are money and moral both unless you understand. ",
