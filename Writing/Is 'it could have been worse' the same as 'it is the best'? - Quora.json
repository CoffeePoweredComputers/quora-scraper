            "answer_text": "No, it literally means it could have been worse. Generally we use this phrase when something has gone wrong, but we realize something even more horrible could have happened. We\u2019ll strive to carry on and not complain too much because we were lucky it was only this bad. Examples: Let\u2019s say you fall down the stairs and break your arm. It\u2019s unpleasant, but it could have been worse, you could have hit your head and damaged your skull or even died. Or perhaps you walk out to the parking lot and find you have a flat tire. This is annoying, but it could have been worse. It could have gone flat while you were driving on the highway in a snow storm. ",

Now saying \"It's for the best\" could imply that the outcome wasn't the desired one, but that it was still the best outcome. ",
