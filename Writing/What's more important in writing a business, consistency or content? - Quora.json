Let be a business or a personal brand until you maintain the consistency of your content, you would lose on targeting your potential customers. And if you don\u2019t focus to write intriguing, engaging, informative, and useful content, you\u2019re for sure at a loss. It\u2019s important that you understand, please don\u2019t segregate the importance of content based on the organization or brand. Content is the fundamental aspect of your social presence, in fact, any presence digitally/electronically. Rather focus on the category of the content and how can you catch eyeballs using that content. Strategize the content workflow. Hope this helps! ",
