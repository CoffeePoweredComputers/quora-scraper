            "answer_text": "Some good answers already here, you\u2019ll probably start to gather that there are a practically unlistable number of mistakes editors make when they\u2019re starting out. The only way to avoid making these mistakes is to go out and practice editing for at least 10 years (I\u2019m not joking), and as the best editors will tell you - they\u2019re always learning. A fact that it\u2019s important to always remain humble about. Without wishing to make the list too much longer - one thing that I\u2019ve learned above all about editing, that novices almost certainly will have no clue about (I had no clue until recently), is just how much a completed film may differ from what was shot. It\u2019s been mentioned here already to not use every shot that was filmed, to trim down and think outside the storyboard etc, but more than that you really need to think outside the box when it comes to editing a movie. Don\u2019t take anything for granted about how the footage should be used. In fact you should take the box, throw it on the ground, and jump up and down a few times, then order a new box (and repeat).  Artist\u2019s impression of a novice film editor. I can give you a specific example from a film I\u2019m making at the moment where we\u2019ve reinterpreted footage in quite a drastic way. In fact this is just one of many examples from this movie where we\u2019ve taken footage, and used it for completely different purposes than what was originally intended. So\u2026 we had this scene later in our film where there has been a confrontation at a school. A couple of parents have been called to the headteacher\u2019s office and a kid is waiting outside.  What happened though after we had finished the shoot and got into editing is that we decided that we wanted a whole new scene at the beginning of the movie, featuring the same location, and of a similar thing happening. The original beginning to the movie was a bit boring and we felt we needed to reveal more of the backstory to make it clearer. Anyway, so we basically fabricated this entirely new scene out of shots we\u2019d filmed for other parts of the movie. For example this shot:  Was originally shot from inside the headteacher\u2019s office. But with a bit of clever compositing (to be completed), we\u2019ve made that into a shot that\u2019s from outside the office looking in through a door.  We\u2019ve also taken a couple of other shots from completely unrelated scenes and stitched them in to fabricate this whole new scene that wasn\u2019t scripted in any way (and all without having to shoot any new footage).  Another interesting thing to note is that the original scene that occurred later in the movie (at the HT\u2019s office) has been essentially cut out, and you don\u2019t actually see anything inside the office at all, as we felt this was unnecessary for the story. I can\u2019t describe how many more of these examples there are throughout the film, we\u2019ve changed a fair amount of it by using a combination of reshoots and reinterpretation of existing footage. The following shot was originally from a french lesson from mid way through the film, it\u2019s now been changed to a teacher handing out letters about a school football match at the beginning of the film (a storyline that was completely added after editing had commenced).  The below scene originally featured an entire conversation, and is now cut down to just a brief shot of walking.  Here is another example where we plan to composite two shots to make a whole new scene that was never there in the script.  And so on. I thought this was all quite odd initially, to have to be changing things quite this much. However, I started to come across more and more examples from Hollywood movies where this level of \u2018reinterpretation\u2019 of footage had occurred, eventually I realised that this is actually more like the norm than the exception to the rule. There\u2019s a fundamental problem for novice editors that upon viewing a movie, we only get to see the end result. It\u2019s easy to assume that everything in the movie is intentional or was there in the storyboard from the off. The editors are so skilled that they essentially hide the fact that they\u2019ve taken Shot A from one scene and combined it with Shot B from another to create Scene C The best analogy I can think of is that looking at the end result of a movie as a guide for how to make one yourself, is a bit like looking at a plane and then going to try and build a jumbo jet. There is so much that goes into the production of a movie that you simply don\u2019t get to see, and what is featured on behind the scenes documentaries is only a fraction of the story too. Anyhow - the saying goes that editing is the last draft of the script and as an editor, your job may include to effectively rewrite that script if it comes down to it. Thinking up brand new scenes, recording new dialogue, completely altering existing scenes, nothing really is off limits - if the movie is bad, you\u2019re now the only hope, and it\u2019s not gonna magically get any better unless you make it so!

            "answer_text": "the biggest mistakes I made as a beginner, and that I see in other editors' work are the following: -ping pong cuts between dialogue shots. This one is unforgivable, and renders scenes unwatchable once you are on the lookout for it. Essentially, an editor should maintain a natural rhythm to their cuts. You want to show the audience what they would be looking at if they were there in person. Ping pong editing is basically a rough cut that never got fine tuned. It shows only the action. So if someone is talking it shows them talking, then if someone replies it shows them replying. It is the same as the audience having super powers to anticipate someone about to speak. That never happens in real life, and it shouldn't happen in your edit. -using every angle. Just because it was shot, it doesn't mean you have to use it. using every angle screams rough cut. Cull down to what is necessary. -awkward pauses. Again, this is a sign of a rough cut. In real life People are generally waiting for a chance to speak, so pauses in conversations are few and far between. If there is a pause between every line then it is jarring for the audience. Cut it more natural. Have characters start talking over the last word of another character\u2019s sentence. Play around with timing. Pauses can be great, just not all the time. -out of synch dialogue on a reaction shot. This one kills me because it is everywhere. Don't become a statistic. I know the mistake happens due to the shooting style, but the editing style also come into play. Be creative. -loose edits. Tighten that baby up! Cut cut cut! ",
