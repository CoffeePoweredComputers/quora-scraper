            "answer_text": "We want to demonstrate that choosing a niche doesn\u2019t mean reinventing the wheel. 1. Languages Did you know that English is only the first language of 21% of the world\u2019s population? In fact, by 2050 the United States will have more people speaking Spanish as their first language than English. Canadian schools now teach Chinese as a subject because of China\u2019s growing economic power. People like to learn new languages. But, over the next few decades many of us will have to learn a second language besides English. The world is changing. Maybe we\u2019ll all eventually speak a language like Cityspeak from the movie Blade Runner? That would be confusing\u2026but kinda cool. That means a ready market exists for language tuition software, online language coaching services, and everything else related to learning a new language. 2. Pets Here\u2019s a market that\u2019s not going away anytime soon, and has massive potential for all kinds of niche businesses. Companion animals are very much a part of Western life, and are becoming so in other parts of the world. We\u2019ve already looked at a bunch of pet affiliate programs here. No sense in waiting to start profiting from this market. There\u2019s a generation of people not having kids and raising pets instead. They refer to them as \u201cfur babies.\u201d Note: The author of this piece has to admit he treats his dog like a child. Her name is Butters, and she\u2019s amazing. You could start a niche website about a specific breed of cat. Another option could be a YouTube channel reviewing dog chew toys. Or you could start an authority site about caring for exotic birds. You could also go offline with your niche business by starting a pet sitting service. Pet owners in some cities are willing to pay up to $100 per day for reliable pet sitters. Pet owners are fanatical about giving their companion animals the best of everything, from food to toys to health treatments. Why not tap into that? Market value: $66.75 billion per year 3. Prepping If you listened to the news you\u2019d have to at least suspect that the world is getting worse by the day. (That\u2019s good enough reason to not listen to mainstream news.) But even if there\u2019s isn\u2019t a zombie apocalypse, there\u2019s no denying that it makes sense to be prepared to take care of your family. Our planet\u2019s weather patterns do seem to be changing, for example. So, why would you not prepare for situations where extreme cold or a violent storm might pose a risk? You could choose to start a full-blown ecommerce or FBA business drop-shipping prepper supplies. If you aren\u2019t sure what those supplies would be, you can figure out some low hanging fruit with Jungle Scout or Helium10. Or you could start an affiliate marketing niche site about prepping for complete newbies. The neat thing about this niche market is that it expands beyond just buying freeze dried meals and shotgun ammunition. It also includes topics such as gunsmithing, blacksmithing, knife making, food preservation, etc. 4. Relationships & Dating Until there\u2019s some massive evolutionary jump where we become an asexual species, relationships are going to matter for a long time to come. And what\u2019s the biggest problem most people have with relationships? Finding somebody to fall in love with. It\u2019s kinda funny looking back at how far online dating has come. There was a time when anyone using online dating was the butt of jokes. Now, it\u2019s an accepted part of the dating scene. Recent studies show that up to 50 million Americans have tried online dating at some point. Now that\u2019s a big market. You can engage with this niche market in a number of ways. You could write a Kindle book on dating for people over 40 (or find another niche with low hanging fruit), self-publish it on the Amazon platform, and make over $100 per day. Or maybe you could put together a digital product on the best way to break up with somebody. Everyone else is trying to get their ex back, so why not take a different approach? Being in a relationship is one of the biggest commitments people make during their lifetime. That makes them more than willing to pay for solutions to their relationship issues. This is an area where there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to publish books, and it\u2019s never been easier than it is now to publish income generating books on Amazon Kindle. These books can generate more than $100 per day. 5. Personal Finance The financial meltdown of 2008 taught a lot of us some very harsh lessons about how quickly you can go from boom to broke. What it made most people wake up to is the fact that diversifying your incoming and planning for your future is smart. You can\u2019t rely on the government to take care of you. Especially not when most countries in the developed world are effectively bankrupt. This niche has tons of opportunities for different products or services, but all with the goal of either increasing a person\u2019s income, or helping them get back in control of their outgoings. Some people like Jeff Proctor are making over $100,000 per month in this niche through SEO traffic and smart keyword targeting. Niche businesses that could work really well in this market include informational sites about budgeting. Another sub-niche is how to live without cable TV. Or you could come up with ideas for family meals that cost less than $10 each. A financial advice coaching service is another option. Selling high-end digital products in this market might prove to be a challenge though. Remember, people are usually more interested in learning how to save money. If, however, your niche business is about generating more income, then selling digital products shouldn\u2019t be a problem. If you get into the personal finance niche, you\u2019ll have to do some serious keyword research. A few years ago I made a tool that makes it easy to do keyword research. It\u2019s called Long Tail Pro (read our Long Tail Pro review here). 6. Home Security Nobody likes the idea of having to turn their family home into a \u201cFortress of Solitude\u201d, but crime isn\u2019t going away any time soon. Even the most liberal families are being forced to look at just how secure their home is. In short, home security is a growing market and has lots of sub-niches within it. You could start a niche site focused purely on home defense weapons of the non-lethal variety. Home monitoring software and hardware is also growing in popularity, including video doorbells, Wi-Fi security camera systems and PIR lighting systems. A sub-niche could be offering solutions to deter \u201cporch pirates\u201d from stealing packages from outside homes. You could also create a series of digital information products for this market, or a YouTube channel reviewing home security gadgets and appliances. Another approach could be to start an affiliate marketing site on making your home burglar proof. Market value: US$51 billion per year 7. Babies There were 900 million people alive in 1800. By 1900 that figure increased to 1.65 billion. By 1980 that had increased to 4.4 billion people. And in the last 40 years the population of our planet has almost doubled to 7.6 billion people. That\u2019s a whole lot of babies born every single day. 386,000 of them. Unless we wind up in some kind of dystopian nightmare, like in the movie \u201cChildren of Men\u201d, the market for baby-related products is getting bigger every day. Not only that, but parents are \u201craving fan\u201d spenders. New parents spend an average of $4,000 per year to care for, clothe and feed their baby. Sub-niches within this market include Amazon affiliate marketing sites, how to organize baby showers, and sites dedicated to baby names. You could create a blog dedicated to first-time parents who are in their late 30s. Or a blog about the adoption process in different countries. Even Spencer has dipped into this niche when he bought a mom blog. So yeah, the opportunities within this niche are pretty much unlimited. People in this market are willing to pay almost anything to ensure their families get the best possible start in life. Market value: US$18 billion per year 8. Weight Loss America is in the middle of an obesity epidemic. It\u2019s not the only country in the world with that problem though \u2013 the UK and Germany are following close behind. There is a massive market for helping people lose all those extra pounds, and then keeping them off. Sub-niches you could take part in include ideas like a personal trainer YouTube channel aimed at young adults. Or you could run a niche site, or offline business, offering customized meal plans. Or maybe a digital product on weight loss for busy people. As we discussed earlier in this article, you need only take a look at the shopping channels to see just how much money is spent in the weight loss market. Yes, it is very competitive. Yes, you can compete with Time, Innovation and Effort. While there may be some ethical boundaries with certain types of content promotion, you can still make some good revenue from programs like the Amazon Affiliate program, or even with display ads. For those going the display add route, you can make a killing. Spencer has had the best luck with Mediavine, but it has a high visitor requirement (25k per month) before you can join. We recommend Adsense and Ezoic for beginners. Ezoic in particular is great for any site that runs ads. They use AI to text the optimum placement of ads on your site and maximize your earnings. Spencer uses Ezoic on Niche Site project 4 and they are doing well. We have a review coming out soon. Until then, you can sign up for free. Sign up for Ezoic and boost your earnings Market value: US$66 billion per year 9. Learning a Musical Instrument Now, this niche isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s because musicians are a different breed. They can spot a non-musician marketer a million miles away, so you\u2019ve been warned. With that warning aside, learning to play a musical instrument is something most people aspire to. And it\u2019s not just for beginners. There\u2019s just as big a market for improving musicians who want to take their skills to the next level. One of the most popular approaches in this market is to create a membership site ( we\u2019ve reviewed Membermouse here, but we also like Clickfunnels) featuring lessons on a specific instrument. You could also start a YouTube channel teaching people how to play covers of popular or classic rock songs, monetizing your channel as your income source. Or, you could sell digital products on the ideal effects pedal setup for the new guitarist or bass player. If you like the idea of a membership site, Clickfunnels help you do the whole thing. You can make the landing page, use their shopping cart software to save you from big fees, offer upsells, and host the membership area. 10. Electronic Entertainment It\u2019s worth taking a few seconds to look at how many electronic \u201cgadgets\u201d you own. You have a smart phone, a tablet and maybe an eReader like the Kindle or Kobo. You probably also have a Netflix, Hulu and Spotify account. Basically, electronic gadgets and entertainment devices are part of your life. They\u2019re part of everyone\u2019s life, including people in the developing world. In fact, the developing world is going to be one of the biggest markets for electronic gadgets and entertainment services over the next decade. Making money in this market means looking closely at focused sub-niches. One example would be a YouTube channel about video streaming services and media players they connect to. Or a digital product on how to make money with game streaming platforms like Twitch. You could also build a niche website dedicated to setting up your own media streaming servers at home, and reviews of all the required equipment such as Network Attached Storage devices. ",

Try honestly answering these three questions\u2026 Question 1: Will I love writing about this one year and 50+ posts from now? Question 2: Are there other people who want to read about this topic?

            "answer_text": "How To Start A Niche Blog You can divide all blogs into two categories: lifestyle blogs and niche blogs. These categories represent two conscious decisions that bloggers can make: I\u2019m going to write about everything, or I\u2019m going to write about one thing. Bloggers have 2 choices: Write about everything, or write about one thing. #NicheBlogging Niche blogs are when you write about one thing, and one thing only. They are a blog with a one-track mind, having one purpose, one goal. Why in the world would you ever consider something as unfun as a niche blog? Because niche blogging is where real traction and traffic happen for a blog. Why You Should Start A Niche Blog As a blog reader I like variety, but when it comes time to save a blog\u2019s RSS feed in Feedly for reading and sharing later, I much prefer niche blogs. Niche blogs save me time. They fit into a specific category and I know that when I want to read on a certain topic, the posts will stay true to the category. I will find content on the topic I\u2019m looking for and nothing else. For lifestyle blogs, I end up dumping them into a category I call \u201cRandom Interesting\u201d (yes, I really call it that) and I only venture in there when I have time to kill. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy reading those blogs (I actually do), but when I am pressed for time I don\u2019t always have the option to sift through content to find something that might be useful in the moment. I turn to categories that I know will give me what I\u2019m looking for. In other words, when it comes time to share content, niche blogs are the workhorse readers turn to. Variety, within boundaries, works. Variety, without boundaries, can be a mess. #NicheBlogging start a niche blog 1. Niche Blogs Keep You On Track Focus is hard enough when you blog. This is especially true on days when you don\u2019t have ideas and are tempted to write about your favorite sports team just this one time. When you have a defined niche, it\u2019s pretty easy to say \u201cno, the NFL doesn\u2019t have anything to do with my pastry blog.\u201d By knowing the specific topic you are writing about, you actually have more tools available to help get you out of an idea rut. Techniques to break writer\u2019s block, like brainstorming or a headline storm, are easier when you have boundaries that define where you should operate. Let\u2019s consider an example of how the two compare. \u201cI have a lifestyle blog and I can\u2019t think of anything to write about.\u201d Has anything interesting happened to me lately? Have I observed anything interesting about life in general I think people might like to hear about? Have I read anything lately that caught my attention that I could write about for my readers? \u201cI have a niche blog about shoes, and I can\u2019t think of anything to write about.\u201d I can go to my RSS reader and get ideas on my niche topic that are trending right now. I can see which of my old posts are most popular and repurpose them. I can do Google keyword research on shoe-related phrases. I can set up a Google Alert on different shoe-related topics. Neither the lifestyle blog or niche blog is \u201cbetter\u201d, but a niche blog has more concrete methods of finding ideas because the topic is restricted. Narrow boundaries keep you from weaving all over the place. Niche blogs make idea and headline generation easier. Boundaries are good. 2. Niche Blogs Give You A Reliable Audience I have several personal blogs; a few are niche and a few are without boundaries whatsoever. My main blog is mainly personal, and I\u2019ll write on any topic that strikes my fancy. My core readers are those who connect with my personality and as an individual, and not with a specific topic. While that is valid, it isn\u2019t a reliable audience that you can build a huge email list or serious traffic on (unless you\u2019re already famous). The average blogger isn\u2019t generally going to be a mini-star with a huge following that clings to them no matter what they write. A great example is a viral blog post I had recently. The topic of the post was on food and health, and I picked up a lot of email subscribers who were interested in that topic. The next week\u2019s email came out and most of those subscribers went away. Why? Because they thought I was a food blog, and that\u2019s what they wanted. A niche blog will give you an audience that you understand, and that understands you. They are less prone to churn. Niche blogs give you an audience that you understand, and that understands you. 3. Niche Blogs Make It Easier To Monetize Your Blog Perhaps you\u2019ve decided you\u2019ll use advertising on your blog to earn income. Once again, niche blogs for the win. If you\u2019re blog is about everything, what ads will you sell? It\u2019ll be hit and miss to guess what ads will actually be the most successful. You don\u2019t know which topic makes your audience show up and read and therefore, you don\u2019t know which ads will interest them. It\u2019s also a hard sell to advertisers. They want to know what your blog is about. How do you sell an ad when your blog is \u201cabout me\u201d? The same can be said for ebooks, training, and other items that people use to make money through a blog. How will you choose a topic for an ebook, or training, and know that your readers will buy it, if you\u2019re not writing a niche blog? You have no idea what they\u2019d spend money on or like to learn. All you know is that they are willing to come to your blog to hear your random thoughts on all kinds of topics for free. 4. Niche Blogs Expand Your Own Knowledge Blogs that aren\u2019t niche blogs don\u2019t generally do in-depth coverage on a particular topic. Their lifeblood is the variety, and sometimes topic coverage is a bit like skipping stones. Each post glances at the surface of the topic and then moves on to the next topic. Niche blogs, however, encourage in-depth coverage of topics. They have to. You\u2019re only writing about one specific topic and you\u2019ll naturally dig in deeper and cover details as much as you can because there isn\u2019t another topic to bounce on to. For example, if you have a food blog, you wouldn\u2019t write just one blog post about whether you should use cold or room temp butter for making a cake and call it done, never to revisit butter temperature again. Instead, you might do a series on how to properly use butter, and that might lead you to do features on more individual ingredients and how they affect your baking. With niche blogs, you don\u2019t have to come up with 1000 new ideas. You can start with three and approach them from every angle possible before moving on. A niche blog allows you to do that, but on a general lifestyle blog, you\u2019re just going to be seen as strangely obsessive about butter. You don\u2019t need 1000 new ideas on a #NicheBlog. A few, from all angles, will do. How To Start A Niche Blog The difference between starting a niche blog and any other blog isn\u2019t particularly magical or unusual. It involves research and planning before you jump in and start writing. It involves more than just the decision to \u201cstart a blog.\u201d It requires you to decide to \u201cstart a blog about ___.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for your niche blog to bring in money, you\u2019ll want to be even more conscientious in your selection of a niche topic. 1. Know Your Passion If you hate vegetables, deciding to write a niche blog about vegetables is a terrible idea. Even if you like vegetables well enough, it still might not be enough. Remember, you are going to be writing heavily about a very focused topic. That\u2019s going to be difficult enough. At least make it easy on yourself and have a serious passionate and interest in your niche. Otherwise, it\u2019s going to be a very short-lived blog. 2. Decide On Short Or Long Term Trend niche blogs won\u2019t last, but they can be profitable for a while. For example, your niche blog might capitalize on a TV show or movie. Once the show is no longer on the air, or the movie buzz has faded, your blog won\u2019t be the traffic horse it once was. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t do it. As long as you know, going in, that you\u2019re going to be in a bit of a pressure cooker to build traffic quickly, and are ready to capitalize on absolutely every last drop of it before it fades, go ahead. It\u2019s the way your entire blog exists by capitalizing on a trend. 3. Decide If And How You\u2019ll Monetize Your Site Perhaps you\u2019re writing your niche blog for the absolute love of the topic and don\u2019t care about bringing in money. Fair enough. Most people create a niche blog in the hopes of bringing in money, because niche blogs are uniquely able to handle advertising and affiliate marketing very well. Let\u2019s say you do want to use affiliate marketing. You will need to pick a niche topic where good affiliate marketing programs and products are available, and you\u2019ll get paid a decent commission. You\u2019ll need to research available affiliate programs and find a reputable one that fits what you need best. Or maybe you want to use advertising. Again, you\u2019ll need a blog whose topic attracts a specific audience that has advertisers eager to market to them. And, you\u2019ll need to build up traffic to a certain level before some advertising programs will even consider your blog. Remember to comply with the FTC and disclose on your blog if you decide to use affiliate marketing or paid reviews. Niche blogs are uniquely set up to bring in advertising and affiliate marketing money. 4. Find Your Keyword Niche You\u2019ve decided you\u2019ll write about coffee for your niche blog. But \u201ccoffee\u201d is still pretty broad\u2013are you talking about growing coffee? roasting coffee? brewing coffee? fair trade coffee? coffee culture? buying coffee? cooking with coffee? You need to find specific keywords if you want your niche blog to bring in money and traffic. Google\u2019s Keyword Planner is the most popular tool, and even though there is no shortage of blog posts telling you how to find the best keywords, you might consider Google\u2019s own instructions on using Keyword Planner, too. Which site will be easier to target with affiliate marketing, advertising, and keywords: A niche blog about photography, or a niche blog about Nikon cameras? Sometimes the extreme niche blog is the way to go when you are looking to monetize your site and find precise keywords that do the heavy lifting. When it comes to traffic and monetizing your blog, the more focused your audience is, the better. 5. Tighten Up Your Current Blog Maybe your current blog went off track and became a blog about everything. How do you turn your blog into a niche blog? Look at your categories. You\u2019ll notice that a blog off track often has category and tag bloat. Which category do you seem to write in the most? That\u2019s a good hint at where your passion and interest for blogging lies. Look at your stats. Which of your posts tend to get the most traffic? This is an indicator of why people come to your blog, and it is also an indicator of a post that has done well in search. Dissect the post. What\u2019s the topic? How did you write it? What brings the search engines? Make more posts like this on the most popular topic. Do some pruning. You might consider removing posts that are completely off-topic. If you absolutely must write on more than one topic, why not start a personal blog elsewhere and rehab your current blog into a niche blog? If your blog has been around a while, build on that traffic and following while you regain focus as a niche. Resist that spontaneous post. If you catch yourself feeling like you just have to post a photo and story about your dog and the cute thing he did today, stop. Don\u2019t put it on your blog. That is more appropriate for social media, or your personal lifestyle blog. Again, if you must have this outlet, create a personal blog to do it on. Keep your niche blog purely on topic, always. Don\u2019t give up on a wayward blog. Even if you haven\u2019t stayed on topic over the years, it\u2019s not too late to start. Decide today that you will have a niche blog, and get that mindset in place. ",

Views or Spaces are other axes to sort these. The reader infers that there are more blogs about these subjects. Search automatically eliminates duplicates though. To be unique, writers may select specializations within subtopics. Their local stats rank material by type. Content does not last forever, e.g. under technology. Someone may be looking for a new niche and what is likely ahead of the hype curve or next big thing. The blog itself may be content marketing for preferences or other destinations. The question has to be interpreted since popular could have connotations based on related contexts, counts, and clusters, such as keywords, messages, searches, ads, affiliates, products, publications, promotions, professional services, startups, or hashtags, to name a few. Market analysis tools would be identified as sources for audience indicators and trends. Since the answer changes along with conditions, this is also begging the research question like a poll.

Because it's obviously something you love doing. And when you love what you do, it will be impossible to give up! Which is of paramount importance.

Once you have the business plan completed, you will have a road map for where you want to go and the milestones along the way so that you can measure your progress and to make sure that you stay on course. Your business plan will have the results of your research and budgeting. If you don\u2019t have a clue on how to build the business plan, I suggest you hire a business consultant. With their help you will get a marketing consultant and me (maybe) as your web presence consultant. You don\u2019t have to hire anybody if you are inclined to do it yourself. Search online for business plans. You\u2019ll get all sorts of templates and some help on how and why to use them. Your business plan will take a while to build so be patient. Do it right and you will have a competitive advantage when you launch. ",
