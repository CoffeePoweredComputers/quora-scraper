            "answer_text": "Interesting Question. I can share with you my experience of improving English writing online. Key Word: Quora, Italki, Deliberate Practice One Basic Principle: striking a balance between the input and output of English. The input of English refers to the learning of any new words, phrases or sentences I read in books or hear from radio or TV programs. The output means practicing these new words, phrases or sentences in my writing or speaking. Striking a balance between the input and output means a language learner shall proportionally allocate his/her learning efforts and time between these two activities. Otherwise, the learning will be inefficient.Based on my learning experience, if I only focus on the input side, I may learn the meaning of those new words and phrases, but I\u2019m not able to internalize them as my own words. Conversely, if I spend too much time on the output while making light of the input, I, being short of the knowledge of the idiomatic usage and vocabulary, will not be able to write and speak natural English.Therefore, in order to master English language in a more efficient way, it is important to strike a balance between the input and output.Two Rules which shall be continuously applied throughout the learning process. Repetition of Practice. We, as curious human beings, are always hungering for fresh knowledge and information. Unfortunately, such hunger is also the reason why we fail to retain what we have learnt, because the time which should have been spent on reviewing has been used on gaining new knowledge and information. If we are constantly indulging ourselves in the eagerness for new things, we will sooner or later get lost in the sea of knowledge. Therefore, effective acquisition of English lies chiefly in the repetition of practicing what have been learnt, rather than searching for and learning new knowledge.Getting Feedback. There is no doubt that feedback is the most important factor in the learning process. Otherwise, you will always make the same mistakes all the time. Therefore, in my opinion, practicing without feedback is a waste of time.Based on the above principle and rules, I made a plan several month ago, which aims to improve my English writing by using Quora and Italki. The general idea is to answer interesting questions in English on Quora. Step 1: Find an interesting question on Quora which I\u2019m able to give an informative answer. The more interesting the question is, the more you will be motivated to research and answer the question. Step 2: Create a Database of the vocabulary on the topic. After the question has been chosen, I will intensively read English materials and watch or listen to English videos or audios in order to collect English expression relevant to the topic. By reading and watching, I will accumulate lots of vocabulary and idiomatic usage, based on which, a database can be created. These vocabulary and idiomatic usage can be used in my answer. Step 3: Draft an answer to the question and have it revised by a native English user. You can find such English teacher on \u201cItalki\u201d. Usually, after my English teacher revises my writing, we will schedule a class discussing the mistakes I made in my answer. By this means, I can get immediate feedback on my writing and avoid the same mistake next time. Step 4: Post the answer on Quora. I will type the revised answer on Quora instead of copying-pasting the answer. I believe it is a good repetition practice, which can help me review the vocabulary, idiomatic usage as well as the mistakes I made. Hope the above answer is of help to you. Sincere gratitude to Ms. Lauren James, who helped me polish the language of the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Thanks:) Browsing Google is not enough to find the best English learning  websites on the net. Google usually brings you the same websites you\u2019ve  already seen hundreds of times before, and you just can\u2019t get those  quality English learning websites you want. So let me share with you, some of the best websites to learn English online that would probably be hard to find yourself.   1. MyEnglishTeacher.eu  This website always provide you with the best  tips, websites and materials to learn English.

PhraseMix  One of the most enjoyable English learning  websites on the net. Aaron from Phrasemix teaches you English phrases in  a new way. Just look at this amazingly designed website! And that\u2019s  just the beginning.You may ask, why should I learn English phrases?! Well, it is  important to know them, because this is what you will mainly use in your  conversations. You don\u2019t want to be searching for English words each  time you talk to someone. It would be so much easier to have access to a  bank of phrases that can be memorized. And you are ready to speak!  3. English as a Second Language on About.comIf you are looking for an English learning website with the largest  amount of English learning materials, tips, videos, quizzes, vocabulary  and grammar exercises, then this is your site.What topics should you expect?

The only thing they don\u2019t have information about is the latest apps  to learn English on your mobile device. But, no need to worry. You will  find English learning app reviews here on One-to-one Skype English lessons with native American or British teacher Blog. 4. Voice of AmericaSimilarly to About.com, you will find a lot  of information here. What is great about this site is that you can  learn American English whilst watching the latest news on topics like  the world, USA, business, education, health, entertainment, science and  technology. Very, very useful and FREE. 5. English Central  Last week, I got a question on our Facebook page.  One of our fans asked me if I knew any easy and short video dialogues  with exercises to improve listening. I directed her to English Central,  where you are able to improve not only English listening skills, but  also English pronunciation and vocabulary. All for FREE.I believe this is a very powerful website and definitely deserves to be on this list of best English learning websites. 6. Holmwoods  Holmwood\u2019s  Online Learning can provide you with extra reading and listening  practice material. Plus, many exciting exercises which you can do at  home by yourself. Annual subscription costs \u20ac34.99. 7. News In Levels  An extremely useful English learning  website.

Highly efficient if you want  to focus specifically on the areas you are the weakest in. 8. How do you do?  \u2018How do you do?\u2019 is an amazing idea by some Polish guys. It\u2019s simple, and it\u2019s FREE. Once again, it\u2019s really simple.  What you can do here, is practice English SPEAKING with NON-native  speakers around the world using Skype. The tool basically connects you  to other people who also want to focus on speaking in English.I like the idea, because here you don\u2019t have to spend time teaching the other person to speak your language, as you do on language exchange websites (you will find my blog post here about the TOP 10 BEST language  exchange websites). You both simply practice speaking ONLY English  together, and this is a HUGE benefit. ",
