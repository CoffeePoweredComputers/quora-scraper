            "answer_text": "Creative writing is pretty much anything you want it to be. You can be as fact-based as you\u2019d like, you can be as dreamy and incoherent as you\u2019d like\u2026it\u2019s free-form writing that you do to honestly please no one but yourself. Hey, you might even please some other people and get this published, get \u2019em to read it, lovely. Technical writing is typically done to explain something about a high-tech or professional product or process to people who don\u2019t know about it. So it\u2019s expository writing, versus creative writing (which can also be expository of course, being creative, live your bliss). So it has some specific criteria: You need to have something you\u2019re explaining to people. it might be:Why something exists, and why it\u2019s relevant to you (potentially, which is identifying an audience).What it does.How to install/configure/update/upgrade/uninstall it.Other information related to usage.This has to be information that\u2019s accurate, preferably validated in some way by the author, or people the author\u2019s worked with (like the people who\u2019ve built an application, designed a web site or process, or walked through some activity you\u2019re now describing to others). You get to figure it out (smart) and help others (nice), yay!It should be able to, ideally, account for at least the most common scenarios (say ~85%) a person might encounter in relation to that technical scenario and allow that person to go ahead with a more informed decision on whether/how to act with that information.It should be easy to read and understand.Yeah, I know the last one\u2019s funny to a lot of people who\u2019ve read technical writing, but seriously, if you\u2019re writing confounding technical documentation, you\u2019re screwing something up in there, possibly through some weird belief that you need to make this difficult and boring so that only the \u2018true believers\u2019 will read and then try to do that stuff you wrote about. Sad. But anyway, that\u2019s the difference. So in that sense, technical writing can be creative writing, but creative writing can be pretty much anything it feels like. Don\u2019t write things you don\u2019t enjoy! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The primary difference between the two forms of writing can be measured based on the audience, subject matter, languages, expression, and platform on which they base. While presentation, lucidity, clarity, and brevity are some the key factors to differentiate them from each other, you also find the difference of source information, spontaneity of expression, and emotional and motivational reasons as other factors. As the name suggests, creative writing is the wing of writing which does not follow strict boundary of writing style, expressional exactness, and systematic format. Creative writing might be following types of writings: An emotional outburst, which is expressed in poems, lyrics, and songsAn intellectual expression, which can be expressed essays, modern theoriesFictional story based writing which are expressed in drama, plays, novels, scripts etc.A report of excessive emotional expression which are detailed in travel writing, ghost writing etc.A promotional and advertorial, which are expressed in copies, scripts, screenwriting, and play writingDetailed expression of an incident or place which are detailed in reports and featuresTechnical writing is based on systematic and scientific writing procedures, which include facts, information, simplicity, exactness, and accuracy of the information expressed. It strictly follows rules, styles, and expressions to write anything. There are sufficient clarity on the reasons, motivations, and requirements and planning of writing particular documents. There no exaggeration or ambiguity required in this writing; rather clarity, exactness, and accuracy are key factors in the writing technical documents. The following types of documents come under technical writing: A hardware or software user guide that discussed about a product or serviceA quick help guide that helps the user to easily get info for simple installation or repairA functional specification documents that discusses functions of a product or servicesOnline help files, the gives instant details about a topic while working the product or serviceA training manual that help the user to get started with the product or serviceAn installation guide that help the user on how to install the productA whitepaperA brochureA technical specification documentA business requirement documentA business proposal documentI hope this helps\u2026.:) ",
