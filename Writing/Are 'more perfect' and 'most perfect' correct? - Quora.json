It cannot not be better. Nothing can be better that \u201cperfect\u201d. If something was better that whatever was \u201cperfect\u201d then what was was called \u201cperfect\u201d was not \u201cperfect\u201d. \u201cPerfect\u201d means 100%. There is no 100.00001% . So nothing can be \u201cmore perfect\u201d. It can only be \u201cbetter\u201d than anything else except \u201cperfect\u201d. \u201cMost perfect\u201d would mean that something would be \u201cbetter\u201d than the \u201cbest\u201d, in which case the \u201cbest\u201d would be worse that the \u201cbetter\u201d, which cannot be. \u201cMore perfect\u201d is \u201cbetter\u201d. And \u201cMost perfect\u201d is best. The \u201cbetter\u201d and the best\u201d may or may not be \u201cperfect\u201d. You could have two \u201cperfects\u201d, in which case they would be \u201cequal\u201d. Do I make myself most perfectly clear? ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. English often treats absolute adjectives (ones that either apply or don\u2019t) as gradable (more or less applicable). For example, complete is often called absolute: a job is either complete or it isn\u2019t. But we don\u2019t hesitate to say almost complete or nearly complete or even put a number on it and say 75% complete, like a software upgrade. This reintroduces gradability, and we can understand more complete as meaning \u2018more nearly complete, closer to completion\u2019. If John\u2019s work is 75% done and Mary\u2019s work only 50% done, it is legitimate to say \u201cJohn\u2019s work is more complete than Mary\u2019s work.\u201d However, more perfect union is a red herring: the word perfect in that sense does not mean \u2018ideal\u2019 but in fact \u2018complete\u2019: the more perfect union sought by the constitutional convention was a more complete union between the U.S. states. Similarly, infinite often means in ordinary language \u2018very, very large\u2019 rather than \u2018endless, unbounded\u2019, and so nearly infinite is a sensible notion. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are incorrect. Perfect denotes a state that can\u2019t be improved upon, so a comparative and superlative are impossible and illogical. Just as one can be dead but not more dead or most dead, a thing can be perfect but not more perfect or most perfect.

Yes, I know that more perfect union appears in that sacrosanct American document, but usage changes over time and in 2018, you may not modify perfect if you want to be grammatical. ",

Just like how \u201creal, wrong\u201d can have multiple layers of connotation when used in specific ways i.e. I hoped it was a dream, but the experience couldn\u2019t have been more real. It is wrong to divest a person of his precious freedom, but it is even more wrong to take his heart. (Maybe not too convincing example sentences here) Anyway, here is where \u201cperfect\u201d can have a more gradable meaning:- During his performance the piece was so cleanly executed, so heavenly it left his audience enthralled - it couldn\u2019t have been any more perfect. [perfect is closer to \u201cgreat\u201d, \u201cmagical\u201d in this sense] However, it is still not possible to use \u201cperfect\u201d in comparative and superlative forms when the word has an \u201cextreme\u201d sort of connotation and does not allow for gradations in meaning. \u2018He earned a perfect score on his most recent maths test\u2019 [I cannot imagine what a \u2018more perfect score\u2019 than an already \u2018perfect\u2019 score (100%) would be] Hope it helped!

The US Constitution is a canonical work of writing so \"more perfect\" is correct by premise.  The meaning is clear too, it's just an inverted use of \"more\" to mean approaching the quality of the adjective it modifies, not expanding on the quality - in other words, closer to.  Similarly, in \"most perfect\" the word most means \"closest to\" rather than \"having the greatest amount of\". Next stop, \"nearly perfect\" and \"nearly infinite\".  What do those mean? ",

For example, in both philosophy as well as science + mathematic there are degrees of what is seen as absolute in quotidian reality. Specifically, in math + physics, there are notions of smaller, larger + greater infinities depending upon the scale of reference. One also has countable infinities as well as uncountable. Likewise, ideologies also surface be it finitism, intuitionism, constructivism, etc. Where one might get into grey areas would be physical states of being such as pregnancy, death, illness, evil, etc. However, I would aver that in many cases there could arguably be a case for degree of said quality.
