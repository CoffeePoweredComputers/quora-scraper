            "answer_text": "Every time I\u2019ve taught the course (undergraduate), I\u2019ve been saddled with someone else\u2019s choice of text. And they\u2019ve generally been isomorphic (the same) and not particularly inspiring. So I\u2019m going with speculation here - in terms of what I think would be more student-friendly. If I were ever to teach the course again, I would choose Messer\u2019s Linear Algebra solely because chapter one starts with vector spaces and linear transformations. Every other LA book I know of pushes this abstract part of LA way back behind a bunch of mind-numbing calculation techniques. I\u2019ve seen many students run into a brick wall after a month or two of dull drudge-work. So - I speculate that it would be much better to introduce the abstract notions right up front with the promise that \u201cWe\u2019re going to get into the nuts and bolts of this later and learn some useful notation and techniques.\u201d The other book I will mention is Strang\u2019s. I\u2019ve met the guy and - my opinion - he seems as dry as his book. However, I\u2019m a pure mathematician and Strang is very much applied. I\u2019ve heard very positive comments from students who worked through Strang\u2019s book as the best math book they\u2019ve ever had. All science and engineering types, but there you go. I was surprised to see the book criticized by a physics type below. On the graduate level, I have to go with Hoffman-Kunze\u2019s Linear Algebra. It\u2019s somewhat formulaic in the vein of the undergraduate texts I\u2019m scoffing at above, but being grad level, it moves past the drudgery quickly and barges into the realm of abstract algebra with no apologies. That\u2019s OK if you\u2019re up for it. It\u2019s in the bottom half of my top ten hardest ever math books. Like calculus, EVERYONE (including me) thinks they have a better way of presenting linear algebra - hence the wagon-load of books on the subject. My sampling says that Messer\u2019s book is the only one that is significantly different yet still at a reasonable introductory level. There are other decent books besides H-K at the graduate level and, naturally, they are going to cater to a particular author\u2019s take on the role of the subject in the broad scheme of mathematics. If I were to assay an advanced text on LA, I would definitely start with rings and modules - squeeze some background from there and then settle into the meat of LA which is fields and vector spaces. (Basic knowledge of vector spaces, bases, matrices and linear maps would be assumed.) Module theory is the same thing - vector spaces are just a bit more restricted so you can get sharper theorems. Well - it turns out it\u2019s a LOT more restricted. All hell breaks loose when your scalars aren\u2019t invertible. ",

            "answer_text": "There might be different levels to which you would like to read the topic. Here's my selection :-  An absolute introduction which will tell you nicely about the basics would be Serge Lang's \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\". It's strange people did not recommend that. People often confuse between Serge Lang's other book \"Linear Algebra\" which is slightly advanced and is not primarily for first timers. Though he clearly mentions this that the \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" is a prelude in the preface, but then how many people do read that section.These two books have been well written in a manner that the author seems to communicate as if he's teaching you in person. There's nothing like learning from someone who has made contributions to the Bourbaki. These books are written with good rigour and should set you apart.Gilbert Strang's books cover the entire course in two different perspectives \"Introduction to Linear Algebra\" and \" Linear Algebra and its Applications\" looking into concepts and applications respectively. The latter is only if you want to explore the applications, little depth is given for the concepts. Introduction covers all the major concepts and has a good perspective on visualizations of the abstract concepts. A good choice if you like visual interpretations. This is some advanced text \"Linear Algebra\" by Peter Lax. Avery concise book only for those who wish undertake a lot of hard work to understand it thoroughly. You might want to stay away if you don't know about the book, Courant guys you see :)The duo of \"A primer on Linear Algebra\" and \" Matrix Theory and Linear Algebra\" by I.N. Herstein is yet another great choice with increasing order of difficulty. Herstein is popular for giving tough times to people with his exercises. Though I haven't read the book myself, My prof. says \"The one who did Herstein in my times was known by that fact\". Herstein books are out of print and only Library copies and second hand versions might be available.Once (if) you do all of them you can rest assured that you among the very few to have gained extreme mastery of the topic. If only basics required stick to the first 2.",

            "answer_text": "For many students the first time rendezvous with linear algebra is like hitting a brick wall. The first semester in nearly every college offers an introductory linear algebra course touching on topics like rank of a matrix,echelon forms, and the very brutal Vector space. In my case I was so much unaware about the existence of such a topic in Mathematics that the linear algebra lectures simply propelled past my head,like fireladen missiles at times tangentially scratching my scalp. Oh!\u2026those classes were no less scary and tormenting than a gory and grisly horror show. After those classes I had a feeling that I have Catatonia. The professor went on teaching basis and sub-space while I went on wondering what it was that he was actually blathering about. Is it some alien language or if it is so that he has gone nuts and needs an urgent mental checkup. The professor would explain an impossible to comprehension topic and say smiling like Sherlock Holmes \u201cIt\u2019s elementary\u201d ,ofcourse not ending as\u201dMy dear Watson\u201d! So this drama continued for almost two months but still my aptitude in the subject was a complete zlich. But now at this juncture I came across three books that changed my notion. They are Linear algebra by Ward CheneyLinear algebra and its applications by David C. Lay.Linear algebra and its applications by Gilbert StrangAll of the above three are excellent books.I bought the second one and truly it made me realize that linear algebra afterall isn\u2019t that tough. The book is just brilliant. Each material presented in the book is absolutely flawless,complete in itself and meticulous. Grazing through the pages you automatically start feeling an inner thirst to know more, a lambent flame start strobbing in your heart as the book enlightens you with its treasure,you are compelled to turn more and more pages and unravel the throbbing mystery . In this book each topic has been supplemented with generous amount of drawings to help visualize concepts and get a more intuitive taste of the subject that is very much beneficial in the long run. So now you all might wonder why so long an answer when only a three line answer was quiet possible. I would just say that this was only to help students who are facing a similar problem to just kind of relate with me and select a book that will make things go smooth and hush up the turbulence in life once again. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "The Schaum Outline of linear algebra is great and easy to read. I also liked \u201cLinear Algebra\u201d by Michael O'Nan. It is very clear and begins very concretely. By the end, if memory serves, it gets to really cool stuff like dual spaces, and, I think, the natural isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space and its second dual space. This is a fabulously beautiful result and I wish that everyone could be exposed to it! This book is out of print but still available. These are the two books I used to study linear algebra in high school and I very clearly remember being floored by the aforementioned isomorphism, so that result is probably covered in one or the other, if not both. Axler's \u201cLinear Algebra Done Right\u201d is bound to be great, although I don't own it and haven't examined it in detail. Strang's books strike me as unbearably tedious and ugly. For the basic stuff on Gaussian elimination, the Schaum Outline is all you need. For numerical linear algebra, the classic \u201cMatrix Computations\u201d by Moler and Van Loan is the place to start and the go-to reference. I also like the books by Serge Lang. His \u201cAlgebra\u201d is where I learned something about Galois theory. I haven't looked at his book on linear algebra, but I'm sure that if you like mathematics you will enjoy it. I hope this helps! Have fun! ",

But the requirements of people wanting to study linear algebra vary considerably hence no single book can be called as among best suited for an individual\u2019s needs. My suggestions would be Not to suddenly jump and start reading the books which addresses applications of your interest. Have patience to read the fundamentals first well enough.Choose a book which covers basic foundations. Good books are Linear Algebra by authors: 1) Hoffmann and Kunz 2) Curtis 3) Halmos 4) Algebra book by Herstein 4) Lang (Advanced) 5) Rotman (Advanced) 6) short crisp book value for money by Sahai and Bisht (Indian book)For problems you can solve problems in the above books but there is the best book for problems: Halmos, Linear Algebra Problem Book.For applications you might want to look at well known books such as Applied Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang or Applied Linear Algebra by Noble.But you need to ask experts in specialized areas such as ML, Computer Science, Engineering Computations, OR who are the bulk consumers of Linear Algebra which are most relevant books.Hope the answer helps.

            "answer_text": "If you have never attempted to seriously study Linear Algebra before, I would recommend:The Manga Guide to Linear AlgebraOnly the essentials are presented for the beginners, and there are effective illustrations for the concepts.  You will finish it for its cute characters and the plot (literally!). And the plot interacts with the subject - it is not just only for the sake of entertainment - for example the \"sensei\"'s command is the author's metaphor for linear transformation. I shared this book with one of my bunkmate (I am from Singapore, serving NS) and he finished it, despite being indifferent to mathematics. Of course, this is only an introduction: it is not rigorous (no proofs at all, and no practices). It will at least give you an outline nevertheless. If you really want to master linear algebra, it is best you enroll into a linear algebra course formally. At least for me, self-studying will not get you far, unless you have like-minded peers who will endure with you. This is an issue already addressed by the top writers in mathematics here:\u200eAlon Amit (\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05df \u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea)\u200e's answer to What is the best way to learn Galois theory?

The basics are covered adequately just like his YouTube videos. If you need a Computational Approach to Linear Algebra, I will recommend you start with \u2018Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications using MATLAB\u2019 by William Ford. That book is a life saver! Then if you need to go deep and learn from the masters, Any of the following books is perfect. Numerical Linear Algebra by Lloyd Trefethen and David BauApplied Numerical Linear Algebra by J.W DemmelMatrix Computations by G.H. Golub and C.F Van Loan.Applied Numerical Linear Algebra by W.

            "answer_text": "Although Gilbert Strang from MIT is considered one of the premier world authorities in linear algebra I cannot recommend his book because it appears to be designed for honors students. It simply tries to teach too much for a one-semester introductory course in elementary linear algebra.  If you are like me you would rather attempt a gentler introduction to linear algebra which itself can be very challenging even if you had already taken a course in higher calculus (i.e. differential equations) then I recommend Elementary Linear Algebra by Larson & Falvo. It is an excellent text that also has a solution manual if you should choose to acquire it. When I took the course at my local community college it cost me $200 from the college book store. But you can get it new at the link provided for only $51.19 and used from $36.55: Elementary Linear Algebra, by Larson, 6th Edition ",

In fact, the determinant is not introduced until the last chapter (after all the necessary results involving eigenvalues are explained and proven)!  Strang is great, but I find it too mechanical.  If you want something more advanced, you can always check out the book by Peter Lax. ",

            "answer_text": "I recommend Apostol's Calculus, volume II. Despite it's title, it has 5 chapters exclusively dedicated to linear algebra. It's problems are well elaborated and have different levels, from the basics to advanced ones. The basis of linear algebra is very well explored and it includes a lot of applications to calculus. Furthermore, the reach of the book is profound, in the sense it has rigorous profs to almost every theorem and clear definitions.I found a PDF link on the web, check it out! www.matematica.net/portal/e-books/Apostol%20-%20CALCULUS%20-%20VOLUME%202%20-%20Multi%20Variable%20Calculus%20and%20Linear%20Algebra,%20with%20Applications%20to%20Differential%20Equations%20and%20Probability.pdf Hope to have helped!

This is a very thorough and rigorous graduate level book in linear algebra, with plenty of exercises. It does use some abstract algebra, especially ring theory, but it covers the necessary prerequisite material in the preliminaries chapter. It is a bit terse, and would be a little too fast if you\u2019ve never done any proof-based linear algebra before. In that case, I\u2019d recommend starting with a more introductory level proof-based book (I personally liked working through the first 6 chapters of Berberian\u2019s Linear Algebra) before moving on to Roman.

But in masters people should dig deep in the subjects. So if you are mastering in EE then your text should be \u201cLA and its applications\u201d by Gilbert Strang. A nice reference can be \u201cIntroduction to applied LA\u201d by Boyd-Vandenberghe. There are books of LA which are more mathematical and less application oriented. And Strang has a nice intutive style which engineers around the globe love. And yes, there are also books which have \u2018applications\u2019 in their title, and they cover essentially the same thing as Strang\u2019s, but they are not Strang. P.S it was a typical fanboy style answer :p. Edit 1. I myself learnt from Nakos-Joyner in masters.But fell in love with Strang later. ",

For advanced topics like Krylov space methods, preconditioners for large-scale sparse matrix, Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems by Yousef Saad is a must have.

Basically; linear agebra is just addition and multiplication BUT you use the beautiful theory to short circuit the computations. At first glance linear algebra (with its vectors and planes and hyperplanes) seems to have limited usefulness but any sufficiently smooth function in a small neighbourhood is essentially linear so you can apply the powerful theorems of linear algebra. \\U0001f603 ",

I find No Bullshit Guide to Linear Algebra really good at explaining simple concepts to students new to linear algebra. The contents are as theoretically correct as any typical textbooks but the writing style and explanations are a lot easier to understand. I feel like walking away understanding key definitions better or at least can recall what they are approximately about, rather than definition memorization in many \u201cpopular\u201d texts. ",

In particular, Axler\u2019s book is very formulaic in its approach, almost reading like an analysis textbook, which suited me well since I had taken multiple analysis courses before taking linear algebra and was used to that style of exposition.
