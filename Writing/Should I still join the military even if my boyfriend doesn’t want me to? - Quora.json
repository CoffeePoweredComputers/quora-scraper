It\u2019s either him or the service, which one you choose is none of our concern, only you can choose. Story time: I had an online relationship about two years back with a little, she was an adult at the time. Thankfully it didn\u2019t last long as our maturity levels were so different, but I will say she was a wonderful person. She had mentioned how she had gone to a recruiter, stating she wanted to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps of becoming a Marine. And here\u2019s the thing, I was fine with it. I had no control over her, after all we were an online relationship. I discussed with her why she wanted to, if she understood what it would take, and that she should never give up. I also told her that I worried about her in the future, and if she\u2019s deployed to always be careful. Most of what our conversations were about were to help me understand certain things, and make sure she really KNEW she wanted this. Our relationship ended maybe a month before she went to boot camp, we had stayed friends and for the summer I was excited to hear whether or not she became a Marine or not. It was maybe August when she got back to me with a photo of her in uniform standing at attention, smiling the great big smiles you see from every new Marine on Quora. I\u2019ll see if I can find the photo, and her account. For most guys it\u2019s the fear of the unknown. Will she be deployed?? Is she going to face harassment by her male colleagues?? If my current little decides the military is the way to go I will be more mature about it, show less of my feelings, and make sure she knows what she wants to do upon graduating. I will worry for those weeks, but once she comes out a new person I\u2019ll be the happiest man in the world, and maybe, just maybe she can smack some sense into me, and help me out when I need it.

You are going to meet a bunch of driven, fit, loyal, dedicated young men. At about a 10:1 ratio.Weighted against these guys, your boyfriend isn\u2019t going to make 2nd place. I\u2019ve been in over 40 years. In that time I can only think of a dozen ladies who didn\u2019t end up with an army boyfriend, at least for some of the time. Lastly you will be entering a world where he won\u2019t be 1st place. You won\u2019t be able to take the morning off work to take his dog to the vet, If your unit has to work late, he\u2019ll have to learn to make dinner.You will be too busy doing your own laundry to do his. But let\u2019s say he is that guy who is better than all the guys you\u2019ll be working with, good on you, you have a keeper. The ladies who have boyfriends/husbands outside the military, have exceptional men, who love the heck out of their wives. I say, join and let the chips fall where they may. ",
