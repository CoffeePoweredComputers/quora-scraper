            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I don\u2019t think they do. I think they may accept what you believe to be ridiculous because you and they have had very different life experiences and you and they have found different explanations as to how life works. World-views are idiosyncratic. Who is to say that yours is the correct one? Or mine? I once dealt with a case where a couple had identical twin girls. For some, unknown, reason the mother had bonded with one of them but not the other. The mother had a lot of problems and the father was a rather weak individual who did not protect his children very well from his wife\u2019s decidedly erratic behaviour. The mother fed and looked after one of the girls adequately but treated the other, not merely neglectfully, but cruelly. For example, if the child refused to eat what had been put in front of her the mother would bang her head against the wall next to the kitchen table. I saw crime scene photos which showed there was actually an indentation in the plasterboard of the wall next to the child\u2019s chair. When the authorities finally intervened the abused child, aged around six by then if my memory serves, weighed around half what her identical twin sister weighed and was substantially shorter. Without wishing to get too emotive about it, she looked like the survivor of a concentration camp. Knowing nothing of their background, were you to interview those children separately I would be willing to guess that one of them would convey the sense that she saw the world as a harsh and dangerous place and her mother as an unpredictable tyrant. The other, if she was sufficiently sensitive, may display signs of cognitive dissonance but if she were insensitive or believed, along with her mother, that her sister deserved the treatment meted out to her, she may describe the world as a fair place where people get what they deserve. How would you explain the difference in their world-views? Would you choose one and call it the truth? Would you label one of them deluded and the other rational? With the benefit of a wider perspective we can easily see where the truth lies. Returning to your question. What is your view about what is \u201cridiculous?\u201d It\u2019s a word loaded with judgment, after all. Who gets to decide what is ridiculous? You? Why? My advice? Go out into the world and speak to enough people about all of their life experiences so that you have satisfied yourself that you have a sufficiently wide perspective to judge whether or not they have accepted the \u201cridiculous.\u201d That requires humility and an open mind, otherwise all you are doing is confirming your own biases. But if you can manage it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good idea and possibly even the beginning of wisdom. I\u2019d be willing to bet that, while the objective world may not change as a result of your investigations, you are likely to be a different person by the end of it. ",

            "answer_text": "I have no idea. However, I can assure you that you yourself do this effectively all the time. How do we determine what makes sense? Pattern recognition. What mediates that pattern recognition? Human intelligence. What\u2019s that? Good luck\u2026 In order for pattern recognition to occur there must be a sequential precedent - namely \u2018something like this has happened before\u2019 - encoded into memory. Again how this occurs and in what format is deeply mysterious. Perhaps more importantly, the neurophysiological phenomena associated with the process are dynamic (read \u2018chaotic\u2019) such that memory is constantly revised according to both internal and external influences (The neurobiological bases of memory formation: from physiological conditions to psychopathology). So, our sense of disbelief arises from and is thus dependent upon the past. More importantly, \u2018the past\u2019 is anything but a record written in stone in terms of cognitive science. Saying \u2018it is written\u2019 somewhere in some external source is not that helpful either, since even regularly reviewed sources are distorted by the same continuous, complex, adaptive systems that produce our perception of anything. (A picture is worth a thousand lies: using false photographs to create false childhood memories.) Hence, one of the most ridiculous suggestions one can make is that of an objective view of the world that has predictive power. Such a supposition denies the nature of time (who knows if the sun will rise tomorrow?) and puts enormous faith in the foundations of one\u2019s own cognitive capacity which can easily be undermined using the same scientific methods that cognition employs to achieve its surety. If one cannot remember a fifteen digit sequence for more that half an hour how can one be sure of \u2018what happened\u2019 today? Yet, of course, one must suspend the most rational reason for disbelief (the demonstrable frailty of one\u2019s worldview) constantly in order to function. You are doing this right now. Amazing, huh?
