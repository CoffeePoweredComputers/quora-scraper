            "answer_text": "Hello, This is a fantastic question. As a professional blogger and copywriter, I\u2019m happy to answer it for you. Personally, this is one of my favorite questions to answer because my answer is never what my readers think it will be. I don\u2019t come up with ideas for blog posts. My audience does. I just write the content that they tell me they want to read. As a blogger/content writer, your best tool for discovering what your audience want to read is Google. Use Google Search to Source Content Ideas Google is the best way to gather insight into the minds of your readers because the search engine quite literally records every word that every user types into it (appx. 63,000 searches per second) and compiles that information into data sets that we can use to create content for those users. I assure you, the Google algorithm is infinitely more sophisticated than how I just described it, BUT for the purposes of sourcing content ideas, it\u2019s simple to understand and easy to use effectively. Here is how to use Google to find content ideas Identify Search Intent - Go to Google and type a random topic in the search bar and analyze the first page results. If the SERP is split into informational and transactional results, then you have an opportunity to cater to potential customers in different stages of the customer journey by writing both top-of-the-funnel and bottom-of-the-funnel content.Discover Keywords and Phrases - If you already have a topic in mind, simply toss it into Google and see what turns up. Read through the top 5-10 results and take note of the overlapping words, phrases and topics. Then utilize the skyscraper method to create content that both utilizes those keywords and builds on those topics.Use Google Suggest, Related Searches and People Also Ask - You can find even more keywords, topics and phrases to include in your content with the \u201cRelated searches\u201d and \u201cPeople Also Ask\u201d sections of the SERP. They are visible at the top and bottom of the search result page and very handy when looking for new content topics.Check out Google Trends - Google Trends is a remarkable tool that enables you to explore a keyword or topic\u2019s search demand and compare search popularity over time. Using the data you collect, you can then create a content outline that covers most, if not all related sub topics and keywords.Allow Guest Posts to Add New Voices to Your Brand If you exhaust Google search as a topics engine (you wont, but let\u2019s say you do), you can always allow allow guest posts to add new voices to your brand. If you do decide to allow guest posts remember to: Only publish content that adds to your blog.Only allow content from contributors that are actively involved in your industry.Ensure sure links in contributor bios are to quality relevant websites.Proof-read and edit all contributor submissions.For an in-depth look at guest posting, you can check out my article on How to Guest Post: A Content Writers Guide. Rewrite Old Content to Keep Things Current The only thing Google likes more than informative, quality content is informative, quality content that is frequently updated. If you have old content on your blog that isn\u2019t up to today\u2019s standards, consider rewriting it instead of starting a new post from scratch. It will take less effort and enable you to flex your expertise to Google and build trust between you and your customers. Speaking of trust\u2026 I hope I\u2019ve earned yours with my answer. If you\u2019d like to learn more, I encourage you to check out my article on How to Source Content Ideas, or visit my website at Otherworld Content. Good luck and good writing. ~ Jacob B.
