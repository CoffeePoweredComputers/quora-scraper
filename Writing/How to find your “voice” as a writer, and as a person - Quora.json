            "answer_text": "So, finding your voice is trickier than the trickiest trick. It\u2019s true, and I applaud anyone who was able to stumble upon their unique way of writing things. It\u2019s important to understand the flickering in your mind in order to accurately reflect your voice. Think, think, think independently, and then think a bit more and maybe even more than that. Instead of \u201cwhat would (\u2026) say?\u201d replace that god awful phrase with \u201cwhat the fuck would I say here? Ah yes, that!\u201d Phrase it differently for god\u2019s sake though, or even better yet, spin that phrase into something new and meaningful to you and you alone. Copycatting is a gigantic hell no when developing a voice. Taking and changing up aspects of styles that you like from other peculiar people is an okay way to start developing a voice early on. But, and I stress this heavily, don\u2019t rely exclusively on this. One of Nirvana\u2019s greatest influences was The Beatles, but the two are both very distinguished bands with a unique sound. Kurt took the pleasant melodies he so very much adored and incorporated them into something that was his own doing; that pleasantly grimy and dark sound. But dude, hear me out, you can still be pretty cool without that unique and individualistic factor going for you. In the end, technical skill and how well you connect with your fellow man is what people tend to clutch closest to their hearts. After everything is done and you\u2019re ready to kick back and relax, read your work out loud and make sure that it sounds like you\u2019d totally say that. It\u2019s gotta be totally you, not just 99% \u201chmm\u2026I wouldn\u2019t say all of this shit\u201d you. All or nothing, man. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question, I\u2019ll try to answer it. I have a certain voice I use when I am telling stories orally. It is hard to explain, and even harder to write. It is based on several people, including a few famous ones. Being bipolar, sometimes it comes easy, because in my manic stage, it is my natural voice. In my depressed stage, it never comes at all. When I am in that place that is neither manic nor depressed, I can write, but it is hard to focus. The voice I write at that time is not my \u2018voice\u2019 but a cheap imitation of it. The point is, finding your voice is something no one can tell you how to do. It is something you have to do on your own. I like to write humor, and it is designed to be read internally, not read out loud. How do I know this? Because when I read it out loud, it doesn\u2019t sound right. I have recorded myself so many times reading my own work that I no longer feel self-conscious about how I sound, and can focus on how the words sound rather than the tonal quality of my voice. Good luck, I think if I ever find my true writing voice, I will succeed where I have failed for so many years. ",
