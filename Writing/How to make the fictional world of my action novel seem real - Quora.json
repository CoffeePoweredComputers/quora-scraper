            "answer_text": "With the little details. Have the characters notice directions. Name streets. Have them see a bit of culture along the way. Instead of a car chase down a random street, have them go down that one cobble stone road by the old movie theater. You know, the one under the bridge, in that complex with the Sushi place and the French Gourmet place. Instead of having a gunfight in the middle of the street, have it on campus, near that one statue that looks like someone was trying to put up scaffolding for a building, but it fell over and they just left it there and called it art. Have them ducking behind the planter where the fourth grade plants their gardens for environmental science. The little details make the world more real. And it\u2019s not just places. It\u2019s people, too. Instead of the random police officer chasing the hero because of a mistaken identity, have it be Cassie, the overzealous rookie who spends all her time thinking about the day she makes captain, and how much this collar will help fast track her to that point. Instead of the barista delivering coffee as the main characters exchange a tense conversation, have it be the super pretty boy who looks like he could be a model, but instead has that fiery passion in his eyes that tells you he is an artist. Those details, which may seem unimportant, help give the world depth and reality. If you can set it in a city you know, you can use real landmarks. That saves you some time. ",
