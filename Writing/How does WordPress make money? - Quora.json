            "answer_text": "What a simple yet super loaded question. #1 researchMany bloggers blog about earning from blogging. In fact these people earn from blogging specifically by teaching people to earn from blogging. The most underutilized source of research for bloggers often is YouTube. Literally YouTube is video blogging aka Vlogging and much of the same techniques applies to both. While the earnings come in different ways the most profitable source of income is the same in most cases for both styles. #2 Reaching Potential VisitorsIf people do not know your blog is there then you cannot earn a penny from it. It doesn\u2019t get more simplified than that. You need to figure out a strategy to direct people back to your blog. #3 Keep people on your blogFacebook earns more money by keeping people on Facebook then letting them leave Facebook.YouTube earns more money by keeping people on YouTube than letting them leave YouTube.Pinterest is optimized to keep you on their platform also and they also now have Ads.-See the pattern? If people do not stay on the blog your opportunity to earn on the blog is almost non existent. This means you need to find out what you IT will be to keep them on the blog. #4 Turn viewers into advertisers.The best bloggers and vloggers get the most shares. Their fans are diehards. They want to spread the content they connect with to all corners of the world. Now the content creators (in your case you) can focus on everything after step 5 as the viewers are taking care of the first 4 steps. #5 You need to keep people coming back.This means showing people how to subscribe (email, RSS feed, Push Notifications, Social Media Followers, etc). -Whatever you can do to keep them coming back and building brand loyalty is your focal point and sticking to whatever it is that\u2019s doing it for you consistently. In some cases this means having a consistent schedule to release new content. In some cases it means simply making them feel a part of the experience. In some cases it means showing your personality and getting them to love YOU. In some cases it\u2019s showing how much of an expert you are and not as much your personality. In some cases it\u2019s about the cause or the mission. Figure out your IT and it might be multiple things that make up your magic sauce, and then stick to the magic sauce. #6 If you can\u2019t master the first 5 there is no profitability for you.Once you have dedicated and loyal returning subscribers whom are spreading your message you can monetize other people\u2019s products or create your own info product and monetize that way by selling to your audience. Many bloggers, vloggers, individuals and companies generate revenue from affiliate marketing. That can be as simple as hopping onto Amazon and joining their program and putting links to related products to your blog in the blog so people can buy said products or even doing product reviews of multiple products and putting the link to each product on amazon using your referral link to those products. In this scenario it doesn\u2019t matter which of the however many products they buy on amazon you still generate some sort of revenue.  Now let\u2019s expand upon a couple of principles most people miss when it comes to monetizing online. On YouTube they don\u2019t have to put ads manually anywhere, the platform handles that and the users are used to them so it does not detract from the experience. On a blog that\u2019s not the case. SO is it easier to monetize on YouTube?-Yes because it\u2019s done for you and it\u2019s not about going the extra mile as you will earn so much per view anyways on your videos (it\u2019s a ridiculously small ratio but it technically is that way so it still applies).-No because with targeted audience and more control over ads you can earn more on less people with the blog and proper clicks and conversions.-Yes because you don\u2019t need an email list for your subscribers to get emails about your new content-No because it\u2019s not natural for people to read the description to find affiliate links unlike on a blog where they scroll until the page ends-Yes because you need less tools to reach and maintain followers-No because you can do more on less effort with your tools with your blogging subscribers The BEST solution with the two styles is this:ad a video to every blog post and host the video on YouTube then embed it into the blog. Now the vlog counts as a traffic source for the video. Put the link in the video and the video counts as a traffic source for the blog. At the end of the video if people click on recommended video and your videos are recommended then it takes them to YouTube in which boosts your YouTube rating and your blog as a traffic source on Google\u2019s engines and takes them to another piece of content of yours which in turns send them back to your blog if they click the link you put in the description. You\u2019ve now got your users on your content on 3 different tabs and when exiting your content there are multiple more content pieces that can suck them back in. The more of you they consume the more likely they are to buy or click an ad that\u2019s located near your content. This also get\u2019s into SEO which also is a mixture of the first 4 steps as well. This also means SEO is a big focus for you. In all combining these two allows for you to do video reviews of current niche events and then you can turn the video into a blog post in between you working on your masterpieces. This should help you build your content schedule and keep people engaged. Again once the viewer is sharing your content your time is now focused on content creation, living and further exploring avenues to monetize. Or you can skip monetization as a focus and focus on growing your blog and asociated YouTube channel (which if built properly will pay you) and buld your brand to the point of acquiring sponsorship and with sponsorship checks you can earn a nice profit without having to worry about over selling or over advertising to your audience. The best strategy would be to implement some of everything there as it\u2019s only a couple of clicks per button and about 90 minutes per day difference between going all in and not going all in on this. Hopefully this gets you started properly so you can build to the point you create a new ripple of magic that you are able to share with the world. May your hopes, wishes and dreams come true.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you want to start earning money from your WordPress blog, the best piece of advice, I can give you, is to make sure you're blogging about the right things. This is fundamental, in fact, this is foundational. For example, I may be excited about midget socks, but if the market for midget socks doesn't exist, or it's so minuscule, then I'm just wasting my time. Similarly, if I'm interested in a certain type of mouse, but there are no advertisers looking to advertise the people interested in the topic that I'm blogging on, then I won't make any money. You have to build your WordPress blog on the right foundation. That's how you start running from it. In other words, you start earning from your WordPress blog even if you don't have any blog post yet. It's the concept that will make money. It's the potential that determines whether this thing that you engaged in is worth it or not. This is the kind of question that you need to ask before you even start thinking seriously about blogging. You need to ask yourself if you're going to be blogging about the right things. Then you have to start thinking about the follow-up question which is, \"How do I blog?.\" And to be honest, people screw this up all the time. Why? Do you think that they can just come up with all sorts of a topic as long as it's related to their niche, then their good? Well, that's the fantasy. And the truth is if you did that there's a 99% chance that you're just wasting your time. Blog post after blog post, day after day, no results. Keep that up and you'll lose your passion and before you know it, you quit. As we all know, the only way to fail is to quit. This explains according to the new your times 90-95 % of all blogs failed. You have to get results. This is why it's really important to reverse engineer what already works. Just because you're excited about a topic doesn't mean that your audience members would share your excitement. Instead, look at what they already excited about and come up with the better version. That's how you play the game. That's how you blog for money. On the other hand, if you're not interested in making money, then you can just blog about whatever comes to your mind. But since your question is how to earn money from your WordPress blog, then you have to blog about the right things and blog about them the right way. Use content that already works. The third element to this is building an audience distribution system from day zero. In other words, before you even decide to put up a blog, you have to visit all these places where your target members were already discussing your niche. I'm talking about Facebook rules, forums. Facebook pages, comment sections, YouTube channels and many more. You have to have a clear idea of where these people are. This way, once you come up with your own content, you just go back to those places and share your content. This is how you earn from your WordPress blog. This is how you pull traffic. And I'm not talking about bulk traffic that doesn't convert. I'm talking about traffic that is actually interested in what you have to say. You follow the sounds complicated, or the sounds that it's too much to do, or it's too technical, that's good news. You keep outsourcing your content production. You can even outsource your niche research. For example, if you're looking for a content specialist, you can hire native English American writers like Gene Eugenio which work for cents on the dollar. If you're looking for high-quality keyword research, you can go to places like Fiverr. You don't have to take any of this line down, the key here is to have a big picture of you of what you are about to do. That's how you ensure your success. Otherwise, if you're just going to think that blogging is just a passion project, then there's a good chance that you're probably going to fail. You'll lose interest afterward and before you know it, you start thinking that is more bothered than it's worth. ",
