            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. This is an example of a preposition error question. They are widely recognized as errors and even tested for on the SAT. Though imho they are unnecessary, they\u2019re important to know. Preposition errors can be categorized as idiom errors. An idiom is simply the way we say things because it\u2019s the way we say things. This makes it particularly difficult to learn for non-native speakers, while native speakers learn it intuitively because they hear it the same way over and over again their entire lives. For example, you always \u201cinsist on\u201d something never \u201cinsist to\u201d something, even though in many cases \u201cto\u201d would be more intuitive. And sometimes they are even context-dependent, for example, you agree with a person, but you agree to a proposal. So how will you be able to identify these preposition idioms in the future? Most online dictionaries will include several sample sentences that can help. So let\u2019s use this approach to tackle your question. Here\u2019s an online dictionary entry for the word synonymous. Scroll past the definition and related forms to example.  I highlighted each case where there was a preposition after the word synonymous. As you can see it is always used with the preposition \u201cwith.\u201d If I was copyediting a piece that said \u201csynonymous to,\u201d unless it was a non-standard usage, I would correct it to \u201csynonymous with.\u201d I hope that helps.

If history had been kinder, their name might have been equally synonymous with the computer revolution. This has led some scientists to predict the extinction of wines that are nearly synonymous with the liquid itself, such as Burgundy\u2019s pinot noirs or Bordeaux clarets. That tradition, Warren says, is near-synonymous with hazing. Pumpkins are synonymous with fall, whether that means carving them or cooking them. I hope this helps. ",
