            "answer_text": "VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. If I could go back in time and change something, I would want back all my minutes/hours spent in listening to people's stories stretched to the limit of being story-less. Let me take a moment to express what's going on in my head at such times. Aaaarrghhhhhh whyyy...! Yes. So.I don't know the technical and social aspects of \"striking up good conversations\" but I can think of a few people who always invoke this feeling in me: \"Why, why can't you try to place yourself in my position and think what parts of your story are likely to be of interest to me? It's the polite thing to do.\"  Think before you speak: It's not a crime not to, but if you want to be a good story-teller, you have to do what all good story-writers do: edit. Only here, it will be in your head. It's not so much about length. I am all for narrating and hearing long stories. It's more about the number of words-to-value added ratio. Skip the inessentials. They render the essential, interesting parts of your story ineffective.Don't say it all in one breath: Yes, you're probably all psyched up to share your excitement but your listener hadn't been preparing for it. Take a moment to calm down and then begin.Engage them, let them participate: Story-tellers enjoy one advantage that story-writers cannot: seeing and listening to the recipient's reactions. Look for it. The real art of storytelling lies in building a connection with your audience while you weave your tale. If your story about an adventurous road-trip reminds them of the time they were caught in a dangerous car accident, you are probably doing a good job at winning their undivided attention. Don't spoil it by hushing through their words saying, \"Yeah that's okay but listen to what I did next!\"Give them something to look forward to: Start with the end only if it is the most gripping part. Kind of like Agatha Christie in \"Why Didn't They Ask Evans\". Otherwise, don't make it a pain for them to listen to the whole thing when they know it all ends in you drinking a glass of soda.Props to you for using props! Your story becomes so much more lively and fun when you start using things and people around you to recreate the whole scene. Use those cups to tell me how your vehicles were all in a disarray before that show. Make two people shake their hands the way your friends did before one of them accidentally crushed the other one's. Help me visualize by explaining how that dog looked much like the one I had once been chased by.Visuals over audio is the thumb-rule, after all.And lastly, give your listener the freedom to tell you when they feel you are stretching it or could tweak the method a bit. You could even ask them if it's getting boring, if they want you to shorten it, etc. Nothing to feel bad about, it will in fact help you become a better story-teller. Every listener is different. And they are the best source to know what will catch their fancy and give your story the weight it deserves!",

            "answer_text": "Content and delivery are important.  Content -  Good stories are more about images than words. When appropriate, include depictions of smells, sounds, and other sensory details to bring the content to life. Storytellers should also leave gaps in their stories so that the audience can fill it in and own it themselves and therefore care more about it.  Delivery - Practice varying the pitch, tempo, and dynamics of your speech. When done correctly, and when aligned well with the content, these techniques will keep your listeners hooked and attentive. For inspiration, consider watching great standup comic routines. Pay attention to how they speak and how they move when they tell stories.  These tips were imparted to me by Kevin Brooks - Storyteller and Blue Planet - Public Speaking Training : Own The Room ",
