WHY do you want to write to a prisoner? Unless you knew the person BEFORE he was incarcerated, don\u2019t do it. If this is a childhood friend and you\u2019ve known him for years and years, fine. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting hooked up with a con artist. I\u2019ve known people in prison. I had a friend I\u2019d known for years who wound up at the Nevada State Penitentiary in Wells. He and several other inmates had a nice racket going where they\u2019d find lonely female \u201cpen pals\u201d to write to them. The first few letters would be \u201cnormal\u201d. Then the con started. They needed money on their books for this or that. Can they have some sexy pictures they can put under their pillow. Actually, they made copies and sold those photos to other inmates who did not just keep them under their pillows. One guy took his when he got out and began selling them on the internet. Several young ladies were shocked to discover their nudes all over the web. Worst case is when they want you to \u201cdo me a favor. This guy needs to drop off something for me\u2026\u201d Now he\u2019s given your address to other criminals. You could find your house being raided because that innocent-looking teddy bear he wanted you to send him was filled with cocaine. And since it\u2019s YOUR name and address on the package, who do you think the police are going to visit? And what about the criminals who now know that a lonely lady lives at this address? Once one comes to visit you to drop off the package, they\u2019ve cased your home. Can you say \u201crape\u201d? Can you say \u201crobbery\u201d? Remember, these people are in prison for a reason. They\u2019re CRIMINALS. They don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s rump about you or what harm may be done to you, your life, or your reputation. If you shut them off, they\u2019ll just move along to the next victim. ",

            "answer_text": "My friend actually my neighbor did wrie some. They told her how much they loved her. Asked for money. Told her everything lady's love too her. Send no money if your going to write get a P.O. box so no address. Tell him your in a shelter or homeless. Then he not as app to ask for things. Why would you want too?? I guess it's up too you. My neighbor moved outta state before he got out. I guess she just needed something to do. Or was filling in a space were something. Happened in her life. I don't where it went from there. I didn't talk to her again. Don't believe everything they tell you.keep it on a pen pal bases. So no expectations no problems when they are released.why do you wanna write this person.?? Be smart and safe about it. They usually go back for the same thing. ",
