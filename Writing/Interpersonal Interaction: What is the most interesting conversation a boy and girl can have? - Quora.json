            "answer_text": "\"Are those beautiful eyes are the reason for the whirling sensation in my head or is it something else..  like, like medicine ?\" Uttered Jay, a 23 old guy with long disheveled hair and dark circled eyes adjusting himself on the hospital bed as soon as he regained his senses. Pain, consciously caused by the sharp cut of a blade on the vein of his left hand to make him unconscious, was evident in his voice .    \"Anaesthesia , the effect of Anaesthesia \" Simran , a beautiful 24 years old doctor smiled before saying , counting the beats of the Jay's heart through her stethoscope.    \"Anaesthesia , I see \" Jay contemplated for a moment then asked immediately looking at the Simran's eyes \" Purpose? \".    \"Anaesthesia means 'loss of sensation' which prevents pain and discomfort and enables a wide range of medical procedures to be performed.\" Simran threw words in a scientific manner scribbling something on Jay's report.    \"It means it keeps you from pain , temporary ?\" These words had the mixed emotions of pain and curiosity. .    \"You can say.\" . Simran looks into Jay's eyes.    \"Just like suicide .Suicide also keeps you from the pain and discomfort given by the life .But there is good thing .It does its job for permanent result unlike Anaesthesia .\" Agony seemed to be disappeared from the voice .Face was the place for smile .Eyes brightened .    \"Are you a writer?\" Simran tried to contain herself from being startled by the statement came from an immature boy who , a few hours ago , tried an unsuccessful attempt to give her mother a lifetime suffering .    \"A writer who does not know how to write. A philosopher who does not how to philosophise . A lover who does not know how to love.\" The time he reached to the third statement , pain resurrected , but now it was more excruciating . A Pain caused by the hate . The hate caused by love. Irony.    \"As expected. A Life who does not know how to live.\" Doctor added one more point with a face of no expression.    \"I know how to live a life. Life is as beautiful as a rising sun, a revolving earth and as a cold moon But you know what doctor, Sometimes you can\u2019t tolerate the heat of the sun, you can't appreciate an earthquake on the earth and can't  applaud the permanent stains on the moon .\" Voice escalated quickly. Now, it was not the pain, it was something comes with the pain and leaves with the pain, Anger.     \"The fragrance of the flowers fade. The heap of rocks fall. The brain inside the head stops work.. The truth flowing in  the veins, few hours ago you tried to make it come out of your body, is temporary. You do not need to attempt to stop the flow. It will happen one day .eventually and the heat, earthquake and the stains are not the valid reasons.\u201dSimran's expression has got a life now. It was anger accompanied by the compassion.  \"Are you a writer?\" Jay, completely dumbfounded listening whatever Simran said, got a question to ask.    \"A Doctor who knows how to cure.\" Simran said looking at the injection she was holding to see the quantity of the fluid inside it.    \"Now, what is that?\" He asked looking at the sharp needle.     \"Afraid?\" She asked trying to make his fun.     \"Blade was sharper.\" He said showing his courage. Smile appeared on both faces.    \"This is Analgesia. It will provide you the relief from the pain .But before you put one more metaphor, I would like to say, it is like Life , if given a chance .\" Simran elaborated while injecting the analgesic drug inside his body.    \"Thank you, Miss Analgesia.\" Jay found the relief from his pain looking at her eyes.    \"Welcome.\" Perhaps, she really welcomed him into her life.   A doctor saved a life. ",
