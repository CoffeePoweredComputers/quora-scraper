            "answer_text": "Thermodynamic equilibrium A system is said to be in Thermodynamic Equilibrium if it is in phase, thermal, mechanical and chemical equilibrium at same time. If any one of the equilibrium condition disturb then the system cannot comes under Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Let us understand these four equilibrium. THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM - The system is said to be in thermal equilibrium if it has equality of temperature with surrounding. For example a dead body is the perfect example of thermal equilibrium with surrounding. Normal human body temperature is approximately 37 degree Celsius whereas temperature of surrounding keeps on changing, let us consider surrounding temperature is 25 degree Celsius. Therefore a living human body is a not under thermal equilibrium with surrounding because metabolism of the body is continuously working or producing heat. The metabolism of a dead body shuts down therefore after sometime dead body comes under same temperature with surrounding. PHASE EQUILIBRIUM - When mass of each phase remains constant with time then the system is in phase Equilibrium. For example -Let us consider a closed container that is partially filled with liquid. Now what happened is evaporation takes place inside the container. The air above the liquid can absorb the water vapour molecules upto a certain limit and this limit is known as saturation limit. This closed container is our system and remember I am considering atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions which means pressure and temperature are not changing. When saturation limit occurs then the mass of liquid present in container will remain constant and similarly mass of vapour present in container will also remain constant. At saturation limit condition there is no more tendency of phase change, so at this point our system is in phase equilibrium. CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM - Chemical equilibrium is the state when both reactants and products are present in concentrations and have no further tendency to change with time, so that there is no observable change in properties of system. Generally it occurs when rate of forward reaction is equal to rate of backward reaction. In simple language we can say chemical reaction potential should not be present. Mechanical Equilibrium - A system is in mechanical equilibrium when net forces acting on that system will be zero. It is basically equality of forces. It can also be defined as, the the pressure acting at any point of the system does not change with time.

            "answer_text": "Thermodynamic equilibrium is an axiomatic concept of thermodynamics. It is an internal state of a single thermodynamic system, or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable walls. In thermodynamic equilibrium there are no net macroscopic flows of matter or of energy, either within a system or between systems. In a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, no macroscopic change occurs. Systems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual thermal, mechanical, chemical, and radiative equilibria. Systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium, though not in others. In thermodynamic equilibrium, all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely, until disturbed by athermodynamic operation. In a macroscopic equilibrium, almost or perfectly exactly balanced microscopic exchanges occur; this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium. A thermodynamic system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform temperature. Its intensive properties, other than temperature, may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long range force field imposed on it by its surroundings. In non-equilibrium systems, by contrast, there are net flows of matter or energy. If such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring, it is said to be in a metastable equilibrium. Though it is not a widely named law, it is an axiom of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The second law of thermodynamics states that when a body of material starts from an equilibrium state, in which portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions, and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable and it is isolated, then it spontaneously reaches its own new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the entropies of the portions.
