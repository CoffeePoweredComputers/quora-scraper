By that I mean that criticism is a personal attack, \u201cyou are stupid\u201d \u201cyou should never write/whatever again\u201d Constructive criticism aims to make your work better by telling you what\u2019s wrong with it \u201cthis would be more realistic if xyz happened because blah blah facts\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019d be better if you used the word \u2018frustrated\u2019 rather than \u2018seethed with annoyance\u2019\u201d Constructive criticism can range from harsh \u201cthis is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever read and here\u2019s why:\u201d to gentle \u201cI suggest xyz, or maybe you could x?\u201d It doesn\u2019t always feel good, but it isn\u2019t meant to hurt you, they are simply giving you feedback. To get the most out of constructive criticism, it\u2019s important not to conflate the thing you have created with yourself/self worth. The sooner you listen to what they\u2019re saying the quicker you\u2019ll get better, so long as you are careful to distinguish between a criticism of skill or a criticism based in preference(you don\u2019t have to write something a certain way just because that\u2019s the way they want it). Put another way, one passes judgement on the creator and the other passes judgment on the work. ",

            "answer_text": "In this context, I believe criticism only tears down, while constructive feedback (constructive criticism) is given with the intention of helping the other person to improve. Constructive feedback doesn\u2019t stink of judging, and will offer suggestions to improve. I once had a press release come back with one note written on it: \u201cNot good.\u201d This was the most useless feedback I\u2019ve ever received, and it was from a guy who\u2019d never actually seen a real press release before (and I have no idea why he was involved in the review cycle, lol). Now, that was real criticism. Haha. The CEO, fortunately, had constructive feedback: \u201cWe need to revise this to focus on this other product feature, as it\u2019s what differentiates our product.\u201d I hadn\u2019t been told that by the account lead, and in learning that, I was able to rewrite it in a way that met their needs. Whether the creation is fiction or a marketing piece, the difference is the same. Telling you \u201cI hate this character\u201d doesn\u2019t help you at all, and is rather judgmental. Telling you \u201cI found this character unsympathetic, and so the Inciting Incident in your story didn\u2019t draw me in\u201d is maybe not great, but it\u2019s a whole lot better because it doesn\u2019t judge, and states it in such a way that you could figure out at least what problem I had with it, and maybe do something about it. If I also suggested a plot point change that would make the character more sympathetic, as a reader, that would help even more. Hope that helps in some way, lol. ",
