            "answer_text": "It depends on how non-human your characters are going to be. Surely aliens also have motivations, needs, desires, hopes, fears, loves and hates. If that\u2019s the case then they are not much different from humans. Their biology may be different but essentially they will still behave as we do - in other words, simply humans in disguise. I think it would be much more of a challenge to write characters who do not share our basic needs and drives and I wonder if it would be worth writing or reading. ",
