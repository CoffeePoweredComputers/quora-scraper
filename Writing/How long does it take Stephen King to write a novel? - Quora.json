            "answer_text": "I was in Chicago watching a live interview with David Morrell, who wrote First Blood for you Rambo fans, and he knew Stephen King pretty well. A lot of aspiring writers asked about the author's method. He said that first, King wrote 365 days of the year including Christmas. He worked in the mornings from when first woke up to around noon, and the critical part was he finished 10 pages. King did 10 decent pages every day. After that was done in his mornings he proceeded to do all other things in his life and spend time with his family. Morrell explained that King's method was what allowed him to put out so much material as he does. ",
