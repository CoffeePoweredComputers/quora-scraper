            "answer_text": "My very favorite mystery writer is the one who springs to mind when I saw this question\u2014the late, great Ruth Rendell (she also wrote as Barbara Vine). As a reader, Rendell supplied me with some of the best mysteries I\u2019ve ever read, all impeccably plotted (with twists you don\u2019t see coming and then, once the shock has dissipated, seem perfectly logical), gorgeously, yet simply written, and peopled with characters who are flawed but all too real (so that we care about them and sympathize and/or empathize with them). She passed away a couple years ago, but left behind an amazing body of work, including her praised Inspector Wexford series. But I think it was her darker, more psychological mysteries that really showcase her brilliance\u2014Asta\u2019s Book, The Water\u2019s Lovely, A Dark-Adapted Eye, Live Flesh, The Bridesmaid\u2014I could go on and on because I never read even one of her many works that I was disappointed with. She also left a legacy of television and movie adaptations of her work, plus numerous awards, including the Silver, Gold, and Cartier Diamond Daggers from the Crime Writers Association, three Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America, The Arts Council National Book Awards, and The Sunday Times Literary Award. As a writer, she\u2019s one of my chief inspirations, for all of the reasons listed above. I can recommend no contemporary mystery writer more highly. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends which sort of mystery novel you prefer \u2014 police procedural, P.I., cozy, historical, foreign, humorous, suspense, thriller, etc. \u2026 Some personal favorites, in no particular order: Lee Child \u2014 Jack Reacher novels, 23 books to date. The series debut, Killing Floor, won both the Anthony and the Barry awards. Each is more or less stand-alone, but there is a certain amount of continuity. Jack Reacher is a 6ft 5in former military policeman turned super-drifter who roams America with only a toothbrush and the clothes he\u2019s standing up in. Bus station to bus station, diner to diner. Nothing slows him down except a plot, because Reacher is a man for whom the phrase moral compass was invented: His code determines his direction. Where dwells unrighteousness, where redress is demanded, there goes Reacher.[1] Louise Penny \u2014 Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec; 15 novels, must be read in order. Character-driven mysteries that often take place in a tiny village named Three Pines. The beautifully written series has won five Agatha Awards, five Anthony Awards, the John Creasey Dagger, Nero, and Barry Awards. Michael Connelly \u2014 Harry Bosch series (22 books), Mickey Haller series (5 books), Ren\u00e9e Ballard series (3 books), and 15 other books. \u201cBosch\u201d is also a series on Amazon Prime and several of the other novels have been made into full-length films. Harry was an L.A. police detective until his retirement and now consults with a small police department near L.A. Haller is an L.A. defense attorney and Bosch\u2019s half-brother. Ballard is a young, female police detective. Books should be read in order of publication. Writer Michael Connelly\u2019s Teenage Brush With Crime Andrea Camilleri \u2014 Inspector Salvo Montelbano of the police in a fictional city in Sicily; 26 novels. Police procedurals with a great deal of humor. Camilleri is widely considered to be one of the greatest living Italian writers. Each book is more or less stand-alone, with some continuity. Inspector Montalbano is an engaging hero \u2013 honest, decent and loyal. He has his own way of doing things, and his superiors regard him as something of a loose cannon. One of the strengths of the novels is Montalbano's ability to navigate through a murky world, a world of shady connections and favours owed and owing, without compromising himself beyond what he can live with. There is a great deal of humour in his character, such as his unconditional love for silence while enjoying a good meal, but the primary subtext is hard criticism of the social and political situation of both the Sicilian and Italian contexts.[2] Dick Francis \u2014 43 mostly stand-alone novels that center on some aspect of the horseracing world. The key Francis elements: the damaged hero, various moral dilemmas, the easygoing first-person narration, at least one scene of brutal violence, the presentation of a lot of information about some arcane subject (e.g., wine, investment banking, photography) and a more or less happy ending. Great fun. Donna Leon \u2014 Commisario Guido Brunetti of the Venice police; 27 novels to date. Should be read in order. Leon is the ideal author for people who vaguely long for \u201ca good mystery,\u201d meaning a strong story with discreet violence, a wise detective who doesn\u2019t drink or brood too much, and a setting that\u2019s worth the visit. That Leon is also a brilliant writer should only add to the consistently comforting appeal of her Venetian procedurals featuring Commissario Guido Brunetti, an immensely likable police detective who takes every murder to heart. Leon allows her warmhearted detective to take what solace he can from the beauty of his city and the homely domestic rituals that give him the strength to go on. [Marilyn Stasio, New York Times Book Review] J.D. Robb (pseudonym of Nora Roberts) \u2014 \u201c\u2026 in Death\u201d series, 50 books featuring homicide Lt. Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband, Roarke; set in a mid-21st century New York City, AD 2059\u20132061. The books are primarily police procedurals. Should be read in order. C S Harris \u2014 Sebastian St. Cyr, Viscount Devlin, early 19th century England; 14 books. Should be read in order. Colin Cotterill \u2014 Dr. Siri Paiboun, chief medical examiner, Laos in the late 1970s; 14 novels, should be read in order. Dr. Siri is the cranky hero of wonderfully fresh, funny, exotic mysteries set in the Laotian capital of Vientiane after the former French colony came under the Communist rule of the Pathet Lao. Substantial crimes with a soup\u00e7on of political intrigue. Some of the authors of the early-to-mid-20th century include: Dorothy L. Sayers (Lord Peter Wimsey series); Rex Stout (Nero Wolfe, armchair detective); John D. MacDonald (Travis McGee, Florida); Ngaio Marsh (Inspector Roderick Alleyn); and P.D. James (Adam Dalgliesh, New Scotland Yard).
