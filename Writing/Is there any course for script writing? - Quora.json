            "answer_text": " There are many courses and countless books on screenwriting. But I feel compelled to repeat my previous answer which reveals the secret advice that has probably launched most of the careers of Hollywood\u2019s greatest screenwriters. Okay, it\u2019s not a secret. But it is advice that is too often ignored. You MUST read scripts, lots and lots of scripts, preferably brilliantly written produced screenplays by Hollywood\u2019s best. That would seem obvious, yet it is not an integral part of most aspiring screenwriters weekly routine. But if you read the bios of hundreds of produced screenwriters, you\u2019ll discover how many started as industry script readers. Screenwriting, as a profession, is unlike most other professions. Certainly, if one needs a plumber, one would steer clear of any plumber who only completes 33% of his jobs successfully. Yet, in the ranks of professional baseball, any batter who can manage one hit out of three times at the plate is considered a fantastic hitter with a .333 batting average. So consider my words thoughtfully; there are far more athletes who can hit a major league fastball than there are writers who can produce a professionally-written Hollywood screenplay!!! As a screenplay consultant, I try to learn a bit about any new client. So, I have the writer complete a brief questionnaire which always includes two specific questions: 1) How long have you been writing screenplays and/or teleplays? 2) How many produced scripts (shooting scripts) have you ever read? The combined answers are often highly illuminating. It is all too common for me to receive answers such as: 1) I have been writing screenplays for 5 years. 2) I have read a total of 5 produced screenplays in that time. Do you see the problem here? This writer only reads an average of one produced screenplay per year! How can anyone, regardless of his/her level of innate writing talent, expect to become a working professional screenwriter by reading only one script annually? Do aspiring writers not realize their competition, includes produced writers, have read hundreds of scripts? After all, Hollywood is only going to make a finite number of movies each year. Most of those movies will be written by the writers who best understand what makes a screenplay great. Let\u2019s take a moment to consider other professions. Architectural students study thousands of blueprints during their education. Doctors study thousands of x-rays during medical school. Yet, over and over again, I run into aspiring screenwriters who don\u2019t feel the need to study the masterfully written screenplays from Hollywood\u2019s best working screenwriters. Of course, these same screenwriters attend every pitching event, every networking seminar, and totally believe they are doing everything possible to succeed. Yet success continues to mysteriously evade them. Well, it is no mystery. No one can skip the first essential step in becoming a professional screenwriter unless the writer\u2019s parents own a motion picture studio. Screenwriting has always required that you work very hard on your craft. But unless you work smart, as well, you are going to waste unproductive years pursuing your writing career. Therefore, if you are going to take your screenwriting career seriously, then you can surely read at least ONE produced screenplay per week. That\u2019s 50 scripts per year, giving yourself two weeks off for vacation. If you think that seems like a lot of scripts, just remember that your competition is likely reading many more scripts than that. So you must seriously ask yourself, \u201chow badly do I want to succeed in Hollywood as a writer?\u201d Your answer will determine how many scripts you read annually. ",
