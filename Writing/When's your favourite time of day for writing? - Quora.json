            "answer_text": " Quick answer: just not right in the middle of the day! That\u2019s when your brain is more in reactive mode, and is less likely to focus on creating anything new and original. What\u2019s a better solution? Pick either mornings or evenings for the best quality time to write. Here\u2019s why.  Writing in the morning Why it works: Mornings can be great for doing deep work, i.e. work that requires a lot of your concentration. Some scientists call this the brain\u2019s peak performance time, and it's roughly 2-4 hours after we wake up. So, for example, if you wake up at 6, your peak times are between 8 and 10 a.m. How you can incorporate it into your schedule: Create more space and time to your day by implementing a morning routine to help you be productive. The benefit of a morning routine is that you jumpstart your day; you complete several tasks before moving on to work, school, or other responsibilities; you are more productive with your time; you feel more successful in what you do.Block time off for your analytical brain to perform the most complex tasks that require a lot of focus: learning new material, researching, reviewing, recalling, problem-solving.Use a timer to maximize productivity. Why work longer when you can work smarter? Use a timer to divide up your morning into manageable increments so your brain can focus in a more targeted and effective way. Set the timer to 30 or 60 minute increments to maximize concentration, or try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks. Writing in the evening Why it works: Evenings, which are usually any time after 6 p.m., can be scheduled for strategic thinking. This is the time when the brain eases into a different tempo. There are fewer distractions, there\u2019s nowhere to rush to, there\u2019s no commute to work or school, and there is usually less noise than in the daytime. You might feel that it\u2019s much easier to relax and get creative. How you can incorporate it into your schedule: Make the connection with your writer self. How? By getting in tune with why you love to write to begin with, and how writing makes you feel. Reflect on the good experiences you\u2019ve had with writing. Contemplate why the writing ritual works for you and what you gain from it.Be strategic by contemplating the big picture. How? Create a long-term plan for what you want to write. Identify your goal, your deadline, and your milestones for getting there in time. Don\u2019t forget to accommodate your research and the time for editing and reviewing what you\u2019ve written.Be a better writer by reading books. Why is this important? You need to feed your brain, learn new things, reconnect with topics and writers you feel passionate about, and absorb the life experiences and inner worlds of writers. To help you build your reading habit, download the Goodreads app to locate topics that interest you, get recommendations, add books to your bookshelf, and track your reading progress.",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A Matthew Prince! =) My favorite time to write is somewhere between 13:00-16:59. The first hours of writing between 10-12 are just work, work, work. You're just churning and grinding it out, you know? Then comes lunch and you feel like it's been productive and all but it hasn't been \"inspired\". With a full belly and clear head, also having had something else to do for a while, you sit back down and start writing again. For me this is usually when the \"magic\" happens.  When exactly it happens and how long it lasts varies. Something just clicks or you suddenly get another angle to it. It all begins to really flow. While I'm in it it's just happening so I don't really appreciate it until towards the end of the process. That usually happens some time before 17:00. After that it's time to do some email, posting on social media, Q&A, etc. If I feel like there's something more I can do or I'm just inspired I can keep going until 20:00 or 21:00. Then I have to cut it off, otherwise I'll find myself having a hard time relaxing. I need a solid 2-3 hours before going to bed to wind down. Also, I try to fill the time reading, listening to music, playing video games, watching my shows or something. Have a kick-ass \u20a2eative day! =) ",
