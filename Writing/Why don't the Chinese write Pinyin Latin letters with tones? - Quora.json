            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking. If you\u2019re asking: When Chinese people write pinyin, why don\u2019t they write tones?: CJ Chen already answered this. They do!Why don\u2019t Chinese people stop writing characters and just write pinyin with tones?: There is not a one-to-one ratio of character to pinyin/tone. For example, \u201csh\u00ed\u201d (shi in second tone) means \u201crock,\u201d but it also means \u201cten,\u201d depending on the character used. In a sentence, you would probably be able to deduce which meaning the speaker was after, but if all the words were written this way, it would get confusing, and a lot of meaning held in the characters would be lost. Why fix something that isn\u2019t broken (and is, in fact, beautiful)?",

            "answer_text": "Pinyin Romanization does include tones. A tone mark is placed on the vowel of the syllable concerned to indicate the tone of the syllable. For example \u0101, the bar on top indicates the first tone; \u00e1, an ascending accent indicates the second tone; \u01ce, a carrot indicates the third tone; \u00e0, and a descending accent mark indicates the forth tone.
